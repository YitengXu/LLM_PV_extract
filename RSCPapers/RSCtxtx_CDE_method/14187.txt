Astounding development of organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in the past decade has been led by three-dimensional (3D) perovskites. Nevertheless, the concern over the stability of 3D PSCs casts a shadow on their real-world applications. By adopting various technological and scientific approaches, some progress has been made in improving the stability of 3D perovskite devices. Nonetheless, the best, definitive solution consists in improving the inherent chemical stability of the halide perovskite itself. Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites, on the other hand, display excellent stability under ambient conditions and have been recognized as an alternative to their 3D analogs. Although the first generation 2D PSCs have shown relatively lower photovoltaic performance, recent reports suggest that they are also capable of achieving high power conversion efficiency well beyond 20%. In the wake of the recent resurgence of 2D halide perovskite materials, we review their structural and optoelectronic properties, followed by an extensive analysis of recent progress in 2D PSCs.

Presently, more than 75% of the energy demand of the world is met by traditional, non-sustainable energy resources, which include coal, natural gas and oil. A recent report, issued by the United Nations (UN) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), states that if “clean” energy resources are not widely employed, the planet will reach the critical threshold of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels by 2030. Among several sustainable energy resources, solar energy is the cleanest, with zero carbon cost. However, replacing the expensive silicon (Si) wafer solar technology with a much cheaper one is vital for realizing affordable solar technologies. Halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged recently as a promising technology that may have the potential to outshine Si technologies at cheaper costs because high-quality perovskite semiconductor films can be made at much lower temperatures using simple solution processes. Unfortunately, the instability of extensively explored three-dimensional (3D) perovskites under ambient conditions is a significant roadblock in the path of commercializing perovskite-based photovoltaic technology. Emerging two-dimensional (2D) layered perovskites, produced by spatially disconnecting the 3D structure and incorporating “protective” species, offer a promising solution to this issue. In this review, we discuss recent breakthroughs and future challenges in conceiving 2D perovskite materials for solar cell applications.


In the search for cheap, solution-processable solar conversion technologies to replace Silicon (Si) wafer technology, halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become a leading contender within a decade of their development. PSCs employing a three-dimensional (3D) structure achieved a certified efficiency of 24.2%. Unfortunately, the issue associated with the long-term stability of 3D perovskites against moisture, heat, and light is still a huge hurdle for their real-world applications. The effect of moisture on PSCs has received substantial attention on account of the presence of water (from rain and humid air) under realistic operating conditions of solar cells. A small amount of Lewis base, such as water, can readily disrupt the 3D perovskite structure through hydrogen bonding. Volatile small organic molecules (such as methylammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA)) can be ejected by water due to the weak non-covalent bond between the organic and inorganic frameworks. For instance, a typical 3D perovskite methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) readily hydrolyzes in the presence of water due to deprotonation of CH3NH3+ (MA+) by H2O, and degrades into products, such as CH3NH2, HI, and PbI2. Some researchers suggested that the degradation of MAPbI3 in ambient environments may produce PbCO3 and α-PbO rather than PbI2. Formation of unstable intermediate phases like monohydrated CH3NH3PbI3·H2O or dihydrated (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O has also been observed. First-principles calculations have recently predicted that intermediate degradation products could reduce the activation energies for vacancy-mediated ion migration. Ion migration is also detrimental to the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs. Even though a comprehensive understanding of water-induced decomposition of 3D perovskites is not yet fully established, there is a resounding consensus on small organic cations being an extremely vulnerable component to the water molecules. In addition, organic cations having low enthalpies of formation can also be easily liberated at moderate temperatures. In addition, superoxide O2− formed in halide perovskites under illumination acts as a Lewis base to deprotonate MA+ to form CH3NH2. Therefore, replacement of these unstable small hygroscopic organic cations with bulkier hydrophobic organic cations is expected to help prolong the lifetime of the perovskites under ambient conditions. The introduction of certain bulkier organic cations in perovskite structure distorts the structural integrity of the perovskite framework and may lead to the formation of lower dimensional (two-dimensional (2D)) layered perovskites, but in some cases they can also form other substances, like one dimensional perovskites. We are well aware of the ongoing debate over the semantics of “layered perovskites” as well as the definition of a “perovskite-type structure”, but we label the materials that contain disconnected perovskite layers as “layered perovskites” in this review, following the widely held perception. Nevertheless, it has been asserted that bulkier, hydrophobic organic cations in 2D perovskites could strain the surface Pb–I bonds and repel the water molecules from reactive sites. Karunadasa et al. reported the first application of 2D halide perovskites as a promising, stable solar absorber layer, although the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.73% was relatively low even at that time. An efficiency of over 10% reported by Mohite and co-authors in 2016 revived interest in layered perovskite materials. This led to a number of seminal fundamental and experimental studies in 2017–2018, including but not limited to structure–property relationships, excitonic properties of charge carriers, synthetic chemistry aspects and solar cell application, etc. Recently, a mixed composite of 3D and 2D perovskite phases, known as 2D/3D perovskites, emerged as a class of excellent photovoltaic materials with long-term stability.

In this review, considering an invigorated appeal to 2D perovskites, we discuss their structural and optoelectronic properties. We also summarize the progress of 2D and 2D/3D PSCs extensively in this article. Further, we assess the design principles for efficient layered PSCs.

An ABX3 perovskite structure consists of an extended 3D network of corner-sharing BX6 octahedra, where B is generally a divalent metal cation, and X is a halide anion. The A cations fill the 12-fold coordinated cubo-octahedral space created by adjacent octahedra. The ABX3 perovskite structure formation is dictated by the Goldschmidt tolerance factor,

(1)
where
RA, RB, and RX represent the ionic radii for the A, B, and X ions, respectively and the tolerance factor must satisfy t ≈ 1. The ABX3 perovskites known as 3D perovskites have rigid structural constraints, which limit their structural tunability. But they can be cut into slices from the 3D structure to a lower dimensional layered configuration, all the way down to eventually zero-dimensional (0D) BX6 octahedral clusters. Dimensional reduction gradually removes the size constraints imposed by the tolerance factor. The layered 2D derivatives of the 3D perovskites can be conceptualized by slicing the 3D structure into well-defined 2D inorganic or perovskite layers (Fig. 1). The layered perovskites can accommodate considerably larger and more complex organic cations as compared to 3D perovskites. There are two central guiding principles to be followed in designing and synthesizing new 2D layered perovskites. Foremost, the organic molecule must contain one or two terminal functional groups that can interact with the inorganic anion via hydrogen bonds. It is important to note that the rest of the organic molecule should not interfere with the “B” and “X”. Secondly, the width of the organic molecule is regulated by a space specified by adjacent corner-sharing BX6 octahedra. If the width of the organic molecule is too large, it can cause steric hindrance to neighboring organic molecules, leading to difficulty in fitting the required number of organic cations into the perovskite framework for charge balance. The formation of layered 2D derivatives may be along different crystallographic directions, producing different families of layered perovskites, namely, 〈100〉-oriented, 〈110〉-oriented, and 〈111〉-oriented perovskites (Fig. 1). Out of the three classifications, 〈100〉-oriented perovskites are by far the most commonly found 2D layered perovskite structure. Further, the number or thickness of perovskite (or inorganic) layers in layered 2D perovskites can be synthetically controlled by tuning the stoichiometric ratio between A-site cations and larger spacer cations. The layer thickness is denoted by ‘n’ in 〈100〉-oriented layered perovskites, ‘m’ in 〈110〉-oriented layered perovskites and ‘q’ in 〈111〉-oriented layered perovskites. Following the classification of layered oxide perovskites (such as Sr2TiO4, Ca2MnO4 and SrLaAlO4), the 〈100〉-oriented 2D halide perovskites can be further categorized to Ruddlesden–Popper (RP), Dion–Jacobson (DJ), and Aurivillius (AV) perovskites. Among these three types, RP phase perovskites are the most commonly used in optoelectronic applications. In contrast, we are aware of only a few reports on the DJ phase in halide perovskites, while the AV phase can only be found in oxide perovskite families. In this section, our discussion primarily focuses on the 〈100〉-oriented RP phase halide perovskites.


RP perovskites with a general formula (RNH3)2 An−1BnX3n+1 can be imagined as intergrowth compounds formed from 3D ABX3 and 2D layered (RNH3)2BX4. RNH3 is an organic cation spacer. From a crystallographic point of view, RP perovskites can be produced by methodically removing the B-component from the inorganic framework along the 〈100〉 crystallographic axis in the ABX3 structure. In the RP phase, inorganic layers are offset by one octahedral unit, showing a (½, ½) displacement along the ab-plane (i.e., a half unit cell shift in both a and b crystallographic axes). As a result, the layers are to slide in a staggered configuration (where inorganic layers are not stacked perfectly on top of each other).

The structure of (RNH3)2BX4 compounds generally matches that of the distorted K2NiF4-type. The unit cell in the layered (RNH3)2BX4 perovskites features two inorganic layers and two organic bilayers. In contrast to the 3D structure, the lattice constant values in layered perovskites are increased due to the incorporation of larger spacer cations. For example, butylammonium (BA) spacers need an accommodating space of ∼7.12 Å between the perovskite layers and one perovskite layer has a thickness ∼6.32 Å, which is about two Pb–I bond lengths (Fig. 2). As the perovskite slab gets thicker by introducing smaller cations (e.g., MA) in the crystal structure, the unit cell expands. The low angle reflections in X-ray diffraction (XRD) reveal the number of perovskite layers in a 2D perovskite. Both the calculated and experimental XRD spectra (Fig. 3a) of BA2MA4Pb5I16 (n = 5) show five distinct reflections below 2θ ≈ 14°, indicating the number of perovskite layers in the compound. The positions of heavy atoms in layered perovskites govern the crystal symmetry, but the exact space group changes with the nature of the organic spacer and thereby indirectly affects the details of crystal symmetry. The organic spacer provides the structure with more freedom and prompts a relative rotation and tilting of the [BX6]4− octahedra with respect to small A-site cations in the cuboctahedral cages. All A-site cations in 2D layered RP perovskites are oriented in the same direction, which is implied by noncentrosymmetric configurations in the 2D perovskite crystal structure. The (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 layered perovskite compounds are one of the well-studied (100)-oriented RP phases. BA is a monovalent organic spacer molecule. All (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) perovskites crystallize in orthorhombic space groups, of which (BA)2PbI4 (n = 1) crystallizes in the primitive centrosymmetric Pbca space group, (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 (n = 2) in Cc2m, (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (n = 3) in C2cb, (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 (n = 4) in Cc2m, (BA)2(MA)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) in Acam, BA2MA5Pb6I19 (n = 6) in Cc2m and (BA)2(MA)6Pb7I22 (n = 7) in C2cb. It is important to note that compounds with n > 5 is synthetically challenging to be isolated in a phase pure form due to unfavorable enthalpies of formation (ΔHf). The higher-n members tend to transform into the n = 3 and n = ∞ members. Recently, Kanatzidis et al. reported the first and only structurally characterized high members of layered perovskites (n = 6, 7) using kinetically controlled chemical synthesis. In contrast to monovalent organic spacer cations like BA, the divalent organic cations bring the inorganic layers closer. For example, the interlayer terminal iodide–iodide distance was decreased from 9.14 Å to 4.37 Å when benzylammonium (BZA), a monovalent organic cation, was replaced with histammonium (HA), a divalent organic cation, in 2D perovskites. The variation of the interlayer distance strongly affects the lattice constants, and therefore the crystal structure of 2D perovskites. Crystallographic data of 2D layered perovskites explored in solar cell applications are listed in Table 1.

Interestingly, the RP phase was observed in CsPbBr3 nanosheets. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM) revealed the structural details of plausible coexistence of RP domains and conventional perovskite phases (such as cubic and orthorhombic).
The [001]-projected atom columns in conventional perovskite phases are pure Cs and Pb–Br columns. On the other hand, all the [001]-projected atom columns are Cs–Pb–Br in RP phases. Fig. 3b shows the crystal structures of different phases, where the [001] structural projection is also depicted. The AC-STEM image of CSPbBr3 is shown in Fig. 3d. Yu et al. observed an unusual phase region in the AC-STEM image of CsPbBr3 nanosheets along with the conventional perovskite phase (Fig. 3e). They overlaid the [001]-projection of the conventional phase on the unusual phase region to identify the unusual phase observed in the CsPbBr3 nanosheets with atomic resolution. An in-plane (½, ½) shift corresponding to the RP phase was observed between two adjacent CsPbBr3 units. Therefore, all the [001]-projected atom columns were Cs–Pb–Br columns in the unknown phase region confirming the coexistence of RP and conventional perovskite phases. It also shows that RP domains and conventional perovskite domains are well-connected, and all the domain boundaries are positioned in the 〈100〉 crystallographic directions on the atomic scale. Very recently, Li et al. synthesized all-inorganic 2D RP perovskites, Cs2PbI2Cl2 and Cs2Sn2I2Cl2, with an optoelectronic response for the first time. The RP compound Cs2PbI2Cl2, with n = 1, is formed by corner-sharing of elongated [PbI2Cl4] octahedral units. Cs2PbI2Cl2 synthesized by a solid-state method crystallizes in the tetragonal space group of I4/mmm. All-inorganic layered compounds, Cs2SnI2Cl2 and Cs2PbI2Cl2, and the hybrid layered compound, (MA)2PbI2(SCN)2, have a distinctive structure compared to the rest of the hybrid layered perovskite RP phases. In these structures, the separation between the layers occurs without the use of bulky organic spacers, as a result of the ionic-size mismatch of the two heteroatoms (I− and SCN− in the (MA)2PbI2(SCN)2 compound and I− and Cl− in the Cs2SnI2Cl2 and Cs2PbI2Cl2 compounds).

Recently Mao et al. reported the first complete homologous series of DJ hybrid layered perovskites, which adopt a general formula of A′An−1PbnI3n+1. In comparison to the RP phase which features two monovalent spacer cations, the DJ structure contains a single divalent (2+) interlayer spacer cation. Compared to RP perovskites, the DJ phases exhibit relative (1/2, 0) shift of the layers along the ab-plane or no shift (0,0) at all. In DJ oxide perovskites, the size of the spacer cations determines the shift in the unit cell; the (0,0) shift (P4/mmm space group) was observed with large cations, whereas the (½,0) shift (I4/mmm space group) was observed with smaller cations. However, it has been perceived that this particular rule does not apply to halide perovskites. The layers in DJ halide perovskites do not display any significant shift (with (0,0) displacement, where layers are stacked perfectly on top of each other). Fig. 4a shows the comparison of crystal structures between the DJ and RP phases of both oxide and halide perovskites. The DJ halide perovskites were formed by employing 3AMP (3AMP = 3-(aminomethyl)piperidinium) and 4AMP (4AMP = 4 (aminomethyl)piperidinium) cations as spacer cations in between inorganic layers. The multilayered perovskites (n > 1) were synthesized employing MA as the A-site cation. From the top-view of the DJ phase structure, the inorganic layers in (3AMP) PbI4 exhibited a small mismatch owing to an out-of-plane octahedral tilting (Fig. 4b and c). Conversely, a large in-plane tilting was observed in (4AMP) PbI4, which resulted in perfect stacking of the inorganic layers. As observed in the RP phase, the hydrogen bond between the spacer cation and the inorganic layer has a significant effect on the octahedral tilting (or Pb–I–Pb angles) in DJ phases. For example, in (3AMP) (MA)Pb2I7, the 3AMP cation forms a weak hydrogen bond (red dotted line) with the terminal I−, which has a small effect on the in-plane Pb–I–Pb angles since the terminal I− does not directly impact the in-plane distortion. In the case of the (4AMP) analog, the hydrogen bonds are formed with the bridging I− anions, which are located inside the layers, which can strengthen the in-plane distortion. (3AMP)PbI4 has one of the shortest interlayer distances of ∼4.0 Å among all the Pb-based 2D perovskites, which impacts the electronic properties of these materials. The use of propane-1,3-diammonium (PDA) as a spacer was also found to produce DJ hybrid perovskites with the shortest interlayer distance of 2 Å in 2D perovskites. The short interlayer distance in DJ hybrid perovskites is favorable for solar cell applications due to its beneficial effect on optoelectronic properties. The relationship between the interlayer distance and optoelectronic properties will be discussed in the next section.

Introducing two types of spacer cations, guanidinium (GA) and MA, simultaneously into the interlayer space produces a unique type of structure, named as alternating cations in the interlayer space (ACI). ACI perovskites exhibited the structural features of the DJ phase with the chemical formula of the RP phase. To be more specific, in the ACI phase, inorganic layers exhibit a (½, 0) shift along the ab-plane similar to the DJ phase structure, but at the same time differ in the position of the interlayer sites due to charge balance restrictions, thus leading to different centering of the unit cell (Fig. 4d and e).

Widely used spacer cations (like aromatic and aliphatic ammoniums) in synthesizing layered perovskites are electrically insulating without any active functionalities, such as light absorption. Replacing aliphatic and aromatic spacer cations with functional organic cations has attracted great interest. For example, conjugated oligomers can absorb a complementary portion of the solar spectrum to that of the inorganic layer and conductive polymers can improve charge carrier transport in the layered perovskite solar absorber. The layered perovskites with functional spacer cations are in particular relevant to optoelectronic applications. For instance, improved light absorption of layered perovskites with conjugated oligomers and dye molecules as spacer cations potentially could boost the current of derived solar cells and enhance their efficiency. Dye molecules like 5,5′′′-bis(aminoethyl)-2,2′:5′,2′:5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophene (AEQT) can strongly influence the optical properties of layered perovskites. In the case of the AEQT molecule, it has an appropriate molecular shape and two aminoethyl groups to bond to the inorganic framework. Recently, Vanderzande et al. introduced charge-transfer complexes (combination of pyrene–butylammonium, a donor molecule with the strong acceptor molecules, tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) and tetracyanobenzene (TCNB)). The incorporation of charge-transfer complexes has a significant influence on the absorption in the visible wavelength region.

Interestingly, subtle structural alterations induced by the organic spacer cation substitutions can change the properties of layered perovskites. This opens new opportunities in materials design. One of the simple structural tailoring methods of layered perovskites is selectively fluorinating the PEA spacer cation at different positions of the aromatic benzene ring. The position of the fluorine atom on the aromatic moiety (ortho, meta, para) leads to changes in the ordering of the organic spacer cations in the interlayer gallery (two organic cations in the spacing for RP phase) relative to one another with varying degrees of structural disorder. For instance, para-FPEA2PbI4 and para-FPEA2SnI4 (with fluorine atom located at para-position) have cations within the interlayer gallery facing the same direction in a co-aligned fashion, whereas ortho-FPEA2PbI4 has the maximum orientation disorder among other positions. Custom-synthesized, more complicated organic cations are also used to tune structural ordering of the cation within the interlayer space to alter the properties of layered perovskites. For example, a series of layered perovskites, (aromatic-O-linker-NH3)2PbI4 (where the aromatic moiety is naphthalene, pyrene, or perylene and the linker is ethyl, propyl, or butyl), showed better energy level matching between the inorganic and organic layers, resulting from ordering of organic cations.

Typically, thin films of halide perovskites are used for optoelectronic applications and good quality 3D perovskite thin films can be easily fabricated through spin coating perovskite precursor solutions onto substrates. Nonetheless, synthesis of phase-pure layered perovskites by this approach is not viable and such obtained layered perovskite thin films may contain multiple lower dimensional perovskite phases. The best approach to produce phase-pure layered perovskites is by synthesizing single crystals through a wet chemistry route. Even though numerous synthesis protocols exist for the n = 1 member of a homologous series (a single inorganic [BX6] layer), few report the synthesis of higher-n members. Phase-pure compounds of layered perovskites up to n = 7 have been successfully synthesized by using BA, as the limiting reagent. In this synthetic protocol, the use of BA is essential in achieving the layered perovskites in the pure form, avoiding precipitation of unwanted n = “∞” (3D perovskite phase). Other synthetic protocols like slow evaporation of solvent, precipitation of compounds using antisolvent, etc. are only successful in producing low-n members of layered perovskites (up to n = 3).

A recent study on enthalpies of formation (ΔHf) of the RP phase suggested that high-n members (n > 7) of layered perovskites are thermodynamically unstable and challenging to synthesize. The ΔHf values are negative for low-n-member compounds (n = 1–5) but positive for the compounds with a higher n (n = 6 and 7). For a favourable reaction, the ΔHf must be negative to achieve a negative Gibbs free energy (ΔG). The attempt to grow high-n-member (n > 7) compounds can lead to the formation of a mixture of 3D perovskites with a lower-n compound or randomly or coherently intergrown 2D perovskites. These materials consistently show a blue shift of the band gap compared to their 3D analogs and can be termed as “quasi-2D perovskites”. In the wake of growing number of publications on lower dimensional perovskites, researchers are advised to term the synthesized compounds as “2D perovskites” or “quasi-2D perovskites” only based on the rigorous analysis of optical and structural characterizations. As we mentioned in the beginning of this section, most of the optoelectronic applications of layered perovskites have been reported using thin films. The fundamental properties of the films are significantly different from those of the grown single crystals. Primarily, thin films do not produce a phase-pure n-member of layered perovskites but a mixture of different n-members of lower dimensional perovskites. Evidently, almost all the reports on 2D perovskite based solar cells have effectively employed quasi-2D perovskites in their devices. In another class of materials, called 2D/3D perovskites, 2D perovskites are incorporated on the top surface of the 3D perovskite film or inside the bulk 3D perovskites. 2D/3D perovskites predominantly show bulk 3D perovskite characteristics (optoelectronic and structural properties), even though they have some additional benefits, such as improved stability and fewer defects.
In summary, the structural characteristics of 2D perovskites can be vastly tuned by means of changing the interlayer spacing, number of perovskite layers, octahedral tilting, etc., through employing different organic/inorganic spacers. The recent advancement in the unexplored, 2D perovskite structures has shown that there are abundant opportunities for discovery of new materials. Also, structural properties of 2D perovskites strongly affect their optoelectronic properties. So even a slight change in structure may lead to significant modification of the optoelectronic features of 2D perovskites. In the next section, we discuss current fundamental understanding of the optoelectronic properties of the 2D layered halide perovskites.

Halide perovskites are fundamentally different from other direct band gap inorganic semiconductors explored in solar cell applications, such as GaAs and CdTe, etc. (known as p–s semiconductors), due to the presence of lone-pair Pb s electrons. In 3D Pb perovskites, the conduction band minimum (CBM) comes from Pb p orbitals, and the valence band maximum (VBM) derives from a mixture of Pb s and I p orbitals (called as a s–p semiconductor). The hole effective mass is balanced with electron effective mass due to strong s–p antibonding coupling in the VBM, which leads to ambipolar conductivity in halide perovskites that leads to high charge carrier mobilities. Also, the superior optical absorption observed in halide perovskites is closely associated with their electronic structure. In addition to direct band gap absorption, the intense optical absorption also partially originates from the halide-p to metal-p transition at the band edge.

Because the electronic band structure of the 2D perovskites is very different from that of 3D perovskites, it can be expected that they exhibit significantly different optoelectronic properties. In this section, we describe and discuss the band structure, confinement effects of 2D perovskites and their effects on optical properties and charge carrier dynamics.

A detailed understanding of materials’ band structure provides insights into their optical and electronic properties from a fundamental viewpoint. First principles calculations, such as density functional theory (DFT), can predict consistent structures and stabilities of perovskites.

The calculations showed that organic molecules are not directly involved in determining the electronic structure of organic–inorganic halide perovskites. For instance, density of states (DOS) of MAPbI3 suggests that the contribution from the states of MA cations is insignificant around band edges (Fig. 5a). The organic molecule in halide perovskites primarily functions as a counterion for stabilizing the perovskite structure and charge balance. However, the size and nature of organic cations influence the B–X–B bond angle and equatorial B–X bond length, which strongly affects the optical properties of these materials. For instance, the differences in hydrogen bonding between organic spacer cations and halide ions have an impact on the B–X–B angles, thereby their optoelectronic properties. For 2D perovskite compounds having similar crystal structures while different spacer cations, the B–X–B bond angle is the dominant factor that influences the band gap. Undistorted octahedral networks have a B–X–B bond angle of 180°. In the case of Pb-based perovskites, larger Pb–I–Pb bond angles (close to 180°) mean greater overlap of Pb s and I p orbitals, which instigates larger bandwidths and consequently lowers the band gap. The B–X–B bond angles can be classified into two categories, equatorial along the inorganic plane and axial along the stacking axis. Equatorial B–X–B bonds are more relevant to the band gap because the charges transport across the inorganic layer (Fig. 5b). Axial Pb–I–Pb bonds mainly impact the excitonic behavior. Therefore, 2D perovskites prepared with different types of organic spacer cations can have the same band gap if they have similar crystal structures and equatorial Pb–I–Pb bond angles. For example, (NH3C8H16NH3) (MA)2Pb3I10 (where NH3C8H16NH3 is diammonium ion) and (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 with the same structure of the RP phase and similar equatorial Pb–I–Pb bond angles of 168.7° and 169.4°, respectively, have the same band gap at ∼2 eV. For 2D layered perovskites with different structures, the interlayer spacing between inorganic layers is the determining factor for the band gap rather than the Pb–I–Pb bond angle. (3AMP) (MA)2Pb3I10 (with an equatorial Pb–I–Pb angle of 163.5°) and (4AMP) (MA)Pb3I10 (with an equatorial Pb–I–Pb angle of 157.4°) are more distorted than (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (with an equatorial Pb–I–Pb angle of 169.4°) and still have similar band gaps (1.90–1.97 eV vs. 2 eV) due to the shorter interlayer spacing in (3AMP) (MA)2Pb3I10 and (4AMP) (MA)Pb3I10.Fig. 5c shows the variation of absorption and emission, i.e., the optical band gap, with the change of layer thickness. The 2D perovskites show a change in optical properties when they are subjected to external pressure. An unprecedented 8.2% decrease in band gap was observed in (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 after compression to 26 GPa and then decompression back to ambient pressure (Fig. 5d). The (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 series exhibits a characteristic structural change upon compression, specifically reflecting the narrowing in the Pb–I–Pb angle and shortening in the Pb–I bond length (Fig. 5e), leading to the increased electronic wave function overlap between Pb and I, and thereby accounting for the narrowed optical band gap.
The calculated electronic band structures exhibit a quasi-direct band gap at the Γ point for 2D perovskites (Fig. 5a). The electronic structure shows no dispersion along the Γ–Z direction as a direct consequence of a dielectric mismatch between inorganic (PbI4 anionic component in the case of Pb-perovskite) and organic layers. The absence of dispersion along the Γ–Z direction results in nearly infinite effective masses in the direction perpendicular to the perovskite layers, demonstrating reduced charge carrier mobility across the perovskite layers. On the other hand, 2D perovskites exhibit light electron and hole effective masses parallel to the perovskite layers. For example, (BA)2SnI4 displays electron and hole effective masses of 0.15m0 and 0.13m0 respectively parallel to the 2D perovskite sheets, comparable to the effective masses of 3D MASnI3 (0.28m0 and 0.13m0). Also, the 2D perovskites exhibit larger band gaps compared to their 3D analogs because of the reduced dimensionality. Fig. 5c displays an increase in optical absorption edge with decreasing n value, from 1.50 eV (n = ∞) to 2.43 eV (n = 1) in the (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 series. DFT calculations agree with the general trend of decreasing band gap with increasing number of perovskite layers, although DFT calculations consistently underestimate the band gap of materials. For accurate determination of band gaps, spin–orbit interactions or spin–orbit coupling (SOC) should be included in the calculations. A strong SOC is indeed generally observed in halide perovskites that can contribute formidably to the character of band gaps. A Rashba band splitting, arising from the SOC effect, has been recently explored as a possible origin for the reduced electron–hole recombination observed in MAPbI3. In particular, a large Rashba splitting was observed in 2D perovskites where the spin degenerate parabolic band splits into two branches with opposite spin-aligned electronic states.Fig. 6a shows a schematic of the Rashba splitting of the conduction band (CB) to two parabolic CB branches with opposite spins from a doubly spin-degenerate parabolic band having a single minimum at k = 0. DFT calculations yield an estimated Rashba parameter of (1.6 ± 0.1) eV Å for the Rashba splitting in the plane perpendicular to the organic spacer barrier of (PEA)2PbI4. The experimental measurements by means of electroabsorption spectroscopy and photoinduced absorption spectroscopy confirmed the Rashba splitting in this compound, with a splitting energy of (40 ± 5) meV. Yin et al. observed perovskite layer thickness-dependence of the Rashba splitting in 2D perovskites. Theoretical calculations predicted a larger Rashba splitting for n = 2 among n = 1, 2, 3 systems, which was supported by the longer PL (Fig. 6b) and ground-state bleaching recovery lifetimes for the n = 2 system (Fig. 6c–e).
The band gap is also dependent on the size and electronegativity of metal and halide ions; as their size decreases, the band gap increases. For example, Sn-based 2D perovskites show a smaller band gap compared to Pb-based systems at the same perovskite layer thickness. (HA)SnI4 and (BZA)2SnI4 have much smaller band gaps compared to their Pb analogs (Fig. 6f–h). Sn–Pb alloyed 2D perovskites show an anomalous band gap behavior, where Sn–Pb perovskites display much narrower band gaps compared to both pure Pb and Sn systems (Fig. 6h). It is linked to the SOC effects arising from alloying of heavier Pb atoms and lighter Sn atoms and accordingly structural distortion.

Quantum and dielectric confinement effects in 2D layered perovskites increase the band gap and the exciton binding energy compared to their 3D counterparts. The 2D perovskites, viewed as type-I quantum-well (QW), are composed of organic barriers separating inorganic wells. Such a scenario arises from a wider band gap of organic spacer molecules with respect to that of inorganic perovskite layers. As the thickness of the perovskite layer decreases, pronounced quantum confinement in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the inorganic layer leads to broadening of the band gap. The quantum confinement also increases the exciton binding energy. The exciton binding energy is given by

where
Eb is the binding energy of the 1s exciton, α is the dimensionality of the system, Eb,3D is the exciton energy of the bulk system, ε1 is the dielectric constant of the inorganic layer, m0 is the free electron mass, and RH is the Rydberg constant.mex is the reduced exciton mass and can be calculated from:

(4)
where
me and mh are the mass of electron and hole, respectively. The value of α increases from 2 (for a perfect 2D system) to 3 (for the bulk, nonconfined system), as the thickness of the quantum well increases. Moreover, the organic barrier has a much smaller dielectric constant than the inorganic perovskite layer. Dielectric confinement occurs when the inorganic layer with a high dielectric constant ε1 is surrounded by organic molecules with a lower dielectric constant ε2. In this scenario, the electric field generated by charges in the high dielectric constant material increases due to a less effective screening of the field by the low dielectric constant material. A stronger dielectric confinement steers to larger excitonic binding energies (100–500 meV) in 2D perovskites. Analysis of dielectric constants in 2D perovskites by classical models relies on a crude continuum modeling of the dielectric heterostructures with abrupt interfaces. Atomic description of dielectric profiles for 2D perovskites built upon periodic supercells can provide a more accurate account of the dielectric confinement without any empirical input. Pedesseau et al. treated a 2D perovskite as a composite to analyze its dielectric profiles.Fig. 7a and b shows the atomic level description of the dielectric profiles of a composite 2D perovskite. With this approach, authors were able to accurately model the quantum and dielectric confinements and calculate CB and VB alignments in the 2D heterostructure.Fig. 7c shows the high frequency dielectric profile of 2D perovskites. A clear dielectric contrast between the organic part (with a low dielectric constant, ca. 2.2) and the inorganic part (with a higher dielectric constant, ca. 5) is present in 2D perovskites. It may be noted that the dielectric constant of the inorganic part (ε∞ = 4–5) in 2D perovskites is lower than the bulk value of 3D analogs (ε∞ = 5.6), but greater than that of the single layer (ε∞ = 4). It is worth mentioning that 2D perovskites differ from other 2D materials, where electron and hole wave functions are confined in a 2D plane. In the case of 2D perovskites, exciton wave function is not confined to the 2D plane since the exciton size is comparable to the thickness of the perovskite layer. Generally, two types of excitons are observed in semiconductors, namely Wannier and Frenkel excitons. The Wannier excitons are stretched over the host by numerous lattice constants with small binding energies of <100 meV, whereas the Frenkel excitons have large binding energies of ∼500 meV, which are tightly bound to a single unit cell. Most of the reports suggest the presence of the Wannier-type exciton in 2D perovskites, although no consensus on the nature of excitons in 2D perovskites has been reached. A direct measurement yielded a large excitonic energy of about 470 meV for BA2PbI4. It was derived from optical transitions corresponding to the exciton Rydberg series and the continuum. The binding energy of excitons in perovskite wells steadily decreases as the number of perovskite layers is increased due to reduced quantum and dielectric confinements. An exciton energy of 125 meV was reported for the 2D perovskites with n = 5 ((BA)2(MA)4Pb5I16).

Magneto-absorption spectroscopy measurements confirmed a similar trend for reduced exciton masses, decreasing from 0.221m0 to 0.186m0 with increasing perovskite layer thickness from n = 1 to n = 5. Blancon et al. proposed a scaling law to calculate the exciton binding energy of excitons in 2D perovskites based on the Keldysh theory, which was well corroborated by optical density (OD) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra.Fig. 7d shows OD and PLE spectra of (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 (n = 4). The spectral features in these measurements can be assigned to the Rydberg series of Wannier–Mott excitons. The experimental spectra provide energies corresponding to 1s, 2s and 3s exciton states (Fig. 7e). The difference |E1s − EG|, provides the binding energy of the 1s exciton ground state. The continuum energy EG was calculated from fitting 2s, 3s Rydberg series with the 2D hydrogen model. Fig. 7f displays the exciton ground state (1s), first excited state (2s), and continuum (EG) energies for 2D perovskites with different layer thicknesses. Fig. 7g compares experimentally obtained binding energies with theoretical values. Both optical and magneto-absorption spectroscopy measurements suggested strongly bound excitons with energies >120 meV in the RP phase 2D perovskite with n = 5. The proposed scaling law for excitons predicts free carrier like behavior for layered 2D perovskites with n ≥ 20. In contrast, the photoconductivity study and the Saha equation yielded significantly lower exciton energies, as low as 80 meV for n = 4 ((BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13) (Fig. 8a).
The excitonic properties are tunable, varying with the physical and chemical properties of the organic and inorganic cations. For instance, by employing an aromatic organic cation of PEA (dielectric constant: 2.9) instead of the aliphatic cation of decylammonium, C10H21NH3 (dielectric constant: 2.1) in 2D perovskites the exciton binding energy was significantly decreased from 320 meV for (C10H21NH3)2PbI4 to 220 meV for (PEA)2PbI4. The exciton energy can be further tuned by mixing organic cations that differ in their dielectric constants in 2D perovskites. For example, by stoichiometrically mixing organic cations A = 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorophenethylammonium (5FPEA) and B = 2-naphthyleneethylammonium (NEA) cations in (AxB1−x)2SnI4 2D perovskites, the exciton energy was tuned from 572 nm (pure 5FPEA) to 602 nm (pure NEA). An unusual, efficient generation of triplet excitons was observed in (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 2D perovskites, where MA is an organic spacer cation. These triplet excitons showed extremely long diffusion length of 152 nm. Alternatively, mixing halides can also modify the excitonic properties of 2D perovskites since the exciton binding energy is inversely proportional to the square of the dielectric constant. In 3D perovskites, MAPbI3 showed a lower exciton energy than MAPbBr3 due to the higher dielectric constant exhibited by MAPbI3. Even though quantitative studies on halide-dependent changes of the excitonic energy in 2D perovskites are not available, a similar trend to that in 3D perovskites is expected. Also, when iodide is replaced by bromide and then by chloride, carrier effective masses tend to increase in perovskites.
Polaron formation has also been observed in 2D perovskites. The charge carriers in 2D perovskites were mainly scattered via deformation potential by acoustic and homopolar optical phonons, which is indicative of polaron formation in the material. Formation of polarons limits the carrier mobilities, modulates the cooling process of hot charge carriers and broadens the width of radiative transitions. Larger carrier effective masses due to the dielectric confinement in 2D perovskites strengthen the electron–phonon coupling and enable the polaron formation even at room temperature. The splitting of excitonic absorption spectra (Fig. 8b) of PEA2PbI4 into three transitions (α at 2.438 eV, β at 2.398 eV, and γ at 2.355 eV) with a spacing of ∼40 meV is an indication of the electron–phonon coupling. Due to the strong electron–phonon coupling, free excitons are transformed into self-trapped excitons. Self-trapped excitons are qualitatively similar to small polarons. The calculation showed a large binding energy (Epolaron ≈ 0.4–1.2 eV) for polarons, which are tightly localized at specific Pb–X positions (in (EDBE)PbCl4). In contrast, a broadband emission (white-light emission) was found to deviate from the self-trapped excitons mostly in the organic lattice of (PEA)2PbCl4. Interestingly, (PEA)2PbBr4 and (PEA)2PbI4 (bromide and iodide analogs of (PEA)2PbCl4) exhibit a narrower excitonic emission. All these observations together suggest that organic layers are more than just an inert spacer. (PEA)2PbCl4 showed a remarkably high color rendering index and photostability, rendering it a high-quality material for white LED applications. Fig. 8c and d show strong excitonic absorption and intrinsic broad emission from (PEA)2PbCl4.

An increase in the charge mobility and a decrease in the effective masses of holes and electrons were observed as the thickness of the 3D perovskite layer was increased, as a result of easier disassociation of excitons into free charges. On the other hand, charge carrier mobility in 2D perovskite films is inherently related to the exciton binding energy and defects in the material. The recombination in 2D perovskites falls into the Langevin-type regime due to the excitonic nature of charge carriers, limiting the overall thickness of the absorber layer in 2D perovskite-based solar cells. Interestingly, the 2D perovskites with n > 2 exhibit a unique, intrinsic dissociation of the photogenerated excitons to free carrier-like states through layer edge states. For the n = 3 2D perovskites, energy corresponding to the layer edge state was observed at 1.68 eV, lower than the exciton emission energy at 2.01 eV (Fig. 9a). The charge carriers are thus trapped in the edge states and remain protected from nonradiative processes like electron–phonon coupling. Moreover, long-lived free carriers provided by lower energy edge states (LES) can contribute to photocurrent in a solar cell (Fig. 9b and c). This distinct behavior has been observed in both thin-films and their exfoliated crystal counterparts. Also, the presence of the edge states extends the perovskite absorption to the visible and even to near infrared regions (Fig. 9b). Kepenekian et al. suggested that LES might originate from the surface states in 2D perovskites as a result of lattice mismatch. In this model, authors treated 2D perovskites as a composite system/heterostructure with a coherent interface.Fig. 9d shows layered perovskites as a heterostructure with alternating stacking of 3D perovskite layers L1 (of thickness n − 1) and of 2D perovskite monolayers L2 (single octahedron, n = 1). Classic theory of elasticity predicts that for a heterostructure L1/L2 with a large lattice mismatch between L1 and L2, the structure may undergo a reorganization for a critical layer thickness (Fig. 9e). Consequently, the internal elastic energy may accumulate inside the material. The surface octahedra in n = 1, 2 have no rotational degrees of freedom, while those for n > 2 exhibit significantly larger in-plane and out-of-plane tilting (Fig. 10a). Thus, the mechanical energy is more efficiently relaxed in n > 2 compounds due to additional rotational degrees of freedom through surface relaxation (i.e., through in-plane and out-of-plane tilting of surface octahedra).

As a consequence, the band gap blueshifts by 70 and 150 meV for n = 1 and 2, respectively, and redshifts by 120 and 70 meV for n = 3 and 4, respectively (Fig. 10b) compared to the calculated band gaps of these materials without taking surface relaxation into account. The small octahedral tilting leads to lattice expansion at the (101) surface, which results in the blue shift of the band gap, whereas a significant octahedral distortion in the subsurface yields lattice compression that induces a band gap redshift. Importantly, the LES originating from surface relaxation can strongly localize the electron at the surface and enable the dissociation of the strongly bound excitons to long-lived free carriers. A schematic of the LES mechanism is shown in Fig. 10c. For a broader picture, lattice mismatch in the layered perovskites employing a wide variety of spacer cations is shown Fig. 11a. Clearly, spacer cations can largely impact lattice mismatch and influence the internal elastic energy density accumulated in the bulk of layered perovskites (Fig. 11b). For instance, (4Cl–C6H4NH3)2PbI4 (4Cl–PhA) displays a larger lattice mismatch, therefore a greater elastic density than other materials in Fig. 11b. This would favor surface relaxation and sequentially the formation of LES in (4Cl–C6H4NH3)2PbI4. On the other hand, layered perovskites employing a C9H19NH3 (NoA) cation have an appreciably smaller lattice mismatch, resulting in a lower elastic energy density that effectively prevents the formation of LES. In summary, LES stems from the release of the strain-induced elastic energy at the heterostructured L1/L2 interface and fine-tuning the layered perovskite structure and composition can promote efficient exciton disassociation in 2D perovskites.
An understanding of defects and scattering processes in 2D perovskites is vital to realize their optoelectronic applications. Transient photoconductivity experiments using a terahertz (THz) probe have asserted that photoconductivity is significantly higher along the inorganic or perovskite layers than across the layers in a 2D perovskite film. Temperature-dependence of carrier mobility (Fig. 11c) reveals the occurrence of electron–phonon scattering in 2D systems. It also discloses the increase of the mobility and lifetime of charge carriers with the thickness of the perovskite layer. The charge transport properties in 2D perovskites are also related to the orientation of the inorganic layers within the perovskite film. The perovskite layers are called preferentially oriented if they are aligned perpendicular to the surface of the substrate, enabling smooth charge transport. First principles studies have shown that defects in 2D perovskites are different from those in 3D perovskites. The point defects with surplus cations/deficient anions can easily n-dope the 3D perovskite. In comparison, the formation energy for point defects in 2D perovskites is higher. The grain boundaries in halide perovskite films are very vulnerable in the form of edge and line defects due to misorientation of crystal grains. The defects such as anion and cation vacancies at grain boundaries create pathways for ion migration in halide perovskites. Huang and co-authors showed that the long-chain organic spacer cations could form a barrier suppressing ion migration along the out-of-plane and in-plane directions in single crystal layered perovskites compared to their 3D counterparts. The ion migration is detrimental to the perovskite-based electronic devices by means of monomolecular recombination, photocurrent hysteresis and accelerated degradation, etc. The authors calculated the ion activation energy from fitting temperature-dependent electrical conductivity (Fig. 11d–f) using the Nernst–Einstein relation (from the slope of ln(σT) − 1/kT, where σ is the electric conductivity, k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin). The 2D perovskite exhibited only electronic conductivity in both low and high-temperature regions without any transition from electronic conduction to ionic (Fig. 11f), which implies that ion migration is negligible in layered perovskites. Nonetheless, 3D MAPbI3 showed ionic conductivity in the high-temperature region (T > 280 K) (Fig. 11e). DFT calculations also estimated considerably higher formation energies of vacancy defects in 2D perovskites compared to their 3D analogs.

In this section, we review the most recent and relevant reports on 2D/quasi-2D and 2D/3D PSCs. For 2D/quasi-2D RP perovskites, mainly those employing PEA and BA organic spacer cations are used in solar cell application. The diversification of spacer cations in RP phases for optoelectronic applications and employing a hybrid DJ phase in solar cells have been a main research focus in recent years. So, we divide this section into four subsections, with the first three subsections focusing on different organic spacer molecules in the RP phase while the last subsection primarily discussing the emergence of hybrid DJ phase-based PSCs.


In the first report on 2D PSCs, (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 was employed as a solar absorber in an n-i-p planar device configuration. These first generation devices displayed a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.18 V with a PCE of 4.73%. The (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 films also exhibited remarkable stability under humid air. Recently, we showed that optimization of film thickness and thin-film deposition can lead to a better PCE in (PEA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 devices with significantly lower current density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis. Depositing the 2D perovskite film at elevated temperature (known as hot-cast method) is a good practice to obtain a highly crystalline, oriented 2D perovskite film.

One of the major concerns with the Pb-based PSCs is the toxicity of the water-soluble Pb component in the material. So far, Tin (Sn) has been the best replacement for Pb although the performance falls far short for Sn-based solar cells. Moreover, the stability of Sn-based solar cells represents another concern for their practical use. The promise may lie in 2D engineering. Sn-based quasi-2D perovskite (PEA)2(FA)8Sn9I28 (n = 9) devices were found to exhibit significantly improved stability compared to 3D FASnI3 devices. Importantly, (PEA)2(FA)8Sn9I28 also showed an impressive PCE of 5.94% with a fill factor (FF) of 0.69 and Voc of 0.59 V. Notably, Sn-based quasi-2D perovskites showed a significant improvement in Voc compared to 3D FASnI3, which routinely exhibited a lower Voc of less than 0.50 V. The improvement in Voc in the quasi-2D perovskites was ascribed to lower defect density as a result of lower chance of Sn2+ oxidation. The Sn2+ in 3D perovskites can easily be oxidized to Sn4+ even if Sn-thin films are prepared under an inert atmosphere, which greatly hampers the performance of Sn-perovskite devices. A comparison of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (Fig. 12a) revealed that the PEA molecule could retard the oxidation of Sn2+. It also helped to improve the moisture stability of Sn-PSCs (Fig. 12b). Additionally, crystal grains of quasi-2D perovskites were found to be highly oriented on the substrate, as revealed by sharp and discrete Bragg spots in Grazing-Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS), whereas perovskite grains were randomly oriented in 3D perovskite films (Fig. 12c and d). Highly oriented crystal grains in the perovskite film play a critical role in yielding well-balanced carrier charge transport in solar cell devices. A detailed discussion on the crystal orientation and GIWAXS characterization can be found in Section 5 of this review. Recently, Fu et al. reported a PCE of 14.1% for n ≤ 5 quasi-2D perovskites processed with ammonium salts as additives. In that work, they used NH4SCN and NH4Cl as additives in the perovskite precursor solution with molar ratios of PEAI/MAI/PbI2/NH4SCN/NH4Cl at 2:4:5:1:1. It has been observed that the NH4SCN additive can regulate the orientation of crystal grains in the perovskite layer as well as enhance its crystallinity (Fig. 13a–c), while NH4Cl can passivate the electron traps at the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface. The effects of ammonium salts were unmistakably observed in solar cell performance.
The devices with NH4SCN as an additive showed a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) as a result of highly oriented crystal grains and enhanced crystallinity. The better passivation of electron traps by Cl− with the use of NH4Cl additive improved the Voc of the device. The simultaneous incorporation of NH4SCN and NH4Cl as binary additives into 2D perovskite films led to both high Voc (1.21 V) and Jsc (15.2 mA cm−2) with an average efficiency of 12.9% (Fig. 13d). Incredibly, these (PEA)2(MA)4Pb5I16 devices with ammonium salt additives displayed a record low nonradiative Voc loss of only 0.14–0.16 V in 2D PSCs. As we have discussed in the structural properties section, fluorine substitution on an aromatic spacer molecule like PEA can induce structural ordering of spacer molecules in layered perovskites. Zhang et al. demonstrated that by fluorine substitution on the para position in PEA, the average phenyl ring centroid distances in the organic layer become shorter with better aligned packing of perovskite sheets. The (F-PEA)2MA4Pb5I16 solar cells demonstrated an improved PCE of 13.64% compared to (PEA)2MA4Pb5I16 (9.66%) due to increased carrier lifetime and reduced trap density in the solar absorber layer. The out-of-plane (or interlayer) microwave mobility of (F-PEA)2PbI4 (n = 1) was found to be ∼7 times higher than that of its PEA analog. The increase in microwave mobility was probably due to the better energetic alignment of the organic cations with the perovskite band structure rather than the difference in perovskite interlayer distance since the F-PEA film happens to be slightly longer than the PEA film (smaller interlayer distance is supposed to be better for out-of-plane charge transport). On the other hand, the real-world devices employing (F-PEA)2MA4Pb5I16 (n = 5) or (F-PEA)2MA3Pb4I13 (n = 4), where films contain mixed dimensional phases (n = 2, 3, 4, 5 and ∞), can benefit from ordered phase distribution depending on the position of fluorine on PEA.

In their seminal paper, Tsai et al. reported the achievement of a high efficiency of 12.52% by employing hot-cast (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 films in the p-i-n device configuration (Fig. 14a). In the hot-cast process, a PEDOT:PSS coated substrate is pre-heated at 150 for 10 min and immediately a perovskite precursor solution is spin coated. GIWAXS of hot cast films (shown in Fig. 14b and c) exhibited sharp, discrete Bragg spots indicative of highly oriented crystal grains in contrast to randomly oriented crystal grains in room-temperature-cast 2D perovskite films. The nearly perfect oriented perovskite layers or [(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1]2− in hot cast films enabled charge transport across the device electrodes without any hindrance by the organic spacer layers, which resulted in a high Jsc of 16.76 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.74. In a separate study, the use of iso-BA as a spacer cation alone was found to produce highly oriented and crystalline 2D perovskites. But the devices employing (iso-BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 showed a large J–V hysteresis in the FTO/C60/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au configuration. Interestingly, the devices employing a hot-cast (BA)2(MA)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) film have shown a relatively lower PCE of 8.71% compared to its lower member, n = 4 because of the lower crystallinity of the film. It was previously proved that in the 3D perovskite DMSO (Lewis base) has a high affinity for PbI2 (or metal halides in general), and forms an intermediate phase reducing the crystallization rate. Soe et al. controlled the degree of crystallinity and crystal grain orientation by tuning the DMSO concentration in the DMF solution, producing highly oriented (BA)2(MA)4Pb5I16 thin films. XRD analysis of (BA)2(MA)4Pb5I16 films fabricated from a precursor solution with 3:1 DMF:DMSO concentration exhibited better crystallinity (Fig. 15a). On that account, the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the (111) XRD reflection peak was found to be the lowest for the film grown from 3:1 DMF:DMSO precursor concentration, indicating the optimum DMSO concentration for obtaining high crystallinity (Fig. 15b). Most of the perovskite layers were perpendicular to the substrate in the film fabricated from a precursor containing optimum DMSO concentration, as evidenced by the Bragg spots in the GIWAXS map (Fig. 15c and d). The devices employing hot-cast films fabricated using a 3:1 DMF:DMSO precursor solution displayed a PCE of 10% (Fig. 15e). External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) measurements (Fig. 15f) revealed an enhanced photoresponse for the devices with films fabricated using a 3:1 DMF:DMSO precursor solution. The photocurrent enhancement correlates well with enhanced crystallinity and preferentially oriented microstructures in the perovskite film. Introduction of inorganic cations such as Cs and Rb into the halide perovskites is also beneficial for improving the stability. It was found that the introduction of 5% Cs+ into the (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 film improved the stability. The Cs-doped (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 devices also exhibited a superior PCE of 13.7% compared to reference solar cells. Moreover, Cs-doped 2D perovskite devices retained 89% of the initial performance after 1400 h of storage in a 30% RH environment vs. 79% for the devices made of pristine 2D perovskites. The addition of NH4SCN was found to be beneficial in the (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 3, 4) 2D perovskite system likewise in PEA-based 2D systems.

Yan et al. synthesized a low band gap 2D perovskite system by using FA as the A-site cation. In 3D perovskite systems, FA-based perovskites exhibit relatively lower band gaps compared to MA-based perovskites. A FA-based 2D perovskite, (BA)2(FA)2Pb3I10 film, exhibited a suitable band gap of 1.51 eV for single junction solar cell application, while (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 displayed a larger band gap of 1.87 eV. Nevertheless, the (BA)2(FA)2Pb3I10 devices showed a low PCE of 1.19% mainly because of the random orientation of perovskite grains. Later, it was found that addition of 0.5 molar thiourea in the precursor was able to help with preferential orientation of grains in the (BA)2(FA)2Pb3I10 perovskite film. Basically thiourea, a Lewis-base, can coordinate with PbI2 to produce large perovskite crystal grains with better orientation. Consequently, the devices showed an enhanced average PCE of 5.27%. The unencapsulated devices stored in air with 25% RH maintained 80% of their initial performance after 25 days. Further, the orientation can be controlled by mixing FA with MA in the 2D perovskite composition. The perovskite crystals were aligned perfectly to the substrate when 20% of MA cations were replaced with FA cations. The (BA)2(MA0.8FA0.2)3Pb4I13 devices displayed a superior PCE of 12.81% vs. 10.7% for (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13.
The 2D Sn-perovskites, such as (BA)2(MA)2Sn3I10 and (BA)2(MA)3Sn4I13, have nearly ideal band gaps of 1.50 and 1.42 eV, respectively for single junction solar cells. However, the derived devices displayed very low PCE due to the instability of Sn, as mentioned in the previous section. Cao et al. observed the formation of perovskite aggregates in (BA)2(MA)2Sn3I10 and (BA)2(MA)3Sn4I13 films when 0.2 mol SnF2 was added to the precursor solution, which is a common additive used in 3D Sn-perovskites to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+. The introduction of triethylphosphine (TEP), a weakly coordinating ligand for Sn2+ species, into a 2D Sn-perovskite precursor solution avoids perovskite aggregate formation. The devices employing TEP coordinated (BA)2(MA)2Sn3I10 displayed an average PCE of 1.75% with a Jsc of 8.64 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.37 V and FF of 53.7%, and the (BA)2(MA)3Sn4I13 devices attained an average PCE of 2.43% with a high Jsc of 23.7 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.23 V and FF of 44.6%. Unencapsulated 3D Sn-perovskite (MASnI3) devices displayed poor air stability, completely degrading within 3 min under an ambient atmosphere. On the other hand, 2D BA2MA3Sn4I13 devices retained more than 20% of their initial performance after 20 min. Encapsulated BA2MA3Sn4I13 devices maintained more than 50% of their initial performance after 4 months. Ramirez et al. developed quasi-2D Pb–Sn mixed perovskites using t-butylammonium (t-BA) as spacer cations with a low band gap of ∼1.24 eV. The resultant (t-BA)2(FA0.85Cs0.15)4(Pb0.6Sn0.4)5I16 devices exhibited an average PCE of 9.3%. Recently, a record-high PCE of 18.20% was reported for solar cells by using 3-bromobenzylammonium iodide (3BBAI) based quasi-2D perovskites. The precursor solution with a weight concentration of 20% was prepared by mixing 3BBAI, MACl and PbI2 at a molar ratio of 1.8:2.5:3 in DMF. These devices exhibited impressive, robust stability, retaining 82% of their initial performance after 2400 h of storage in a chamber at room temperature with an RH of 40%.

Recent progress in 2D perovskite research strongly suggests that organic spacer cations other than BA and PEA can also be interesting choices for solar cell applications because by tuning the nature of the spacer molecules the optoelectronic properties and orientation of the perovskite crystal grains can be tailored. Quasi-2D perovskites (n = 5) using n-propylammonium (PA) spacer cations showed a PCE of up to 10.42%. These PA2MA4Pb5I16 devices showed an excellent Jsc of 18.89 mA cm−2 and Voc of 1.11 V, with a FF of 49.53%. Also, they demonstrated commendable stability: retaining ∼98% of their initial performance after 500 h under 60% RH. Lai et al. successfully synthesized 2D perovskites using 2-thiophenemethylammonium (ThMA) cations as a spacer. The resulting (ThMA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 devices displayed an impressive efficiency of 15.42%. Incorporation of MACl into a 2D perovskite precursor solution produced a nanorod-like morphology (Fig. 16a and b) where perovskite layers were highly oriented on the substrate. Fig. 16c–e show GIWAXS images, which depict crystal grain orientation as a function of the amount of MACl. In contrast, the GIWAXS map of the pristine (ThMA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 film showed smooth diffraction rings, suggesting random orientation of perovskite layers in the film. Consequently, pristine (ThMA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 devices displayed a very low efficiency of 1.74%. Notably, the addition of MACl enhanced Jsc from 3.27 mA cm−2 to 18.89 mA cm−2, Voc from 0.99 V to 1.07 V and FF from 53.9% to 76.3%. Such improvements were attributed to balanced hole and electron mobilities as well as considerably reduced defect density as supported by longer PL lifetime. Even better, MACl-treated (ThMA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 devices could retain more than 80% of the initial efficiency after being stored in air with a humidity of 30 ± 10% RH for 250 h. Polyethylenimine (PEI), a polymeric ammonium cation, was also successfully used as a spacer cation in producing 2D/quasi-2D perovskites, which were highly resistant against moisture even allowing the fabrication of efficient solar cells under ambient humidity. The polymeric ammonium cation enables electronic interactions between inorganic layers unlike other organic cations mentioned above, which helps charge transport in 2D perovskites. (PEI)2(MA)6Pb7I22 devices displayed an average efficiency of 9.39% in a small area (0.04 cm2) and still demonstrated a decent efficiency of 8.06% in a larger area (2.32 cm2). The devices fabricated with lower n-members of (PEI)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 3, 5) also exhibited a good photovoltaic response.


To date, most of the reports on 2D PSCs have been based on RP phase 2D perovskites. Very recently, Kanatzidis et al. explored the use of DJ perovskites as light absorbers in solar cells. They demonstrated photovoltaic responses from two different DJ perovskites synthesized using organic cations stemming from a piperidinium organic backbone and the efficiency of resultant devices varied depending on the 3- and 4-positions of the –CH2NH3+ group with respect to the piperidine nitrogen. Specifically, devices fabricated using the 3AMP-based homologous series of perovskites showed a higher performance (a PCE of 7.32% for n = 4) relative to the 4AMP homologous series (a PCE of 4.24% for n = 4) due to the lower band gap of the former compound. The Pb–I–Pb angles for 3AMP-based perovskites are larger than those for the 4AMP. As explained in the optoelectronics section, the larger the Pb–I–Pb bond angles (closer to 180°), the narrower the bandgap due to more overlap between the Pb s and I p orbitals. (3AMP)(MA)3Pb4I13 exhibited the lowest band gap of 1.87 eV among 3AMP and 4AMP based homologous series (n = 1–4) of DJ perovskites and led to a broader EQE response in the derived devices. The J–V curves and EQE spectra of DJ perovskite-based devices are presented in Fig. 17a and b. By employing a mixture of MA and FA cations in the cuboctahedral/perovskite cages, (3AMP)(MA0.75FA0.25)PbI13 devices displayed a better performance with a champion PCE of 12.04%. The (3AMP)(MA0.75FA0.25)3Pb4I13 perovskite has a narrower band gap (1.48 eV) possibly due to the less distorted inorganic framework than the (3AMP)(MA)3Pb4I13. Also, the first Sn-based hybrid DJ perovskite used 4AMP as spacer cations, where the (4AMP)(FA)3Sn4I13 devices showed a promising PCE of 4.22%. Ma et al. used small PDA cations as a spacer layer to synthesize DJ phase perovskites and (PDA) (MA)3Pb4I13-based solar cells showed a PCE of over 13%. The unencapsulated solar cells employing (PDA)(MA)3Pb4I13 demonstrated outstanding stability under various harsh stresses. They retained 95% of their initial efficiency under ambient air with 40–70% RH for 4000 h, humid heat of 85 and 85% RH for 168 h, and constant 1 sun illumination for 3000 h. It has been proposed that DJ phase 2D perovskites are more stable than RP phase perovskites under harsh humidity, heat and light conditions. It is because that the RP phase has a van der Waals gap between adjacent monoammonium spacer cations, leading to a weak interaction between the perovskite layers, that affects the structural stability of the 2D perovskite framework upon exposure to external harsh stresses. On the other hand, diamine molecules with two amino groups in the DJ phase perovskites can produce hydrogen bonds with the inorganic slabs without any van der Waals gaps, resulting in their enhanced stability. The incorporation of 1,4-benzenedimethanamonium iodide (BzDAI) as a spacer cation in the perovskite framework was also found to produce DJ phase perovskites. The Hall mobility measurements suggest that (BzDA) (Cs0.05MA0.15FA0.8)9Pb10(I0.93Br0.07)31 (n = 10) has a similar carrier mobility to 3D perovskites. The (BzDA) (Cs0.05MA0.15FA0.8)9Pb10(I0.93Br0.07)31 devices showed a champion PCE 15.6%. DJ phase, (PDMA)(FA)2Pb3I10 based solar cells (where PDMA is 1,4-phenylenedimethanammonium) also showed a good PCE of 7.11%. Interestingly, electron mobilities for PDMA-based 2D perovskite films deposited without using hot casing or antisolvent engineering are comparable to those reported for the most recent record performing 2D perovskites. The preliminary studies revealed that PDMA spacer molecule in combination with FA cations can greatly influence the orientation and crystallization of perovskite layers, which resulted in better charge carrier mobilities in these systems. Unencapsulated (PDMA)(FA)2Pb3I10 devices maintained >85% of their initial performance after 60 days upon storage in ambient air with an RH of 30–50%.

The newly discovered ACI 2D perovskite structures also exhibited excellent photovoltaic responses and stability. (GA)(MA)3Pb3I10, a member of the 2D ACI perovskite family, was applied as a light absorber in FTO/c-TiO2/perovskite/PCBM/Ag solar cells and produced an average efficiency of 14.1%. The devices retained 88% of their initial performance after being kept in an ambient environment for 240 days. The DJ phase and ACI phase perovskites exhibit better optoelectronic properties for solar cell applications as compared to RP phase perovskites. For instance, the I⋯I interlayer distance of the 3AMP-based DJ perovskite is ∼4.0 Å, much shorter than that of BA-based perovskites (I⋯I ≈ 8). The smaller 3AMP-organic barrier is advantageous for better out-of-plane charge carrier transport, which results in better performance in solar cells.
The most relevant works on 2D/quasi-2D PSCs are listed in Table 2. Some major points can be briefly summarized as follows. Basically, the 2D/quasi-2D PSCs are mainly based on the RP phase perovskites containing either BA or PEA cations. A record PCE of 18.2% was reported for 2D perovskites employing a BA-derivative as spacer cations. But the most recent reports suggest a shift towards diversification; different types of organic cations are being explored to improve the performance (efficiency and/or stability) of the solar cells. For instance, DJ phase (PDA)(MA)3Pb4I13-based devices with 13% PCE showed impressive stability maintaining 95% of their initial efficiency for 4000 h under ambient air. Also, designing new types of 2D halide perovskites like the ACI phase and reduction of van der Waals gap in the layered perovskites are promising new research directions. A systemic study on the relationship between adjacent perovskite layer interaction and stability may lead to development of ultra-stable 2D PSCs. Also, the post-treatment of 2D perovskite films and the use of additives in the perovskite precursor solution were found to be beneficial to improve the crystallinity and orientation of perovskites, thereby contributing to the improvement of device efficiency. We strongly believe that an efficiency of more than 20% can be achieved in ultra-stable 2D perovskite-based solar cells by combining material design and post-treatment/additives approaches.

Due to the different optoelectronic properties of phase-pure 2D perovskites, such as wider optical band gaps and limited charge transport, the related devices do not deliver as high photovoltaic performance as their 3D perovskites. In contrast, 3D/2D perovskites, a mixture of 3D and 2D perovskite phases, have recently surfaced as a promising photovoltaic material that can better balance long-term stability and high efficiency. Typically, 2D/3D perovskites are designed by replacing small amounts of organic cations with bulkier organic spacer cations in the precursor solution. To our best of our knowledge, only the RP phase is used to design 2D/3D perovskites.

Though layered perovskites with n ≥ 10 were reported in the literature, most likely they were indeed composed of both 2D and 3D perovskite phases. Sargent and co-authors conducted theoretical and experimental investigations of multilayered perovskites. Based on their theoretical calculations, as the perovskites transitioned from the 2D to the 3D phase, the formation energy decreased. The lack of long-term stability of 3D perovskites was attributed to the lower formation energy of the material. (PEA)2(MA)59Pb60I181 (n = 60) solar cells exhibited a PCE of 15.3% and could retain ∼75% of their initial performance after storage in humid air (RH 55%) for 14 days. 2D/3D perovskites employing Br-containing organic cation spacers had higher optical band gaps, resulting in higher Voc in corresponding solar cells than I-containing cells.
As an example, (BA)2 (MA)49 Pb50 Br151 solar cells displayed an average efficiency of 8.8% with a high Voc of 1.35 V. An even higher Voc of 1.45 V was observed for (PEA)2(MA)49Pb50Br151 devices, representing one of the highest values among all the PSCs. These devices were also capable of delivering good efficiency without a hole transporting layer (HTL), with only 17% reduction in performance compared to the HTL-containing devices. Nazeeruddin and co-authors reported impressive one-year stability for HTL-free, 2D/3D engineered (AVA)0.3(MA)0.7PbI3 perovskite solar modules, without any obvious loss in efficiency under ambient air with 1 sun illumination at 55 °C. The (AVA)0.3(MA)0.7PbI3 solar module produced 10.1% efficiency with a FTO/c-TiO2/meso-TiO2/perovskite/meso-ZrO2/Carbon device configuration. Small-sized (AVA)0.3(MA)0.7PbI3 PSCs with SpiroOMeTAD/Au as the HTL delivered a champion efficiency of 14.6% vs. 15.95% for 3D perovskites. First principles calculations suggested the widening of the band gap at the 2D/3D interface region of the (AVA)0.3(MA)0.7PbI3 perovskite (Fig. 17c and d). In this case, widening of the band gap at the interface does not prevent electron injection to TiO2 (an electron selective layer), rather it acts as a barrier to the electron recombination as a result of the lower-lying CB of the 2D perovskite versus that of the 3D phase (Fig. 17d). Consequently, the efficiency of 2D/3D perovskite devices was largely unaffected, while retaining the stability features of the 2D phase. Snaith et al. designed “low” and “wide” band gap 2D/3D perovskites involving mixed A-site cations and halides. They tuned BA-to-FA/Cs ratio in FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6 Br0.4)3 (wide band gap perovskite) and FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.8Br0.2)3 (low band gap perovskite) by replacing a small percentage of FA/Cs with BA spacer cations. BA0.05(FA0.83Cs0.17)0.95Pb(I0.8Br0.2)3, a low band gap (Eg = 1.61 eV) 2D/3D perovskite, yielded an average PCE as high as 18.1% with a stabilized power output (SPO) of 17.5%. Devices employing a wide band gap 2D/3D perovskite active layer (BA0.09(FA0.83Cs0.17)0.91Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3) displayed an average efficiency of 15.5% with a SPO of 15.8%. When a lower percentage of BA was incorporated into the 3D perovskite structure, crystallinity was found to increase, as evidenced by GIWAXS analysis (Fig. 18a–f). Also, powder diffraction rings disappeared in GIWAXS of 2D/3D perovskite films indicative of the orientation of crystals on the substrate. The 2D (BA)2(FA0.83Cs0.17)n−1Pbn(I0.6Br0.4)3n+1 phase emerged as plate-like structures at the grain boundaries of 2D/3D perovskite films as shown in Fig. 18g–i. In general, devices using 2D/3D perovskites as a photoactive layer show lower J–V hysteresis in comparison to devices using their 3D analogs. It was proposed that the formation of the 2D–3D heterostructure at the grain boundaries contributed to the elimination of the hysteresis in PSC devices. The encapsulated BA0.09(FA0.83Cs0.17)0.91Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 devices exhibited superior stability with a lifetime of 1650 h, maintaining 80% of the original SPO whereas the SPO of devices employing 3D perovskites dropped to a similar level in a much shorter time of 970 h. By employing 2D/3D Sn-perovskites, PEA2FA49Sn50I151 solar cells achieved a record high efficiency of 9% for Sn-based perovskite devices, much higher than 6% in their 3D version, FASnI3 devices. Recently, we observed that defects associated with Sn vacancies can be reduced in Sn–Pb alloyed perovskites by designing 2D/3D perovskite composites (Unpublished). DFT calculations suggested a higher formation energy for Sn vacancies in 2D Sn-perovskites ((PEA)2SnI4), which discloses the reason for the reduction in the number of defects in the 2D/3D Sn–Pb perovskites.
Nazeeruddin and co-authors observed the formation of a separate water-repellent 2D perovskite layer on the top surface of a 3D perovskite film when a fluorous spacer cation, (CF3)3CO(CH2)3NH3+ (coded as A43), was incorporated into the perovskite film (Fig. 19). In their work, authors explored two different methods to incorporate 2D perovskites, (A43)2PbI4 (n = 1) and (A43)2MAPb2I7 (n = 2), into the perovskite film. In the first approach, they added A43 into a MA0.9FA0.1PbI3 (coded as (MFPI) precursor solution, so a 2D/3D composite formed in the entire film including on the film surface (Fig. 19a and b)). In the second approach, a solution of A43 was spin-coated on top of the Cs0.1FA0.74MA0.13PbI2.48Br0.39 (coded as CFMPIB) perovskite film, which led to the formation of a 2D phase at the top surface (Fig. 19d and e). In both cases, the presence of the A43 spacer cation made the film surface waterproof as evidenced by the increase of contact angle from 55° to 80°–100° (Fig. 19c). (A43)2PbI4 (n = 1) and (A43)2MAPb2I7 (n = 2) 2D perovskites at the film surface improved the moisture stability of the devices by blocking water infiltration and slowing down the interface degradation (Fig. 19i). Also, the photovoltaic performance (Fig. 19g and h) was enhanced in both cases with respect to reference devices delivering efficiencies more than 20%. The deposition of (p-FPEA)2PbI4 on top of the 3D perovskite film was also found to be able to improve the performance and stability of the solar cells. The devices with a stabilized PCE of 20.26% maintained 99% of their initial performance after 864 h upon exposure to dry air with 10–30% RH. Cho et al. passivated the interfacial trap sites in the device by depositing a 2D/3D perovskite layer at the perovskite/hole transport layer interface. They spin coated a solution containing a mixture of bulky organic ammonium iodide, iso-butylammonium iodide (iBAI) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) on top of the 3D perovskite ((FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15) film, which led to the formation of a 2D/3D perovskite phase on top of the film. The passivation of non-radiative recombination pathways resulted in improvement in both Voc and FF, producing a stabilized PCE of 21.7%. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), a powerful tool to study charge-carrier concentration, ionic defects, impurities on the perovskite films by analyzing spatial surface potential or contact potential difference (CPD), revealed the properties of the passivated perovskite surface. Under applied voltage bias, the passivated sample showed a smaller change in CPD due to the reduced number of ionic defects at the surface, within and underneath the 2D/3D passivation layer (Fig. 20a–c)
Consequently, devices with a passivation layer have displayed reduced J–V hysteresis with respect to solar cells using a non-passivated perovskite layer since surface defects play a huge role in device hysteresis. The 2D/3D passivation layer also helped to resist moisture infiltration to the 3D perovskite layer (passivation layer shown in Fig. 20d). The devices with a passivation layer showed superior stability compared to non-passivated devices stored under 75 ± 20% RH conditions (Fig. 20e). Cao et al. found that post-treatment of the MAPBI3 film with tetra-ammonium zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) produces 2D (ZnPc)0.5MAn−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites at the grain boundaries of perovskites which passivated the defects in the perovskite film (Fig. 21a–c). Elongated PL decay time from 44 to 57 ns resulted in the reduction of trap-assisted recombination with modification of MAPbI3 grain boundaries. The devices employing passivated perovskite films showed an increase in the average PCE from 18.1% to 19.4%. More importantly, moisture and heat stability of these devices improved, as shown in Fig. 21d–g. Devices using modified perovskites retained over 90% of their original performance after a 1000 h test at 85 °C with a humidity of 45% RH. All-inorganic halide perovskites are an alternative to organic–inorganic halide perovskites, which largely avoid the stability issues associated with the moisture-sensitive organic component. α-CsPbI3 is the most suitable inorganic perovskite with a band gap of ∼1.73 eV. But the α-phase of CsPbI3 is structurally unstable and easily converts into a photo-inactive δ-phase under ambient conditions. The α-phase could be structurally stabilized by incorporating a small amount of bulkier organic cations, thus producing 2D/3D inorganic perovskites. Inclusion of a small amount of 2D perovskite EDAPbI4 into CsPbI3 produced highly robust α-CsPbI3 films, stable at room temperature for several months. Interestingly, authors found that if a monofunctional ethylamine (EA) or a longer chain alkylamine, such as BA, was used instead of a bication ethylenediamine (EDA), the stability of formed 2D/3D CsPbI3 was on par with that of the pure α-CsPbI3. The solar cells based on the CsPbI3 photoactive layer containing the optimum amount of EDAPbI4 showed an average PCE of 10.42% vs. 5.56% of pure CsPbI3 devices. The most relevant works on 2D/3D PSCs are listed in Table 3.

The film thickness of layered perovskites, especially 2D/quasi-2D perovskites in planar solar cells, is critical in determining the photovoltaic performance of the devices. In contrast to 3D perovskites, 2D/quasi-2D PSCs operate in the Langevin-type charge carrier recombination regime, where the excitonic nature of charge carriers imposes the limit on the thickness of the solar absorber layer. Although, an increase in 2D/quasi-2D perovskite film thickness will improve the optical absorption, it reduces the carrier transport, which in turn decreases the PCE of solar cells. As an example, the PCE, Jsc and Voc values of (BA)2(MA)3Pb3I10 perovskite devices are plotted in Fig. 22a–c as a function of film thickness. The PCE of solar cells is thus defined by the competition between photogeneration (absorption) and carrier transport through the film (Fig. 22d). Different from 2D/quasi-2D PSCs, mixed 2D/3D PSCs are similar to 3D perovskite devices in the sense that their photovoltaic performance is less sensitive to film thickness in the 300–500 nm range as the optical excitation generates free charge carriers, instead of excitons, at room temperature. In a solar cell, a nearly vertical steep slope under the open circuit (OC) condition in a J–V curve indicates that current collection is efficient at a low internal electric field and deviation from the ideal slope implies the loss of photocurrent. In contrast, under the short circuit condition (SC) when the field attains the maximum, a flat slope is anticipated for efficient charge transport and collection, whereas a steep slope at SC alludes that charge collection is field dependent. As illustrated in Fig. 22d and e, when the 2D perovskite film thickness is >375 nm, a sharp fall in the slope value at OC was observed, suggesting that the charge collection efficiency of 2D PSCs is more sensitive at OC than 3D PSCs. The slope of 2D PSCs at SC largely deviated from the ideal value when the film thickness was more than 400 nm. These results explicitly state that charge collection strongly depends on the internal electric field in the absorber layer. Simulations on the band diagram provided further details about the internal electric field in 2D PSCs (Fig. 23a and b). A uniformly strong internal field throughout the film is present for a thin absorber layer device, while the field becomes non-uniform for a thicker film, in particular with the considerably reduced field at the center. The recombination profiles obtained through device simulation (Fig. 23c and d) disclose that the major recombination takes place at the proximity of the interface for a thin film since it is fully depleted.

In the thicker absorber layer, recombination occurs both at the bulk and near the interface due to the faded internal field near the center. A schematic of recombination processes in thin and thick films is displayed in Fig. 23e and f. It was proposed that a slight mismatch and imperfect crystal packing in thin films (Fig. 23g) compared to single crystals can act as potential barriers, which are generated in part by organic spacers between conducting inorganic or perovskite slabs. Consequently, two types of charge carriers can be envisioned in layered perovskite devices, the quasi-bound charge carriers localized in inorganic or perovskite layer regions and free delocalized carriers outside the potential barriers. The electrons and holes are recurrently trapped into and released from the quasi-bound states as they move toward their respective selective contacts (Fig. 23h). The devices with a thick absorber layer suffer from an increased recombination process prompted by organic potential barriers compared to thin films, which regulates the performance of 2D PSCs.
Most recent reports on 2D PSCs adopt the strategy to control the orientation and packing of perovskite layers with additives such as NH4SCN and MACl to enhance the performance of solar cells. Well oriented-perovskite quantum wells with perfect crystal packing reduce the number of potential barriers, enabling efficient charge carrier transport to selective contacts. Alternatively, use of organic spacers with high conductivity or doped organic spacer cations in 2D perovskites can lower the potential barriers for efficient charge transport.

A proper crystal growth orientation is vital in the layered perovskite system to ensure efficient charge transport to selective contacts. Orientation is a unique, yet important, requirement for high performance 2D perovskite-based PSCs. For illustrating this concept, a schematic of orientations of the (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 2D perovskite on the substrate is shown in Fig. 24a. The perovskite layers oriented along the (0k0) direction (horizontal growth) are undesired whereas those oriented along the (202) direction, known as vertically oriented with respect to the plane of the substrate, are highly desired for solar cell application. The crystal orientation can be characterized using powder XRD (PXRD) and Grazing-Incidence X-ray Scattering (GIXS) methods.


The March–Dollase parameter can determine the degree of preferential orientation for the layered 2D perovskites or the alignment of the perovskite slabs relative to the substrate. Kanatzidis et al. simulated PXRD patterns of the (BA)2(MA)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) material (Fig. 24b) as a function of the degree of orientation along (101). In an ideal case of a (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 film with perfect alignment along (202), the March–Dollase parameter is zero, and only the (202) peak is observed in the film PXRD pattern. As the vertical growth starts to weaken, the (111) peak appears. The ratio of (111) to (202) peaks can be used to determine the orientation of perovskite slabs on the substrate. Also, the correlation between layer thickness and crystal growth orientation can be elucidated from the film PXRD pattern. Fig. 24c shows the difference in the ratio of (111) and (202) peaks when n goes from n = 3 to n = 5; it demonstrates an increase in the (111)-to-(202) ratios with increasing n.


GIXS is a powerful tool to investigate the crystal growth, morphology, and degradation of perovskites. In general, the GIXS method can probe a large sample volume on scales relevant for typical solar cell devices while being nondestructive. There are two types of GIXS, Grazing-Incidence Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (GISXAS) and Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWXAS).

In a GIXS measurement, the sample reference frame is typically positioned onto the sample surface where z is normal to the surface and x points to the direction of the X-ray beam as depicted in Fig. 24d. The X-ray beam with the momentum  impinges at a shallow angle αi. The emergent scattering waves with the momentum  are expressed by the in-plane exit angle αf and out-of-plane angle Ψ.
The scattering vector  is given by

In GISXAS, the detector–sample distance is >2 m. Crystal morphology and domain/grain sizes with length scale in the range of several nanometers up to micrometers can be probed using GISAXS. Conversely, GIWAXS investigates length scales down to the atomic range and therefore bears crystallographic information about the crystalline component of the material. The scattering pattern produced in GIWAXS measurements originates from crystal planes in the reciprocal space and provides information about crystalline phases as well as crystal orientation with respect to the normal to the surface of the substrate.

The azimuthal angle χ describes the crystal orientation in the sample to the normal component qz of the scattering vector. The random orientation in the sample produces Debye–Scherrer rings with a homogeneous intensity distribution. The scattered waves, kf, depict an Ewald sphere (a sphere in the reciprocal space). According to the Laue condition, only the points of reciprocal lattice, which overlap with the surface of the Ewald sphere, are detectable in the GIWAXS map. Thus, intense Bragg spots are observed for the samples containing a highly oriented crystalline phase (Fig. 24e–h). In short, GIWAXS is complementary to specular XRD, which examines a small part of the reciprocal space along the normal of the surface of the substrate (≈qr = 0). In 2D/quasi-2D PSCs, the orientation of perovskite slabs with respect to the substrate is a key factor in achieving high performance. The orientation of perovskite slabs parallel to the substrate impedes charge transport to the respective electrodes due to the encountering of charge carriers with insulating organic spacer cations in their transport paths (Fig. 24g). Therefore, the knowledge of perovskite crystal orientation obtained through GIWXAS is essential to understand, design and optimize 2D perovskite absorber films. As seen in the previous section, most recent reports on 2D/quasi-2D PSCs tried to alter the perovskite layer orientation by using additives and modifying film deposition parameters and the GIWAXS technique has been almost exclusively utilized in these efforts.

2D perovskites are an attractive alternative to 3D perovskites for solar cell application as they directly address a critical issue of stability of 3D PSCs, while achieving a similarly high PCE (now close to 20%). The impressive accomplishment sprouted from the developments in the scientific understanding of the materials and the advancements in the fabrication and synthetic chemistry skills of 2D perovskites and solar cells as well as the exploration of relevant, top-notch characterization tools. Their unique layered structural design enables structural flexibility and grants functional materials design. Physical and chemical nature of spacer cations, choice of metal cations and halides, variation of perovskite slab thickness and even external stress can be used to tune the optoelectronic properties of 2D perovskites. To date, RP phase 2D perovskites have been intensely studied and utilized in solar cell investigations, but layered perovskites are not only limited to the RP phase. For example, DJ phase and newly discovered ACI phase perovskites were tested as solar absorbers to produce a PCE of more than 15%. We anticipate that a more fundamental understanding of structure–property relationships of different 2D perovskite phases can lead to further development of impressively stable, high-performing photovoltaic materials. On the synthetic chemistry front, 2D perovskites containing bifunctional organoammonium cations, such as Y(CH2)2NH3+ (Y = F, Cl, Br, I, CN), will open the door for a new class of band gap tunable photovoltaic materials, although they have not been widely employed for solar cell applications yet. Recent reports on fluorination of aromatic organic spacer cations to improve charge transport in 2D perovskites are very encouraging. A detailed investigation on changes in structural and intermolecular electronic coupling between neighboring organic cations in organic gallery upon fluorination could lead to employing a wide variety of bifunctional organic molecules in layered perovskites to improve photovoltaic performance of the solar cells. A phase-pure, high member (n ≥ 5) of layered perovskites is still challenging to synthesize and advancement in synthetic chemistry is expected to provide a leap forward in 2D perovskite semiconductor research. So far, we have limited understanding about the nature of excitonic properties of charge carriers and conversion of excitons to free charge carriers in the RP phase 2D perovskites. Current experimental results are not convincing enough to categorize excitons into one of the regimes of excitons, namely, Wannier and Frenkel. Another plausible scenario is that the excitons in 2D perovskites may belong to an intermediate state between the Wannier and Frenkel regimes. Recently, mixed 2D/3D PSCs have also generated great interest due to their long-term stability without much compromise on the photovoltaic properties. Thus far, a strong theoretical framework is not developed for the enhanced long-term stability of 2D/3D perovskites, but the preliminary experimental and theoretical findings suggest that the incorporation of 2D phases modifies the defect chemistry.

We foresee a breakthrough in 2D perovskite research in the coming years, which could potentially replace 3D perovskites and become a ‘next big thing’ in semiconductor materials for solar cell applications.
