Soluble perylene diimide-based copolymers with conjugated electronic push–pull substituent species (piperidinyl and 4-tert-butylphenoxyl) on the 1,7-bay position of the perylene core and a 5,5′-bis(4-aminophenyl)-2-2′-bifuryl as terminal group were synthesized and characterized in order to fabricate bulk heterojunction solar cells. The introduction of such electronic push–pull substituents, which results in relatively low-lying HOMO and high-lying LUMO energy levels, was achieved experimentally using absorption and cyclic voltammetric measurements and also by density functional theory. Successfully fine-tuned HOMO and LUMO energy levels translated into a high open circuit voltage (Voc > 1.0 V) in fabricated photovoltaic devices of type ITO/PEDOT:PSS/rr-P3HT:Perylene diimide-based copolymers/Ca/Al. However, a relatively poor fill factor and efficiency may be observed due to the large degree of aggregation domains, which are observed from atomic force microscopic studies.

As the importance of renewable energy sources grows, the development of highly efficient organic photovoltaic cells is becoming of increasing relevance for electrical energy production. For the construction of solar energy conversion systems, many research efforts have been focused on the exploration of molecular photoelectronic devices for application in photochemical energy conversion, which requires the design of light-harvesting and electron transporting capacity bichromophoric and multichromophoric systems that undergo photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer processes. For this purpose, recent developments in the field of organic photovoltaics have boosted great interest in the development of a new class of photofunctional materials and multifunctional organic dyes or pigments exhibiting broad light-harvesting properties in the near-infrared (NIR) region, which is highly desirable to attain efficient solar energy conversion processes. In this regard, recent synthetic strategies have been developed for design and synthesis of efficient light harvesting materials based on electronic push–pull π-conjugated systems combined with an electron donor–acceptor pair, which lead to feasible photoinduced charge generation in bichromophoric and multichromophoric systems which exhibit broad absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region as one of the key components to construct high performance solar cells. In addition to near-infrared (NIR) light-harvesting capability, high photostability and thermal durability, distinct redox properties, specific carrier injection-tuning properties, excellent electron acceptor ability, a large molar extinction coefficient in the wavelength range of 480–550 nm and unity fluorescence quantum yields are also key factors to attain efficient solar energy conversion processes. Among the different functional materials available, researchers have made efforts to modify perylene diimide based dyes with versatile functionalized electronic push–pull groups at bay-positions, as well as at imide positions, in order to utilize them as an active light-harvesting component to construct bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells. The main reason for introducing groups at bay positions of the perylene diimide (PDI) core is to use an electronic push–pull approach to enhance electron mobilities via strong π–π stacking interactions between the planar PDI moieties, and to induce an ultrafast photoinduced charge-separated state which contributes to the slowing down of charge recombination. However, the electronic structures of perylene π-systems are not significantly affected upon introduction of substituents at the imide position because the frontier molecular orbital nodes are available on the imide nitrogen atoms.

Recently, an alternating copolymer (PTCDI-PFDA) bearing a non-bay substituted perylene moiety combined with a π-conjugated moiety (5,5′-bis(4-aminophenyl)-2-29-bifuryl; PFDA) moieties was prepared and utilized as an active electron acceptor material to fabricate bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic devices. As an extension of that work, here we prepare bay substituted perylene diimide-based copolymers (two-fold piperidinyl and two-fold 4-tert-butylphenoxyl moieties substituted at symmetrical bay positions (i.e., 1,7-bay positions) of the perylene central core as the electron donor part, and then a high degree of π-conjugated PFDA moieties acting as an acceptor) to be used as a photoactive material for bulk heterojunction solar cells. The motivation for making use of the electron-rich piperidinyl and 4-tert-butylphenoxyl moieties at the 1,7-bay positions of the perylene core and the covalently linked PFDA moiety through π-conjugated spacers is that they increase the acceptor character of the perylene core, thereby enhancing the intramolecular charge transfer processes and in turn, resulting in broad light absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum. Furthermore, the results of DFT calculations revealed that judicious substitution of multiple strongly electron-donating substituents onto the symmetrical bay position of the perylene diimide core could induce a positive shift of the LUMO energy levels, but results in no significant change in the HOMO energy levels, which could lead to significant light-harvesting capability.

The synthetic routes used for preparation of conjugated perylene diimide-based acceptor monomers and copolymers were outlined in Scheme 1 and 2.


The isomerically pure 1,7-dipiperidinyl and 1,7-di(4-tert-butylphenoxyl) substituted PDIs were synthesized from perylene-3,4:9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (1), as follows. That is, perylene-3,4:9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (1) was first brominated to yield pure 1,7-dibromoperylene-3,4:9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (2) followed by imidization in the presence of n-butylamine by refluxing with a 2-propanol–water (1:2 ratio) mixture to yield 1,7-dibromo-N,N′′-dibutylamine-3,4:9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (3). Subsequently, the product (3) was subjected to the nucleophilic substitution of both bromine atoms with an excess amount of piperidine at reflux temperature (70 °C) to yield N,N′′-dibutyl-dipiperidinyl-3,4:9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (4) which was separated by conventional column chromatography using neutral alumina. Finally, upon saponification of compound (4) with 125-fold excess KOH in 2-propanol at reflux temperature (85 °C) yields 1,7-dipiperidinyl-3,4:9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (5). However 1,7-di(4-tert-butylphenoxy)-3,4:9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (6) was synthesized by nucleophilic substitution of (2) directly with 3.5 equivalents of 4-tert-butylphenol and 3.8 equivalents of cesium carbonate in dimethylformamide (DMF) at reflux temperature. The yielded product (6) was purified by conventional column chromatography on a silica gel 230–400 mesh. The structures of these compounds were fully characterized by different spectroscopic methods, including FT-IR, 1H-NMR and elemental analysis. The isolated compounds have been applied as the main building blocks in order to design different n-type semiconducting copolymers for solar cell applications. By coupling the above monomers (5 and 6) with a high degree of π-conjugated 5,5′-bis(4-aminophenyl)-2-2′-bifuryl (PFDA) chromophore in m-cresol solvent and with a catalytic amount of benzoic acid and isoquinoline at reflux temperature for 24 h generates the necessary copolymers (1,7-DPPDI-PFDA and 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA) in moderate yields. The isolated copolymers were fully characterized by FT-IR, 1H-NMR spectroscopic methods, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermogravimetric analysis and elemental analysis. The overall copolymerization results are collated in Table 1.

The synthesized copolymers have moderate average molecular weights (Mw), number-average molecular weights (Mn), and polydispersity index (PDI) [Mw = 1503 (g mol−1), Mn = 1466 (g mol−1), PDI = 1.025. for 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA (see Fig. S1, ESI in supporting information) and Mw = 1495 (g mol−1), Mn = 1459 (g mol−1), PDI = 1.024 for 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA (see Fig. S2, ESI in supporting information)] and which were determined by GPC in THF solvent relative to narrow low molecular weight polystyrene standards and the resulting data are summarized in Table 1. 1H-NMR spectrum of both 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA and 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA copolymers showed broad up-field signals in the range of 9.90–9.45 ppm for the respective perylene protons, whereas the bifuryl protons and aromatic phenyl protons gave multiplets in the range of 7.82–7.0 ppm and 6.60–5.85 ppm, respectively. Finally, the cyclic and aliphatic protons of both copolymers resonated in the range of 1.30–1.25 ppm. Thus, the assigned NMR chemical shifts, FT-IR spectral data and elemental analysis presented in the experimental section are found to be consistent with the expected copolymer structures.


The thermal stability of the 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA and 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA copolymers was investigated by means of thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) in a nitrogen atmosphere using a 20 °C min−1 temperature ramp from 50 to 800 °C. The thermograms revealed that both copolymers exhibited a two-stage weight loss. In both copolymer TGA curves, the first stage weight loss was observed in the temperature range of 50–300 °C (<21%), which was assigned to the degradation of bay substituents found in the copolymer frameworks. The second stage weight loss takes place at 350 °C and continues to 520 °C (23.08%) for 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA, whereas in the case of 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA copolymer only a 2–3% weight loss occurs at 320 °C, followed by a drastic degradation starting at about 400 °C and maintained up to 565 °C (35.72%), which are all attributed to the decomposition of the perylene diimide backbone of the respective copolymer frameworks. Thus, both copolymers are thermally stable up to 520–560 °C (see Fig. S7a and S7b, ESI in supporting information) and in addition, it is found from the figure that less than 42% of material remains unaltered at above 600 °C. The total weight loss during both steps is about 43.97% for 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA copolymer and is about 53.49% for 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA copolymer. Consequently, from the observed thermal stability, it is clear that the above copolymers may be potential candidates for solar cell fabrication.


The normalized UV-visible absorption spectra (Fig. 1(a) and (b)) of 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA and 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA copolymers were recorded in dilute chloroform solution (2 × 10−5 M). The overall measured spectral parameters are listed in Table 2. Both perylene copolymers (1,7-DPPDI-PFDA and 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA) exhibits two distinct absorption bands: one absorption band in the UV region (330–430 nm) with two sub-bands at ca. 396 nm and ca. 372 nm for 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA and 401 nm and 339 nm for 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA, respectively, which are attributed to π–π* transitions. The other longer wavelength broad absorption band is in the visible region (450–800 nm) with two strong subbands at ca. 620 nm and 558 nm for 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA and ca. 546 nm and 512 nm for 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA, respectively, which are assigned to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) of the perylene core. The presence of electron-donating piperidinyl and 4-tert-butylphenoxyl substituents in the 1,7-bay positions of the perylene core results in an intense broad absorption in the NIR region and also significantly enhances the solubility of copolymers in common organic solvents. The broad absorption band of the electronic push–pull 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA copolymer is significantly red-shifted by about 74 nm compared to that of the 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA copolymer. These results indicate that piperidinyl substituents are mainly responsible for such red-shifts when compared to 4-tert-butylphenoxyl substituents at the 1,7-bay position of the perylene core, which is due to the stronger steric hindrance of the two-fold piperidinyl than the two-fold 4-tert-butylphenoxyl groups. It is also worth noting that the introduction of the electron donating nature of piperidinyl and 4-tert-butylphenoxyl moieties at the 1,7-bay position of the perylene core boosts more significantly the high degree of conjugation of the entire perylene core. Therefore, the absorption properties of the two copolymers are highly suitable for harvesting sunlight.

The fluorescence spectra of these copolymers were also acquired in dilute chloroform (2 × 10−5 M) with excitation at 540 ± 5 nm for 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA and at 510 ± 5 nm for 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA (Fig. 2(a) and 2(b)) and the overall spectral data were summarized in Table 2. Upon excitation of 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA solution at 540 nm, it exhibits two distinct emission bands at λmax = 598 nm and a shoulder peak at 635 nm. The 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA copolymer solution excited at 510 nm exhibited two emission bands at λmax = 574 nm and a shoulder peak at 632 nm. The excitation spectra of 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA and 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA were relatively similar to the absorption spectra, which indicates that the fluorescence may be the mirror image relative to the S0–S1 absorption. The reason for the observed broad shoulder peak is due to either the coexistence of intrachain molecules or a kind of aggregation state of the polymers appeared in solution. Generally, such aggregated states show weaker vibronic peaks. Time-resolved photoluminescence was recorded at λmaxex = 500 nm (Fig. 2(c) and 2(d)) and shows that the fluorescence decay of 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA (τ = 0.85 ns and 4.08 ns) and 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA (τ = 3.23 ns and 4.75 ns) copolymers has two-exponential decay functions, whereas N,N′-dibutyl-1,7-dipiperidinyl-3,4:9,10-perylenetetra-carboxylicdiimide (N,N′- dibutyl substituted monomer, τ = 1.23 ns) show a single exponential decay function. The fluorescence decay of the 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA copolymer shows two-exponential decay functions which is similar to hexaazatriphenylene (HAT)-substituted with six perylene diimide (HAT-PDI6) chromophores (τ = 4.63 ns and 18.5 ns).  Furthermore, upon comparing with the PDI chromophore (τ = 4.21 ns), the 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA copolymer shows a shorter excited-state lifetime, whereas the 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA copolymer possesses a longer excited-state lifetime. Such observed long-lived species with relatively longer excited-state lifetime values is due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) or enhanced electron transfer characteristics of the relaxed excited-state geometry of the perylene copolymer.

The electrochemical properties of 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA and 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA copolymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry measurements using thin polymer films prepared by a drop casting method to evaluate the ionization potentials/electron affinity (the frontier molecular orbitals) and to understand their intrinsic potential utility to act as semiconductors for the fabrication of solar cell devices. The cyclic voltammograms of the copolymer thin films were shown in Fig. 3 and the overall electrochemical data were summarized in Table 2. The cyclic voltammograms of both 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA and 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA copolymers showed multi quasi-reversible redox waves in Fig. 3(a) and (b). The standard potentials were internally calibrated using the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+), which is assumed to have an absolute energy level of −4.8 eV vs. vacuum and from the measured first oxidation potential for both 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA and 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA copolymers (located at ∼0.27 V), the frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO energy levels), as well as the electrochemical band gap (Eg,ec) were estimated using the following equations:

IP (HOMO level) = −e (Eonsetox + 4.53) (eV)
(1)
EA (LUMO level) = −e (Eonsetred + 4.53) (eV)
(2)
Eg,ec = Eonsetox − Eonsetred(eV)
(3)
where
Eonsetred and Eonsetox were measured with respect to the Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. The formal reduction potentials (Eonsetred) for 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA are −1.02, −1.47 and −2.0 V and the reduction potentials for 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA are −0.89 V, −1.50 V and −2.04 V, respectively. The formal oxidation potentials (Eonsetred) of both copolymers are in the range of 1.0–1.75 V. From the onset oxidation and onset reduction potentials of the 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA copolymer (+1.06 V and −0.76 V), the ionization potential (IP, HOMO level is −5.6 eV) and the electron affinity (EA, LUMO level is −3.77 eV) levels were found, from which the electrochemical band gap was estimated and found to be ca. 1.83 eV. Similarly, from the onset oxidation and onset reduction potentials for the 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA copolymer (+1.06 V and −0.70 V), the ionization potential (HOMO level is −5.6 eV) and electron affinity (EA, LUMO level is −3.83 eV) levels were found, from which electrochemical band gap was estimated and found to be ca. 1.77 eV. Consequently, the effects of substituents at the 1,7-bay position of the perylene diimide copolymers induces a significant shift in the LUMO energy levels relative to the parent PTCDI-PFDA copolymer, while the HOMO energy levels remained almost unchanged, which leads to a decrease in the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps. It is worth noting that the estimated electrochemical band gaps of 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA and 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA are slightly higher than the band gap values measured from their optical absorption spectra (error max = 18–23%), which is probably due to the exciton binding energy of the organic conjugated materials. A complete picture of the energy band diagram of the two copolymers (Fig. 4) was constructed based on electrochemical measurements, which shows the estimated HOMO (IP, −5.6 eV) energy levels of 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA and 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA were relatively deeper (i.e., low-lying energy levels) than that of rr-P3HT (−5.3 eV), which ensures better air stability and also indicates that these are good potential candidates for electron-transporting processes in optoelectronic devices. The estimated EA value of the 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA (−3.77 eV) and 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA (−3.83 eV) copolymers are found to be lower than that of rr-P3HT (−3.0 eV) by 0.77 eV and 0.83 eV, respectively, which guarantees the formation of a downhill driving force for energetically favorable electron transfer. Furthermore, it is also important to note that the electron affinities of the 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA and 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA copolymers were higher than that of PCBM (−4.3 eV), which indicates that these copolymers would enhance the electron accepting capacity and thus favor efficient exciton dissociation at the D/A interface in all-polymer BHJ solar cells.


In order to support and clarify the experimental results further, theoretical calculations on the molecules were performed to gain deeper insight into the electronic properties, the optimum geometry and the electron-density of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA and 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA copolymers using density functional theory (DFT) with the Gaussian 03 programme suite with the polarized RB3LYP/6–31g(d) basis set. The optimized geometries of the copolymers are shown in Fig. 5 and 6. The synthesized copolymers look asymmetric with slightly twisted structures. In order to avoid steric clashes, the phenyl groups are rotated, as shown in the optimized structure (See Fig. 5 and 6). From the computed results, it is clear that the entire C–C bonds in these copolymer backbones are partial double bonds. These are good evidence for comprehensive π-delocalization throughout the perylene core, as well as in the aromatic rings. Fig. 7 and 8 shows the schematic diagrams of the calculated frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels (HOMO, HOMO − 1, HOMO − 2, HOMO − 3, and LUMO, LUMO + 1, LUMO + 2 and LUMO + 3). As clearly shown in Fig. 7 and 8, the calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the ground-state optimized geometry were found to be −7.955 eV and −6.885 eV for 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA and −4.894 eV and −3.161 eV for 1,7-DBPDI- PFDA copolymer, respectively, which are in relatively good agreement with the electrochemically determined HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the copolymers (see Table 2). The FMO calculations revealed that, in the case of the 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA copolymer, as shown in Fig. 7, the electron-density of HOMO is localized on the perylene core as well as slightly on the piperidinyl groups, whereas the electron-density of the LUMO is predominantly localized on the perylene core. On the other hand, the electron-density of the HOMO − 1 and LUMO + 2 levels is mainly localized on the PFDA segment and the electron-density of the HOMO, HOMO − 2, LUMO and LUMO + 1 levels is mainly localized on the substituted perylene core. In addition, the electron density of HOMO − 3 and LUMO + 3 is almost evenly localized on the entire π-conjugated copolymer system, as depicted in Fig. 7.

In the case of 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA copolymer, as shown in Fig. 8, it is interesting to note that the electron-density of the HOMO is mainly localized on the well-defined π-conjugated PFDA segment, whereas the LUMO mainly lies on the substituted perylene core. On the other hand, HOMO − 1 and LUMO + 2 are predominantly localized on the perylene core of the 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA copolymer. The electron-density of the HOMO and LUMO + 1 is concentrated on the PFDA segment and the electron-density of the HOMO − 1 and LUMO + 2 lies on the perylene core, as depicted in the Fig. 8. However, the electron density distribution of the HOMO − 2, HOMO − 3 and LUMO + 3 is localized on the entire π-conjugated copolymer system. This indicates that the photoinduced intramolecular electron transfer take place between PFDA and substituted perylene diimide units by HOMO–LUMO transitions. Thus, the frontier molecular orbital energy calculation findings revealed that incorporating piperidinyl and 4-tert-butylphenoxyl substitution patterns onto the bay positions of the perylene diimide core induces a significant positive shift in the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, which leads to a tremendously reduced energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the perylene diimide-based conjugated copolymers, compared with those of the parent PTCDI-PFDA copolymer. These results are also in good accordance with the electrochemical results discussed earlier.

The current-density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of two photovoltaic devices [(ITO/PEDOT:PSS(40 nm)/rr-P3HT:1,7-DPPDI-PFDA(100 nm)/Ca(2 nm)/Al(110 nm)) (D1) and (ITO/PEDOT:PSS(40 nm)/rr-P3HT:1,7-DBPDI-PFDA(100 nm)/Ca (2 nm)/Al(110 nm)) (D2)] were determined in the dark and under AM 1.5 G illumination conditions and were shown in a semilogarithmic plot (Fig. 9(a) and 9(b)). In these characteristics, the forward bias corresponds to a positive and negative voltage applied to the Al and ITO electrode, respectively. The generated power conversion efficiency of the polymer BHJ devices (D1 and D2) based on 1,7-DPPDI-PFDA and 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA copolymers was summarized in Table 3. The device D1 delivered an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.24 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 2.16 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.46, and exhibits a power conversion efficiency of about 1.23%. The device D2 exhibits an efficiency of 1.18% with a short circuit current (Jsc) of 2.65 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.11 V, and a fill factor of 0.42.

Furthermore, the PCE is expected to be enhanced either by increasing the thickness of the active layer (about ∼180–200 nm) or by varying the composition of the blend (rr-P3HT:synthesized perylene diimide copolymer ratio; about 1:2 and 1:4 w/w%) under AM 1.5 G illumination conditions. Since, the photocurrent and the photovoltaic performance are highly dependent upon the thickness of the active layer, which mainly depends on optical effects (light absorption) and that of the optimum nano-scale morphology domain (an interpenetrating network of donor/acceptor in the blend films, which is smaller than the exciton diffusion length). Hence, further increasing the composition of the blend ratios, which leads to the decrease of Jsc and the overall PCE may be attributed to a disruption of the perylene diimide-based acceptor copolymer network in the polymer blend, which could adversely affect charge carrier transport in BHJ solar cells. Further extensive research is under way to study and optimize the thickness of the active layer and their photovoltaic performance.
The IPCE spectra of rr-P3HT:1,7-DPPDI-PFDA (D1) and rr-P3HT:1,7-DBPDI-PFDA (D2) devices show broader photocurrent peaks in the wavelength range of 400–650 nm (Fig. 10). The photocurrent spectra of D1 and D2 exhibited an onset at about 664 nm (1.86 eV) and 655 nm (1.89 eV), respectively, which closely resemble the determined optical band gap as well as the electrochemical band gap. The IPCE (%) of the D1 and D2 devices exhibits a maximum of 16.13% at 530 nm for rr-P3HT:1,7-DPPDI-PFDA and of 14.40% at 520 nm for rr-P3HT:1,7-DBPDI-PFDA.
The characteristic high open circuit voltages (Voc > 1.0 V) of the fabricated solar devices (D1 and D2) using copolymers are due to the electronic push–pull substituent species of the 1,7-di-(piperidinyl) and 1,7-di-(4-tert-butylphenoxyl) conjugated systems in the bay positions of the perylene diimide core, which favor a significant positive shift in the LUMO energy levels and in turn, such results were in relatively good agreement with the findings from electrochemical analysis and theoretical calculations.

The surface morphology of the BHJ active blend films were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 represent surface topographic images of rr-P3HT:1,7-DPPDI-PFDA and rr-P3HT:1,7-DBPDI-PFDA, respectively, at 1:1 wt% as a function of blend ratio. The topographic image of the rr-P3HT:1,7-DPPDI-PFDA blend film showed a relatively smoother surface with a roughness of ∼5.12 nm, whereas the blend film (Fig. 12) based on rr-P3HT:1,7-DBPDI-PFDA showed uneven and rounded features with a roughness as high as ∼12.5 nm. This indicates that there is a large amount of aggregated domains, which lead to a decrease in the efficiency of exciton dissociation in the device system since the exciton diffusion length for organic conjugated materials is typically 5–20 nm.


All the chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (USA) and Rankem (India) and were used as received. All solvents used in this work were of analytical grade and were distilled using standard procedures before use (Vogel's text of practical organic chemistry, 5th edition); chloroform was passed through an alumina column to remove the ethanol before distilling over K2CO3; dichloromethane was distilled over anhydrous phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5). All chromatographic separations were carried out on silica gel (60–120 mesh). Poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and regioregular-poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rr-P3HT) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without purification. The monomer of 5,5′-bis(4-aminophenyl)-2-2′-bifuryl (PFDA) was synthesized according to the procedure reported in the literature.

The above mentioned monomers (5 and 6) have been applied as building blocks for the synthesis of 1,7-dipiperidinyl-3,4:9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic anhydride (1,7-DPPDI) and 1,7-di(4′-tert-butylphenoxy)-3,4:9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic anhydride (1,7-DBPDI)-based copolymers comprised of a high degree of π-conjugated PFDA chromophore for organic solar cell applications. The mentioned copolymers (perylene polyimide) were prepared by means of a one-step copolymerization method of the monomers (5 and 6) with a high degree of π-conjugated 5,5′-bis(4-aminophenyl)-2-2′-bifuryl (PFDA) chromophore in m-cresol solvent in the presence of a catalytic amount of both benzoic acid (BA) and isoquinoline based on the described experimental procedure. The compound PFDA (1.79 mmol) was dissolved in 10 ml m-cresol and added into a flame-dried RB (round bottom) flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, condenser and inlet for nitrogen gas. After the addition of perylene dianhyride monomers (5 and 6, 1.79 mmol) and a catalytic amount of benzoic acid (BA, 3.60 mmol), the reaction mixture was heated to 190–195 °C and maintained at the same temperature for 9 h under nitrogen atmosphere. Furthermore, a catalytic amount of isoquinoline (3.60 mmol dissolved in 0.5 ml m-cresol) was added into the reaction mixture and the copolymerization process was allowed to occur for another 24 h at 190–195 °C. After being cooled to room temperature, a minimum amount of chloroform was added to the viscous reaction mass and the resulting solution was poured dropwise into 500 ml of methanol. The yielded precipitate was collected on a G4 funnel, washed with methanol (2 × 50 ml) and dried in an oven under vacuum. All polyimides were purified by reprecipitation in chloroform and recovered as a solid.

The solution 1H-NMR spectra were acquired on a 300/400 MHz BRUKER spectrometer in deuterated chloroform solution at 298 K, unless specified otherwise. Chemical shifts were reported as δ values (ppm) relative to an internal tetramethylsilane (TMS) standard. The weight average molecular weight (Mw), number-average molecular weight (Mn), and polydispersity index (PDI = Mw/Mn) of the copolymers were determined from a calibrated curve based on polystyrene standards recorded by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min−1 THF solution (HPLC grade) at 35 °C. Elemental analyses were performed on a Vario EL III elemental analyzer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) were conducted on a Perkin Elmer Pyris-1 thermogravimetric analyzer with a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. Electrochemical measurements were carried out using a computer controlled AUTOLAB-potentiostat/galvanostat, Netherlands.


The UV-vis absorption spectra and photoluminescence emission spectra were recorded on a double beam ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (T90+, PG Instruments Ltd., United Kingdom) and a Shimadzu spectrofluorometer (RF-5301 PC, Japan), respectively. The optical bandgap was calculated from the onset of the absorption spectra. Fluorescence lifetime measurements were carried out on a picosecond time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) spectrometer with a tunable Ti-sapphire laser (TSUNAMI, Spectra physics, USA) as the excitation source of 500 nm excitation wavelength. The fluorescence decay curves were analyzed using software provided by IBH (DAS-6).


Electrochemical measurements were recorded on a computer controlled AUTOLAB-potentiostat/galvanostat in a conventional three-electrode system using a polymer film prepared by a drop casting method on a glassy carbon disk as the working electrode (3.0 mm in diameter), platinum-wire as the counter electrode, and silver wire (Ag/Ag+, 0.1 M) as the reference electrode in an argon-saturated acetonitrile (CH3CN, HPLC grade) solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) as supporting electrolyte. Ferrocene (Fc) was employed (concentration 1 mM) as the reference redox system according to IUPAC recommendations. In each case, several scans were carried out to confirm the chemical reversibility of the redox process. The HOMO and LUMO energies of the copolymer were determined based on a value of −4.8 eV for Fc/Fc+ with respect to the zero vacuum level.


To gain insight into the surface morphology (topographic and phase images) of the blended P3HT/copolymer films, atomic force microscopy (AFM, XE-100, Park Systems) was performed in tapping mode. A commercially available Si cantilever (crystal silicon tip) with a resonant frequency (F0) of 300–350 kHz and a typical spring constant (K) of 20–100 N m−1 was used in non-contact mode. The scanner was a 100 micrometer scanner, and the scan rate was 0.50 Hz in air. Off-line image processing and analysis (roughness and size) were performed using DI off-line software (XEI Corp.).


All theoretical calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 programme package. The polymers were optimized using the RB3LYP functional in conjunction with a 6-31 g(d) basis set. It has been already shown that B3LYP/6–31 g(d) gives decent ground state structures for conjugated polymers.


Polymer solar cells were fabricated in the configuration of the common sandwich structure through several steps (Fig. 13). Indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates (15–20 Ω cm−2) were used as the anode with calcium/aluminum as cathode. Prior to use, the ITO glass substrates were patterned in isolated configuration by photolithography, and cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. After drying the substrate in an oven at 100 °C for 1 h, the thickness and roughness of ITO were measured to be 110 and 10 nm, respectively, using a Tencor Alpha Step 500 thickness profilometer. First, PEDOT:PSS (filtered through a 0.45 μm PVDF filter) was spin-coated onto the cleaned ITO substrate at 1000 rpm for 1 min and subsequently baked at 140 °C for 10–20 min in air to dry, which resulted in a thin film with a thickness of ∼40 nm. Secondly, a blend mixture (active material consisting of P3HT: perylene diimide-based copolymers in anhydrous chlorobenzene (1:1 weight ratio at a concentration of (10 mg ml−1)) solution was spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer at 1000 rpm for 1 min and the resulting films were dried at 120 °C for 15–20 min on a hot plate. The above blend mixture was prepared by stirring for 6–8 h at room temperature and then filtered through a 0.2 μm pore sized poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) filter. The thickness of the active layers (90–100 nm) was measured using the above mentioned profilometer. Then, Ca capped by Al (2 nm/110 nm) was evaporated onto the substrate under high vacuum (5 × 10−6 mbar) in an evaporation chamber (Hind High Vacuum Co. (P) Ltd., BC-300 vacuum evaporation system with E-100 load lock). Two organic solar devices were fabricated here with the typical structure as follows: ITO/PEDOT-PSS/rr-P3HT:perylene diimide-based copolymers (1:1 w/w)/Ca/Al. Such a fabricated device consists of 4 isolated cells per substrate with an active area of 0.25 cm2 (Fig. 14). After encapsulation by UV-curing glue, current density versus voltage curves (J–V characteristics) of the encapsulated devices were obtained in ambient air using a Keithley 2400 semiconductor characterization system and an Oriel white light solar simulator operating at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 under AM 1.5 G (air mass 1.5 global).

The spectral responses (incident photon to current conversion efficiency; IPCE) of the fabricated devices were measured with an Oriel 300 W Xe Arc lamp in combination with an Oriel Cornerstone 260¼ monochromator. The number of incident photons was calculated for each wavelength using a calibrated monocrystalline silicon diode as reference. All the fabrication processes were performed in open air conditions.

In summary, soluble perylene diimide-based conjugated electronic push–pull copolymers with moderate molecular weights were synthesized by a one-step process. The as-synthesized copolymers showed extended broad light absorption from the visible-to-near infrared region and also showed higher absorption coefficients. The introduction of the electronic push–pull substituent species results in a relatively low-lying HOMO and high-lying LUMO energy levels were established well by experimental and theoretical calculations, which in turn translated into high open circuit voltages in the fabricated photovoltaic devices. However, the fabricated device based on 1,7-DBPDI-PFDA has a relatively poor fill factor and efficiency, which may be due to the large degree of aggregated domains found via AFM.
