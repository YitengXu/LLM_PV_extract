In this paper, we report the effect of fluorine substituents on the opto-electronic properties and photovoltaic device performances of organoboron electron acceptors. We synthesized two new organoboron electron acceptors with four fluorine substituents introduced to either the organoboron core unit or the endcapping groups. Owing to the unique electronic structures of organoboron electron acceptors, fluorine substituents at the organoboron core unit lead to a downshifted HOMO level and blue-shifted absorption spectrum, and fluorine substituents at the endcapping groups lead to a downshifted LUMO level and red-shifted absorption spectrum. In both cases, the fluorine substituents result in improved crystallinity of the organoboron electron acceptors. In polymer solar cell (PSC) devices, while the fluorine substituents at the organoboron core unit do not significantly affect the active layer morphology and the photovoltaic performance, the fluorine substituents at the endcapping groups result in large-size phase separation in the active layer and consequently decrease photovoltaic efficiency. These results suggest that the opto-electronic properties and device behaviors of organoboron compounds can be rationally tuned by fluorine substitution.

Compared with inorganic solar cells, PSCs have the great merits of low cost with solution processability and flexibility. PSCs always use a blend of polymer electron donor and small molecular electron acceptor as active layer. The majority of non-fullerene small molecular acceptors are A–D–A-type molecules, in which an electron-donating core unit (D) is endcapped with two electron-accepting units (A). The design and optimization of A–D–A-type small molecular acceptors lead to the dramatic enhancement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction PSCs to over 14%. A–D–A-type small molecular acceptors exhibit narrow absorption spectra with only one strong absorption band, which indicates limited sunlight harvesting capability. Organoboron chemistry provides a new toolbox to design opto-electronic materials. Recently, our group reported an organoboron electron acceptor based on an organoboron core unit. The organoboron electron acceptor exhibits a wide absorption spectrum with two strong absorption bands, which indicates superior sunlight harvesting capability and is very desirable for photovoltaic applications. This is attributed to its unique electronic structure, i.e. delocalized LUMO and localized HOMO. Therefore, organoboron electron acceptors represent a new kind of opto-electronic materials. It is important to tune the opto-electronic properties of organoboron electron acceptors and to establish the relationship of their chemical structures, electronic structures, opto-electronic properties and device performance.

Fluorine substitution is an effective approach to tune the opto-electronic properties and enhance the PSC device performance of organic photovoltaic materials. The electron-withdrawing nature of the fluorine substituent leads to a downshift of both lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of π-conjugated molecules. The non-covalent interactions of the fluorine substituents, such as the F–S interaction and F–H interaction, result in strong intermolecular interactions and can change the molecular stacking and phase separation behaviours of organic electronic materials. This affects the charge transporting property and exciton diffusion/dissociation processes, which consequently affect photovoltaic device performance. Indeed, fluorine substitution has been successfully used to enhance the PSC device performance of A–D–A-type small molecular acceptors.
In this work, we report the effect of fluorine substitution on organoboron electron acceptors. As shown in Scheme 1, four fluorine substituents are introduced to either the core unit or the endcapping groups of the organoboron electron acceptors. We find that fluorine substitution at the core unit leads to a downshifted HOMO level and blue-shifted absorption spectrum and that fluorine substitution at the endcapping group results in a downshifted LUMO level and red-shifted absorption spectrum. The effect of fluorine substitution in organoboron electron acceptors is different from that in typical A–D–A-type electron acceptors because of the unique electronic structure of organoboron electron acceptors. The photovoltaic performances of these fluorine substituents organoboron electron acceptors are also thoroughly studied.


Scheme 1 shows the chemical structures of three organoboron electron acceptors, among which MBN has been reported previously. In MBN-F1, the four fluorine substituents are introduced to the phenyl groups in the organoboron core unit. In MBN-F2, the four fluorine substituents are introduced to the endcapping 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INIC) groups.



MBN-F1 and MBN-F2 were synthesized following the synthesis method for MBN, which has been reported previously.Scheme 2 depicts the synthetic routes of the new organoboron molecules. Starting from 5,5′-dibromo-N3,N3′-di-2-hexyldecyl-[2,2′-bipyridine]-3,3′-diamine, the two target molecules were synthesized by three-step reactions, i.e. reaction with triarylboron, Suzuki coupling reaction with 5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)thiophene-2-carbaldehyde, and Knoevenagel condensation with INIC derivatives. For MBN-F1, the fluorine substituents were introduced using tris(4-fluorphenyl)borane instead of triphenylborane as the reactant in the first step. For MBN-F2, the fluorine substituents were introduced by replacing INIC with 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile as the reactant in the final step.

The chemical structures of the two fluorinated molecules were confirmed using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectrum and element analysis. MBN-F1 and MBN-F2 exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform and chlorobenzene. According to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), MBN-F1 and MBN-F2 exhibit good thermal stability with thermal decomposition temperature (Td) of 302 and 264 °C (Fig. S1).

To study the electronic structures of the three molecules, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. The alkyl chains were replaced by methyl for simplifying calculation. Fig. 1 shows the calculated Kohn–Sham LUMOs and HOMOs of the three molecules. MBN, MBN-F1 and MBN-F2 exhibit similar electron structures with the LUMO delocalized over the whole conjugated backbone and the HOMO localized at the organoboron core unit. These electronic structures are different from typical A–D–A-type small molecular electron acceptors, in which both LUMOs and HOMOs are delocalized over the whole conjugated backbone. As discussed in our previous paper, the limited overlap between the LUMOs and HOMOs of the three organoboron molecules is expected to afford a wide absorption spectrum; the delocalized LUMO is expected to ensure excellent electron transporting property. The unique electronic structure of the organoboron electron acceptors would enable us to effectively tune their LUMO/HOMO energy levels. To elucidate the effect of fluorine substituents on the LUMO and HOMO energy levels, we also carried out the calculation of two more fluorinated derivatives. As shown in Fig. S2, one compound has pentafluorophenyl groups on the organoboron core unit, while the other compound has fluorine substituents on both the organoboron core unit and the endcapping unit. These two compounds also show delocalized LUMOs and localized HOMOs. As the endcapping groups participate in the LUMO and are not involved in the HOMO, the fluorine substitution on the INIC groups is expected to mainly affect the LUMO levels. Since the HOMO is mainly distributed on the organoboron core unit, the fluorine substituents on the organoboron core unit should mainly affect the HOMO levels.


To estimate the LUMO/HOMO energy levels (ELUMO/EHOMO) of the three molecules, we employed cyclic voltammetry (CV) in dichloromethane solution. Fig. 2a shows the cyclic voltammograms of MBN, MBN-F1 and MBN-F2. Based on the onset potential of the reduction waves and oxidation waves (see Table 1), we calculated the LUMO/HOMO energy levels.

The ELUMO/EHOMO values are −3.93 eV/−5.34 eV for MBN, −3.94 eV/−5.39 eV for MBN-F1 and −4.02 eV/−5.35 eV for MBN-F2. As shown in Fig. 2b, compared with MBN, the fluorine substituents at the organoboron core unit in MBN-F1 led to downshifted EHOMO by 0.05 eV with little effect on EHOMO, corresponding to increased band gap. In comparison, fluorine substituents at the endcapping units in MBN-F2 result in downshifted ELUMO by 0.09 eV with little effect on EHOMO, corresponding to decreased band gap. These results are in accordance with the DFT calculation results as discussed previously.

Fig. 3 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of MBN, MBN-F1 and MBN-F2 in diluted chlorobenzene solution and in thin film. The characteristics are listed in Table 1. All three organoboron electron acceptors exhibit wide absorption spectra with two strong absorption bands. The long-wavelength absorption band is assigned to the HOMO → LUMO transition, and the short-wavelength band around 500 nm is attributed to some HOMO−n → LUMO+n transitions with high energy. The detailed DFT calculation results of these transitions are provided in the ESI. As studied in our previous work, the emergence of two strong absorption bands is due to the unique electronic structures, i.e. delocalized LUMO and localized HOMO, of the three organoboron molecules. In solution, the two absorption peaks of MBN, MBN-F1 and MBN-F2 locate at 483/699 nm, 480/679 nm and 493/714 nm, with the maximal molar extinction coefficient of 7.83 × 104 cm−1 mol−1, 8.01 × 104 cm−1 mol−1 and 6.92 × 104 cm−1 mol−1, respectively. Fluorine substitution at the organoboron core unit in MBN-F1 leads to a blue-shifted absorption spectrum and increased extinction coefficient. In comparison, fluorine substitution at the endcapping groups in MBN-F2 results in a red-shifted absorption spectrum and decreased extinction coefficient. These results are consistent with the increased band gap of MBN-F1 and decreased band gap of MBN-F2 measured in CV. The absorption spectra of three molecules in thin film are red-shifted compared with the corresponding absorption spectra in solution. This is due to the intermolecular interaction of the molecules in the solid state. Based on the onset absorption wavelength, the optical band gap of MBN, MBN-F1 and MBN-F2 are calculated to be 1.40, 1.47 and 1.33 eV, respectively.

The molecular stacking of the three organoboron molecules was studied by grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) with drop-cast films on SiO2 substrates. Fig. 4 shows the GI-XRD patterns of the three organoboron molecules. MBN exhibits no diffraction peaks, indicating an amorphous nature in the solid state. This is due to the four rigid and bulky “sticking-out” phenyl groups of the organoboron core unit, which make the molecular configuration nonplanar. Both MBN-F1 and MBN-F2 show obvious diffraction peaks, indicating the semicrystallinity of the thin films of the two molecules. Regardless of whether the fluorine substituents are introduced to the core unit or the endcapping unit, the fluorine substituents lead to greatly improved crystallinity. The improved crystallinity is expected to result in an enhanced electron transporting property and changed phase separation behaviours in PSCs.


To evaluate the photovoltaic performances of the three organoboron molecules, we fabricate PSC devices with three molecules as the electron acceptor. We select poly[2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene)]-alt-[5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PBDB-T, see Fig. 5b) as electron donor. The device configuration was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:MBN or MBN-F1 or MBN-F2/Ca/Al. The active layer was spin-coated from the blend of the polymer electron donor and the organoboron electron acceptor in chlorobenzene containing 2 vol% 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as the solvent additive. Fig. 5c shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) of the devices. Table 2 summarizes the photovoltaic parameters. The MBN-based device shows an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.76 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 11.55 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 57.2%, leading to a PCE of 5.02%. The MBN-F1 device exhibits a Voc of 0.73 V, Jsc of 11.40 mA cm−2, and FF of 59.7%, corresponding to a PCE of 4.96%. The device performance of MBN-F1 is fairly comparable to that of MBN, indicating that the fluorine substituents on the organoboron core unit do not significantly affect the photovoltaic performance. In contrast, the MBN-F2 device exhibits a Voc of 0.64 V, Jsc of 8.80 mA cm−2, and FF of 44.3%, corresponding to a PCE of 2.49%. This performance is inferior to that of MBN. Therefore, we believe that the fluorine substituent on the endcapping unit can greatly affect the photovoltaic performance of organoboron electron acceptors. Fig. 5d shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the three devices. The EQE spectra show a broad photoresponse from 300 nm to about 900 nm. The Jsc value calculated from the integration of the EQE spectrum agrees well with the Jsc value obtained from the J–V scan within 10% error.

We investigated the active layer morphology of the three PSC devices using atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 6, among the three active layers, the PBDB-T:MBN-F2 blend shows the roughest surface. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of PBDB-T:MBN, PBDB-T:MBN-F1 and PBDB-T:MBN-F2 is 3.17 nm, 3.20 nm and 3.58 nm, respectively. In view of the poor photovoltaic performance of the PBDB-T:MBN-F2 blend, we speculate that large-size phase separation exists in the PBDB-T:MBN-F2 blend. The fluorine substituents at the endcapping unit greatly change the phase separation behaviors of the organoboron electron acceptor and lead to decreased PSC device efficiency. Although the fluorine substituents at the organboron center obviously increase the crystallinity of MBN-F1, they do not significantly change the phase separation morphology of MBN-F1 and do not greatly affect its PSC device performance.
The charge-transporting properties of the three active layers were studied by the space charge-limited-current (SCLC) method with the J–V curves of the hole-only and electron-only devices (Fig. S5). The device structures are ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:molecular acceptor/MoO3/Al (hole-only) and ITO/PEIE/PBDB-T:molecular acceptor/Ca/Al (electron-only). The hole mobilities of the active layers are 1.11 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for MBN, 1.07 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for MBN-F1 and 1.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for MBN-F2. The electron mobilities of the active layers are 1.88 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for MBN, 2.71 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for MBN-F1 and 2.40 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for MBN-F2. The lower electron mobility of the PBDB-T:MBN-F2 blend film may be attributed to the large-size phase separation. This is also in accordance with the low FF and low Jsc of the MBN-F2-based device. To gain insight to the charge-recombination behaviors of the PSC devices, we investigate the Jsc as a function of light intensity (P) (see Fig. S6). The results suggest that the MBN-F2-based device has more bimolecular charge recombination under short-circuit conditions than the other two devices. We also measure the dependence of photocurrent on the effective voltage of the three devices to estimate the charge carrier generation/collection efficiencies. The charge carrier generation/collection efficiencies of three devices are relatively low (<80%), indicating possible inefficient exciton dissociation.

In summary, we have systematically investigated the effect of fluorine substituents on opto-electronic properties, molecular stacking behaviors and photovoltaic performances of organoboron electron acceptors. Owing to the unique electronic structures of the organoboron electron acceptors, i.e., delocalized LUMO and localized HOMO, the fluorine substituents at the organoboron core unit lead to a downshifted HOMO level and blue-shifted absorption spectrum, while the fluorine substituents at the endcapping groups lead to a downshifted LUMO level and red-shifted absorption spectrum. In PSC devices, while the fluorine substituents at the organoboron core unit do not significantly affect the active layer morphology and the photovoltaic performance, the fluorine substituents at the endcapping groups result in large-size phase separation in the active layer and consequently decreased PCE. This work provides an effective strategy to rationally tune the opto-electronic properties and device behaviors of organoboron compounds.


All reactions were performed under an argon atmosphere. Commercially available solvents and reagents were used without further purification unless otherwise mentioned. Toluene and tetrahydrofuran were purified via standard methods. The compound MBN and compound 2b were synthesized in our previous work. Tris(4-fluorophenyl)borane was prepared according to the literature methods. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured with a Bruker AV-400 (400 MHz for 1H NMR and 13C NMR) spectrometer in CDCl3 at 25 °C. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm using CHCl3 (7.26 ppm) for 1H NMR, as well as using CHCl3 (77.16 ppm) for 13C NMR as an internal standard. Elemental analyses were carried out using a VarioEL elemental analyzer. Mass spectra were measured with a Bruker Daltonics Flex matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscope (MS). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurement was performed using a PerkinElmer 7 instrument in nitrogen flow at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured with a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a CHI660a electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode system consisting of a cylindrical platinum working electrode, platinum mesh counter electrode and Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. CV measurements of two molecules were carried out in the dichloromethane (0.3 mM) using n-Bu4NClO4 (0.1 M) as the electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The redox potentials were calibrated with ferrocene as an internal standard. LUMO and HOMO energy levels were calculated from the equations: ELUMO = −(Ered + 4.80) eV and EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.80) eV, where Ered and Eox are the onset potentials of reduction and oxidation processes, respectively. The grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) data were obtained using a Bruker D8 Discover reflector (Cu Kα, λ = 1.54056 Å) under 40 kV and 40 mA tube current, and the sample was prepared by drop-casting with chlorobenzene solution (10 mg mL−1) on a silicon substrate. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was recorded with a SPA300HV (Seiko Instruments, Inc., Japan) in tapping mode.
