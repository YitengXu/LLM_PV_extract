CuIn0.7Ga0.3S2 quantum dots (QDs) with particle size of 2–5 nm were directly synthesised by a vacuum one-pot-nanocasting process and homogeneously anchored on TiO2 nanocrystals (<50 nm) for the first time. We further present CuIn0.7Ga0.3S2 quantum dots and dye bilayer-sensitized solar cells with a power conversion efficiency 36.3% higher than mono-dye sensitized solar cells.

With increasing global energy consumption and environmental issues, the fabrication of low cost and high efficiency photovoltaic cells has attracted intense research interest in recent years. Ternary and quaternary compounds play a key role in the research of novel functional materials with high photoelectric properties and without toxic elements such as Cd, Pb, and Hg. Due to the relatively narrow band gaps and high absorption coefficients, chalcopyrite semiconductors show excellent photovoltaic performance in thin film solar cells. Furthermore, chalcopyrite semiconductors suffer from a large range of off-stoichiometries, such as CuIn5Se8, CuIn3Se5, Cu2In4Se7, without compromising their performance in optoelectronics as the result of forming deep trap states.

It is well known that the band gap of semiconductor nanocrystals can be optimized by changing their compositions or sizes, which makes them very attractive as sensitizers in quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSC). CuInS2 is an important representative which has achieved much development in synthesis methods and applications in QDSSC. In previous studies, CuInS2 quantum dots were often synthesized in organic solvent systems with long chains on the CuInS2 QDs, which decreased their photovoltaic performance. By substituting cations or anions with ions of the same oxidation state, CuInSSe and CuInGaSe2 can be synthesized.
A different type of approach implemented to expand the spectral response of the system is the co-sensitization of TiO2 photoanodes with both QD semiconductors and molecular dyes, which have complementary absorption profiles. Herein, we firstly report a facile approach for the synthesis of CuIn0.7Ga0.3S2 quantum dots directly and homogeneously anchored onto TiO2 nanocrystals (designated TiO2@CIGS) for quantum dot-dye bilayer-sensitized solar cells (QDBSC). CuIn0.7Ga0.3S2 QDs with particle size of 2–5 nm were attached onto the surface of TiO2 nanocrystals directly without any bifunctional linker molecules. Scheme S1 shows a schematic of the relative band energy levels for charge transfer in the FTO/TiO2/CIGS/N719 electrolyte. Due to the quantum confinement effect in the CuIn0.7Ga0.3S2 QDs, a higher conduction band edge drives the energetics of CuIn0.7Ga0.3S2 QDs to more favorable levels, for electron injection from photoexcited CuIn0.7Ga0.3S2 QDs into TiO2. More importantly, the TiO2@CIGS nanocrystals open the path toward high optical density DSSCs that cover a significant part of the solar spectrum.
A one-pot vacuum nanocasting process was proposed and is shown in Scheme S2. In step A, the as-prepared TiO2 nanocrystals sample was subjected to a vacuum to remove all of the air in the pores of TiO2 nanoparticles. In step B/C/D, the vacuum pump was switched off and the solution of InCl3–GaCl3 (1:1 molar ratio), CuCl2, and Na2S was allowed into the chamber containing TiO2 nanoparticles, respectively. The pore channels of the TiO2 nanoparticles under this transitory vacuum were therefore filled by the solution. Subsequently, the composites were separated and dried under 80 °C. Finally, the TiO2 with a quantum dots precursor in the pores was calcined in order to obtain CuInGaS2 quantum dots-loaded TiO2, with the CuInGaS2 nanoparticles anchored onto TiO2. To accomplish an efficient solar device, this synthetic route did not involve any long-chain ligands, which are important for electron injection into TiO2, thanks to a higher binding affinity for QDs and an improved carrier transport.
The low magnification TEM images of the synthesized TiO2 nanocrystals (Fig. 1a) and TiO2@CIGS composite nanoparticles (Fig. 1b and S1a) clearly show that the diameter of the prepared TiO2 particles was about 20–50 nm, and some very small particles could be found on the edge of the TiO2 in the TiO2@CIGS samples. A high resolution image in Fig. S1b, S1c and the image (Fig. 1c) of the highlighted square area in Fig. 1b show the quantum dots with homogeneous size (2–5 nm) and a well-defined lattice structure anchored uniformly on the TiO2 nanocrystals.

Fig. 1d is the energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) image of the sample TiO2@CuInGaS nanocrystals. It proves the existence of Cu, In, Ga, and S elements in the quantum dots, and the ratio of Cu/In/Ga/S is 1.07(±0.2):0.73(±0.1):0.27(±0.1):2.0. To further prove it, SEM–EDS elemental mapping was conducted and is shown in Fig. 2, we can conclude that the quantum dots are off-stoichiometry CuIn0.7Ga0.3S2.

Fig. 3 shows the XRD pattern of the TiO2@CIGS matched well with that of anatase TiO2 (I41/amd, JCPDS 73-1764) and CuIn0.7Ga0.3S2. However, the presence of a small portion of the chalcopyrite CuIn0.7Ga0.3S2 (tetragonal, Id) cannot be ruled out, corresponding to the (101) lattice plane of CuIn0.7Ga0.3S2 confirmed by HRTEM analyses (Fig. S1c). Note that, as no pattern was reported in the JCPDS database for this exact composition, a pattern was calculated for this phase by Liberato Manna. The XRD diffraction features of the TiO2@CuIn0.7Ga0.3S2 sample indicated a composite material of anatase TiO2 and chalcopyrite CuIn0.7Ga0.3S2.
The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of TiO2 nanoparticles and TiO2@CIGS are shown in Fig. 4 for comparison. Both the isotherms of TiO2 nanoparticles and TiO2@CIGS exhibit a type-H1 hysteresis loop, characteristic of mesoporous materials, with clear adsorption and desorption jumps at 0.6 and 0.9. The pore size distribution of TiO2@CIGS derived from the desorption branch using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method indicates an unaffected large mesopore size of 10 nm and a small mesopore size of 3.5 nm aggregated by quantum dots, but the specific BET surface area and the mesopore volume reduced by 59.8% and 48.8%, respectively (see Fig. 4 and Table S1), after loading of CIGS quantum dots, due to the small particle size (2–5 nm) and the large molecular weight of quantum dots. The BET surface area and the mesopore volume of TiO2@CIGS are 18.2 m2 g−1 and 0.084 cm3 g−1, respectively, which are enough for the high capacity enrichment of the N719 dye.

Fig. 5 shows the absorption spectra of the naked TiO2 film and the TiO2@CIGS film. The TiO2 film absorbs only UV light (wavelengths of <400 nm). After QDs sensitization, the absorption spectra of the TiO2 films extend to the visible light region. The absorption onset for TiO2@CIGS is approximately 550 nm. The optical absorption spectra of the TiO2@CIGS showed a corresponding red shift of the band edge as the QDs capped TiO2 NPs. Fig. S2 shows a plot of (Ahν)2versus hν (A = absorbance, h = Planck's constant, and ν = frequency), from which it is possible to extrapolate the slope near the absorption edge and extract the band gap energy. The fits yielded 2.06 eV for TiO2@CIGS. The band gap value is close to those reported for wurtzite C(IG)S nanocrystals, due to the density of state (DOS) of TiO2/QDs contributed by the surface states of QDs. A Bohr excitonic radius of 5.6 nm for CuIn0.7Ga0.3S2 QDs was calculated by the Bohr excitonic radius formula and the Brus formula. Due to quantum confinement, reducing the dimensions of QDs smaller than its exciton Bohr radius effectively widens its energy gap.
Co-sensitization with QDs or dyes has also been shown as an effective strategy for improvement. The contribution of the two absorbers to the overall cell performance is also evident in the I–V curves presented in Fig. 6. Comparing the bisensitizer nanoporous configuration (TiO2@CIGS/N719) with a monosensitizer cell (TiO2/N719 and TiO2@CIGS), we obtained a significant increase in all cell parameters. The short-circuit current density, Jsc, increased from 12.28 to 18.44 mA cm−2 (+50.2%), the open-circuit voltage, Voc, increased from 730 to 767 mV (+37 mV); however, the fill factor (FF) reduced from 0.62 to 0.53, due to electron recombination and larger Rsh which can be validated from the slope of the Jsc point in the J–V curve. Consequently, under operating conditions (1 sun illumination), the bisensitizer configuration improved the conversion efficiency from 5.51% to 7.51% (+36.3%), 215.5% higher than 2.38% of the QDs sensitized solar cell (TiO2@CIGS).
The higher efficiency of the TiO2@CIGS/N719 co-sensitized solar cell is mainly attributed to its broader light absorption. To further investigate the role of CuIn0.7Ga0.3S2, Fig. S3 shows the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra. In general, the trends of the IPCE spectra (Fig. S3) of the TiO2@CIGS/N719 co-sensitized solar cell and the TiO2/N719 dye-sensitized solar cell are consistent with that of UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 5).
It was shown that by the utilization of two sensitizing layers we were able to increase the optical density of our photoanodes. The energy of photons absorbed by the QDs can be transferred to a dye using Forester resonance energy transfer (FRET). In this manner, one can separate the actions of light harvesting and charge separation. The CuIn0.7Ga0.3S2 QDs on the TiO2 NPs could not only contribute to absorb more photons to generate more photoexcited electrons, but also form a uniform shell to reduce direct contact areas between the naked TiO2 surface and the electrolyte, consequently decreasing electrons recombination in the TiO2 to the hole-transport material of the electrolyte. As a consequence, improved solar cell performance can be achieved using a combination of a high-extinction-coefficient light-absorbing QD donor with an efficient electron-injecting acceptor dye molecule.
In conclusion, the TiO2@CIGS nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized by the vacuum one-pot-nanocasting process for the first time, in which the CuIn0.7Ga0.3S2 QDs (2–5 nm) homogeneously anchor on TiO2 nanoparticles (<50 nm) directly. The TiO2@CIGS nanoparticles are composites of anatase TiO2 and chalcopyrite CuIn0.7Ga0.3S2. The absorption onset for TiO2@CIGS is approximately 550 nm and the band gap value is 2.06 eV. The best device, fabricated with the TiO2@CIGS photoanode, shows a power conversion efficiency η of 7.51%. The proposed TiO2@CIGS synthesis method is more facile and costs less compared to other existing methods, and this strategy might be suitable for large-scale synthesis of nanomaterials for low-cost perovskite solar cells and layer-built solar cells.
