To explore high efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), two experimentally derived (single fence and double fence porphyrins) and two theoretically designed zinc porphyrin molecules with D–D–π–A–A configurations were studied. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory were employed to simulate these two experimental dyes and dye@TiO2 systems to understand why the double fence porphyrin molecule exhibits better photovoltaic performance than the single fence porphyrin molecule. For the short-circuit current (JSC), the various parameters that affected the experimental magnitude of JSC were analyzed from different aspects of absorption, charge transfer and chemical parameters as well as an electron injection process. The almost equal open-circuit voltages (VOC) in the experiment were predicted by theoretical VOC calculations. Our model predicted power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 1.993% and 10.866% for the single and double fence molecules, respectively, which are in accordance with the experimental values of 3.48% and 10.69%, respectively. In addition, one designed two new molecules based on the double fence porphyrin molecule with a 2-methyl-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (BTA) unit bearing one fluorine and two fluorine atoms as the guest acceptor, respectively. Compared to the original molecules, the engineered molecules significantly improved the photovoltaic parameters, JSC and VOC, thereby causing excellent PCEs. The most outstanding designed molecule reached a PCE of 12.155%, and is considered a candidate dye for high-efficiency DSSC. This study provides insights into the photoelectric properties of single and double fence porphyrins. It also demonstrated that the strong electron-withdrawing ability of fluorine atoms would enhance the photovoltaic performance and provide a guideline for the further design of double fence porphyrins.

The excessive use of traditional fossil fuels and severe environmental pollution has resulted in urgent demand for clean and renewable energy sources. Because solar energy is pollution-free and has no geographical restrictions, solar cells have become an alternative technology to solve this dilemma, in addition to other forms of renewable energy use. Solar cells are excited by light to generate electrons, and the directional movement of the charges forms an electric current. At present, high prices and the complex production process of conventional silicon-based solar cells limit their widespread application. Although thin-film solar cells, such as cadmium sulfide and cadmium telluride, have a lower cost than silicon-based solar cells and are easier to produce on a large scale, they can also cause severe pollution due to their inclusion of highly toxic materials. Alternatively, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted widespread interest because of their high efficiency, environmental friendliness and low costs.

The performance of the dye is the decisive factor that determines the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the DSSC, and thus the molecular design of a dye with higher efficiency is essential. Since Gratzel and O’Regan used an organic dye with a nanocrystalline porous electrode to design the first DSSC with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.1%, many studies have concentrated on developing the structures of dyes based on triphenylamine, porphyrin, carbazole, natural dyes and so on. Among them, dyes based on porphyrin rings have many advantages, such as inexpensive metal centers, adjustable optical properties and light stability, which have been widely used in the field of photoelectric materials. The basic porphyrin structure is a polyheterocyclic conjugated system composed of four pyrrole rings connected through four carbon atoms. There may be different substituents for the four pyrroles, and the four nitrogen atoms in the middle of the ring can also be combined with various metal atoms through covalent and coordination bonds. However, porphyrin molecules possess strong absorption at 200–400 nm (Soret band) and display only weak absorption in the near-infrared region at 600–800 nm (Q band). According to the sunlight spectrum character, sunlight has 50% of the radiant energy in the infrared area; therefore, improving sunlight utilization is essential for managing the performance of DSSCs.
Many studies have focused on developing and designing new structural dyes through donor groups, π-conjugated bridges and acceptor substituents. For example, Prakash et al. designed and synthesized various electron donor moieties on Zn porphyrin dyes to enhance their light-harvesting ability, with KP-Zn-PTZ reaching the highest PCE (5.48%). Wang et al. synthesized four molecules (LD4-OR4, LWT16, LWT18 and LWT27) and found that LWT16 and LWT18 resulted in a red-shift of the spectrum by changing the type and the structure of the donor, with their efficiencies reaching 9.45% and 10.30%, respectively. The π-conjugated bridge plays a significant role in broadening the absorption spectrum. Zou et al. used the N1 molecule as DSSCs and formed axial coordination with a porphyrin π bridge to increase the efficiency of the W64 molecule from 5.94% to 7.35%. Kurumisawa et al. fused an aromatic ring in a porphyrin to expand the π-conjugation, resulting in a red-shifted absorption and a PCE of 10.1%. An acceptor with strong electron-withdrawing ability can accelerate electron injection, which is a crucial means to improve photovoltaic performance. Palivela et al. designed three molecules (LG5, LG-tT and LG-DtT). By adding a strong electron-withdrawing acceptor, LG-tT and LG-DtT exhibited a red-shift at the Q band compared with LG5, proving the stronger light absorption capacity by molecular modification. Jie et al. designed three molecules TF-0F (no fluorine), TF-1F (one fluorine) and TF-2F (two fluorine) with a benzothiadiazole unit as the auxiliary acceptor. The fluorine atom possessed a strong electron-withdrawing ability, meaning that TH-2F had the largest PCE. Furthermore, the absorption spectrum can also be broadened through co-sensitization; for example, Ji et al. performed the co-sensitization of SGT-149 with an SGT-021 porphyrin dye, which exhibited a PCE of 14.2%.
Although significant experimental research has been carried out and achieved essential advancements, the theoretical study has also made progress in explaining the observed phenomena, and molecular design can guide the synthesis of experimental molecules. Heng et al. exchanged the guest acceptor and π-bridge positions of dyes through theoretical analysis, achieving 16% efficiency. Chen et al. designed four anchoring groups based on SM315, using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations, and found that porphyrin dyes that had hydantoin or barbituric acid anchoring groups exhibited an enhanced performance. Xie et al. used DFT and TD-DFT to simulate three types of porphyrin sensitizers that acceptor connected different positions (α, β and center axial), and found that the acceptor located at the α-position-type porphyrin could be used as an effective sensitizer. Arunkumar et al. designed and modified a π-linker (SP1–SP9) for the potential utility in DSSCs to achieve a highly efficiency.
Recently, Chen et al. synthesized a single fence molecule (Mjs2) and a double fence molecule (Bjs2) with the D–D–π–A–A structure. Through the study of their photoelectric properties, Mjs2 exhibited a short-circuit current (JSC) of 5.468 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.843 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.752 and a PCE efficiency (η) of 3.48% under AM 1.5G illumination. Bjs2 shows a better performance, with a JSC of 16.586 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.841 V, a FF of 0.759 and a η of 10.69%. However, there are still few theoretical models for systematic analysis and assessment of the two systems, and the micro-mechanisms for single and double fence structures need to be investigated in detail. Here, one performed DFT and TD-DFT calculations to study the geometric structure, energy gap, absorption spectrum, electron-donating and electron-withdrawing abilities, intramolecular charge transfer, electron injection and recombination to explain two originally experimental molecules, and reveal the reasons for the better performance of Bjs2. Based on Bjs2, the B-Dye1 and B-Dye2 molecules were then designed by introducing fluorine atoms into the guest acceptor to enhance the electronegativity of the BTA moiety. Finally, one proposed an evaluation model that provided an accurate description of the PCEs for the investigated molecules and these designed molecules. This study will be helpful for the development of efficient porphyrin sensitizers.

The calculations of the molecular ground states were performed by DFT, while the excited states were simulated using TD-DFT. The molecular ground-state structures were optimized with the B3LYP functional, with C, H, O, N and F calculated utilizing the 6-31G(d) basis set and the LANL2DZ basis set used for Zn. Additionally, the tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent was simulated using the conductor-like polarizable continuum model. To further reveal the properties of dye@TiO2 complex systems, one chooses (TiO2)9 to construct the dye@(TiO2)9 model (see Fig. S1, ESI); here, the two oxygen atoms are bonded to the same Ti atom, i.e., bidentate chelation, which can produce the relatively stable coupling mode. It has been demonstrated in previous work that (TiO2)9 was sufficient to reproduce electronic absorption spectra of dye@(TiO2) systems and was affordable within TD-DFT calculations for analyzing the photoelectric properties of dye@TiO2 systems. Based on the consideration of computing resources and effectiveness, the (TiO2)9 cluster was selected as the model of a semiconductor substrate for simulation of the TiO2 surface.

The ground-state optimizations of dye@TiO2 were carried out with B3LYP using the 6-31G(d) set for the C, H, O, N and F atoms and the LANL2DZ basis set for Zn and Ti atoms. Furthermore, the CAM-B3LYP functional provided an excellent description for simulating the charge-transfer excitation of molecules. The natural bond orbital (NBO) – 3.0.1 in Gaussian 09 was applied to obtain the ground state and excited state charges of donors, π bridges and acceptors, respectively. The electron-donating ability and the electron-withdrawing ability were analyzed by calculating the difference between the ground state and excited state charges of donors and acceptors. The partial density of states (PDOS) was computed to examine the contribution of each molecular part to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Besides, the number of electrons in TiO2 was analyzed by interfragmentary charge transfer (IFCT) and then obtained the VOC. The charge difference density (CDD) and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) images were implemented using the Multiwfn 3.6 program, and the electron injection time was studied by the Newns–Anderson model. Marcus theory was employed to obtain the electron injection and electron recombination rates. Finally, all the calculations were carried out using the Gauss 09 software package.

The structures of dye molecules are closely related to their photoelectron properties. For two dyes, bis(4-methoxyphenyl) amine (BPA) and anthracene acted as donors 1 and 2, respectively, and the Zn porphyrin with different dialkoxylphenyl groups served as the π bridge. 2-Methyl-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (BTA) with benzoic acid took the role of guest acceptor and host acceptor, respectively. Fig. 1 depicts the structures of the molecules, with their labels shown in Fig. S2 (ESI). The dihedral angles and distances between the donor, π bridge and acceptor are listed in Table S1 (ESI). As shown, the distortion of BPA of Bjs2 (80.2°) was more extensive than that of Mjs2 (34.4°), indicating that the double fence increased the distortion angle of donor 1. In the meantime, increasing the twist angle of BPA can inhibit the aggregation of molecules and affect charge transfer to some extent.

Anthracene plays the dual function of donating electrons and expanding the π bridge. The twist angle of Bjs2 was smaller than that of Mjs2, meaning that the addition of the double fence made the twist angle of anthracene smaller, which was conducive to the electron transmission from the BPA group. The angle between the phenoxy methyl group and the porphyrin ring was 65.9° for the double fence dye. Still, the phenoxy methyl group and the porphyrin ring were nearly perpendicular, and the angle was ∼90° in the single fence dye. The torsion angle of the guest acceptor (A (G)) was almost 0° for Mjs2 and Bjs2 molecules, and there is a twisted structure about 35.7° for Mjs2 and 31.9° for Bjs2 between the host acceptors (A (H)) and porphyrin ring of both molecules. The bond lengths of d1 and d4 were in the range of 1.4–1.5 Å, while the bond lengths of d2 and d3 were ∼4.05 Å. It was found that there was no significant difference between Mjs2 and Bjs2 through statistical bond length, indicating that the introduction of a double fence had no effect on the distance of each group and maintained the original molecular stability.

The energy gap shows the difference between HOMO and LUMO energy levels, which is closely related to light absorption. All schematic energy gaps (ΔH–L) of the investigated dyes and dye@TiO2 systems in the THF solvent are shown in Table 1. The ΔH–L values of the investigated dyes were found to be 1.908 eV (Mjs2) and 1.924 eV (Bjs2), consistent with the experimental trend of 1.770 eV (Mjs2) < 1.790 eV (Bjs2). When dyes were connected to the TiO2, their energy gaps became smaller than isolated molecules. It was evident that a red-shifted absorption band may appear due to a smaller energy gap. The order of the energy gap was Bjs2@TiO2 (1.361 eV) < Mjs2@TiO2 (1.364 eV) for dye@TiO2 systems; after the incorporation of TiO2, the energy gap of the double fence molecule was narrowed greatly compared with the single fence system.

To provide better insights into the HOMO and LUMO, the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) are depicted in Fig. 2. For the HOMO and LUMO, FMOs illustrated the HOMO of the dye molecule was the π orbital and was mainly composed of the donor unit and expanded to the π-bridge group. In contrast, the LUMO was a π* orbital and was primarily composed of the π bridge and acceptor position. It was observed that these dye molecules all exhibited the characteristics of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) during the HOMO to LUMO transition. After the TiO2 was attached, the HOMO was still distributed in the donor unit and the π-bridge group. In contrast, the LUMO was only distributed on TiO2, which was expected to improve the ICT characteristics effectively.
To explore the phenomenon more precisely, the total density of states (TOTAL DOS) in Fig. S3 (ESI) and the PDOS in Fig. S4 (ESI) showed quantitative information on the electron density of the dye donor (1, 2), π-bridge and acceptor (G, H). It was seen that the TOTAL DOS and PDOS were beneficial for analyzing the contribution of different parts of the molecule to the orbitals. For Mjs2, the electron cloud of the HOMO was mainly distributed on the BPA and anthracene units (69%) and the Zn porphyrin group (28%), and the BTA with benzoic acid positions had just 3%. In comparison, the electron cloud of the LUMO was mainly located on the π-bridge group (72%) and acceptor position (16%), while the donor unit was holding only 11%. Considering Bjs2, the electron cloud of the HOMO was mainly distributed on the BPA and anthracene (66%), the Zn-porphyrin group (30%) and the BTA with benzoic acid positions occupied just 3%. In the meantime, the LUMO's electron cloud was mainly distributed on the π-bridge group (71%) and acceptor position (17%), with the donor unit occupying only 12%. It was evident that the contribution of the BTA with benzoic acid groups to the LUMO for Bjs2 was slightly greater than that of Mjs2, suggesting that the double fence dye had slightly better charge transfer properties than the single fence dye.

An ideal spectrum shows that the molecules have a strong light absorption ability. To understand the light utilization of the two molecules initially, TD-DFT was employed to obtain the related parameters of S1–S8 states (in Table 2), which included the transition energy (E), oscillator intensity (f) and absorption peak (λmax), and simulated spectra are shown in Fig. 3. It is noteworthy that the two absorption peaks in the Soret band and Q bands calculated by TD-DFT were consistent with the experiment (see Table 2). As shown, the absorption peak at the Soret band was Bjs2 (432.21 nm) > Mjs2 (424.81 nm), and the absorption peak at the Q band was evaluated in the order of Mjs2 (657.51 nm) > Bjs2 (651.71 nm). It was apparent that the Bjs2 molecule had a red-shift spectrum relative to the Mjs2 at the Soret band and a blue-shift range at the Q band, consistent with the experimental conclusions. Therefore, the choice of CAM-B3LYP for TD-DFT simulations adequately reflected the excited-state properties of the dye molecules.

Table 2 shows that the two absorption peaks of the dye molecule both occurred in S1 and S4. For the Q band, the absorption peaks of the two molecules all appeared in the S1 state, which was mainly derived from the HOMO to LUMO transition and was a π–π* transition with a weak oscillator strength. In addition, the absorption peaks at the Soret band all occurred in the S4 state, and the two molecules were mainly derived from the HOMO−2 to LUMO+1 electron transition. Simultaneously, the Soret band exhibited an obvious charge transfer character and relatively strong oscillator strength. For the range of molecular absorption wavelengths, a strong absorption phenomenon occurred in the range from 400 to 900 nm. Apparently, the molar extinction coefficient of Bjs2 was greater than Mjs2 at 400–700 nm, indicating a stronger π–π* transition characteristic for the double fence system. Table S2 and Fig. S5 (ESI) illustrate the overall red-shift of the spectrum after the dye was connected to TiO2, which shows the improved light absorption efficiency.

It is necessary to explore the ionization potential (IP), electron affinity (EA), chemical hardness (h), electrophilicity (W) and electron-accepting power (W+) for qualitatively analyzing the electron-donating and accepting capabilities. In this case, NBO was applied to provide supporting evidence for the donating and accepting capabilities. In the present work, the parameters in Table 3 were obtained through the following equations:

A small IP meant that it was easier to lose electrons. It can be seen in Table 3 that the IP order was Bjs2 (4.353 eV) < Mjs2 (4.600 eV), which implied that the double fence molecule had a stronger ability for donating electrons than the single fence molecule. Simultaneously, the EA of the double fence molecule (2.870 eV) was lower than that of the single fence molecule (2.892 eV). Accordingly, the ability of the double fence molecule to prevent electron reflow was stronger than that of the single fence molecule, thereby reducing the possibility of recombination. For the reactive chemical parameters, the chemical hardness of Bjs2 (0.741 eV) was less than that of Mjs2 (0.854 eV). It was clear that the resistance of the single fence molecule was more extensive than that of the double fence molecule, which is adverse to the generation of photocurrent. Furthermore, the order of W and W+ was Bjs2 (8.795 and 7.082 eV, respectively) > Mjs2 (8.216 and 6.449 eV, respectively), indicating that the double fence molecule improved the electron receiving ability in unison. For the NBO analysis, one calculated the ground-state (S0) and excited-state (S1) charge distributions, which include the donors, π bridges and acceptors. According to Table 4, the increased positive charge in the BPA and anthracene after molecule excitation meant that the two moieties could be viewed as influential electron donors. The increased negative charge of the BTA with benzoic acid group testified that it was the powerful electron acceptor. Δq (D) took the order of Bjs2 (0.0275 e) > Mjs2 (0.0259 e), which also illustrated that the electron-donating capacity of BPA and anthracene for the double fence molecule was better than that of the single fence molecule.

The effective transfer of electrons from the donor to the acceptor upon excitation is crucial for photocurrent generation. Excellent ICT performance is conducive to the smooth transmission of electrons to promote the generation of photocurrents in the DSSC. Consequently, one used CDD and ICT parameters (Dct, t, Sr, H and Ec) to study the charge transfer characteristics and implemented the ICT parameters:

(6)
(7)
t = Dct − H
(8)
(9)
(10)
where
Dct is the charge transfer distance, DX, DY and DZ represent the distance in the three different primary directions, δele and δhole are the space distances between electrons and holes, respectively; t is applied to measure the degree of hole and electron separation, Ec is the Coulomb interaction energy, ρhole(r) and ρele(r) are the space charge distribution, r1 and r2 are the center of mass of the hole and electron, respectively, and Sr is the overlap condition.

Eight excited states were selected for the CDD analysis, where the green color in Fig. 4 represents the distribution of holes and the red color shows the distribution of electrons. From the CDD diagram, it can be seen that the electron density in the two dye molecular acceptors and TiO2 was higher than the hole density, indicating that the electrons can reach the BTA with benzoic acid and entered into TiO2. Except for the S2 state, the hole densities of the two dye donors were higher than the electron densities, indicating that BPA and anthracene supplied the electrons. For the S2 state, the BPA of Mjs2 and Bjs2 did not provide electrons, while the electrons in the acceptor and TiO2 were only provided by anthracene and the porphyrin ring. For the excited state S8 of the two molecules, the electrons are completely transferred from the dye molecules to TiO2. To sum up, it was noted that the electrons can be injected into TiO2, which was identified by CDD and FMOs analysis.
After that, the ICT-related parameters were computed to describe the charge transfer performance. The ideal ICT property meant that the dye could inject many more electrons into TiO2 more easily. As displayed in Fig. 5 and Table 5, the order of Dct was Bjs2@TiO2 (1.803 Å) > Mjs2@TiO2 (1.459 Å). Furthermore, a large Dct indicated the better charge separation distance in the double fence system. The H value was reduced in the sequence of Bjs2@TiO2 (5.667 Å) > Mjs2@TiO2 (5.512 Å). The larger H meant that the double fence molecule was beneficial for increasing the distribution of holes and electrons. Among the two molecules, the t values were estimated to follow the order of Bjs2@TiO2 (−3.861 Å) > Mjs2@TiO2 (−3.997 Å); this result was in agreement with the H parameter, suggesting that the double fence molecule had increased the degree of separation between holes and electrons. The Ec and Sr were raised in the order of Bjs2@TiO2 (2.334 eV and 0.764 Å) < Mjs2@TiO2 (2.504 eV and 0.795 Å), and it was apparent that the double fence molecule had good ICT properties owing to the smaller coulomb energy and the reduced overlap degree of charge. Therefore, Bjs2 had a large Dct, H and t and a small Ec and Sr compared with Mjs2. These parameters all indicated that the many electrons of the double fence molecule could be injected into TiO2 compared to the single fence molecule, which contributed to the ICT nature of the double fence molecule.

The light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), electron injection and excited-state lifetime are vital factors to evaluate molecular photoelectric properties and reflect the tendency of JSC. The electron injection driving force and electron injection time affect the electron injection efficiency. The electron injection time (Tinj) calculation was performed using the Newns–Anderson model to further evaluate the electron injection performance, which was obtained from the energy shift after the dye was adsorbed on the TiO2 of the adsorbate's LUMO semiconductor. As for the first excitation lifetime (τ1), the greater the τ1 is, the longer the molecule stays in the excited state, which causes a more significant photocurrent. The relevant equations are shown below:

LHE = 1 − 10−f
(11)
(12)
(13)
(14)
where
f is the oscillator strength of the first excited state, f1 is the oscillator strength and e1 is the excitation energy of the first excited state, Δ is the energetic broadening, εi is the orbital energy, pi is the absorbate part of each molecular orbital and ELUMO is the adsorbate's LUMO energy.

As shown in Table 6, the calculated LHE of Mjs2 was slightly higher than that of Bjs2, and they had the same trend after connecting TiO2 (see Table S3, ESI). Apart from the LHE, the electron injection driving force and electron injection time also affected JSC based on the principle of DSSCs. The parameters are given in Table 6 and Fig. 6. The greater electron injection efficiency was attributed to the greater ΔGinj and shorter Tinj. The trend of ΔGinj followed the order of Bjs2 (0.495 eV) > Mjs2 (0.462 eV), and the Tinj of Bjs2 (4.444 fs) was significantly shorter than that of Mjs2 (7.403 fs). Furthermore, the excited-state lifetimes of the two molecules for Mjs2 and Bjs2 were much longer than the electron injection time, which ensured the routine injection of electrons. Therefore, the electron injection driving force and electron injection time were decisive reasons that caused the different JSC in the experiment.

The best double fence molecule (Bjs2) from the experiment was selected to design two molecules (B-Dye1, B-Dye2) by replacing hydrogen atoms of the BTA moiety with one or two fluorine atoms. The improved global model evaluated the photoelectric performance, such as the VOC, JSC, FF and the corresponding PCE (η). Table S4 (ESI) describes that the distortion of the BPA group was slightly increased after introducing fluorine atoms in the BTA moiety. In addition, the distortion between the anthracene and porphyrin ring was decreased, and thus the two designed molecules may have smoother charge transport on account of better plane structure. The existence of fluorine atoms had little effect on the structure in the double fence moiety. For the region in the acceptor units, the angle of the designed molecules was almost not changed in comparison with the original Bjs2.

Energy gaps are shown in Table 1, which indicate that adding fluorine atoms in the BTA group led to a decrease in the value of ΔH–L. Especially, the decline of the B-Dye2 molecule was the most apparent (1.891 eV) by substituting two fluorine atoms, which may be conducive to the red-shift of the spectrum. For FMOs characteristics, it can be found in Fig. 2 that the HOMO was delocalized primarily on the BPA unit, while the LUMO provided a larger contribution to Zn-porphyrin and acceptor. The contribution of donors to the HOMO (see Fig. S4, ESI) in the designed molecules (67%, 71%) was increased relative to the original molecule Bjs2 (66%). In the meantime, the contribution of the BTA incorporated benzoic acid moiety to the LUMO was improved to some extent (20%, 20%) compared with the two original molecules (16%, 17%). In addition, the charge distribution of the investigated molecules had been further investigated by the analysis the charge contribution, as shown in Table S5 (ESI). The donor hole proportion of the designed molecules (12.83% for B-Dye1 and 15.52% for B-Dye2) and the acceptor electron proportion (11.64%, 11.70%) are much higher than those of the original Bjs2 molecule (hole: 11.80% and electron: 6.82%). The changing trend proved that substitution of fluorine atoms made a greater percentage of electrons transfer from BPA and anthracene units to acceptor fragments during photoexcitation. For the dye@TiO2 complexes, one studied the HOMO−2, HOMO−1, HOMO, LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2, as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S6 (ESI), respectively. The HOMO−2 of the four molecules were mainly distributed on the Zn-porphyrin, while the HOMO−1 and HOMO were primarily provided by the BPA and anthracene as well as Zn-porphyrin. For the LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 orbits, the four dye molecules were only delocalized in TiO2.
The ability of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing as well as the properties of ICT were also conducive to improving the efficiency of DSSC. The higher values of Δq (D) of the designed molecule clarified that the donor of the design molecules exhibited a superior ability for donating electrons compared with the experimental molecules (see Table 4). The trend was increased in the following order: B-Dye2 (0.0325 e) > B-Dye1 (0.0286 e), which demonstrated that introducing two fluorine atoms to the BTA moiety obviously enhanced the electron-donating ability of the BPA group. Moreover, the Δq (A) values of the designed molecules underwent a significant enhancement compared with the Bjs2 molecule, which heightened the electron-withdrawing ability of the BTA moiety, especially for the introduction of two fluorine atoms. Simultaneously, the larger W and W+ and smaller h of B-Dye2 also indicated that replacing two hydrogen atoms with two fluorine atoms can concurrently promote a prime enhancement of charge-transfer performance. From the analysis of Dct, H and t, it was found that the B-Dye2 molecule possessed the largest Dct (2.427 Å), H (6.363 Å) and t (−3.487 Å) value, as well as minimum Ec (2.231 eV) among all the investigated dyes, which supported the above discussion that the addition of two fluorine atoms on the BTA group significantly developed the ICT properties of porphyrin dyes.
The LHE and electron injection process also play an essential role in enhancing the DSSC efficiency. Table S6 (ESI) shows the excited properties of the two designed molecules. The oscillator strength in S1 for the designed molecules (B-Dye1 and B-Dye2) was stronger than that of the Bjs2 molecule, and its transition was mainly from the HOMO to LUMO with the probabilities of 0.61 (B-Dye1) and 0.60 (B-Dye2), respectively. It is profound that the two absorption peaks of the B-Dye1 molecule were at 433.34 nm and 653.56 nm, respectively. Similarly, the two absorption peaks of the B-Dye2 molecule were at 431.64 nm and 652.20 nm, respectively. When it comes to the Soret band, both B-Dye1 and B-Dye2 molecular spectrums had a red-shift relative to the original Bjs2 molecule. Furthermore, only the spectrum of B-Dye1 at the Q band had a certain red-shift absorption compared with the Bjs2 molecule. Note that the existence of fluorine atoms in the BTA group was beneficial to light absorption, and the two designed molecules had larger LHE than the Bjs2 molecule. For dye@TiO2 complexes, the bond length between the O atom and Ti atom of the designed molecules was from 2.061 to 2.080 Å, and the interaction energy range was within −12.46 and −15.23 kcal mol−1 (see Table S7, ESI), indicating the strong interaction between adsorbate and substrate. The CDD diagram of the designed molecular complexes (B-Dye1 and B-Dye2 dyes) showed that electrons were injected smoothly into TiO2, which is more evident than the Bjs2 molecule. Using the LUMOs and PDOS values of the complex, one calculated the electron injection time of the designed molecule in the framework of the Newns–Anderson model; electron injection time follows this trend: B-Dye2 (3.093 fs) < B-Dye1 (3.661 fs), meaning that the existence of fluorine atoms on the BTA moiety significantly reduced the Tinj, which led to a faster electron injection rate and is exactly conducive to photocurrent generation.

The JSC was determined using the following equation:

(15)
where LHE(
λ) represents the light absorption efficiency, Φinj is the electron injection efficiency, ηcoll is the charge collection efficiency, and IS(λ) is the photon flux. The maximum ideal short-circuit current can be obtained:

(16)
LHE (λ) = 1 − 10−Γσ(λ)
(17)
σ(λ) = ε(λ) × 103
(18)
where
Γ is the surface loading of sensitizers (mol cm−2) based on the experiment, and ε(λ) is the molar absorption coefficient. According to the above equations, the integral curve is shown in Fig. 7 and Table 7, which contained ideal short-circuit current (JmaxSC) data. When considering Φinj and ηcoll, the two efficiencies are defined as:

(19)
(20)
where
τinj is the required electron injection time of the dye to the TiO2, which is the inverse electron injection rate (Kinj) based on Marcus theory; τrelax is the relaxation lifetime from the experiment (10 ps), and τtrans is the electron transfer time from TiO2 to the redox couple (5 ps), and τrec is the attenuation time matched to the inverse of the recombination rate. Simultaneously, Marcus theory is employed to obtain Kinj as:

(21)
(22)
where Δ
G represents the driving force for electron injection (ΔGinj), and ΔG* is the activation energy for the reaction that depends on ΔG, and λtot is the total recombination energy, ℏ is Planck constant, and factor β is equal to 0.5, and absolute temperature T = 300 K, and kB is Boltzmann constant, and r is the electron injection distance (rinj) and the recombination distance (rrec) shown in Fig. S7 (ESI). The parameters are obtained using the following equations:

ΔGinj = ELUMO − ECBM
(23)
λh = (E0+ − E+) + (E0+ − E0)
(24)
λe = (E0− − E−) + (E0− − E0)
(25)
λtot = λh + λe
(26)
where
ELUMO is the LUMO energy of the dye, and ECBM is the conduction band minimum of TiO2, and E0 is the neutral molecule's energy in the ground state, and E+/E− is the energy of the cationic (anionic) optimized under the cationic (anionic) structure, and E0+/E0− is the cation (anion)'s energy with the geometry of the neutral molecule and E0+/E0− is the neutral's energy with the geometry of the cationic (anionic) state.

Based on the experimental loading capacity of Mjs2 and Bjs2, the ideal JmaxSC values were calculated to be 32.872 and 32.043 mA cm−2 (see Table 7), respectively. Compared with the original Bjs2 molecule, the ideal JmaxSC of the designed molecules rose to 32.591 mA cm−2 (B-Dye1) and 32.543 mA cm−2 (B-Dye2) due to the existence of fluorine atoms to the BTA moiety. The actual JSC includes many factors, therefore, one further modified the current parameters by considering injection and recombination. Here, the long electron recombination distance indicated that the ηcoll of all investigated molecules can be close to 1, and thus the value of electron injection efficiency is considered the main cause for the different JSC. Table 7 also shows the modified value of JSC, and it was found that for original molecules, the double fence Bjs2 exhibits a significantly higher JSC value of 13.458 mA cm−2, which is in agreement with the experiment (16.586 mA cm−2). Furthermore, there was an increasing trend of JSC for the design molecules, which is due to the increasing electron injection efficiency Φinj by means of the modification of molecular structure.

The VOC is obtained by the following equation:

(27)
where
ECB is the conduction band of TiO2, and e is the value per unit charge, and nc is the electron number at the conduction band of TiO2, and active density states in the conduction band of TiO2 (NCB = 7 × 1020 cm3) and Eredox is the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox potential in the experiment (−5.06 eV).

The VOC expressed the potential difference between the oxidation–reduction potential of the electrolyte and the quasi-Fermi level of electrons in TiO2. It was perceived that ΔECB was a key factor in determining the VOC, which can be obtained by calculating the PDOS of dye@TiO2. Depending upon the investigations of De Angelis, one calculated the ΔECB of these porphyrin dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 surface (see Fig. 8), and they are 0.093 eV (Mjs2), 0.091 eV (Bjs2), 0.092 eV (B-Dye1), and 0.090 eV (B-Dye2). In addition, the electron numbers of the CB of TiO2 (nc) that affected the VOC were calculated in the trend of 16.18 × 1016 cm−3 (Mjs2), 16.23 × 1016 cm−3 (Bjs2), 32.99 × 1016 cm−3 (B-Dye1) and 35.18 × 1016 cm−3 (B-Dye2). Based on the above parameters, VOC was calculated to be 0.924 V (Mjs2), 0.923 V (Bjs2), 0.954 V (B-Dye1) and 0.954 V (B-Dye2), as shown in Table 8. Accordingly, the experimental values of Mjs2 and Bjs2 molecules were consistent with the predictive values. It is noteworthy that the existence of fluorine atoms in the BTA moiety increased the electron injection, which led to a significant improvement in VOC.

The PCE (η) is the decisive factor for measuring the quality of a DSSC. Due to the various main parameters affecting η, one drew radar charts for the four dyes in Fig. 9 to estimate their levels of efficiency. Considering the JSC and VOC properties of solar cells, the global I–V model curves of the DSSC were derived, and the efficiency of the dye was accurately calculated by the following formulas:

(28)
(29)
(30)
(31)
where
IS represents the reverse saturation current, ImVm is the maximum power, and FF is the fill factor. Parameters were listed in Table 9, and I–V curves were plotted in Fig. 10. Table 9 shows there is a good agreement of tendency between the experiment and calculation for original molecules. For the four dyes, there is the following trend of η: B-Dye2 (12.155%) > B-Dye1 (11.791%) > Bjs2 (10.866%) > Mjs2 (1.993%). The efficiencies of double fence molecules (Bjs2, B-Dye1, B-Dye2) were much higher than the single fence molecule (Mjs2) due to the better intramolecular charge transfer characteristic, electron-donating and withdrawing ability, excellent chemical reaction parameters and short electron injection time in the double fence system. In addition, these parameters in the design molecules (B-Dye1, B-Dye2) show better properties than the original Bjs2 molecule, causing superior JSC and a certain increment in VOC. Thus, the final efficiencies of the design molecules (B-Dye1, B-Dye2) were promoted relative to the original Bjs2 molecule (see Table 9). Of the two design molecules (B-Dye1, B-Dye2), the B-Dye2 molecule incorporating two fluorine atoms in the BTA moiety obtained an excellent performance with a η value up to 12.155%.

Four kinds of D–D–π–A–A structural molecules and their dye@TiO2 have been investigated, and the electronic and optical properties related to JSC and VOC were comprehensive studied by DFT and TD-DFT methods. It was found that there are some distortions in the molecular structures, and larger distortions of the BPA group in the double fence molecule could prevent dye aggregation, and the minor distortion in the region of guest and host acceptors will make the electron transfer. The molecular spectra of the original molecules have two absorption bands. NBO analysis showed that the molecular donor of the double fence porphyrin more easily provided electrons compared with single fence porphyrin, and a larger Dct, H and t and smaller Ec and Sr means that intramolecular charge transfer was more likely to occur in the double fence molecule. The reduced chemical hardness, higher electronegativity and electron-accepting power can reflect efficient chemical parameters of the double fence porphyrin. The ICT and chemical parameter characters as well as faster electron injection process of the double fence porphyrin will lead to a higher experimental JSC. However, the similar VOC for single and double fence porphyrin molecules can be attributed to the little difference value of ΔECB. Furthermore, the influence of replacing fluorine atoms in the BTA moiety on performance was investigated, and it was found that the molecular modification will decrease the energy gaps, improve chemical parameters, and enhance electron-withdrawing ability. In the meantime, there were more electrons in TiO2 and a shorter electron injection time in the designed system, which subsequently caused the increased JSC and VOC. Through global evaluation, it was predicted that B-Dye1 (11.791%) and B-Dye2 (12.155%) dyes had higher PCE than the original Bjs2 molecule (10.866%). The replacement of fluorine atoms can effectively guide molecular design for the improved performance of double fence porphyrins.
