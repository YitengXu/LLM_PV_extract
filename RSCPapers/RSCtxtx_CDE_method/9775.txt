Dispersible cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoparticles are synthesized by a facile solvothermal reaction and are used for the first time as an electron transport layer (ETL) in inverted planar perovskite solar cells. The CdS ETL has superb electron extraction and transport properties, leading to a solar cell with light hysteresis and a high efficiency of 13.36%.

Nowadays, organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have come into focus in the photovoltaic field. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has reached a certified value of 22.1% from 3.8% in a short span of eight years. This rapid increase is attributed to their prominent characteristics such as a long charge carrier diffusion length, high absorption coefficient and open-circuit voltage. Additionally, low-cost production and environmental benignity also boosted the development of the PSC. In general, the architecture of PSCs can be assembled as normal or inverted structures, in which a light absorption layer (ABX3 and their mixed structures, A = CH2(NH2)2+ or CH3NH3+, B = Pb2+ or Sn2+, X = Cl−, Br− or I−), charge transport layer and electrode are included. In various PSC architectures, the inverted planar structure has distinct advantages due to its relatively low hysteresis behaviour and low temperature manufacturing processes, which are conducive to flexible device applications. Inverted PSCs have the configuration of conductive substrate/hole transporting layer/perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL)/metal electrode. For inverted PSCs, the research of ETL mainly concentrates on fullerene derivatives (PCBM). Although the fullerene derivatives have high electron mobility, PCBM is very sensitive to water, resulting in deterioration of the PSC device. In addition, PCBM is very expensive, hindering the actual application of PSCs.

Many n-type semiconductor materials have been applied to the ETL. For instance, TiO2, ZnO, SnO2 and Zn2SnO4 have been used as an electron transport layer in the normal structure of perovskite solar cells. However, these materials usually require high temperature annealing in practical application. This process will make the light absorption layer degrade quickly and destroy the integrity of the light absorption layer in the inverted structure, which then causes severe decay of the photoelectric properties and even no PCE output. Certainly, these materials can also be prepared by low temperature methods. However, the solvents of these low-temperature processed ETLs can damage the organic–inorganic halide perovskite film due to the instability of the amino groups in the PSCs.
To overcome the above problem, we developed dispersible cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoparticles as an electron transport material in inverted planar PSCs. The CdS can be dispersed in the non-polar solvent toluene to form a uniform solution, and cannot cause damage to the PSC device during processing, which is crucial to the performance of the PSC device. Indeed, electron transport materials should have both high electron mobility and stability of physicochemical properties. According to previous literature, the electron mobility of CdS is greater than that of TiO2, ZnO and SnO2. CdS has been used as an electron transport layer in normal PSCs and it should be able to be used in inverted PSCs. In this work, dispersible CdS nanoparticles are synthesized by a simple solvothermal method. Using the as-synthesized CdS as the electron transport layer in inverted planar PSCs, a PCE of 13.36% is achieved. Although the efficiency is temporarily lower than that of the inverted planar PSC based on PCBM (14.36%), it paves a novel way in the search for electronic transport materials.
CdS nanoparticles are synthesized by a facile solvothermal reaction. Fig. S1(a) (ESI) shows the XRD pattern of the as-synthesized CdS nanoparticles. The diffraction peaks of the sample are well-matched with the standard spectra of the CdS hawleyite structure (PDF# 10-0454), indicating the formation of pure CdS crystals. Three strong peaks at 26.50°, 43.96° and 52.13° correspond to the (111), (220) and (311) crystal planes of CdS. Fig. S1(b) (ESI) shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the as-synthesized CdS nanoparticles. The grain size of the as-synthesized CdS is about 6 nm, and the morphology of the particles is spherical or quasi-spherical. The selective area electron diffraction pattern [SAED, inserted in Fig. S1(b), ESI] indicates that the as-synthesized CdS possesses a polycrystalline structure. Fig. S1(c) (ESI) shows the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the as-synthesized CdS and it is obvious that CdS has an interplanar spacing of 0.336 nm, which is attributed to the (111) direction and consistent with the XRD analysis.
Fig. S2 (ESI) shows the top view FESEM images of the CdS deposited on a CH3NH3PbI3 film by spin-coating at speeds of 3000, 4000, 5000 and 6000 rpm, respectively. The CH3NH3PbI3 film can be well-covered by the CdS layer, as shown in Fig. S2(a)–(c) (ESI), and the CdS can form a continuous film, which is conducive to transporting the electrons from the CH3NH3PbI3 layer and hindering the hole contacting the top Au electrode. As shown in Fig. S2(d) (ESI), some of the perovskite cannot be well-covered by the CdS layer, which inhibits the transportation of the electrons from the perovskite. In Fig. S3 (ESI) it’s shown that the thickness of the CdS layer is 61 nm, 54 nm, 45 nm and 38 nm, corresponding to a spin-coating speed of 3000, 4000, 5000 and 6000 rpm, and samples CdS-3000, CdS-4000, CdS-5000 and CdS-6000, respectively.
Inverted planar perovskite solar cells with an architecture of FTO/Cu:NiOx/CH3NH3PbI3/CdS/Au based on CdS-3000, CdS-4000, CdS-5000, CdS-6000 and PCBM ETLs were fabricated, and their J–V curves were measured. The results are shown in Fig. 1(a) and Table 1. Obviously, the photovoltaic parameters of the device based on PCBM ETLs are better than those of the devices based on CdS ETLs. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) of PSCs depends on the value band (VB) of the ETL. Since the VB value of PCBM (−4.2 eV) is larger than that of CdS (−3.8 eV), the Voc of the device with the PCBM ETL (1.03 V) is larger than that of the CdS ETL (0.98–1.01 V). On the other hand, although the electron mobility of PCBM (6.1 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) is lower than that of CdS (4.66 cm2 V−1 s−1), PCBM has a more negative conduction band edge (−4.2 eV) and a smaller Rs (5.21 Ω cm2) than that of CdS (−3.8 eV and 5.96–7.94 Ω cm2), which is conducive to the injection of photogenerated electrons and the increased short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) for the device with the PCBM ETL. Thus, the PSC based on the PCBM ETL exhibits an optimal PCE of 14.36%, with a Jsc of 20.23 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.030 V and FF of 0.689.

Among the various CdS ETLs, CdS-5000 obtains the best performance with a PCE of 13.36% (Jsc = 19.74 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.012 V and FF = 0.668), while the PSCs based on CdS-3000, CdS-4000 and CdS-6000 ETLs exhibit PCE values of 11.34%, 12.06% and 12.4%, respectively. To a certain extent, the Jsc value increases following the increase of spin-coating speed and the Jsc reaches a maximum value of 19.73 mA cm−2 at the speed 5000 rpm. The variation tendency of Voc based on the CdS layer is consistent with the Jsc. The increase in speed can bring about the reduction of thickness of the CdS layer and thus results in a decrease in resistance which can accelerate the electron transport. However, a higher spin-coating speed leads to the incomplete coverage of the CdS layer on the CH3NH3PbI3 film, which caused electron loss at the interface between the CdS layer and CH3NH3PbI3 film and the decrease of Jsc. Therefore the efficiency of the device with CdS-6000 has a lower PCE than that of CdS-5000.
The IPCE spectra of the PSCs based on CdS-3000, CdS-4000, CdS-5000, CdS-6000 and PCBM ETLs are shown in Fig. 1(b). From the plots, the IPCE values of the PSCs reduce in the order of the devices based on PCBM, CdS-5000, CdS-6000, CdS-4000, and CdS-3000, which is in accordance with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves. The integrated Jsc of these five devices, calculated from IPCE data, is 18.73, 17.90, 17.53, 16.89 and 16.25 mA cm−2, respectively, which is slightly smaller than that of the J–V measurement because the Jsc from the IPCE is obtained in weak light. By holding a bias near the maximum power output point (0.81 V), we got a stabilized efficiency of 13.29% as shown in Fig. 1(c). It is very close to the PCE value extracted from the J–V curve. Fig. 1(d) shows the J–V curves of the PSC based on the CdS-5000 ETL with a forward and reverse scan, where the device displays a PCE of 13.36% in the reverse scan, and 12.12% in the forward scan, indicating a light hysteresis, which is attributed to ion migration, unbalanced carrier transport or ferroelectric effects within the perovskite absorber.

Fig. 2(a) shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the devices with architectures of FTO/ETL/perovskite. Quenching of perovskite emission is clearly observed from the intensity of the PL peak at 767 nm. The device with FTO/PCBM/perovskite shows more evident PL quenching in contrast to the others, which illustrates an efficient carrier extraction at the PCBM ETL/perovskite interface. Among the four kinds of FTO/CdS ETLs/perovskite, the FTO/CdS-5000 ETLs/perovskite shows the best ability of carrier extraction at the ETL/perovskite interface. This result indicates that the charge carrier extractions at interfaces are enhanced with the increase of spin-coating speed when the spin-coating speed is below 5000 rpm, and the reduction of the CdS thickness increases carrier extraction at the ETL/perovskite interface. But when the speed of spin-coating is larger than 5000 rpm, the rate of carrier extraction begins to decay, which may result from the uncovering of the CdS film on the perovskite.
The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of FTO/ETL/perovskite devices are shown in Fig. 2(b). The observed PL decays were fitted with two exponential decay curves to yield the lifetimes (τ) of excitons or carriers according to the one-dimensional diffusion model, and the results are listed in Table S1 (ESI). It can be seen that the PCBM ETL on perovskite shows the fastest average lifetime (τave) of 10.79 ns, which is due to its high electron mobility. Among the CdS films on perovskite, the CdS-5000 ETL obtains the shortest τave of 26.24 ns with a short first-order decay time (τ1) of 48.19 ns (amplitude A1 = 32.98%) and a shortest first-order decay time (τ2) of 15.44 ns (amplitude A2 = 67.02%), while the τave of the other three CdS ETLs are 55.19 ns, 43.77 ns and 36.28 ns, respectively. So it is obvious that the CdS-5000 ETL can more quickly extract and transport electrons from the perovskite layer than other CdS ETLs.
To investigate the air-stability of the devices, we measured the efficiencies of the PSCs as a function of storage time under ambient conditions (relative humidity 45% and temperature 25 °C). Fig. 3 shows the stability of PSC devices based on CdS-5000 and PCBM ETLs. Apparently, the device based on the CdS-5000 ETL is more stable than that with the PCBM ETL, which illustrates that replacing PCBM with CdS can improve the stability of the PSC device under ambient conditions. According to chemical principle, CdS has higher resistance to moisture and oxygen than PCBM, which results in better stability for the PSC with the CdS-5000 ETL than that for the PSC with the PCBM ETL.
In summary, CdS nanoparticles with a grain size of about 6 nm are synthesized by a facile solvothermal reaction, and the resultant product can be dispersed in toluene to form a uniform solution. The as-synthesized CdS is used for the first time as an ETL material in inverted planar PSC devices with a structure of FTO/Cu:NiOx/CH3NH3PbI3/CdS/Au. Photoelectrical characterization indicates that the CdS ETL has superb electron extraction and transport properties. When the thickness of the CdS ETL is optimized at about 45 nm, the inverted planar PSC achieves a PCE of 13.36%, which is comparable to that of the device based on a PCBM ETL (14.36%). Besides, the PSC with a CdS ETL shows a negligible hysteresis and better stability than that of the PSC assembled with a PCBM ETL. The present results provide a novel, low-cost, facile electron transport material for planar PSCs.
