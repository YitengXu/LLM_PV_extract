An efficient one-pot three-component domino coupling reaction of phenols, C60, and bromoalkanes was developed, resulting in the highly regioselective synthesis of 1,4-asymmetrical C60 bisadducts. The reaction utilizes KOtBu as a promoter and likely proceeds by an oxyanion/carbanion rearrangement/nucleophilic addition cascade. This new methodology is particularly effective for the synthesis of 1,4-asymmetrical C60 electron transport materials. Its utility is demonstrated by the synthesis of a new efficient 1,4-C60 ETM, which possesses better performance, easier synthesis, and a lower cost compared with the commercially available PCBM.

Fullerene derivatives have found widespread applications in chemistry, materials sciences, and biology. Specifically, the 1,4-asymmetrically modified [60]fullerene is a bisadduct of C60, possessing two different organic functional groups in a 1,4-relative regiochemistry on the fullerene core. Its unsymmetrical skeleton allows for increased absorption in the visible light region. Furthermore, the solubility and energy levels of 1,4-adducts of C60 could be tuned by varying the combinations of different organic addends. As a result, 1,4-asymmetrical [60]fullerene bisadducts show potential applications in organic photovoltaic devices. Earlier research in this field has been focused on using 1,4-[60]fullerene compounds as electron acceptor materials for polymeric solar cells. Recently, applications of [60]fullerene derivatives as electron-transporting materials (ETMs) in perovskite solar cells have become research hotspots. For example, our group previously reported the synthesis of 1,4-asymmetrical [60]fullerene bisadducts by two-step electrochemical benzylation of [60]fullerene-fused lactones, which exhibit good yields but suffer from relatively low regioselectivity. When applied as ETMs in perovskite solar cells, an inferior power conversion efficiency (PCE) was achieved (12.47%), which is lower than that based on 1,2-hydrofullerene (15.25%) and the most commonly used ETM, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). To the best of our knowledge, there is still a lack of a simple one-pot protocol for regioselectively synthesizing 1,4-asymmetrical [60]fullerene bisadducts affording better electron transport property in perovskite solar cells than PCBM.

Recently, the extensive study on metal salt-mediated or catalyzed fullerene reactions has revolutionized the synthesis of novel fullerene derivatives. Over the past three decades, many metal salt-catalyzed reactions were successfully applied in the synthesis of various 1,4-bisadducts of C60, exhibiting special properties. However, the one-pot selective synthesis of 1,4-bisadducts of C60 has been scarecely reported and appears formidably challenging. Stimulated by the favourable performance of potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu) in developing new fullerene functionalization methods, herein, an efficient one-pot three-component coupling reaction toward the selective synthesis of 1,4-asymmetrical [60]fullerene bisadducts was developed for the first time. The results reveal that the reaction of C60 with phenols and bromoalkanes show high regioselectivity at the C4-position of phenols as well as the 1,4-position on the C60. Furthermore, 1,4-bisadducts of C60 were applied as novel ETMs of perovskite solar cells, obtaining a high power conversion efficiency of 17.72%, which surpasses that based on the commonly used PCBM ETM.
Inspired by previous ongoing research interests devoted to the development of novel KOtBu-promoted derivatization reactions of C60, our research group envisioned that a straightforward approach for the synthesis of asymmetrical 1,4-C60 bisadducts could be realized through cascade carbanion and oxyanion nucleophilic reactions in the presence of phenol, C60, and bromoalkanes. Encouraged by our previous work in the synthesis of 1,2-(4-phenol)(hydro)[60]fullerenes, it was speculated that fullerephenol anion C could be generated from the nucleophilic attack of phenolic carbanion B to C60 (Scheme 1). Further deprotonation of C in the presence of excess base would lead to the formation of 1,2-fullerephenol dianion D. Intermediate D could then form 1,4-fullerephenol dianion Evia resonance, which is favorable for the nucleophilic attack to bromoalkanes due to steric hindrance. Finally, nucleophilic attack of the carbanion and oxyanion on E to bromoalkanes would lead to the formation of the 1,4-asymmetrical bisadduct F.
The reaction started by using the readily available phenol (1a) and benzyl bromide (2a) as the model substrates (see ESI, Table S11). After extensive screening, the optimal reaction conditions were established with the molar ratio of C60 : 1a : KOtBu : 2a to 1 : 2 : 5 : 10 and raising the reaction temperature to 150 °C in the second step. Diverse bromoalkanes can be used in the protocol as substrates, leading to different reaction products, as seen in Table 1. Methyl, methoxyl, and chlorine-substituted benzyl bromides can all efficiently react to afford the desired 1,4-asymmetrical C60 adducts 3ae–ag in 51–58% yields. Ethyl, methyl, and tert-butyl bromoacetate could also be employed and generate the desired 1,4-bisadducts 3ae–ag in good yields (45–52%). In addition, 2-bromoacetophenone, allyl bromide, and 3-bromopropyne are competent substrates for this reaction, furnishing the respective products 3ah–aj in moderate to good yields (43–51%).

a The reactions were performed with C60 (0.05 mmol), 1a (0.10 mmol, 2.0 equiv.), KOtBu (0.25 mmol, 5.0 equiv.), and 2 (0.5 mmol, 10.0 equiv.) in DMF (8 mL) in Schlenk flasks under Ar atmosphere for indicated time. Isolated yield by column chromatography.

Since fullerene derivatives should have high solubility to ensure ETM films with a thickness of tens of nanometers in perovskite solar cells, phenol benzyl bromide (2a) and ethyl bromoacetate (2e) were applied as the model substrates in the three-component reaction. As shown in Table 2, a wide array of functional groups on the phenol such as methyl (3ba–be), tert-butyl (3ca–ce), methoxyl (3da–de), phenyl (3ea–ee), and halogen groups such as chloro (3fa–fe), were tolerated well under the optimized conditions. Noteworthy, a series of 2,6-disubstituted phenols were also compatible with the reaction conditions, affording the desired products 3ga–ge, 3ha–he, 3ia–ie, and 3ja–je in moderate yields.

a The reactions were performed with C60 (0.05 mmol), 1 (0.10 mmol, 2.0 equiv.), KOtBu (0.25 mmol, 5.0 equiv.), and 2 (0.5 mmol, 10.0 equiv.) in DMF (8 mL) in Schlenk flasks under Ar atmosphere for indicated time.

The chemical structures of 3aa–je were unambiguously characterized by MALDI-TOF MS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and UV-vis spectroscopy (see ESI). All of the mass spectra of these products displayed the expected molecular ion peaks and their 1H NMR spectra exhibited the expected signals. Consistent with the C1 symmetry of the 1,4-asymmetrically modified structure of C60, the 13C NMR spectra of 3aa–je showed more than 50 peaks for the 58 sp2-carbon atoms in the range of 136–158 ppm, and two sp3-carbon atom peaks between 54–70 ppm. The UV-vis spectra of 3aa–je had a broad absorption peak at ca. 449 nm, which is similar to the other 1,4-adducts of C60. As shown in Table 2, the structure of 3ia was unequivocally confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.
Subsequently, the application of the newly developed asymmetrical 1,4-C60 bisadducts as novel ETMs in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) was explored. Planar p–i–n-type PSCs with the configuration of FTO/NiOx/MAPbI3/ETM/BCP/Ag were fabricated to evaluate their electron-transport properties (Fig. 1a). For comparison, control devices based on PCBM ETM were also fabricated. Early tests showed that diester modified 1,4-C60 ETMs have better performances than benzyl substituted 1,4-ETMs. For example, the PCE of the device based on product 3ae as ETM was 14.11%. This is presumably due to their higher solubility and better film-forming properties contributed by the ester groups. Subsequent screening of a series of phenol-substituted diester modified 1,4-C60 ETMs revealed that o-methoxyphenol and diester modified 1,4-C60 adduct 3de was an effective ETM. In particular, a highest PCE (17.72%) than that obtained by PCBM (16.22%) was achieved for the device based on 3de as ETM (see Fig. 1b). As shown in Table 3, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the 3de-based device (1.081 V) increased by 46 mV relative to that of the PCBM-based device (1.035 V). Moreover, the short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) of the 3de-based device also increased from 20.94 mA cm−2 to 21.11 mA cm−2, and 74.7% to 77.6% compared with the PCBM-based device. Therefore, 1,4-C60 compound 3de exhibits superior electron transport properties in planar perovskite solar cells, even more efficiently than PCBM. It is hypothsized that this was because of the involvement of an additional ester group and the methoxy group in 3de, which reinforced the interaction of the fullerene derivative with MAPbI3 perovskite. We carried out the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements for the devices based on different ETLs (Fig. 1c). Integrated current density and Jsc coincide well, confirming the reliability of Jsc. The J–V curves in different scan directions were also measured to examine the hysteresis of J–V curves(see ESI, Fig. S8 and Table S9). Similar to the case of PCBM ETL, no obvious hysteresis of J–V curves is observed for devices based on 3de. These results confirm the suitability of 3de as potentially commercial ETL.

We investigated the electron mobility (μe) of the PCBM, 3ae and 3de-based devices via SCLC method (Fig. 1d). The PCBM-based device exhibits a μe value of 9.41 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 3de-based device has higher μe value of 1.46 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3ae-based device has lower μe value of 5.85 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (see ESI, Table S10). The difference of μe value can explain the discrepancy of devices performance. Then we compared the uniformity and roughness of MAPbI3/fullerene derivative films by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode (see ESI, Fig. S10). After depositing the PCBM, 3ae and 3de layer, the MAPbI3/fullerene derivative films all looks more compact with a dramatic decrease of the RMS roughness from 13.21 nm to 2.85, 2.94, and 3.02 nm for PCBM, 3ae and 3de respectively. The morphological change does not seem to be a major factor responsible for their difference in the ETL performance.
After proving the effectiveness of 3de, the presented method was readily scaled up (see ESI, Scheme S1). The reaction of C60 (0.72 g, 1 mmol) under identical conditions afforded the corresponding product 3de in 52% yield, demonstrating that the efficiency of the present protocol remains high at a large scale. It should be noted that this potassium salt promoted one-pot synthesis of 3de is relatively easy to operate and cost-effective compared to the preparation of PCBM, which requires the pre-synthesis of a diazo compound from 4-benzoylbutyric acid in three steps.
In summary, an efficient one-pot three-component domino coupling reaction of phenols, C60, and bromoalkanes under transition-metal free conditions was developed, resulting in the high regioselective synthesis of 1,4-asymmetrical C60 bisadducts. This protocol provides an operationally simple and scalable strategy for the synthesis of 1,4-asymmetrical C60 electron-transport materials in perovskite solar cells. Moreover, a new efficient 1,4-C60 ETM has been fabricated and analyzed, which possesses better performance, easier synthesis, and a lower cost compared with the commercially available PCBM. The simplicity and broad applicability of this one-pot approach has great potential in the regiocontrolled synthesis of novel fullerene derivatives towards photovoltaic applications.
