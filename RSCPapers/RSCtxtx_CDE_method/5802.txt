Development of green and low-cost interfacial materials is an important issue to promote the commercialization of polymer solar cells (PSC). In this study, a derivative of natural chlorophyll, called chlorophyllin (CuCN), is applied as a cathode interfacial layer (CIL) to effectively improve the charge-carrier transportation and collection of both fullerene and non-fullerene based PSCs. As a result, the high power conversion efficiency of 8.35% and 10.55% is achieved for fullerene PTB7:PC71BM-based devices and non-fullerene PBDB-T:IT-M-based devices, respectively. Notably, the natural chlorophyllin is a green food additive with low cost and solution-processability. This study demonstrates that the environment-friendly chlorophyllin is a promising CIL material to fabricate highly efficient solution-processed PSCs with a large area and low cost.

Bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted huge attention due to the great advantages of light weight, ease of fabrication, low cost and high flexibility. In recent years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction PSCs has been improved by over 11% via material designing, device optimization and interface engineering. In general, PSCs are usually composed of active layer blending conjugated-polymer donor with an electron acceptor, sandwiched by two cathode and anode interfacial layers, in which cathode interfacial layers (CILs) play a very important role for charge carrier transport and collection. For example, Ca metal is one of the most popular CILs in the conventional PSC devices. However, the low function metal (i.e., Ca) is highly chemically active in the ambient atmosphere and also requires ultra-high vacuum thermal deposition, which restricts its sustainable development in large-area and low-cost organic photovoltaics.

Numerous cathode interfacial materials (CIMs) such as metal oxides/fluorides, organic and polymeric electrolytes have been used as CILs instead of Ca for boosting the performance of PSC devices. Among the CILs, alcohol/water soluble materials have drawn increasing interest because they can be dissolved in green solvents, which are vital for commercial application and can provide orthogonal solubility during the multilayer PSCs fabrication. Recently, organic small molecular CIMs are raising wide attention because of their potential superiority with features such as a fully-defined framework, facile purification and better batch-to-batch reproducibility. Moreover, certain typical small molecular CIMs such as electrolytes, zwitterions and perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives have been employed to integrate PSCs as a CIL. It is found that the PCE of the devices is comparable to that of the devices with Ca/Al, and the PSC devices are easily reproducible, demonstrating a promising application in the field of organic optoelectronics. However, most above-mentioned CILs contain complicated conjugated units, demanding difficult chemical synthetic procedures, which limit their commercial application in cost-effective fabrication of PSCs. The investigation of existing cheap and green CIMs from nature is another promising avenue to promote the commercialization of PSCs.
Herein, we report a derivative of natural chlorophyll called chlorophyllin (CuCN), which is employed as CILs for both fullerene and non-fullerene based PSCs. CuCN can act with the sun light for oxygenic photosynthesis of plants and is also a natural compound existing in the plant leaves. It differs from most alcohol/water soluble materials reported in literature in that it is environment-friendly by itself. On the basis of natural CuCN, we fabricated two types of PSC devices with PTB7:PC71BM and PBDB-T:IT-M. The results demonstrate that our devices with PTB7:PC71BM and PBDB-T:IT-M show an inspiring PCE of 8.35% and 10.55%, respectively, which is superior to that of both the control devices with either Ca/Al or poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)pr-opyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN)/Al. For the first time, the study demonstrates that natural CuCN has great potential in the preparation of highly efficient polymer solar cells as a low-cost and green CIL.

PTB7 and PC71BM were purchased from 1-Material Inc. PBDB-T and IT-M were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. CuCN was purchased from J&K Chemicals Inc. and its purity is 98%. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083) was obtained from Heraeus, Germany.


The device architecture of the PSCs is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active layer/CIL/Al (Scheme 1). Fig. S1 shows all the chemical structures of materials, i.e., PTB7, PBDB-T, PC71BM, IT-M and CuCN. The indium-doped tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass (square resistance: 15 Ω per square) was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, and then dried in a nitrogen stream, followed by UV-ozone treatment for 30 min. Then, PEDOT:PSS solutions (Clevios PVP AI 4083) were spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 60 s, followed by annealing at 130 °C for 20 min. The total concentration of PTB7:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) and PBDB-T:IT-M (1:1, w/w) in chlorobenzene (CB) was 25 and 20 mg ml−1, respectively. The thickness of the active layers is about 100 nm. Subsequently, CuCN dissolved in methanol was spin-coated onto the blend layers. Via changing the concentrations of CuCN solutions, the thickness of CuCN layers can be precisely tuned. Finally, the Al electrode (100 nm) was deposited through a shadow mask (defined active area of 0.04 cm2) by thermal evaporation in a vacuum chamber with a base pressure of 2 × 10−5 mbar.


The surface images and roughness were measured using an atomic force microscope (AFM, VEECO Dimension 3100 V). The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were conducted by a ULTRADLD UPS/XPS system (Kratos analytical, Manchester, U.K.) and the UV-visible absorption spectra were obtained using Perkin-Elmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer.

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSC devices without encapsulation was measured under simulated solar light (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), provided by a Newport-Oriel® Sol3A 450 W solar simulator and calibrated by a standard Si photodiode detector (PV measurements Inc.) in a N2-filled glove box. The device parameters were recorded using Keithley 2440 Source Measure Unit. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were recorded using a Newport-Oriel® IQE 200™ measurement system. The thickness of the films was analyzed by using a surface profiler (Dektak 150).

The UV-visible absorption spectra of both PTB7:PC71BM and PBDB-T:IT-M layers with and without CuCN are shown in Fig. 1. Clearly, the CuCN film has a weak absorption in the visible light region of 400–800 nm, which is also consistent with the high transparency as shown in Fig. S2. Compared with the methanol-treated PTB7:PC71BM film, the film modified by CuCN exhibits an almost identical curve in the visible light region of 400–800 nm, which indicates that the CuCN film has a weak absorption in this region, similar to the PBDB-T:IT-M film. Moreover, the optical band gap of CuCN is calculated to be 3.26 eV according to its absorption spectrum (Fig. 1). The energy level of CuCN was obtained by using the data from the absorption spectrum and the ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (Fig. S3). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is found to be −5.62 and −2.36 eV, respectively. The energy levels of CuCN and other materials are shown in Fig. S4. Clearly, the existence of CuCN can effectively prevent the active layer from eroding the electrode, and to a certain extent, it benefits the charge-carrier transportation, thus minimizing the quenching of the charge-carriers in active layers and at the interface of the active layer/cathode.

To illustrate the role of the CuCN on device performance, we fabricated four PSC devices, in each of which the Al cathodes were modified by MeOH, MeOH/Ca, PFN and CuCN. The CuCN is dissolved completely in methanol and deposited on the active layers to form a super-thin film (5 nm thickness). Fig. 2 presents the J–V curves of the devices. It presents that the PSCs with the CuCN layer exhibit the higher PCE up to 8.35% with the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.76 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 14.72 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 74.58%. However, the devices with CH3OH/Al exhibit a much lower PCE of 5.58% with the Voc of 0.64 V, Jsc of 14.12 mA cm−2 and FF of 61.49%. The device with Ca/Al cathode presents a PCE of 7.46% with Voc of 0.74 V, Jsc of 14.21 mA cm−2 and FF of 70.31%, which is comparable to the results reported in the literature. Clearly, the PCE of the PSCs with CuCN/Al is 1.5 times that of the devices with Al cathodes, and is higher than that of the devices with Ca/Al by 12%, demonstrating a promising interfacial material for fabricating highly efficient PSCs. All the performance parameters are summarized in Table 1.

In order to verify the compatibility of the natural CuCN, a non-fullerene PBDB-T:IT-M blend was selected as the active layer for fabricating the PSC devices with CuCN as CIL. As displayed in Fig. 3, using the optimized CuCN CIL with 5 nm thicknesses, the high-performance non-fullerene devices were achieved with Voc of 0.93 V, Jsc of 16.69 mA cm−2 and FF of 67.91%, leading to an outstanding PCE of up to 10.55%. The PCE of CuCN-based devices (10.55%) are 1.72 times that of the bare methanol-based devices (6.13%). In addition, the PCE of CuCN-based devices are also higher than that of the Ca-based devices (9.47%) and (9.93%). As illustrated in Table 1, as compared to the control devices with Ca/Al, our as-fabricated devices with CuCN/Al exhibit a significant enhancement in PCE, which is attributed to the significant increase in Jsc and FF caused by the introduction of the effective CIL CuCN.
Moreover, to further explore the potential mechanism of improved Jsc and FF, the dark J–V characteristics of all the devices were investigated (Fig. 2b and 3b). Evidently, both the fullerene-based and non-fullerene based devices with CuCN exhibit a lower reverse leakage current and a better diode effect than the other devices.
The electron mobility (μe) and the hole mobility (μh) are key factors that can determine the performance of devices. Herein, the space charge limited current (SCLC) method was employed to calculate the electron mobility of the electron-only devices with device architectures of ITO/Al/Active layer/CIL/Al and the hole mobility with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active layer/CILs/MoO3/Al. Fig. 4 shows the electric field dependence of the current of the electron-only devices. The μe and μh of both the fullerene and non-fullerene devices was calculated by fitting the Mott–Gurney square law,
where
ε0 is the dielectric constant of free space (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1), εr is the relative dielectric constant of the BHJ systems (∼3 for conjugated polymers), and L is the thickness of the blend layer in PSCs. The μe of CuCN-based devices is calculated to be 4.86 × 10−3 for PBDB-T:IT-M devices and 6.59 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PTB7:PC71BM devices, which is much higher than Ca-based devices with μe of 9.82 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDB-T:IT-M and 1.37 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PTB7:PC71BM devices. Similarly, the μh of CuCN-based devices is calculated to be 1.03 × 10−3 for PBDB-T:IT-M device and 1.37 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PTB7:PC71BM device, which is higher than Ca-based devices with μh of 1.31 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDB-T:IT-M, and 1.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PTB7:PC71BM devices. Clearly, the devices with CuCN as CIL exhibit a more balanced charge mobility, which can increase the Jsc and FF in the devices, indicating that the CuCN interlayer can effectively reduce the charge transport barrier and recombination.

Atomic force microscopy was employed to thoroughly investigate the effect of CuCN on the morphology of the blended active layers. The height images and the three-dimensional (3D) surface plot are illustrated in Fig. 5. Clearly, both pristine films display a relatively glossy surface, and the root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of PBDB-T:IT-M and PTB7:PC71BM films is 1.91 and 1.51 nm, respectively; both the films coated by CuCN layer showed a slightly increased RMS of 2.04 and 1.66 nm, respectively. Based on these results, we can clearly observe that films coated with CuCN maintain similar homogeneous morphologies without apparent surface reconstruction, suggesting that the natural interfacial material possesses uniform film forming performance, which is also favorable for an effective transportation of charge-carriers. Thus, the non-fullerene and fullerene based devices with CuCN/Al cathodes possess an inspiring PCE up to 10.55% and 8.35%, respectively, which is superior to the common devices with Ca/Al or PFN/Al cathodes.

In summary, we demonstrated a natural and environment-friendly CIL of CuCN that can largely enhance the PCE of PSCs, including the fullerene and non-fullerene devices. Both the devices with CuCN modified Al cathodes displayed a desirable PCE (8.35% for fullerene devices and 10.55% for non-fullerene devices), which is higher than the common devices with Ca/Al and PFN/Al cathodes. This is mostly attributed to the positive effects of CuCN that lead to high electron mobility, and the better phase-separation morphology of blend layers induced by CuCN solutions. Our opens opens a new avenue to investigate green, low-cost and efficient interfacial materials from nature, which are of great potential to promote the commercialization of PSCs.
