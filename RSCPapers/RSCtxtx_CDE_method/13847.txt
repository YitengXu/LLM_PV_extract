A series of novel A3B and A2B2 thiaporphyrins consisting of mono or dual anchoring groups with different linkers has been synthesized and effectively applied in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The presence of an ethynylphenyl linker has a pronounced effect on their optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties. The ethynylphenyl linker bathochromically shifted the absorption spectra. Density functional theory (DFT) studies revealed that attachment of an ethynylphenyl linker through one of the meso positions to the porphyrin core results in planar macrocycles which is essential for the active electron coupling of the porphyrin core with the anchoring group in DSSCs. Although the dual anchoring groups can bind strongly to the TiO2 surface, the presence of the ethynylphenyl linker and especially the electron withdrawing cyano group on the anchoring group proved to be the pivotal factors to achieve higher efficiency. Among these dyes, N3S-ECN, having an ethynylphenyl linker and a cyano acrylic acid as the anchor, achieved the highest efficiency of 1.69%, with Jsc = 5.12 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.49 V and ff = 67%. To the best of our knowledge this is the highest efficiency obtained for thiaporphyrins.

Developing renewable energy resources to replace depleting fossil fuel reserves is the biggest challenge for civilization. Since the pioneering work from Grätzel et al. in 1991, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been an obvious choice over conventional silicon solar cells owing to their affordable production cost, easy fabrication and relatively high solar to current conversion efficiencies. DSSCs assembled with ruthenium complexes as sensitizers gave excellent performance with efficiencies of 11%. Although ruthenium dyes feature advantages like broad absorption, suitable energy levels and higher efficiencies, the drawbacks of moderate extinction coefficients, restricted availability, and higher purification cost hamper their practical application. Nature utilizes chlorophyll in plants as an antenna to harvest light for solar energy conversion in photosynthesis. Some porphyrins, regarded as artificial chlorophylls, have gained huge attention in recent years due to their strong absorption in the visible region, high absorption coefficients, better thermal and photo-stability and appropriate energy levels. Moreover their optical and electrochemical properties can be fine-tuned through varying the substituents on the four meso and eight β-positions. A glimpse of the better performance of porphyrins was displayed in 2007, when Officer et al. reported β-substituted zinc porphyrins with 7.1% efficiency. This result was further bettered in 2010, with a meso-linked zinc porphyrin with a push–pull framework with 11% solar conversion efficiency. In 2011, Yella et al. reported a Zn(II) porphyrin having long alkoxyl chains to wrap the porphyrin core to suppress the aggregation with a D–π–A structure showing a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 12.3% when combined with an organic dye in a Co(II/III) tris(bipyridyl)-based redox electrolyte under standard AM1.5G simulated sunlight. An extensive literature survey on porphyrin sensitized solar cells revealed that the design of the sensitizers is restricted to the regular free-base or zinc porphyrins. From the above mentioned examples of regular porphyrin sensitizers, it is estimated that a near-infrared (NIR) absorption and panchromatic spectral character might enhance the solar to current conversion efficiency of DSSCs. The bathochromic absorption enhancement is achieved through the extension of π conjugation of these regular porphyrins either by substitutions on the meso- and β-positions or fusion with aromatic chromophores.

Modification of the porphyrin core by replacing one or more of the pyrrolic nitrogens in the porphyrin ring with heteroatoms like oxygen, sulphur, selenium and tellurium is an alternative and effective approach to adjust the photophysical properties of porphyrins. This core alteration induces interesting variations in the photophysical properties of porphyrins without affecting the aromaticity of the macrocycle. Based on these improved optical properties, core-modified porphyrins have been widely used as complexation agents for metal ions in unusual oxidation states and as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy. A variety of mono-functionalized thiaporphyrins have been reported in the literature, but the synthesis of carboxyl functionalized thiaporphyrins is quite rare. Although these thiaporphyrins possess interesting optical properties, surprisingly their use in DSSCs is very uncommon. Following our interest in thiaporphyrins and their metal complexes, we have recently shown that these heteroporphyrins can be successfully applied as sensitizers in DSSCs. Thiaporphyrin N3S-ECA, with an ethynylphenyl linker at a meso position and a carboxylic acid as the terminal anchoring group, gave very low efficiency with an iodine/triiodide redox electrolyte. As an attempt to improve the properties of thiaporphyrin-based DSSCs, we explored some possibilities for structural modification of the meso substituents of thiaporphyrin in order to obtain higher light harvesting efficiency (LHE) in the NIR region.
In this report, we designed and synthesized novel A3B thiaporphyrins as shown in Scheme 1, with (N3S-ECA) or without (N3S-CA) an ethynylphenyl linker, along with using either simply a carboxylic acid or cyanoacrylic acid (N3S-ECN) as the anchoring group. Also, A2B2 thiaporphyrins possessing two carboxylic acid anchors on cis-positions in conjunction with donors like 3,4,5-trimethoxy (N3S-2AOMe), tolyl (N3S-2ATol) and triphenylamine (N3S-2ATPA) were prepared for comparison. The effect of one anchor versus two anchors as well as the effect of an ethynylphenyl linker and the electron withdrawing cyano group on the photophysical properties of the thiaporphyrins are studied. A systematic study, well supported by optical spectroscopy, CV measurements, DFT calculations, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), and photovoltaic measurements revealed the marked significance of the ethynylphenyl linker and the electron-withdrawing cyano group to the overall photon conversion efficiencies.

The A3B thiaporphyrin dyes were synthesized according to the stepwise synthetic protocol depicted in Scheme 2. The synthesis of N3S-ECA has been reported previously.N3S-ECN was prepared from N3S-Br (1) and 4-ethynylbenzaldehyde through Sonogashira coupling in the presence of a palladium catalyst. Compound (2) was further condensed with cyanoacetic acid following a Knoevenagel protocol to obtain N3S-ECN. The presence of an acrylic proton in the downfield region at 8.39 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum of N3S-ECN confirmed the formation of the cyano derivative. The presence of the cyano group is further confirmed by the presence of a CN stretching frequency around 2224 cm−1 in the IR spectrum. In order to obtain N3S-CA, thiophene was treated with p-tolualdehyde and methyl 4-formylbenzoate in presence of n-BuLi to get the unsymmetrical diol (3) as shown in Scheme 2. The mixed condensation of this unsymmetrical diol (3) with p-tolualdehyde and pyrrole in the presence of boron trifluoride–diethyl etherate as catalyst, followed by oxidation with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ), gave monoester compound (4), which was further hydrolysed by an aqueous solution of KOH to yield N3S-CA. The A2B2 thiaporphyrin dyes were synthesized according to the stepwise synthetic protocol depicted in Scheme 3.

Thiophene was treated with the corresponding aldehydes in the presence of n-BuLi to get the desired symmetrical thiophene diols. The mixed condensation of these symmetrical diols with the appropriate aldehydes and pyrrole in the presence of boron trifluoride–diethyl etherate as catalyst, followed by oxidation with DDQ, gave the diester compounds. The diester compounds were purified by column chromatography and subsequent hydrolysis by KOH(aq) yielded analytically pure thiaporphyrins. The carbonyl stretching peaks around 1680–1700 cm−1 in the final carboxylic acid substituted compounds are slightly shifted to lower energy compared with their ester derivatives due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

The UV-visible peak positions of the Soret and Q-bands and the molar absorption coefficients (ε) of thiaporphyrins in THF are summarized in Table 1. The UV-visible spectra of the studied porphyrins as displayed in Fig. 1 show typical free-base porphyrin features including a strong Soret band around 430 nm and four Q-bands around 510–700 nm. The absorption wavelengths of these thiaporphyrins depend mainly on the nature of the substituents. The introduction of an ethynylphenyl linker at a meso carbon significantly shifts the absorption wavelength towards the low energy region as shown in N3S-ECA and N3S-ECN compared to N3S-CA. The UV-Visible spectrum of N3S-ECN, having a cyanoacrylic acid terminal as the anchor, shows the largest red-shift in the Soret band as well as the Q-bands, extending the absorption onset beyond 700 nm. The electron donating triphenylamine substituents on the meso positions in N3S-2ATPA result in the broadening of the Soret band as compared to N3S-2ATol and N3S-2AOMe. The extinction coefficient of N3S-CA is the highest amongst the thiaporphyrins. Although ε is not high for N3S-ECN and N3S-2ATPA, the IPCE (incident photon-to-current efficiency) might be compensated by the broadened absorption and increased electron injection resulting in a higher overall conversion efficiency (vide infra).

The absorption spectra of these thiaporphyrins as thin films were studied to understand their adsorption behaviour on TiO2.
To obtain the absorption spectra on TiO2 films, films with a thickness of approximately 3 μm were dipped in a 0.1 mM THF solution of thiaporphyrins for 8 h at room temperature. The adsorption spectra were recorded by reflectance measurements using an integrated sphere and the results are displayed in Fig. 2. The absorption spectra of dyes adsorbed on TiO2 show significant broadening and slight redshifts compared to the absorption spectrum in THF with a threshold of absorption around 750 nm. Particularly, the UV-visible spectra of N3S-ECN/TiO2 and N3S-2ATPA/TiO2 show obvious broadening and bathochromic shifts. This broadening in the UV-Vis spectra after adsorption on TiO2 films suggests that higher charge collection is possible in the Q-band region which will ultimately help to attain higher efficiency when applied in DSSCs. The steady-state fluorescence spectra of all the porphyrins were measured in THF by excitation at the Soret band and are displayed in Fig. 3.
The steady-state fluorescence spectra exhibited a trend similar to the absorption spectra, with a significant redshift upon addition of an ethynylphenyl linker. Not only the redshift but also the higher fluorescence intensity of N3S-ECA and N3S-ECN suggest that the conjugation through the ethynylphenyl linker is more effective than direct phenyl substitution which might result in better electron communication between the porphyrin core and the anchoring group.

For the efficient electron injection into TiO2 and faster regeneration of the oxidized dyes, appropriate tuning of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) with an iodide/triiodide couple and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) with the TiO2 conduction band is necessary. The cyclic voltammetry measurements of all the thiaporphyrins were carried out in degassed THF containing 0.1 M [Bu4N]PF6 as the supporting electrolyte to obtain the first reduction potentials as depicted in Fig. 4. The first reduction couples of N3S-ECA, N3S-ECN and N3S-CA show quasi-reversible redox processes under a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 while irreversible processes of the first reduction couple were observed for thiaporphyrins with dual carboxyphenyl substituents, N3S-2AOMe, N3S-2ATol and N3S-2ATPA. The reduction potentials for thiaporphyrins with a meso ethynylphenyl substituent are less negative than those of the other thiaporphyrins. The zero–zero excitation energies, E(0,0) were calculated from the intersection of the normalized absorption and emission spectra at the Q (0,0) band and were found to be 1.77, 1.77, 1.82, 1.81, 1.82 and 1.80 eV for the porphyrins N3S-ECA, N3S-ECN, N3S-CA, N3S-2AOMe, N3S-2Atol and N3S-2ATPA, respectively. The oxidation potentials were estimated from the first reduction potentials and the zero–zero excitation energies and are listed in Table 1.

The systematic energy level diagram for the studied thiaporphyrins is displayed in Fig. 5. As is evident from the energy level diagram, the ethynylphenyl substitution results in smaller HOMO and LUMO band gaps and consequently redshifts the absorption for A3B thiaporphyrins compared to those without an ethynylphenyl linkage. For the A2B2 thiaporphyrins, the E(0,0) decreases with increasing electron donating ability of the thiaporphyrins. The LUMOs of the thiaporphyrins are more negative than the TiO2 conduction band (>0.3 V) and thus ensure an adequate driving force for electron injection from the dye to the TiO2 conduction band. The HOMOs of all the porphyrins are more positive (>0.5 V) than the redox electrolyte which confirms the efficient dye regeneration.

The ground state geometries of studied thiaporphyrins were optimized in the gas phase by DFT calculations using the hybrid B3LYP functional and the 6-31G basis set. As presented in Fig. 6, the results from the quantum chemical calculations show planar macrocycles for the studied thiaporphyrins. The planar ring ensures effective electron coupling between the porphyrin ring and the anchoring group. The HOMO–LUMO energy gaps for all the thiaporphyrins are consistent with the absorption energies obtained from the UV-Vis spectra. In N3S-ECA and N3S-ECN, the majority of the π electron density is localized on the porphyrin ring, however a small portion is also extended over the anchoring group in the HOMO. In the LUMO of N3S-ECA, the electron density is distributed equally on the porphyrin ring, the ethynylphenyl linker and carboxylic acid anchor. In the LUMO of N3S-ECN, more π electron density is localized on the ethynylphenyl linker and anchoring cyano acrylic acid group than on the porphyrin core, which highlights the electron withdrawing effect of the cyano group. For N3S-CA, N3S-2AOME, N3S-2Atol and N3S-2ATPA, the majority of the electron density in the HOMO as well as the LUMO is located on the porphyrin ring, suggesting that the charge transfer in these porphyrins might be less efficient than in the meso-ethynylphenyl substituted derivatives. Thus, based on the theoretical calculations, it is evidenced that the ethynylphenyl linker is highly beneficial for efficient electron transfer from the porphyrin core to the electron withdrawing anchoring group. This effective electron distribution, especially in the case of N3S-ECN, facilitates efficient charge transfer from the excited state of the porphyrins to the TiO2 conduction band. Interestingly in the LUMO+2, the electron density is extensively located on the carboxylic acid acceptor suggesting that electron injection from higher excited states involving the LUMO+2 might be possible. The dipole moments for thiaporphyrins under study were estimated from theoretical calculations and are displayed in Fig. 6. The dipole moments decrease in the order N3S-ECN > N3S-2ATPA > N3S-ECA > N3S-2ATol > N3S-CA > N3S-2AOMe. The trend in dipole moments is consistent with the overall conversion efficiency for these thiaporphyrins except for N3S-ECA. N3S-ECA might have a higher dipole moment (4.56 D) than N3S-CA due to the presence of the ethynyl linker. The highest dipole moment of 8.57 D is observed for N3S-ECN, highlighting the effectiveness of the electron withdrawing cyano acrylic anchoring group. The higher polarizability is advantageous to expedite intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer.


ATR-FTIR spectroscopy measurements have been utilized as an essential tool for probing the number and mode of carboxylate groups anchored onto TiO2. The ATR-FTIR spectra of neat thiaporphyrins contrasted with the spectra of thiaporphyrins adsorbed on TiO2. Comparative spectra of representative samples are shown in Fig. 7. The spectra of neat N3S-CA and N3S-2ATol show strong ν(CO) stretches at 1687 and 1686 cm−1, respectively, whereas νsym(COO−) and νasym(COO−) stretches are likely to be observed at about 1400 and 1600 cm−1, respectively. In the comparative spectra of N3S-CA/TiO2 and N3S-2ATol/TiO2, the ν(CO) stretches completely disappeared, accompanied by a noticeable rise in the stretching peaks of νsym(COO−) and νasym(COO−) at about 1400 and 1600 cm−1, respectively. The observation noted above indicates that for N3S-CA bonding on to TiO2 is achieved through one carboxyl group while in N3S-2ATol, both p-carboxyphenyl groups at the cis positions are used for bonding onto TiO2. Similar observations are found for the remaining thiaporphyrins, that is, N3S-ECA, N3S-ECN, N3S-2AOMe and N3S-2ATPA (ESI, Fig. S1). Based on the above analyses, the single-anchoring mode for A3B thiaporphyrins and the dual-anchoring mode for A2B2 thiaporphyrins are proposed for the attachment of the porphyrins onto TiO2.


To better comprehend the adsorption behavior and measure the amount of adsorbed dye, we calculated the dye densities adsorbed on the TiO2 surface. The porphyrin densities (Γ) were determined by measuring the absorbance of porphyrins desorbed from the sensitized TiO2 films after being immersed in 0.1 M KOH solution in THF.

The saturated Γ values of A3B thiaporphyrins under study were found to be 141 ± 13, 144 ± 11 and 100 ± 8 nmol cm−2 for N3S-ECA, N3S-ECN and N3S-CA. Due to the ethynylphenyl substitution the thiaporphyrins N3S-ECA and N3S-ECN became planar compared to N3S-CA, giving dense packing on the TiO2 surface resulting in higher dye loadings. The Γ values for A2B2 thiaporphyrins N3S-2AOMe, N3S-2ATol and N3S-2ATPA are found to be 85 ± 5, 116 ± 3 and 54 ± 8 nmol cm−2, respectively. The dye loading values for A2B2 thiaporphyrins are inversely proportional to the steric bulkiness of the substituents. The more bulky the substituent, the lower is the dye loading. Overall, the dye loading amounts for A2B2 thiaporphyrins are lower than those of the A3B thiaporphyrins. This can be explained with the help of the dye attachment mode on the TiO2 surface. As seen from the ATR-FTIR studies, A2B2 thiaporphyrins bind through the dual anchoring mode while A3B thiaporphyrins bind through the single anchoring carboxylic group to the TiO2 surface. Thus A2B2 thiaporphyrins require more space on the TiO2 surface compared to the A3B thiaporphyrins thus giving lower dye loadings. It is obvious that a higher dye loading is observed for N3S-ECA and N3S-ECN as compared to other thiaporphyrins. The trend in the dye loading amounts mentioned above is not consistent with the efficiency with the exception of N3S-ECN, which has both a higher dye loading and higher efficiency. Regardless of the low dye loading, N3S-2ATPA gave superior performance with higher current density.

Devices assembled with thiaporphyrin sensitizers using liquid electrolytes were tested under standard AM 1.5 illumination conditions. The photovoltaic parameters for the thiaporphyrins under study are summarized in Table 2 and the current–voltage characteristics of the devices are shown in Fig. 8a.

As evident from the I–V curve, the N3S-ECN give the best performance with an overall photon-to-current conversion efficiency of 1.69%, supported by a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 5.12 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.49 V and fill factor (ff) of 0.67. It is well supported by DFT calculations and photophysical studies that the electron-withdrawing cyano acrylic acid terminal group enhances the charge transfer from the porphyrin ring towards the anchoring group. Also due to the electron withdrawing cyano group, the LUMO level of N3S-ECN is closer to the TiO2 conduction band compared to other thiaporphyrins, which may facilitate the electron injection. The higher electron injection from the dye to the TiO2 conduction band is well reflected in the much higher short-circuit current for N3S-ECN. Although the Voc values are all alike, other A3B and A2B2 thiaporphyrins have low Jsc values and, therefore, inferior power conversion efficiencies. Noticeably, N3S-ECA only had a short-circuit current of 0.89 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage of 0.41 V and fill factor of 0.55 corresponding to a photon-to-current conversion efficiency of 0.20%. This suggests that carboxylic acid alone is not sufficient to pull more electrons from the porphyrin core towards the anchor which results in the lower performance of N3S-ECA. Interestingly N3S-CA, without a meso-ethynylphenyl linker, achieved a higher efficiency of 0.40% with a short-circuit current of 1.29 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage of 0.48 V and fill factor of 0.64. The A2B2 thiaporphyrin, N3S-2ATol with two anchoring carboxylic groups had an overall photon-to-current conversion efficiency of 0.46% with a photocurrent density of 1.52 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage of 0.47 V and fill factor of 0.65, which is slightly higher than the single arm anchoring dye N3S-CA. Among the thiaporphyrins, N3S-2AOMe gave the lowest conversion efficiency of 0.17% with a short-circuit current of 0.67 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage of 0.45 V and fill factor of 0.57. This might be due to lower dye loadings as compared to other thiaporphyrins. Thiaporphyrin substituted with a triphenylamine donor, N3S-2ATPA, gave the highest efficiency among the A2B2 thiaporphyrins. It had a conversion efficiency of 0.86%, with Jsc = 2.84 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.48 V and fill factor of 0.63. The trend of Jsc in this series can be understood from the variation of the IPCE spectra as displayed in Fig. 8b and is in good agreement with the corresponding absorption spectra of the dyes on TiO2 which display intense absorption bands in the Soret region.
The I–V curves under standard AM1.5G illumination are in qualitative agreement with the photo-action spectra of these thiaporphyrins. For N3S-ECN the IPCE maximum is around 17% in the Soret region, and around 12% in the 550–600 nm region and 6% in the 700 nm region. This indicates that N3S-ECN shows panchromatic absorption behaviour covering whole visible region. This increased photon collection explains the higher short-circuit current for this compound. In the case of N3S-ECA and N3S-CA, there is insignificant IPCE in the Q-band region which is one of the reasons for their inferior performance compared to N3S-ECN. Even though the IPCE values are higher for N3S-2AOMe than N3S-ECA and N3S-CA, the lower dye density triggered by the bulky methoxy groups might be the reason for its low efficiency.

To further study the correlation between the charge transfer processes and photovoltaic properties in the DSSC devices with different thiaporphyrin sensitizers, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed under illumination with an open-circuit voltage with a frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 kHz. Fig. 9 shows the EIS Nyquist plots (i.e. the minus imaginary part of the impedance Z′′ vs. the real part of the impedance Z′ when sweeping the frequency) for DSSCs based on thiaporphyrins. One semicircle was observed for all the thiaporphyrins in the Nyquist plots. This semicircle corresponds to the charge transfer processes at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface i.e. electron transport resistance. A smaller radius of the semicircle in the Nyquist plot corresponds to a lower electron transport resistance, in other words higher electron transfer. The radius of the semicircle in the Nyquist plot decreases in the order N3S-2AOMe > N3S-2ATol > N3S-CA > N3S-ECA > N3S-2ATPA > N3S-ECN. This trend is roughly consistent with the DSSC performance of the thiaporphyrin sensitizers. The DSSC based on N3S-ECN exhibited a smaller interfacial charge transfer resistance at the dye–TiO2–electrolyte interface compared to other dyes indicating improved charge generation and transport, which is well reflected in its higher photocurrent density.


In summary, we have prepared novel mono- and di-carboxylate functionalized A3B and A2B2 thiaporphyrins. With the support of the photophysical and photovoltaic data, it is revealed that these thiaporphyrins, after systematic structural modification, can be applied in dye-sensitized solar cells. The UV-visible spectra of these thiaporphyrins showed that an ethynylphenyl linker effectively enhances the absorption wavelengths towards the near infra-red region. Density functional theory calculations show that higher π electron density is localized on the cyano acrylic acid anchor in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of N3S-ECN compared to the other thiaporphyrins; consequently, more electrons are available for injection from the dye into the conduction band of TiO2. As seen from the electrochemical properties and the energy level diagram, the energy levels of the thiaporphyrins are suitable for application as a sensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cells. The best conversion efficiency of 1.69% with high photocurrent density of 5.12 mA cm−2 is obtained for N3S-ECN owing to its superior photophysical properties. To the best of our knowledge this is the highest efficiency for thiaporphyrin-based dye-sensitized solar cells. These results suggest that the thiaporphyrins, core-modified derivatives of porphyrins, can serve as effective sensitizers for future dye-sensitized solar cell applications.


All chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and used as received without further purification. All the reactions were carried out under nitrogen atmosphere. Solvents used in the reactions were dried by a PureSolv MD 5 system (Innovative Technology, Inc). Flash chromatography was carried out by using silica gel (40–63 μm, Merck). Analytical TLC was performed on Merck silica gel plates. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer and performed in CDCl3 (δ = 7.26 ppm), THF-D8 (δ = 1.73, 3.58 ppm) or DMSO-D6 (δ = 2.50 ppm) solutions. 13C NMR spectra were performed in CDCl3 (δ = 7.26 ppm) DMSO-D6 (δ = 40.0 ppm) solutions. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm. Coupling constants J are reported in Hz. The signals are described as s: singlet; d: doublet; dd: doublet of doublets. The ESI ion trap mass spectra were measured by a Finnigan MAT LCQ mass spectrometer. The HR-FAB spectra were conducted on a JMS-700 double focusing mass spectrometer. Transmittance and reflection UV-visible absorption spectra of the thiaporphyrins in THF and adsorbed on TiO2 electrodes were recorded on a JASCO V-670 UV-Vis/NIR spectrophotometer. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were acquired by using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. The cyclic voltammetry measurements of all thiaporphyrins were carried out on a CHI 621B electrochemical analyser (CH Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) in degassed THF containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) as the supporting electrolyte. The cell assembly consists of glassy carbon as the working electrode, a silver wire as the pseudo-reference electrode, and a platinum wire as the auxiliary electrode. The scan rate for all measurements was fixed at 50 mV s−1. A ferrocene+1/0 redox couple was used as the internal standard and the potential values obtained in reference to the silver electrode were converted to the vacuum scale. DFT calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 package. The molecular orbitals were visualized using ChemOffice software.

TiO2 photoanode films and Pt counter electrodes were purchased from Yingkou Opvtech New Energy Co. Ltd. Liaoning, China. The films, which were prepared by using the screen-printing method, were composed of a transparent layer (thickness ≈ 12 μm), a scattering layer (thickness ≈ 4 μm), and a working area of 0.4 × 0.4 cm2 and were used as received. The films were pretreated according to the following activation procedures before use: heating at 100 °C for 22 min, at 110 °C for 60 min, at 450 °C for 68 min, at 500 °C 60 min, at 250 °C for 60 min, cooling at 80 °C and keeping at 80 °C before immersion. The TiO2 films were immersed in a 2 × 10−4 M solution of the porphyrin in THF for 6–8 h at 25 °C. The dye-sensitized TiO2 films were washed with THF, dried in hot air, and used as the working electrode. To fabricate the DSSC device, the two electrodes were tightly clipped together into a sandwich-type cell that was spaced by a 40 μm film spacer. A thin layer of electrolyte, which contained 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M lithium iodide (LiI), 0.6 M dimethyl-propyl-benzimidazole iodide (DMPII), and 0.6 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in dry CH3CN, was introduced into the space between the two electrodes. The photo-electrochemical characterizations of the solar cells were performed on an Oriel Class A solar simulator (Oriel 91195A, Newport Corp.). Photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs were recorded on a potentiostat/galvanostat (CHI650B, CH Instruments, Inc.) at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and calibrated to an Oriel reference solar cell (Oriel 91150, Newport Corp.). The monochromatic quantum efficiency was recorded on a monochromator (Oriel 74100, Newport Corp.) under short-circuit conditions. The intensity of each wavelength was within the range 1–3 mW cm−2. The EIS measurements were carried out on a CHI 621B electrochemical impedance analyser (CH Instruments, Austin, TX, USA), under applied AC voltage and bias potential on the cells and the corresponding current and voltage were measured under a white LED lamp with various neutral density filters for white light intensity in order to change the Fermi level of the DSSCs. The data were analysed using Zview software.
