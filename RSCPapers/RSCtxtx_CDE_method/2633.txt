Lead-doped TiO2 nanofibers (TNFs) are fabricated by using an electrospun method, followed by the in situ preparation of perovskite-sensitized photoanode for use in perovskite solar cells (PSC). The electrospun TNFs can provide direct pathways for the rapid collection and transmission of photogenerated electrons. The photoanode based on the in situ method shows not only excellent contacting between the TNF and perovskite, but also abundant perovskite filling in it. These can be conducive not only to the separation and transmission of the electron and hole, but also to the absorption and utilization of sunlight. Finally, a high performance PSC with the cell efficiency of 9.03% is obtained without any hole transporting materials.

Organolead halide perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3, X = I, Br, and Cl) have attracted extensive attention as light harvesters for high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) over the last few years due to their optimal band gap, wide light absorption, and long-range exciton diffusion lengths. The PSC shows an impressive high open circuit voltage, high power conversion efficiency, and long-term stability in conjunction with the development of new device architectures, deposition methods, and hole transporting materials (HTMs).

In order to improve the photovoltaic performance of the TiO2 photoanode, many efforts have been devoted to the design and synthesis of TiO2 with particular structures such as nanotubes, nanorods, and nanowires. These particular structures have proved successful for the dye-sensitized solar cell and the PSC since they can provide direct pathways for the rapid collection of photogenerated electrons, which could improve the photovoltaic performance of the device. There are two major deposition methods for the preparation of PSCs. A one-step or two-step solution process was used to fabricate the perovskite sensitized TiO2 photoanode; moreover, a two-step method could provide a higher performance PSC than the one-step method due to its more controllable size of the perovskite sensitizer. Recently, Xiao reported on an interdiffusion method to prepare pin-hole free perovskite films using a low temperature solution process, yielding a PSC efficiency of 15.4%. However, the mesoporous TiO2 photoanode, with hundreds of nanometers of thickness, is an important component for the solution process to match with the preparation of perovskites, and the perovskite is usually hard to fill into the TiO2 film. Snaith reported a PSC efficiency of 15.4% by vapour deposition, which could provide a thin and homogeneous CH3NH3PbI3 film on the surface of the TiO2 with a planar structure. However, the thickness of the TiO2 film should be lesser than the electron diffusion length of the CH3NH3PbI3 to realize the separation of the electron and hole. The planar structure would lead to a waste of the intrinsic and high surface area of the TiO2 nanoparticles. Furthermore, Etgar reported a HTM-free PSC with high power conversion efficiency of 8%, due to the fact that the holes are extracted more efficiently than electrons in CH3NH3PbI3. Recently, a 10.49% power conversion efficiency has been reported for HTM-free PSCs, confirming that the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Au cell is an efficient heterojunction cell.
Therefore, here, we report an in situ preparation of perovskite-sensitized TiO2 nanofibers (TNFs) by using electrospun lead-doped TNFs and preparation of photoanodes for the PSCs by film formation processes. Firstly, lead acetate is homo-dissolved into the electrospun solution, and then electrospinning Pb-doped TNFs. Secondly, TNF&PbO is obtained after film forming and sintering. Thirdly, TNF&PbO is dipped in HI acid solution, and after the full reaction and drying, TNF&PbI2 is obtained. Moreover, additional spin-coating PbI2 on the TNF&PbI2 can avoid the direct contact between TNFs and the Au electrode. Finally, TNF&PbI2 is soaked in a solution of CH3NH3I and rinsed with isopropyl alcohol, and after drying, TNF&CH3NH3PbI3 is obtained by the in situ method. Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the preparation processes for the PSC1 and PSC2. The PSC2 has an efficiency of 9.03% without any hole-transporting materials.

Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 1300000), isopropyl alcohol, acetic acid, titanium tetraisopropanolate (TTIP), lead acetate, acetone, methanol, ether, hydroiodic acid (45 wt% in water), methylamine (30% in methanol), lead iodide (PbI2), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), tetrabutyl titanate, and Triton X-100 were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Agent Ltd., China (Analysis purity grade). The above reagents were used without further purification. CH3NH3I was prepared by reacting 20 mL hydroiodic acid (45 wt% in water) and 20 mL methylamine (30% in methanol) in a 250 mL round-bottomed flask at 0 °C for 2 h with stirring. Then, the resulting solution was evaporated at 50 °C for 1 h. The precipitate was washed three times with diethyl ether, dried at 60 °C under a vacuum oven for 24 h, and used without further purification.


Lead acetate was dissolved into acetic acid to form a saturated lead acetate solution at room temperature (20 °C). PVP (100 mg) was dissolved into a mixture of isopropyl alcohol (0.6 mL) and the aforementioned saturated lead acetate solution (0.4 mL). Under constant stirring, TTIP (0.2 mL) was added to the mixture for electrospinning. The electrospun mixture was fed at a rate of approximately 1.0 mL h−1 through a stainless-steel syringe pipette needle carrying a potential of +15.0 kV. Fibers were collected on a sheet of electrically grounded aluminum foil placed 15 cm below the syringe tip. The resultant fibrous mat was collected and then dried at room temperature under ambient atmosphere, yielding a Pb-doped TNF mat. For comparison, the aforementioned saturated lead acetate solution was replaced by pure acetic acid for the electrospinning mixture, and pure TNF mat was obtained.


The aforementioned pure TNF and Pb-doped TNF mats without sintering were cut into slices with a size dimension of 0.5 cm × 1.0 cm, then placed on the cleaned FTO glass (1.5 cm × 2 cm, 8 Ω sq−1, NSG). After that, a drop of tetrabutyl titanate (3 mM) in isopropyl alcohol with a small quantity of Triton X-100 was dropped into the slice and then dried at room temperature. After sintering at 450 °C for 30 min, pure TNF and TNF&PbO films were obtained. The TNF&PbO film was further dipped in a HI solution (0.5 mol L−1), and after drying under ambient atmosphere, TNF&PbI2 film was obtained. The PbI2 solution in DMF (462 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on the pure TNF and TNF&PbI2 films, and after drying at 80 °C for 6 h in the vacuum drying oven, the films were dipped in a solution of CH3NH3I in isopropyl alcohol (10 mg mL−1) for 20 s and rinsed with isopropyl alcohol. After drying at 60 °C for 30 min in the vacuum drying oven, TNF&CH3NH3PbI3 photoanodes based on pure TNFs and Pb-doped TNFs were achieved.


Gold (100 nm) was sputtered on top of the TNF&CH3NH3PbI3 photoanode to form the back contact by using a magnetron sputtering equipment (ETD-2000M, Beijing Elaborate Technology Development Ltd., China) to fabricate the PSC. It should be noted that the hole transporting material was absent in the PSC. PSCs based on pure TNFs and Pb-doped TNFs are described as PSC1 and PSC2, respectively.


The surface morphologies of samples were observed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL-JSM-2100) operating at 200 kV and a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL-JSM-6701F) operating at 10 kV. The phase identification of the products was conducted with powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, BRUKER D8-ADVANCE), by which the products were collected together from the FTO glass after a grinding process. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorbance spectra of the samples were obtained with an Agilent 8453 UV-Vis diode array spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out on a computer-controlled Autolab potentiostat (Type III) in a solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) (0.1 M) in anhydrous acetonitrile at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at room temperature under argon protection. A FTO glass electrode was used as the working electrode (WE), and each material was deposited on the WE. A platinum wire was used as the counter electrode. As a reference electrode (RE), a silver wire coated with AgCl was used. After each measurement, the RE was calibrated with ferrocene.

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the PSC was performed using a CHI660D (Shanghai Chenhua Device Company, China) electrochemical measurement system at a constant temperature of 20 °C in ambient atmosphere in the dark, and the impedance data covered a frequency range of 1–105 Hz with 5 mV of amplitude with 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, or 0.9 V bias potential, respectively. The incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were measured with a solar cell QE/IPCE measurement system (Solar Cell Scan 100, Beijing Zolix Instruments Co. Ltd., China). The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristic of the PSC was observed using a computer-controlled CHI660D under illumination by a solar simulator (CEL-S500, Beijing Ceaulight Science and Technology Ltd., China) in ambient atmosphere. The incident light intensity was set under 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5), and a black mask (0.40 cm2) was used on top of the device to control the active cell area for the light irradiation.


Fig. 2a shows the XRD pattern of the pure TNFs after sintering at 450 °C for 30 min, where the characteristic diffraction peak at 2θ of 25.3° for titania anatase (101) crystal face is observed, and all sharp peaks can be indexed as titania anatase (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) card no. 21-1272). Fig. 2b demonstrates the XRD pattern of the TNF&PbO, whereas the characteristic diffraction patterns at 28.5°, 31.8°, 36.1°, 50.9°, and 56.7° are from the PbO, corresponding to the data in JCPDS card no. 78-1666. The PbO was transformed into PbI2 when it was dipped into the HI solution by the chemistry of PbO + 2HI → PbI2 + H2O (Fig. 2c). The Ksp of PbI2 is about 1.39 × 10−8 under 298 K of the temperature, which can benefit this transformation. The crystalline phase of PbI2 can be observed at 12.6°, 25.7°, 34.0°, 39.5°, and 52.3°, which are identified to be the (001), (002), (102), (003), and (004) diffraction signals, respectively, according to the JCPDS card no. 73-1750. After soaking in the CH3NH3I solution, the PbI2 was changed to CH3NH3PbI3 (Fig. 2d). Strong diffraction peaks are observed at approximately 14.2°, 20.0°, 23.6°, 24.6°, 28.5°, 31.9°, 35.0°, 40.6°, and 43.2°, corresponding to the reflections from (110), (112), (211), (202), (220), (310), (312), (224), and (314) crystal planes of the tetragonal perovskite structure. The characteristic diffraction peaks of the TNF are retained but weakened due to the TNF being covered with the CH3NH3PbI3. The XRD patterns indicate that the perovskite sensitized TNF was successfully prepared through the in situ method, and the in situ process is as follows: Pb(CH3COO)2 → PbO → PbI2 → CH3NH3PbI3.


Fig. 3a and e show the TEM and SEM images of the pure TNF with a diameter of about 100 nm. Fig. 3b shows that the PbO was doped in the TNF. A large number of holes are evenly distributed on the surface of TNF due to PbO, which fell out of the TNF surface by the ultrasonic dispersion for the TEM measurement. Similar phenomena are observed in Fig. 3c and d. After soaking in the CH3NH3I solution, a mass of CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticles evenly decorate the TNF (Fig. 3d). Fig. 3f shows the SEM image of the TNF&CH3NH3PbI3 (without ultrasonic dispersion), and it is obvious that the TNFs were decorated very well by CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticles. These phenomena, combined with the XRD results, illustrate that the perovskite sensitized TNFs can be successfully prepared by the in situ method.

Fig. 4a and b show the SEM images of the pure TNF and TNF&CH3NH3PbI3 placed on the FTO glass substrates with the film formation processes. The diameter of the pure TNF is larger than that of in Fig. 3e (without the film formation processes). This is due to the pure TNF mat without sintering being dissolved in the tetrabutyl titanate isopropyl alcohol solution; however, the solvent of isopropyl alcohol evaporated quickly resulting in a protection of the nanofibrous structure. Moreover, the tetrabutyl titanate could produce lots of TiO2 nanoparticles after sintering, leading to a good connection among the TNFs and FTO glass. The same phenomenon appears in Fig. 4b, but the diameter of the TNF has little change owing to the Pb doping. Fig. 4c and d show the top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of the PSC2 through the PbI2in situ yielding and device preparing processes. The nanofibrous structure looms through the homogeneous Au nanoparticles on the CH3NH3PbI3 film. The thickness of the TNF&CH3NH3PbI3 film is about 5.0 μm. The CH3NH3PbI3 has a diffusion length of 129 ± 41 nm for electrons, which requires that the thickness of the TiO2 films should be thinner than the electron diffusion length in a planar structure. However, in PSC2 device, the electrospun TNFs can provide direct pathways for the rapid collection and transmission of photogenerated electrons. The TNF film is filled and contacted with the CH3NH3PbI3 according to the Pb-doped TNFs and in situ method. This is beneficial for the separation and transmission of the electron and hole, which results in a very thick TiO2 film that could still work in the PSC. The thick TiO2 film could take full advantage of the large surface area of the TNFs, leading to high sunlight absorption and high photovoltaic performance. However, there are some TNFs and TiO2 nanoparticles exhibiting on the surface of the perovskite sensitized photoanode if only prepared by the in situ method, which will directly contact with the Au electrode by the subsequent solar cell fabrication, resulting in an unintended increase in the electron recombination. For this consideration, additional spin-coating PbI2 on the TNF&PbI2 can overcome the shortage of the in situ method. Moreover, the introduction of the CH3NH3PbI3 film well-covered on the surface of the TNF&CH3NH3PbI3 film would further influence the performance of the PSC.

Fig. 5 compares the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the pure TNF and TNF&CH3NH3PbI3 films prepared on the FTO glass substrates. From Fig. 5a, the pure TNF film has a strong absorption at 320 nm. The TNF&CH3NH3PbI3 film has an additional broad absorption at around 400–800 nm. The broad absorption window overlapping with the maximum irradiance of the solar spectrum ensures efficient photon harvesting, which may eventually lead to a high photocurrent. The optical band gap energy (Eg) of each material was calculated by the equation, Eg = 1240/λ, in which the λ value was measured by UV-Vis absorption spectra (Fig. 5a). Note that the Eg values are listed in Table 1, and the Eg of the TNF film is demonstrated to be 3.25 eV. The Eg of the CH3NH3PbI3 deposited on the TNF film is determined to be 1.55 eV, which shows that the optical absorption in the perovskite sensitizer occurs via a direct transition. The electrochemical properties of each material was studied by CV measurement, and the results are shown in Fig. 5b–d. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels are estimated from the oxidation potential (Eox) according to the empirical formulas of HOMO = −(Eox + 4.80 − Eox(ferrocene)) and LUMO = HOMO + Eg, and the results are listed in Table 1. According to the results, the band positions are well aligned for the charge separation, and the photon-generated electrons from the excited perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 can be quickly transferred to the conductive band (CB) of semiconductor TNF, and outputted by the external circuit.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to characterize the internal resistance and charge transfer kinetics of the solar cell, in which the potential bias was applied from 0.6 to 0.9 V in the dark in the frequency range from 105 to 1 Hz, as shown in Fig. 6. The equivalent circuit of this model (inset of Fig. 6) has been already reported. According to the simplified transmission line model, RS is the series resistance of the device, R1 is the charge-transfer resistance at the Au/CH3NH3PbI3 interface, while R2 (the main arc) is the charge-transfer resistance at the CH3NH3PbI3/TNF interface. The constant phase elements (C1 and C2) are frequently used as substitutes for the capacitors in an equivalent circuit to fit the impedance behavior of the electrical double layer more accurately while the double layer does not behave as an ideal capacitor.Table 2 shows the impedance parameters obtained from the Z-view software analyses of the EIS data. The values of RS, R1, and R2 decrease with increase in the bias potential due to the Fermi level in the TiO2 or TNF being elevated at the forward bias, which is beneficial to the easy electron flow across the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 or CH3NH3PbI3/TNF interface. Under the same bias potential, the RS, R1, and R2 values of PSC2 are lower than those of PSC1, especially for R2. This is owing to the fact that TNF in the PSC2 could possibly provide direct pathways for the rapid collection of photogenerated electrons, and the high carrier mobility of the CH3NH3PbI3 was well contacted and filled up in the TNF film, which could reduce the device resistance and enhance the separation and transmission rates of the electron and hole. The lower resistances could result in a more effective and rapid transporting ability for the electron and hole, which would further improve the performance of the PSC especially the fill factor. Moreover, the value of the C1 or C2 is closely related to the surface area: the higher the C1 or C2 value, the larger the surface area. The little difference in the C1 value for the two devices is due to the similar interface structure (Au/CH3NH3PbI3 interface); however, the value of C2 (0.94 mF cm−2) for the PSC2 is higher than that of the PSC1 (0.83 mF cm−2). This might be owing to the larger surface area of TNF in PSC2, which can promote the performance of the PSC device.

The incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of PSC1 and PSC2 were characterized and are shown in Fig. 7a, which is the response of the monochromatic light in the PSC and is directly related to the short-circuit current density (JSC): the higher the IPCE, the higher the JSC. The two PSCs show a wide light response from 350 nm to higher than 750 nm, with the maximum at ca. 550 nm. The IPCE of the PSC2 is higher than that of the PSC1, due to the fact that more CH3NH3PbI3 were filled into the TNF to absorb and utilize more sunlight. The good contact between the TNF and perovskite resulted in a quick and efficient separation and transmission of the electron and hole. These results are in agreement with the UV-Vis absorption spectra, EIS tests, and the following J–V measurements. The photovoltaic properties of PSCs were measured under full sunlight illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM1.5G) and in the dark, and they were reproduced many times without obvious change. As can be seen in Fig. 7b, the PSC1 produces a cell efficiency of 6.77%. The photovoltaic properties of the PSC2 are observably increased due to the fact that the CH3NH3PbI3 is well contacted with the TNFs and is well filled into the TNF film. As a result, the PSC2 demonstrates a higher JSC value of 19.36 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.88 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.53, and supplies a cell efficiency of 9.03%, although the hole transporting material is absent in PSC.

In summary, Pb-doped TNFs were fabricated by the electrospinning method, followed by the in situ preparation of perovskite-sensitized photoanode for the PSC. Because of electrospinning, TNFs can provide direct pathways for the rapid collection and transmission of photogenerated electrons, and the excellent contact between the TNFs and perovskite can be beneficial to the separation and transmission of the electron and hole. The as-prepared photoanode could be much thicker than those prepared by conventional solution processes or vapour deposition. The much thicker photoanode could observably enhance the absorption of sunlight due to taking full advantage of the high surface area of the TNFs and TiO2 nanoparticles. High performance PSC with the cell efficiency of 9.03% was acquired without any HTMs. The performances of the in situ prepared PSC would further increase after optimizing the thickness of the photoanode, changing the organometallic three halide perovskite to the mixed halide perovskite and adding HTMs into the device.
