Bathocuproine (BCP) is a classic cathode interlayer (CIL) in organic light-emitting diodes and fullerene-based bilayer-structured organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the BCP hasn't yet been reported in recently emerging nonfullerene-based OSCs. In this work, we report that the BCP can be a very efficient CIL for nonfullerene-based OSCs, which show a power conversion efficiency over 17%. An important note is that the BCP can't work with a binary nonfullerene active layer that yields poor performance of around 11%. It is possibly ascribed to the chemical reaction between the nonfullerene acceptor and BCP. Adding fullerene (PC71BM) to form a ternary active layer can deliver high performance, where the interaction between BCP and the nonfullerene acceptor can be passivated by the addition of fullerene via charge transfer. This work shows the potential application of classic BCP in efficient nonfullerene OSCs.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn increasing attention due to their unique characteristics, such as light weight, flexibility, solution processing, and chemical structure versatility. Recently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs has surpassed 18% owing to the tremendous efforts of development in new organic photoactive materials, especially in nonfullerene acceptors which have a high absorbance coefficient in the visible and near-infrared regions and low energy loss.

In OSC devices, interlayers are critical units which extract photo-generated carriers from the organic active layer to the electrodes. For efficient nonfullerene acceptors, the compatible interlayer is a key factor to achieve high performance because of its high chemical activity. That is different from fullerene acceptors. Among the interlayers, the cathode interlayer (CIL) has to meet more stringent requirements compared to the anode interlayer, because the nonfullerene active layer is prone to react with low work function interlayers and bases. For example, polyethylenimine (PEI) or polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) will destroy the conjugate structure of nonfullerene acceptors and the poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) will dope the nonfullerene acceptor, both resulting in poor device performance. Thus, we can not simply copy the recipe of interlayers when the active layer is switched from fullerene to nonfullerene. Recently, several strategies were adopted to passivate the amine groups, such as metal-ion chelation and protonation. In addition, new materials including perylenediimide derivatives, naphthalene diimide derivatives, naphthalocyanine derivatives, organic–inorganic hybrid electrolyte, and metal–nanographenes were synthesized to realize high-performance devices with nonfullerene acceptors.
Bathocuproine (BCP) is a classic and effective electron-transporting material of low cost and with solution processing, and has been widely used as a CIL in organic light-emitting diodes, perovskite solar cells and fullerene-based OSCs. However, the use of BCP as a CIL in recently emerging nonfullerene-based OSCs has not been reported yet. In this work, we report that BCP can deliver very efficient nonfullerene OSCs. But the active layer has to be ternary containing a small amount of fullerene as the third component. The optimization devices exhibit a PCE over 17% with BCP as the CIL and PM6:Y6:PC71BM (the ratio of PM6, Y6, and PC71BM is 1:1:0.2) as the ternary organic active layer.

Firstly, we fabricated nonfullerene-based OSCs with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/CIL/Ag, where the active layer is PM6:Y6 or PM6:Y6:PC71BM (the ratio of PM6, Y6, and PC71BM is 1:1:0.2) and the CIL is BCP or PDINN as a reference. Both BCP and PDINN can reduce the work function of the Ag electrode for electron extraction. The work function of Ag changes from 4.82 eV to 3.88 eV for BCP and 3.93 eV for PDINN, as shown in Fig. S1.Fig. 1a and b present the chemical structure of these materials and device structure, respectively. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves of OSCs measured under AM 1.5 conditions are exhibited in Fig. 1c and d. When the active layer is PM6:Y6, the devices with BCP as the CIL display a low PCE of 11.86% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.72 V, short-circuit current density (JSC) of 25.47 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 0.65. For comparison, the reference device with PDINN as a CIL presents better performance (PCE = 15.47%, VOC = 0.83 V, JSC = 25.88 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.72) that is close to previous reports. Encouragingly, when the active layer is PM6:Y6:PC71BM, both devices with BCP or PDINN as the CIL show high performance. Specifically, the PCE, VOC, JSC, and FF are 17.51%, 0.86 V, 26.10 mA cm−2, and 0.78 for devices with BCP as the CIL, while those of the reference device with PDINN as the CIL are 16.81%, 0.85 V, 26.02 mA cm−2, and 0.76. The results indicate that BCP acts as an effective CIL in ternary nonfullerene OSCs. Fig. S2 presents the morphology of BCP deposited on the PM6:Y6 or PM6:Y6:PC71BM active layer. Both the films show similar surface morphologies.

In addition to PC71BM, we also tried another nonfullerene acceptor, IT-4F, as the third component in the active layer, where the ratio of PM6:Y6:IT-4F is 1:1:0.2. The J–V curves are shown in Fig. S3. When the CIL is BCP, the devices still display a poor PCE of 9.34%, with VOC = 0.65 V, JSC = 24.36 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.59 while the reference device with PDINN as the CIL shows a relatively high PCE of 16.39% (VOC = 0.84 V, JSC = 25.67 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.76). We also fabricated OSCs with PM6:IT-4F:PC71BM as the active layer as shown in Fig. S4. The devices with BCP as the CIL displayed a VOC of 0.87 V, JSC of 20.73 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.78, yielding a PCE of 13.80%, which is comparable to that of the reference device with PDINN as the CIL (VOC = 0.86 V, JSC = 20.42 mA cm−2, FF = 0.75 and PCE = 13.23%). The different results of ternary OSCs with fullerene or nonfullerene as the third component point to the importance of PC71BM.
Next, we investigate the ratio of nonfullerene and fullerene acceptors in the PM6:Y6:PC71BM ternary active layer. Fig. 2 shows the J–V curves of ternary OSCs with different ratios of Y6 to PC71BM under an AM 1.5 solar simulator. All the devices with BCP or PDINN as the CIL show comparable performance on the condition that there exists PC71BM. With the lower ratio of Y6, the devices displayed lower JSC, which can be attributed to the higher absorbance in the visible and near-infrared region compared to the fullerene acceptor. Thus, the champion devices are fabricated with the ratio of PM6:Y6:PC71BM equal to 1:1:0.2. All the parameters of the devices with different active layers are summarized in Table 1.

To figure out the reason why BCP yields a poor performance in binary nonfullerene-based OSCs while it works well with the ternary active layer containing PC71BM, we added BCP directly into the solution of different acceptors and observed the change of absorption. As shown in Fig. 3a, after mixing with BCP, the main peak of Y6 solution at about 730 nm decreases while the small peak at about 480 nm increases. The inset is an optical photograph of Y6 and a mixture of Y6 and BCP. The color of Y6 changes from dark blue to orange when BCP is added. The other nonfullerene acceptor IT-4F displays a similar phenomenon, as shown in Fig. S5. This is a signal of the chemical reaction of the nonfullerene. Y6 and IT-4F exhibit a D–A type structure. The donor and the acceptor moieties are linked via a conjugated CC bond. Intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor moiety to the acceptor moiety is critical for the optoelectronic properties. The ICT contributes the absorption in the long-wavelength spectral region (730 nm). Once the addition reaction occurs, the conjugated CC bond becomes a C–C bond and thus the conjugation is broken. Absorption at 730 nm reduces while that at 400–550 nm increases. The optical and electrical properties including the bandgap and energy levels significantly change.
From the 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurement in Fig. S6, the singlet at about d = 9.18 ppm can be attributed to the proton in the CC linkage moieties in the Y6. After being mixed with BCP, the resonance at 9.18 ppm decreases. BCP possibly reacts as a nucleophile with the CC linkage moiety through the Michael addition reaction. Mass spectrum results confirm the addition reaction. Y6 presents an m/z of 1451 (Fig. 3b). After being mixed with BCP, a new fragment at m/z of 1811 appears which is the addition of Y6 (m/z: 1451, Fig. 3c) and BCP (m/z: 361, Fig. S7). This result is in accordance with the reaction between ethanolamine and IT-4F or IEICO-4F reported by our group.
As for fullerene, the absorbance of PC71BM has nearly no change after adding BCP, as shown in Fig. 4a. Both PC71BM and a mixture of PC71BM and BCP solution show a similar red-brown color. In addition, the small peak related to the exciton absorption at about 550 nm disappeared, which is related to the electronic structure change of the C70 cage induced by charge transfer from BCP to fullerene. This charge transfer process can be utilized to passivate the chemical reaction between Y6 and BCP. As shown in Fig. 4b, when BCP is added into the mixture of Y6 and PC71BM, the main peak of Y6 displays a small decrease. The color of the solution changes from dark blue to blue-green. Besides, we have also tested the absorbance spectra of these samples in film (Fig. S8). The absorbance of the Y6 and Y6:PC71BM films doesn't change after depositing the BCP layer. The reason is possibly that the chemical reduction of Y6 and BCP occurs at the interface which doesn't change the absorption of the entire film.
BCP is also introduced to donor polymer PM6 solution. Compared with pristine PM6 solution, there is nearly no change of absorbance and color, as shown in Fig. S9. These findings suggest that the poor performance of nonfullerene-based devices with BCP as the CIL can be attributed to the chemical reaction between BCP and nonfullerene acceptors.
To further investigate this interaction between BCP and PC71BM, we measured the Raman spectra of PC71BM films with or without BCP, as shown in Fig. 4c. It was found that the peak at 1566 cm−1 upshifts to 1569 cm−1 with the intensity decreasing after introducing BCP. This case is usually attributed to the electron-accepting nature of fullerene. Considering that N atoms in the pyridine ring of BCP have lone electron pairs with strong electron-donating ability, we performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to detect this charge transfer process. As presented in Fig. 4d, compared to its initial state, the N 1s peak of BCP shifted about 0.1 eV to lower binding energy after mixing with PC71BM. This result agrees with the interaction between pyridine and the fullerene cage. Combining these measurements (UV, Raman and XPS), we can conclude that PC71BM is a widely used electron acceptor. It attracts electrons on the BCP and then weakens the lone electron pairs at the N atoms. As a result, the reaction between the BCP and Y6 is suppressed.
Hereafter, we choose the optimal device conditions to characterize the electron-transporting ability of BCP. The JSC was checked by external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. From the EQE spectrum in Fig. 5a, the integrated current density for the devices with BCP or PDINN as the CIL is 24.88 and 24.70 mA cm−2, respectively, which is close to the value obtained from J–V curves. The higher JSC for devices with BCP as the CIL is due to the lower absorbance of BCP in low wavelength compared to PDINN, as shown in Fig. S10.
Besides the JSC, the VOC and FF also display a slight improvement when the CIL is BCP, which can be ascribed to lower carrier recombination. We measured the J–V characteristics of the devices under dark conditions. As shown in Fig. 5b, the devices with BCP as the CIL exhibit a lower dark current density and nearly two orders of magnitude larger rectification ratio compared to that of the reference device, which is a signal of lower leakage current in the dark with a lower density of trap states. To further confirm the lower carrier recombination, we tested the dependence of VOC on the intensity of incident light (P). As shown in Fig. 5c, the slope of VOCversus ln(P) for devices with BCP or PDINN as the CIL is 1.06 kT/q and 1.11 kT/q, respectively. The closer value of the slope to kT/q indicated that the bimolecular recombination plays the dominant role and BCP can suppress the trap-assisted recombination in devices. Meanwhile, we can extract the value of α based on the expression of JSC ∝ Pα from Fig. 5d. In our case, the fitted α for the devices with BCP or PDINN as the CIL is 0.963 and 0.956, respectively, which are close to 1. These results suggested that BCP can transport electrons effectively for nonfullerene-based OSCs after adding PC71BM into the nonfullerene active layer as the third component.

In summary, we have presented the application and optimization of a classic electron-transporting material, BCP, in the recently emerging nonfullerene-based OSCs. It is found that BCP works well with the ternary active layer containing PC71BM as a third component, but not with a binary nonfullerene active layer. The reason is that the BCP can react with the nonfullerene active layer and destroy its chemical structure. This reaction can be further mitigated by the PC71BM via charge transfer. Nonfullerene OSCs with BCP as the CIL can deliver a performance over 17% based on PM6:Y6:PC71BM as the active layer. It shows the potential application of classic BCP in the recently emerging nonfullerene OSCs.
