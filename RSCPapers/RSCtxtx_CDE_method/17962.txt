New D–A′–π–A type (D = electron donor, A′ = auxiliary acceptor, π = π-conjugated bridge, and A = electron acceptor/anchor) sensitizers with two bis(alkoxy)phenyl substituents incorporating thieno[3,4-b]pyrazines (TP) or a benzo[3,4-b]pyrazine (BP) entity as the auxiliary acceptor have been synthesized for application in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Under 1 sun illumination, the DSSCs fabricated from the two BP dyes with a co-adsorbent have efficiencies of 8.39% and 9.03%, respectively. The latter surpasses that of the standard N719 dye (8.87%). Under dim light conditions MD7 exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 18.95% and 27.17% under 300 lux and 6000 lux irradiance, respectively.

In recent years, the drastic improvement in the efficiency of metal-free dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has paved a path leading to their commercialization parallel to conventional Si-based solar cells. Compared with Si-based solar cells, DSSCs have immense potential owing to their flexibility in molecular design, easy device fabrication, environmental friendliness and low cost of production. A high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13% has been achieved with metal-free dyes and Zn-porphyrin dyes. Record PCEs have also been achieved for a co-dyed single cell (14.3%) and a tandem cell (14.64%), using a cobalt-based redox mediator. These values are very close to the threshold required for commercialization (15%). In order to further boost the performance of DSSCs under 1 sun, sensitizers with absorption extending to the near-infrared (NIR) region (∼700–1400 nm) are very important as NIR light (700–2500 nm) constitutes ∼50% of the solar spectrum. Among NIR sensitizers, the most representative dyes are porphyrins and phthalocyanines. Though Si solar cells (absorbing in the range of 350–1000 nm) have excellent efficiencies under 1 sun illumination, they are outperformed by DSSCs under dim light conditions because of two reasons: (1) indoor light sources such as fluorescent lamps and white LED lights cover the visible region mainly from 400 to 650 nm; (2) being an indirect band gap material, Si solar cells need intense light illumination for efficient light harvesting. Currently DSSCs are deemed promising for indoor applications such as powering portable electronics (sensors, wireless transmitters, etc.) used in the Internet of Things (IoTs). However, there are only limited reports on dye-sensitized photovoltaics under indoor lighting.

In this research, we intended to develop metal-free sensitizers for both indoor and outdoor DSSCs. We figured that dyes with panchromatic absorption in the visible region up to ∼650 nm could cover the spectrum of T5 or a white LED light source. In order to achieve this goal, we set out to develop D–A′–π–A (D = electron donor, A′ = auxiliary acceptor, π = π-conjugated bridge, and A = electron acceptor/anchor) type sensitizers. Incorporation of an electron deficient entity as the auxiliary acceptor in the conjugated spacer of D–π–A dyes is beneficial for red shifting the absorption spectra due to deepened LUMO and improving the photostability of sensitizers. We reckon that A′ is like a double-edged sword: on one hand, it helps with red shifting the absorption spectra; on the other hand, it deteriorates electron injection of the excited dye molecule due to charge trapping. Therefore, proper design of conjugated spacers with A′ is needed for the good performance of DSSCs. For example, replacing benzothiadiazole (BT) with more electron deficient pyrido[2,1,3]thiadiazole (PyT) resulted in lower cell performance in spite of the longer wavelength ICT band. In comparison, the cell performance was improved by one order when PyT was replaced with less electron deficient 2H-[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-c]pyridine (PT). Similarly, replacing pyridoimidazole (PIm) with 1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BIm) led to better cell efficiency. We therefore set out to develop D–A′–π–A type sensitizers with benzo[3,4-b]pyrazine (BP), an electron-withdrawing entity popularly used for small band gap D–A type polymeric materials, as the auxiliary acceptor (A′). BP was selected as its moderate electron deficiency may avoid spectral over red shift of the dye and charge trapping of the excited dye molecule. A more electron deficient entity, thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (TP), was also chosen as the electron-withdrawing entity for comparison. Incorporation of alkyl or aryl substituents in the pyrazine ring of BP or TP allows for tuning the solubility and optical properties of dyes. Herein we incorporate a 3,4-dihexyloxyphenyl moiety at the 2- and the 3-site of BP and TP to alleviate serious dye aggregation. To our knowledge, D–A′–π–A dyes incorporating a dialkoxyphenyl unit at the auxiliary acceptor have not been reported so far, though there are examples of dyes with a 2,4-dialkoxyphenyl moiety at the donor. In addition to ambient light, the DSSCs fabricated from the new dyes were also explored under 1 sun. The results show that these novel dyes perform well under both 1 sun irradiation and 300–6000 lux T5 fluorescent light, providing viable materials for realizing the practical use of DSSCs.

All commercially purchased solvents were dried before use. Reactions were performed under an inert atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques unless otherwise specified. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVA-300 and an AVIII-400 spectrometer. The UV-vis absorption spectra of dyes in solution and on mesoporous TiO2 films were measured using a Cary 300 Bio UV-vis spectrophotometer (Varian), and photoluminescence measurements were carried out with a HITACHI F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed on a CHI-621A potentiostat (CH-Instruments, Inc.), with a Pt-wire as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Tetra n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate and THF were used as the supporting electrolyte and solvent, respectively. Elemental analysis was performed on a PerkinElmer 2400 analyzer. Fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB MS) analysis was performed on a JEOL JMS-700 mass spectrometer (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with the standard FAB source. The photovoltaic parameters of the DSSCs were measured with a potentiostat/galvanostat (CHI650B, CH Instruments, Inc.) under 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun) light illumination by using a class A quality solar simulator (XES-301S, AM1.5G, San-Ei Electric Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). An incident light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 was calibrated with a standard Si cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of the DSSCs were recorded using the same potentiostat/galvanostat under monochromatic light illumination in the wavelength range of 380–900 nm. To obtain the IPCE data, another class-A solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM1.5G, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan) equipped with a monochromator (model 74100, Oriel Instrument, California, USA) was used. The incident radiation flux (φ) was obtained by using an optical detector (model 818-SL, Newport, California, USA) and a power meter (model 1916-R, Newport, California, USA). The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the DSSCs were recorded using the same potentiostat/galvanostat equipped with an FRA2 module at an applied voltage of −0.70 V. The explored frequency range is set from 10 MHz to 100 kHz with an AC amplitude of ±10 mV using an equipped FRA2 module. The TiO2 nanoparticles and the reference dye of N719 were purchased from Solaronix, S.A., Switzerland.

Dye-sensitized solar cells were fabricated using conductive glass, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, TEC-7, 7 Ω sq−1, NSG America Inc., New Jersey, USA), as the substrate for the photoanode and counter-electrode (CE) after proper cleaning. The FTO glass was first cleaned via ultra-sonication in a bath of neutral cleaner, de-ionized water, acetone, and isopropanol, sequentially. A 12 μm-thick TiO2 film, containing a 7 μm-thick transparent layer (Solarnix transparent paste) and a 5 μm-thick scattering layer, was cast on the cleaned FTO with a controlled area of 0.16 cm2 and was sintered at 450 °C for 30 min in an air atmosphere. The film thickness is measured with a profilometer (Dektak3, Veeco/Sloan Instruments Inc., USA). The sintered TiO2 film was immersed in 3 × 10−4 M dye solution at room temperature for 12 h in THF. For the cases of the dyes co-adsorbed with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), 1 mM CDCA is added to each dye solution. After rinsing with acetonitrile, the dye-adsorbed TiO2 photoanode was obtained. Finally, a photoanode was assembled with a sputtered-platinum/FTO counter electrode using 25 μm-thick Surlyn® (SX1170-25, Solaronix S. A., Switzerland) as the cell spacer. The iodide-based electrolyte, containing 0.1 M lithium iodide (LiI), 1.0 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.04 M iodine (I2), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile/3-methoxypropionitrile (ACN/MPN = 8:2 by vol), was injected into the cell gap between these two electrodes by capillarity. The cell parameters for dim light irradiation have been adjusted as follows: a mesoporous TiO2 (12 μm active layer ∼4 μm-thick scattering layer) with an effective area of 0.16 cm2 and a redox electrolyte composition of LiI (0.3 M), I2 (0.5 M), DMPII (1 M) and TBP (0.5 M) in ACN/MPN (80:20 v/v).


All the calculations have been performed using the Gaussian 09 program package. Geometrical optimization was performed in vacuo using the B3LYP exchange–correlation functional and 6-311G (d,p) basis set. The optimized geometries were then used to obtain frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs). To simulate the optical spectra, the lowest spin allowed singlet–singlet transitions were computed on the ground state geometry. The TDDFT calculations of the lowest singlet–singlet excitations were performed in THF solution on the optimized geometries using the CAM-B3LYP/6-311G (d,p) level of theory. The integral equation formalism polarizable continuum model (PCM) within self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) theory has been used to describe the solvation of the dyes. The TDDFT calculations were also performed using CAM-B3LYP with the 6-311G (d,p) basis set. GaussSum 2.2.5 software was utilized to simulate the major portion of the absorption spectrum and to analyze the nature of transitions.


The structures of the new sensitizers are shown in Fig. 1, and Schemes 1 and 2 describe the synthetic pathway for MD4/MD6 and MD5/MD7, respectively. Pyrazine cores (4a and 5a) were synthesized by refluxing a mixture of the corresponding diamine and diketone in suitable solvents as mentioned in the schemes. It is worth noting that we failed to isolate the dihexyloxyphenyl moiety-free analogues of 4a and 5a, possibly due to the low solubility of intermediates which stemmed from serious intermolecular aggregation. The Vilsmeier–Haack reaction was performed on 4a to provide an aldehyde intermediate, 4b, which underwent subsequent bromination with NBS to afford 4c. Next, the Stille cross coupling reaction between 4c and N,N-diphenyl-4-(tributylstannyl)aniline was carried out to incorporate the arylamine donor, and the subsequent Knoevenagel condensation reaction furnished the desired MD4 dye. Stille cross coupling of tributyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane with 5a afforded 5b, which then underwent formylation to give 5cvia the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction. Subsequent bromination of 5c with NBS provided 5d. The Stille cross coupling reaction of 5d with N,N-diphenyl-4-(tributylstannyl)aniline afforded 5e incorporating the donor group, which underwent subsequent Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid to provide MD5. The synthetic procedure of MD6 and MD7 was similar to that of MD4 and MD5 except that 4-(hexyloxy)-N-(4-(hexyloxy)phenyl)-N-(4-(tributylstannyl)phenyl)aniline was used instead of N,N-diphenyl-4-(tributylstannyl)aniline.


The UV-vis absorption spectra of the MD dyes were measured in THF and on a TiO2 film (Fig. 2a and b), and the optical HOMO/LUMO energy gap of the dyes was estimated from the intersection of normalized absorption and fluorescence spectra. The dyes show panchromatic absorption: an intense band in the higher energy region is attributed to π–π* transition, and a broad intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) band appears in the longer wavelength region. The thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine-based dyes, MD4 and MD6, show absorption maxima (λmax) at 633 nm and 642 nm with the λonset reaching >750 nm (Fig. 2, Table 1) and the molar absorption coefficient exceeding 10000 M−1 cm−1 at 700 nm. Compared with MD4 and MD6, the absorption maxima of MD5 (513 nm) and MD7 (532 nm) are blue-shifted by 120 nm and 110 nm, respectively, which is consistent with the more electron deficient nature of thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (in MD4 and MD6) than benzo[3,4-b]pyrazine (in MD5 and MD7). Incorporation of alkoxy substituents into the arylamine donor increases its strength and results in red shift of the absorption spectra: MD6 > MD4 and MD7 > MD5. It is noteworthy that the molar extinction coefficients of MD4 (ε = 32231 M−1 cm−1), MD6 (ε = 33530 M−1 cm−1), MD5 (ε = 32231 M−1 cm−1) and MD7 (ε = 39360 M−1 cm−1) are greater than those of BP and TP congeners with similar skeletons, CR and DJ (BT dyes), and NL and FNE (TP dyes). This can be attributed to the better planarity of the conjugated skeleton and incorporation of alkoxy substituents for the MD dyes. Though there is negligible dye aggregation in the solution up to a concentration of 3 × 10−4 M in view of the linearity of the absorbance vs. concentration (in THF) plot (Fig. 2b), slight dye aggregation still exists in the film state. Fig. 2c displays the absorption spectra for the dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 film (∼4 μm in thickness). Broadened absorption spectra in the longer wavelength region with a bathochromic shift of λonset indicate the presence of the J-aggregation of the dyes in the film state.MD4 (or MD6) appears to have a higher tendency to aggregate than its BP congener (ESI: Fig. S1), possibly due to the more planar skeleton in the former. The blue shift of λmax of the dyes on TiO2 is attributed to the deprotonation of carboxylic acid.

To gain a better understanding of the structure–property relationship, we have carried out TDDFT studies on these dyes using the CAM-B3LYP level of theory, with inclusion of the solvent (THF). A detailed list of the calculated transition energies for all the compounds is provided in the ESI (Tables S1–S4), and the simulated spectra are shown in Fig. S2. The TDDFT results are in good agreement with the experimental UV-Vis spectra. The spectra have been produced by convoluting Gaussian functions with FWHM = 0.35 eV centered at the excitation wavenumbers. Relevant ground-state dihedral angles between the aromatic entities of the conjugated skeleton are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI). There is a significant twist (dihedral angles: 46.9–43.2°) between the BP (or TP) core and its two alkoxyphenyl substituents. As expected, the TP core has better planarity with the neighboring thiophene rings compared with the BP core, and the dihedral angles are smaller in MD4 and MD6 (6.6–7.7°) than in MD5 and MD7 (24.2–28.3°). Selected frontier orbitals are shown in Fig. 3 and S4 (ESI). The HOMO orbital is mainly distributed from the arylamine donor extending to the conjugated spacer, and the LUMO orbital is distributed from the anchor extending to the spacer. The charge transfer character is evident for the lowest-energy transition (S0 → S1): >75% of HOMO → LUMO for MD4 and MD6, and >50% of HOMO → LUMO for MD5 and MD7. Computation on compounds MD4′–MD7′, the congeners of MD4–MD7 without alkoxy chains at the BP or the TP core, was also carried out in order to evaluate the influence of the alkoxy chains on the electronic properties of the dyes, and the results are compiled in Table S5. Compared with MD4′–MD7′, the LUMO of MD4–MD7 appears to have been lowered by 0.13–0.18 eV, and therefore the HOMO/LUMO gap lowered by 0.17–0.24 eV. The Mulliken charge differences between the excited-state and ground states for different segments of the MD dyes were also calculated from the CAM-B3LYP/6-311G for the S1 and S2 states in order to estimate the extent of charge separation upon excitation (Fig. S5). The dye molecules were grouped into several segments: the arylamine donor (D), the thiophene unit between D and BD or TP (Th-L), BD or TP (A′), the thiophene unit between A′ and the anchor (Th-R), and the anchor (A). The Mulliken charges are compiled in Table S6. The Mulliken charge changes at A′/A for S0 → S1 are MD4, −0.11/−0.06 |e|; MD5, −0.11/−0.11 |e|; MD6, −0.11/−0.06 |e|; and MD7, −0.04/−0.12 |e|, respectively. The products of the oscillator strength and the Mulliken charge changes in A are as follows: MD4, 0.06 |e|; MD5, 0.15 |e|; MD6, 0.07 |e|; and MD7, 0.17 |e|, respectively. Therefore, the TP-based dyes (MD4 and MD6) have more charges trapped at A′ and less charges residing at A compared with the BP-based dyes (MD5 and MD7). This implies that electronic injection from the excited dye molecule to TiO2 is more facile for the BP-based dyes.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements generally provide information on the feasibility of electron injection and dye regeneration. The CV measurements of the MD dyes were carried out in THF using tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte. The cyclic voltammograms and energy levels of the sensitizers are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively, and the relevant data are compiled in Table 1. We can observe two features: (1) incorporation of hexyloxy chains at the arylamine significantly increases the electron density and lowers the oxidation potential of the arylamine, i.e., MD4vs.MD6 and MD5vs.MD7; (2) both MD4 and MD6 have two quasi-reversible oxidation waves, and MD5 and MD7 have only one. Apparently the three electron rich thiophene rings in MD4 and MD6 render the molecule more electron rich and have higher capability to accommodate two positive charges. The HOMO levels of MD4 (0.96 V), MD5 (1.06 V), MD6 (0.84 V) and MD7 (0.88 V vs. NHE), calculated from the first oxidation potential, are more positive than that of the I−/I3− redox couple (∼0.4 V vs. NHE) and ascertain efficient dye regeneration. The LUMO energy levels of the dyes MD4 (−0.80 V), MD5 (−1.04 V), MD6 (−0.90 V) and MD7 (−1.13 V vs. NHE), calculated from Eox − E0–0, are remarkably more negative than the TiO2 conduction band-edge energy (∼−0.5 V vs. NHE), ensuring favorable electron injection (see Table 1 and Fig. 4b).


The DSSCs fabricated with the MD dyes and I−/I3− redox mediator were characterized under AM 1.5 G illumination. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) plots of the DSSCs are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. The relevant photovoltaic parameters of the cells are summarized in Table 2 The photocurrent densities estimated by integrating the product of the IPCE value at each wavelength and the photon flux density data obtained from the AM 1.5 solar spectrum are also listed in the parentheses of the JSC value for reference. They deviate from the experimental values by <15%. The dyes with the BP core (MD5: 7.88%; MD7: 8.22%) have significantly higher performance than those with the TP core (MD4: 3.92%; MD6: 5.08%). Compared with the solution spectra, the IPCE spectra are broadened in the longer wavelength region, which is consistent with the film spectra of the λonset (vide supra). The best performing dye, MD7, has IPCE values above 80% in the range of 400–620 nm. Though MD4 and MD6 have absorption extending to the longer wavelength spectral region, their IPCE values are lower than 60%. They may stem from several reasons: (1) higher electron density is trapped at the more electron deficient TP entity of MD4 and MD6, leading to lower electron injection efficiency (see Mulliken charge analysis, vide supra); (2) there is lower dye loading for MD4 and MD6; (3) a higher degree of dye aggregation in MD4 and MD6 due to a more planar skeleton (vide supra) jeopardizes the electron injection. Moreover, MD4 and MD6 are less effective in dark current suppression compared to MD5 and MD7 (vide infra, see EIS), leading to smaller photovoltages. Consequently, MD5 and MD7 exhibit better conversion efficiencies than MD4 and MD6. The largest dye loading amount and most efficient dark current suppression (vide infra) certainly contribute significantly to the best performance of MD7 among all. In comparison, the lowest dye loading, most serious dye aggregation and largest dark current (vide infra) render the cell performance of MD4 the lowest among all. The better performance of MD6 than MD4 (or MD7 than MD5) can be mainly attributed to two reasons: (1) better light harvesting because of higher dye loading as well as broader and more intense absorption spectra (vide supra); (2) better dark current suppression, leading to marginal increment of the photovoltage.

The higher VOC values of MD4 and MD6 than other TP dyes using the I−/I3− redox mediator suggest more effective dark current suppression in the former owing to the bulky dihexyloxyphenyl moieties at the TP entity. The dihexyloxyphenyl moiety at the BP entity also benefits dark current suppression in the BP dyes, as MD5 and MD7 have relatively higher photovoltages than their congeners without substituents at the 2- and 3-sites of BP, FNE45 and FNE46. Among BP dyes with the triphenylamine donor, the VOC values of MD5 and MD7 also appear to be higher for the DSSCs using the I−/I3− redox couple. Though the cell efficiencies of MD5 (7.88%) and MD7 (8.22%) are somewhat lower than the best efficiency (9.83%) reported for the single BP dye, they favorably compete with the other triphenylamine-based BP dyes.
Adding a co-adsorbent during dye soaking has been proven to help with anti-aggregation of the dyes in addition to passivation of the TiO2 surface for dark current suppression. As there exists slight dye aggregation, addition of a co-adsorbent was also tested. After adding 1 mM CDCA co-adsorbent, both VOC and JSC were improved and the power conversion efficiencies increased accordingly: MD4, 4.58%; MD5, 8.39%; MD6, 5.26%; MD7, 9.03%. The J–V curves and IPCE plots with CDCA are shown in Fig. 5c and d, respectively. Both VOC and JSC increase in spite of decreasing dye loading, providing good evidence for alleviation of dye aggregation upon addition of CDCA. Accordingly, all dyes exhibit higher IPCE values after addition of CDCA.
Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) taken in the dark were used to analyze the interfacial electron transfer properties in the DSSCs. Fig. 6a shows the Nyquist plots for the DSSCs based on the MD4–MD7 dyes. The semicircle with larger impedance is related to the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) of the injected electron with the oxidized electrolyte occurring at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, and the larger Rrec means a lower tendency for recombination, i.e. lower dark current. The Rrec value for the sensitizers decreases in the order of N719 (206 Ω) > MD7 (171 Ω) > MD5 (165 Ω) > MD6 (139 Ω) > MD4 (114 Ω), which is in agreement with the order of the dark current (Fig. 6a). This trend is also in line with that of the VOC value, N719 (751 mV) > MD7 (725 mV) > MD5 (718 mV) > MD6 (705 mV) > MD4 (700 mV). The electron recombination lifetime extracted from the Bode phase plots (Fig. 7b) using τrec = 1/2πf, MD7 (40.83 ms) > MD5 (18.73 ms) > MD6 (12.94 ms) > MD4 (7.96 ms), provides additional supporting evidence. The larger Rrec value of BP than TP dyes, i.e., MD7 > MD6 and MD5 > MD4, may be attributed to two reasons: (1) more compact packing (higher dye loading) of the dyes on TiO2, resulting in less free volume for penetration of the electrolytes to the TiO2 surface; (2) the larger twist angles between BP and two neighboring thiophene rings than those between TP and the neighbouring thiophene rings, resulting in more effective blockage of the electrolytes from approaching the TiO2 surface. The two alkoxy chains at the arylamine donor also help with dark current suppression, i.e., MD7 > MD5 and MD6 > MD4. MD7 stands out to be the best for dark current suppression due to its higher dye loading, twisted structure and the presence of the alkoxy chains at the donor.

Due to panchromatic absorption, the absorption spectra of the MD dyes have good spectral coverage with the emission spectrum of the T5 fluorescent lamp (see Fig. S7 in the ESI). The high photovoltage of the MD dyes should also be beneficial for dim light environments. The photovoltaic performance of the MD dyes was therefore evaluated using T5 fluorescent lamp (0.1960 mW cm−2) illumination with irradiance in the range of 300–6000 lux. CDCA (1 mM) was added as the co-adsorbent during dye soaking, and I−/I3− was used as the redox mediator for all the cells. The current density–voltage (J–V) curve of the DSSCs under 300 lux T5 fluorescent light illumination is shown in Fig. 7, and Table 3 displays the summarized dim-light cell efficiency data of the dyes at 300, 600, 900 and 6000 lux. The performance data for all other irradiance are compiled in Table S8. Both BP-based dyes (MD5 and MD7) have cell efficiencies >15% even under only 300 lux illumination, and MD7 has the best performance among all: 18.95% (300 lux), 20.16% (600 lux), 21.10% (900 lux) and 27.17% (6000 lux). These efficiencies are comparable with those of the N719-based cell fabricated and measured under similar conditions: 19.02% (300 lux), 20.23% (600 lux), 20.94% (900 lux) and 27.64% (6000 lux). The performance of MD7, though lower than the record efficiency reported by Freitag et al. on a co-dyed system using Cu(II/I)(tmby) (tmby = 4,4′,6,6′-tetramethyl-2,2′-bipyridine) as the redox mediator (25.5% at 200 lux; 28.9% at 1000 lux), is very competitive with the best cell based on a single sensitizer and the I−/I3− redox couple reported by Tingare et al.: 21.40% (300 lux), 21.88% (600 lux), 23.64% (900 lux) and 28.56% (6000 lux). Similar to the case of 1 sun illumination, the efficiencies of the TP-based dyes (MD4 and MD6) are significantly lower: for MD4, 6.39% to 8.62% as the irradiance varies from 300 to 6000 lux; for MD6, 12.08% to 16.86% as the irradiance varies from 300 to 6000 lux. Based on the results under 1 sun illumination, the lower VOC values of MD4 and MD6 can be attributed to less effective dark current suppression and lower JSC values due to their less efficient electron injection.

We have developed four new D–A′–π–A type sensitizers (MD4–MD7) with thieno[3,4-b]pyrazines (TP) and benzo[3,4-b]pyrazine (BP) as the auxiliary acceptor. Incorporation of the 3,4-dihexyloxyphenyl moiety at the 2- and 3-sites of TP and BP improves the solubility of the dyes in organic solvents and helps with suppression of dark current in the DSSCs. The best efficiency of 8.21% for MD7 reaches 92% of that of the N719-based standard cell. Addition of 1 mM CDCA as a co-adsorbent helps with alleviation of dye aggregation and improvement of cell performance. Consequently, MD7 has an efficiency of 9.03%, which surpassed that of the N719-based cell. The DSSCs based on MD5 and MD7 have cell efficiencies >15% under 300 lux irradiance (T5 fluorescent light source). The cell efficiency of MD7 reaches 18.95% under 300 lux and 27.17% under 6000 lux irradiance.
