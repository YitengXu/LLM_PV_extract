A class of polymers (POT-DH, POT-HCN and POT-DCN) were synthesized and they contain the same donor (BDT) and acceptor units but different numbers of cyano (CN)-groups, i.e. 0, 1 and 2. We investigated for the first time the effects of different CN-group numbers on the optoelectronic, molecule packing, film morphology and photovoltaic properties of three conjugated polymers. With increased CN-group number, broader absorption, smaller optical bandgap and lower HOMO level can be obtained. The planarity of polymers also decreases with increasing CN-groups, leading to different inter-molecular packing and morphology. The incorporation of two CN-groups results in poor morphology, inefficient charge transfer and very low device performance. Due to the optimized POT-HCN polymer possessing the most balanced properties, the best PCE of 4.21% was demonstrated by POT-HCN with one CN-group. Thus we believe that, by controlling the number of introduced CN-groups, we can generally fine-tune the planarity and LUMO/HOMO levels of this class of polymers to achieve desired optoelectronic properties and morphology for high photovoltaic performance. This also provides a feasible way for optimizing other photovoltaic semiconducting polymers by adjusting the number of electron-withdrawing units.

As a potential and promising renewable energy source, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant attention recently. However, until now the device power conversion efficiency (PCE) still remains one of the key factors hindering their practical application. It is well-known that the PCE is proportional to the open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) of PSCs. To obtain high Voc, Jsc, and FF, many efforts have been devoted to modify the chemical structure of conjugated polymers to tune their optoelectronic properties, and consequently improve the performance of PSCs. Generally, the structural modifications have been focused on adjusting the solubilizing alkyl group, conjugated substituent group and polymer backbone. However, the incorporation of electron-withdrawing groups in a D–A type polymer, such as cyano (CN)-group, fluorine moiety, carbonyl-group and carboxyl-group, can also significantly affect the physical and chemical properties of the modified polymer, such as solubility, crystallinity, absorbance, and electrochemical and interchain-packing properties. Specifically, as a strong electron-withdrawing unit, the CN-group has been widely adopted in small molecules. The CN-group can significantly lower the LUMO (the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) level while lowering the HOMO (the highest occupied molecular orbital) level only slightly, resulting in changes in a small molecule's physical and electrochemical properties and photovoltaic performance. For example, Li and coworkers have reported that the introduction of a CN-group into a small molecule's backbone lowered both the LUMO and HOMO energy levels, leading to significantly increased PCE from 1.99% to 3.85%. However, compared to the successful application in small molecules, the use of CN-groups in polymers for OPV application has only limited success. Therefore, more investigation may be required to better understand the effect of the CN-group on the properties and photovoltaic performance of conjugated polymers.

In our previous work, we designed and synthesized four new homologous polymers, composed of benzo[1,2b:4,5b′]dithiophene (BDT) donor and fumaronitrile (BCNV) acceptor comonomers with different π-bridges. Two CN-groups were introduced into all the four polymers to achieve desired physical and electrochemical properties and high photovoltaic performance. Although broadened absorption and high Voc were achieved, the devices only demonstrated extremely low PCEs. We concluded that it is mainly due to the polymer's relatively low LUMO levels and poor backbone planarity, induced by the CN-groups. Thus we proposed to optimize the number of CN-groups in the polymer structure to achieve the proper LUMO energy levels to provide sufficient downhill driving force for the exciton dissociation. In addition, the polymer planarity could also be changed by the number of introduced CN-groups, consequently affecting the inter-molecular packing and the morphology of the formed film.
Based on the above consideration, three polymers (POT-DH, POT-HCN and POT-DCN) were synthesized, which contain the same donor (BDT) and acceptor units but different numbers of CN-groups, i.e. 0, 1 and 2. The effects of the different CN-group numbers on polymers' optoelectronic, molecule packing, film morphology and photovoltaic performance were systematically investigated. By adjusting the CN-group, we have achieved semiconducting polymers with improved absorption range, HOMO/LUMO levels and backbone planarity compared to our previously reported polymers.

Toluene and THF were dried over sodium/benzophenone ketyl and distilled before using. DMF was distilled over CaH2. Chloroform, methanol and dichloromethane were used as received. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP. Al 4083) used for the fabrication of PSCs was purchased from Heraeus. Thiophene-2-carbaldehyde, 2-(thiophen-2-yl)acetonitrile and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received without further purification, unless otherwise noted. 2,6-Bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-di(2-octyldodecyloxy)-benzo[1,2-b; 3,4-b]-dithiophene (D) was prepared according to the literature.


1H NMR and 13C NMR data were respectively recorded on a Varian Unity Inova 400 MHz and a Varian NMR system 300 MHz spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS; δ = 0 ppm) as the internal standard. GC-MS spectra were recorded using a ThermoFisher Scientific GC/MS Trace-ISQ mass spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out by using a Perkin Elmer TGA4000 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in a nitrogen atmosphere. Molecular weight and molecular weight distribution (PDI) were determined against a polystyrene standard by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) on a PL-GPC 50 apparatus, and THF was used as the eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min−1 at 40 °C. UV-vis-NIR spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer model Lambda 750 instrument. Cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements were carried out using a Zahner IM6 electrochemical workstation. Tapping-mode AFM images were obtained with a Veeco Multimode V instrument. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission-electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were obtained by using a Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin transmission electron microscope.

PSCs were fabricated with a general structure of ITO/PEDOT-PSS (40 nm)/polymer:PCBM/LiF (0.6 nm)/Al (100 nm). Patterned ITO substrates were cleaned by ultrasonic treatment sequentially in detergent-water, acetone, deionized water and isopropyl alcohol, and finally treated by UV-ozone for 20 min. The PEDOT:PSS (∼40 nm) was spin-coated on ITO substrates and dried at 150 °C for 20 min. Then, blends of polymers and PCBM with different ratios were dissolved in chloroform or CB with or without DIO (2% v/v), and the solutions were filtered through a 0.45 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) filter. After deposition of the active layers with different spin-coating speeds for 40 s, 0.6 nm of LiF (0.1 Å s−1) and 100 nm Al (2 Å s−1) layers were thermally evaporated on the active layer at a pressure of 1.0 × 10−6 m bar through a shadow mask (active area: 7.25 mm2). The current density–voltage characteristics of the polymer solar cells were measured by using a Keithley 2400 (I–V) digital source meter under a simulated AM 1.5 G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U).

Hole-only devices were fabricated to measure the hole mobility of polymers by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The device structure was ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC61BM/MoO3/Al. The mobility is determined by fitting the dark current to the model of a single carrier SCLC, which is described by the equation:
where
J is the current, μh is the zero-field mobility, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, d is the thickness of the active layer, and V is the effective voltage. The effective voltage can be obtained by subtracting the built-in voltage (Vbi) and the voltage drop (Vs) from the substrate's series resistance from the applied voltage (Vappl), V = Vappl − Vbi − Vs.

The structure and synthesis route of the synthesized polymers are illustrated in Scheme 1. The detailed procedure is described in the experimental section. POT-DH, POT-HCN and POT-DCN were synthesized via Stille cross-coupling reaction. All polymers were obtained with high yields. The molecular weight was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis. The molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymers are listed in Table 1. POT-DH has a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 24.09 kDa, with a PDI of 2.52. POT-HCN has a Mn of 27.72 kDa with a PDI of 3.72 and POT-DCN has a Mn of 13.61 kDa with a PDI of 3.84. They all exhibited good solubility in common solvents at room temperature, like chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB).

As shown in Fig. 1, all polymers exhibited good thermal stability under a nitrogen atmosphere with the 5% weight-loss temperature (Td) at 331, 341 and 340 °C, for POT-DH, POT-HCN and POT-DCN, respectively, which is important for their applications in PSCs. Obviously, the introduction of CN-groups improved the polymer's thermal stability.

The UV-vis absorption of the polymers was investigated for both the dilute CHCl3 solutions and the thin films spin-coated on quartz substrates (Fig. 2a) with corresponding data summarized in Table 2. As seen in Fig. 2a, the dilute solution of POT-DH in CHCl3 shows narrow absorption ranging from 300 to 600 nm, while the POT-HCN and POT-DCN solutions show broader absorption bands ranging from 300 to 750 nm. POT-DH has two peaks at 530 and 563 nm respectively, and POT-HCN just has a single shoulder at 605 nm, while POT-DCN has two shoulders at 380 and 596 nm respectively. Obviously, with the increase of the CN-group number in the polymer, the absorption range extends gradually toward the long wavelength region. Similar results were observed for the film absorptions. The film absorption edges of POT-DH, POT-HCN and POT-DCN are 623 nm, 713 nm, and 776 nm, indicating optical bandgaps of 1.99 eV, 1.74 eV and 1.60 eV, respectively. Therefore, the optical bandgaps of polymers were decreased with more CN-groups.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to measure the electrochemical properties of polymers (Fig. S1, see the ESI). In the measurement, ferrocene was used as the internal standard (E1/2(ferrocene) = 0.71 V vs. Ag/AgCl). The HOMO/LUMO levels of polymers were calculated according to the equation:EHOMO/LUMO = [−(Eonset − 0.71) − 4.8] eV. As shown in Fig. 2b, with more CN-group numbers, the polymers show gradually decreased HOMO levels of −5.32, −5.54 and −5.59 eV for polymers POT-DH, POT-HCN and POT-DCN respectively, which is consistent with the results of the theoretical calculation (−4.78, −5.03 and −5.30 eV for the same three polymers respectively; see Fig. S2 in the ESI). In short, for the three polymers, relatively deep HOMO levels are realized due to the effect of BDT unit and the CN-groups, indicating a high Voc for the PSCs.

The effect of the CN-group number on the polymer inter-molecular packing was investigated via grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) measurement. The GIXD patterns of POT-DH, POT-HCN and POT-DCN are shown in Fig. 3a. The (010) peak corresponding to π–π stacking is more prominent in the out-of-plane direction, which suggests that most of the polymer π-faces are oriented parallel to the substrates (inset, Fig. 3a). This face-on orientation is considered to be beneficial for charge transport in the device. With increased CN-group number, the intensity of the (010) peak of polymers decreases in the order POT-DH > POT-HCN > POT-DCN. It should be noted that no obvious signal of the (010) peak can be observed for POT-DCN. The same results can also be obtained from the 1D-graph of the GIXD (see Fig. S3 in the ESI). Thus the inter-molecular packing of POT-DCN may be very poor, leading to a rather amorphous film (Fig. 3a, inset).

To confirm that, we further studied the structural properties of the polymers by theoretical computation at the B3LYP/6-31G* level on the model compound by using Gaussian 09 program suite. We calculated the dihedral angles between the two repeating units in POT-DH, POT-HCN and POT-DCN (Fig. 3b). The gradually increased dihedral angles (Fig. 3b) of the three polymers reveal that the planarity of the polymers gets worse in the order POT-DH > POT-HCN > POT-DCN. And the corresponding side-views of the molecules are displayed in Fig. 3c, which show that the POT-DCN backbone is mostly twisted. These results of the theoretical study are consistent with the results of GIXD measurement. It is clear that with increased number of CN-groups (from 0 to 2), the planarity of polymers becomes poorer, ascribed to the stronger steric hindrance of CN-groups compared to that of hydrogen atoms.

To elucidate the relationship between the CN-group number and the device performance, PSCs with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC61BM/LiF/Al were fabricated based on blends of POT-DH, POT-HCN or POT-DCN together with PC61BM. Different solvents and different D–A weight ratios have been investigated to optimize the device performance (Table S1, see the ESI). The photovoltaic parameters of PSCs under optimized conditions are summarized in Table 3 for comparison, with I–V curves shown in Fig. S4a (see the ESI). Without using DIO, the Voc of POT-DH based PSCs is 0.70 V, which is significantly lower than the 0.83 V of the POT-HCN based device, likely due to the shallower HOMO levels. The FF values of POT-DH and POT-HCN are 60.5% and 59.6% respectively, which are much higher than the 24% of POT-DCN. We attributed the difference to the worse inter-molecular packing of the latter, induced by the extra CN-group. After the addition of 2% DIO, PCEs of PSCs based on all polymers were improved significantly, mainly due to the hugely increased Jsc. Specifically, the POT-HCN based devices exhibit the highest PCE of 3.03% with Voc = 0.79 V, Jsc = 7.05 mA cm−2, and FF = 54.4%, which is over 10% higher than the 2.72% of POT-DH based ones (with Voc = 0.70 V, Jsc = 6.77 mA cm−2, and FF = 57.5%), mainly attributed to the larger Voc. Note that with or without DIO, POT-DCN based devices show an extremely low PCE around 0.01%. Further optimization was performed by using PC71BM instead of conventional PC61BM to enhance the absorbance (Fig. 4a). As expected, the resultant solar cells exhibit increased Jsc, whereas other parameters, including Voc and FF, remain almost unchanged compared to devices using PC61BM (Table 4). By using PC71BM, the PCEs of the devices were improved dramatically from 2.72% to 3.73% for POT-DH and from 3.03% to 4.21% for POT-HCN, while there was almost no change for POT-DCN (from 0.02% to 0.03%). Fig. 4b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the PSCs based on polymer/PC71BM blends with 2% DIO. Maximum EQE values of 58.7% at 460 nm, 55.9% at 410 nm and 1.4% at 390 nm were recorded for the PSCs based on POT-DH, POT-HCN and POT-DCN, respectively. The Jsc calculated by integrating the EQE curve with an AM 1.5G reference spectrum is within ∼5% error compared to the corresponding Jsc obtained from the J–V curves.

The hole mobilities of the photosensitive layers were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method using a device structure of ITO/PEDOT/polymer:PC61BM/MoO3(evapo-rated)/Al. The calculated hole mobilities based on polymer/PC61BM blends are 1.9 × 10−4, 9.7 × 10−5 and 8.5 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for POT-DH, POT-HCN and POT-DCN, respectively. The results are consistent with the theoretical calculation, GIXD spectra and device performance.

It is well-known that the performance of BHJ PSCs also depends on the physical interaction of the donor and acceptor components, which is directly manifested by the blend film morphology. An ideal BHJ PSC should possess a bicontinuous composite of donor and acceptor with a maximum interfacial area for exciton dissociation and a mean domain size commensurate with the exciton diffusion length (5–10 nm). The two components should phase-segregate on a suitable length scale to allow maximum ordering within each phase and thus effective charge transport in continuous pathways to the electrodes so as to minimize the recombination of free charges. Such requirements necessitate that the favorable phase separation balance between the mixing and demixing of the two components be achieved. Therefore, film morphology is a key parameter to explain the difference of photovoltaic performance. We further investigated the morphology of the polymer:PC61BM (1:1.5, w/w) blend films by employing a tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 5, the average surface roughness (Ra) values of the polymer/PC61BM blend films are determined to be 1.75, 2.35 and 2.39 nm for POT-DH, POT-HCN and POT-DCN, respectively. The domains on the surface of POT-DCN/PC61BM are evidently larger than those of the POT-DH/PC61BM film, indicating unfavorable phase separation. After the addition of DIO, Ras of the corresponding blend films are determined to be 1.08, 1.60 and 2.93 nm respectively. Apparently, the addition of DIO makes the blend films of POT-DH and POT-HCN much smoother, but not for the film of POT-DCN. We confirmed the observation by transmission-electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 6) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission-electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) (Fig. S5). As shown in Fig. 6, the polymer or fullerene-rich domains become much smaller after the addition of DIO, suggesting better mixing and more efficient charge transfer between the two components. In STEM images, the contrast between polymer and fullerene is enhanced, leading to clearer observation of the morphology evolution. In Fig. S5, the size of polymer-rich domains in a POT-DCN/PC61BM film is about 200 nm, which is too large for efficient exciton dissociation. In addition, the domains are separated from each other, indicating huge boundary resistance and very poor charge transport between domains. In contrast, the domains in the blend films of the other two polymers are interconnected and significantly smaller. After the addition of DIO, the domains in a POT-DCN blend film are much smaller, but still not well connected, which accounts for the slight performance improvement. For the other two polymers, the DIO leads to further reduced domains and formation of nanoscale networks between donor and acceptor materials, facilitating both exciton dissociation and charge transport in the blend film. As a result, distinct improvements in photocurrent, from 4.12 and 2.45 to 6.77 and 7.05 mA cm−2 were achieved for POT-DH and POT-HCN based devices, respectively. Therefore, the CN-group number has a large impact on the film morphology and thus affects the device performance.


We further investigated the charge carrier dynamics in both pristine POT-DCN and POT-DCN/PC61BM blend films by the ultrafast transient transmission study. As shown in Fig. 7a and b, the transient transmission spectra of POT-DCN and POT-DCN/PC61BM blends at different detection wavelengths (from 600 to 1000 nm, every other 50 nm) changed very slowly in the first 5 ps, which indicates that there is no obvious ultrafast charge transfer occurring between POT-DCN and PC61BM. So the blend mixture showed almost no change in the transient relaxation process. This shows the inefficient charge transfer at the donor–acceptor interface, which is well consistent with the extremely low photocurrent and device parameters. It can be concluded that the LUMO level of POT-DCN is too low to guarantee a sufficient downhill driving force to overcome the exciton binding energy for efficient electron transfer, as illustrated in Fig. 7c.


In conclusion, we investigated for the first time the effects of different CN-group numbers on the optoelectronic, structural, morphology and photovoltaic properties of three conjugated polymers POT-DH, POT-HCN and POT-DCN. With increased CN-group number, broader absorption, smaller optical bandgap and lower HOMO levels can be obtained. The planarity of polymers also decreases with increased CN-groups, leading to different inter-molecular packing and morphology. The incorporation of two CN-groups results in poor morphology, inefficient charge transfer and very low device performance. The best PCE of 4.21% was demonstrated by POT-HCN with one CN-group. Thus we believe that, by controlling the number of introduced CN-groups, we can generally fine-tune the planarity and LUMO/HOMO levels of this class of polymers to achieve desired optoelectronic properties and morphology for high photovoltaic performance.
