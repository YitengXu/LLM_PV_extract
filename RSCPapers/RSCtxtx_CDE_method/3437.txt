The modification of π-linkers represents a viable strategy to improve the performance of organic dye in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). On the basis of the π-linker modification, four cyclic thiourea functionalized dyes (AZ260, AZ261, AZ262, and AZ263) were synthesized and their effects on the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) were investigated. The results showed that AZ261 bearing an n-hexyl chain on the π-linker generated higher Jsc (16.02 mA cm−2) and Voc (739.4 mV) than AZ6 without a substituent on the bithiophene (Jsc = 15.89 mA cm−2, Voc = 729.2 mV, PCE = 7.20%), and a higher PCE of 7.42% was obtained from AZ261. Furthermore, insertion of a double-bond into the π-linker (AZ263) yielded the highest Jsc (17.83 mA cm−2) with a somewhat lower Voc (719.2 mV), and delivered the highest PCE up to 8.24%. In addition, the function of mesoporous spherical TiO2 on the photoanodes were also systematically examined and proven to be beneficial in increasing the Jsc.

Since the pioneering work reported by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991, significant advances have been made in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). As the key component of DSSCs, sensitizers have evolved into two general classes: metal-complex sensitizers and organic sensitizers. Organic sensitizers have attracted ever-increasing attention due to their unique advantages such as facile modification and purification, readily available raw materials, low cost, and high molar extinction coefficients compared to metal-complex sensitizers. DSSCs based on organic sensitizers have reached a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼10%, which needs to be further improved. Therefore, how to enhance the PCE of DSSCs is a topic full of challenge. Under a given incident illumination intensity (Pin), the PCE of a cell is defined by the short-circuit current density (Jsc), the open-circuit voltage (Voc), and the fill factor (FF), as follows:
Obviously, high values of Jsc and Voc are critical to improve the PCE. There are many factors that can affect the Jsc, such as the light absorption range of sensitizers, sensitizer-loading capacity on TiO2 photoanodes and scattering layers. The Voc is determined by the difference between the Fermi level of the TiO2 and the redox level of the redox couple in the electrolyte. Under the same assembling conditions, however, the different Voc values are more likely determined by the differences in electron lifetimes or recombination rates. Therefore, further structural optimization of organic sensitizers and selection of the materials used in DSSC fabrication for high Jsc and Voc are challenges that need to be addressed. With this in mind, our previous work reported that the cyclic thiourea functionalized triphenylamine as a donor to construct the dye molecules. The dyes containing such donor displayed a high Jsc combined with a high Voc due to their broad light absorption band and suppression of dye aggregations. We found that the π-linkers have a significant effect on the Jsc and Voc. Several dye substrates are valuable, which contain the thiophene as the π-linker and generally exhibit high Jsc and limited Voc. The high Jsc might be explained by the prominent electron-transport properties of the bithiophene and the broad absorption band, while the low Voc may be caused by the shorter electron lifetimes from the DSSCs. It was reported that the introduction of alkyl chains can effectively inhibit the intermolecular π–π aggregation and electron recombination for the purpose of reducing voltage losses; however, the remarkable molecular twist because of the strong steric hindrance in the conjugated unit will weaken the conjugation, and thus make the maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) blue-shift. In addition, one double-bond insertion between the triphenylamine and thiophene units has a great influence on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs, especially Jsc and Voc. In this study, our effort to improve the Jsc and Voc by the modification of the bithiophene linkers is described. Four dyes containing cyclic thiourea functionalized triphenylamine as donors and thiophene/bithiophene as π-linkers (AZ260, AZ261, AZ262 and AZ263 of Fig. 1) were designed and synthesized, and their DSSC performances were evaluated as well, with the objective being to exploit the advantages and remedy the shortages of bithiophenes as conjugated units. In addition to this, the effect of the mesoporous spherical TiO2 (ref. 19) overlayer on the photovoltaic properties was also examined.

All chemicals and solvents were purchased from Aladdin-reagent Co. and Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. and used without further purification unless stated otherwise. THF was dried by sodium before use. The synthetic routes of AZ260–263 are shown in Scheme 1. The synthesis of starting materials 1 and 5 were reported in our previous paper, and the synthetic details of intermediates 2, 3-a, 3-b, 3-c, 4-a, 4-b, 4-c, 6, and 7 are described in the ESI. The synthetic procedures of AZ260–263 are described below.

In a 50 mL 3-necked flask, the compound 4-a, 4-b, 4-c or 7 (0.70 mmol), acetic acid (50 mL), cyanoacetic acid (1.75 mmol) and ammonium acetate (2.10 mmol) were added in turn under a nitrogen atmosphere, and the reaction mixture was refluxed for 5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into ice water. Then, the precipitate was filtered, washed with distilled water, and purified by column chromatography (silica gel, 200–300 mesh; PE-DCM mixture as the eluent; where PE is petroleum ether, and DCM is dichloromethane) to obtain the product AZ260–263 as a dark purple solid.

UV-Vis absorption/reflectance spectra were obtained by a Shimadzu UV-Vis-NIR Spectrophotometer UV-3600. For the estimation of the dye-loading capacity, the dye adsorbed onto the TiO2 photoanode was dissolved in a 0.1 g mL−1 NaOH solution (H2O–ethanol–THF (1:1:1, v/v/v) mixture as the solvent), and its absorption property was characterized using a UV-Vis-NIR Spectrophotometer.


The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry studies were conducted on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The redox potentials of the dyes were measured in a MeCN-DCM (3:1, v/v) solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) as a supporting electrolyte (working electrode: glassy carbon; counter electrode: Pt; reference electrode: non-aqueous Ag/Ag+ electrode) under an Ar atmosphere. The redox potentials were calibrated with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the internal reference. Electrical impedance spectra (EIS) for DSSCs under dark with bias −0.7 V were also measured with a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation at frequencies of 0.05–100000 Hz. The magnitude of the alternative signal was 10 mV. Charge-transfer resistances were determined by fitting the impedance spectra using Z-view software.


The glass plates (F-doped SnO2, 14 M/sq, >90% transparency in the visible region, Geao, China) were sequentially cleaned in a detergent solution for 30 min, acetone solution for 15 min, and deionized water for 15 min using an ultrasonic bath. They were coated with four layers of TiO2 (20 nm, Geao, China) by a screen-printing method. The film was then sequentially sintered at 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and finally 480 °C for 15 min. The sintered films were then covered with a layer of scattering particles (200 nm spherical particles of TiO2 or 400 nm mesoporous spheres of TiO2), followed by calcination using the above-mentioned method. TiO2 photoanodes composed of a 6.5 μm nanoparticle (20 nm TiO2) layer in direct contact with the FTO substrate and 3.5 μm light scattering particle (200 nm spherical particles of TiO2 or 400 nm mesoporous spheres of TiO2) layer were fabricated with a screen printing method. The thickness of the TiO2 film was measured by SEM (Quanta 200) and the result was about 10 μm. Upon cooling to room temperature, the TiO2 photoanodes were immersed in solutions of 0.4 mM organic dye in tert-butanol-acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) at room temperature for 24 h. The counter electrode was prepared by screen-printing a paste of Pt (Geao, China) on an FTO substrate and sintering at 400 °C under air for 15 min. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 photoanode and a counter electrode were then assembled into a sealed DSSC cell with a sealant spacer (25 μm, Surlyn 1702) between the two electrode plates. A drop of electrolyte solution [1.0 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.1 M LiI, 0.12 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in 3-methoxypropionitrile] was introduced into the cell through a drilled hole via vacuum back-filling. Finally, the hole was sealed using the sealant and a cover glass.

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs were measured under illumination with AM 1.5 G solar light from a 300 W xenon lamp solar simulator (94022A, Newport Co., USA). The incident light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 with a standard silicon solar cell. J–V characteristics were recorded with a digital source meter (Keithley 2400) controlled by a computer. The action spectra of monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for solar cells were tested on a commercial setup (QTest Station 2000 IPCE Measurement System, Crowntech, USA).

Fig. 2 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the dyes in MeCN-DCM (3:1, v/v) solution and on 6.5 μm TiO2 films, and the corresponding photophysical data are listed in Table 1. All of the dyes exhibited two distinct absorption bands in solution, one is from the local π–π* absorption in the UV region and the other arises from intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) absorption in the visible region. Compared with AZ6, AZ261 exhibited a blue-shifting of 19 nm in the maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) with a lower molar extinction coefficient (ε), which could be attributed to large steric effect due to the hexyl chain attached to the bithiophene. Furthermore, introducing a methyl into the bithiophene, AZ262 displayed the λmax at 348 nm with an absorption shoulder at around 430 nm due to the weaker ICT absorption overlapped by the π–π* absorption. Obviously, the ICT absorption decreased with the introduction of alkyl chains. However, AZ260 showed not only a blue-shift in λmax but also low absorption intensity due to the small π-conjugated system caused by the thiophene linker. To further understand the relationship between the length of the π-linker and absorption properties, AZ263 containing a double-bond on the π-linker was compared with AZ261, and it was found that the insertion of one double-bond between triphenylamine and bithiophene units resulted in a 26 nm red-shift in λmax and broadened the absorption band. In addition, the absorption of the dye-coated TiO2 films also followed the trend of those in solutions but the absorption band red-shifted. Notably, the absorption intensity from 400 to 650 nm was significantly enhanced for all the dyes, which could be explained by the increased delocalization of the π* orbital of the conjugated skeleton caused by the interaction between the carboxylate group and the Ti4+ ions, and the energy of the π* level was directly decreased. This is beneficial for harvesting the visible light.

The redox potentials were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) to evaluate the HOMO–LUMO energy levels and the electron transfer process from the excited dye molecule to the conduction band of TiO2, and the cyclic voltammograms of the dyes are shown in Fig. 3. All of the dyes showed oxidation/re-reduction processes within a positive potential range and reduction/oxidation processes within a negative potential range, indicating that these dyes have the capability to transport both electrons and holes. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels (EHOMO and ELUMO), as well as the electrochemical energy gap (Eecg), were calculated from the onset oxidation potentials (Eox) and the onset reduction potentials (Ered) by assuming the energy level of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) to be −4.72 eV below the vacuum level.

The results (Table 1) demonstrated that all of the dyes have sufficiently high ELUMO and are energetically favorable for electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2 (ca. −4.0 eV vs. vacuum). The EHOMO also favors the regeneration of the oxidized dye by I−/I3− redox couple (−4.80 eV vs. vacuum). AZ263 showed narrower a Eecg than the other dyes, indicating that such molecular architecture would be more beneficial to the electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor.

To theoretically explain the dependence of the absorption properties and the electronic properties on the variations in the linkers, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted using the Gaussian 03 program package at the B3LYP/6-311G(d, p) level, and the calculated results are also recorded in Table 1.

From the optimized geometry (Fig. 4) of AZ260, AZ261, AZ262 and AZ6, the dihedral angles between the phenyl and the adjacent thiophene (θ1) were calculated to be in the range from 19° to 26°. As for AZ263, however, it was found that the phenyl was entirely in plane with the thiophene due to the insertion of the double-bond between them. This planar configuration maximized the π-conjugation pathway throughout the whole molecule and brought a remarkable red-shift in the maximum absorption band, which is in line with the UV-Vis absorption spectra discussed above. The dihedral angle between the thiophene and the adjacent thiophene (θ2) in AZ6, AZ261, and AZ262 are 15.01°, 20.33° and 52.93°, respectively. Obviously, AZ261 and AZ262 exhibit more twisted dihedral angles due to the introduction of the hexyl and the methyl with large steric effect, which results in a blue-shift of the maximum absorption band. Nevertheless, the detrimental blue-shift could be compensated for by the addition of a double-bond into the π-linker.
As shown in Fig. 5, the HOMO and LUMO perfectly revealed the donor–acceptor character of the cyclic thiourea functionalized triphenylamine and the anchoring groups. Such dye architecture provides an energy gradient for the excitation and facilitated the HOMO to LUMO charge transfer transition, which is crucial to afford a favorable energetic pathway for electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2. A closer look at the calculated EHOMO and ELUMO revealed the impact of the subtle variations of molecular structure in these systems. AZ260 and AZ6 have the same ELUMO, but the EHOMO of the latter is much higher than that of the former along with the extension of conjugation length. Although AZ261 and AZ262 contain the same conjugated skeleton as AZ6, the hexyl chain attached to the bithiophene induced the increase of the EHOMO and ELUMO of AZ261; however, continuing to introduce the methyl to the bithiophene resulted in the decrease of the EHOMO and ELUMO of AZ262. AZ263 displayed a lower ELUMO than AZ261, but the EHOMO of both showed no changes, which could be ascribed to the enhancement of the conjugated linker through the insertion of one double-bond. In addition, compared with the EHOMO and ELUMO of AZ263 with those of AZ6, the results showed that the introduction of one double-bond and a hexyl chain into the π-linker not only drove up the HOMO level but also drove down the LUMO level, resulting in a narrow energy gap (Eg). It should be noted that the Eg from the DFT calculation is bigger than the Eecg from the experiment, which is a common feature of organic optoelectronic materials and may be related to the solvent effect; but the relationship between them is linear (Fig. S1).

To validate the effect of the photoanode on the photovoltaic performance, 200 nm spherical particles of TiO2 (labeled SP200) and 400 nm mesoporous spherical TiO2 film (labeled MS400) as scattering layers were, respectively, coated on 20 nm nanocrystalline TiO2 film (labeled NC), which formed bilayered NC-SP200 film and NC-MS400 film as the photoanodes. In order to gain further insight into the photoanodes, the morphology (ESI), physical properties and dye-loading capacities were investigated.

Fig. 6a and b show the diffuse reflectance spectra of NC, SP200, and MS400 without and with AZ261. It was observed that the reflectance in the visible region decreased in the order of SP200 > MS400 > NC. The reflectance of NC with AZ261 was almost less than 5%, which indicates that it barely reflects the incident light. The absorption spectra (Fig. 6c and d) demonstrated that SP200 changed less before and after loading AZ261, while NC and MS400 changed more. It is worth noting that the absorption intensity of NC with AZ261 is markedly enhanced in the range from 400 nm to 650 nm. As shown in Fig. 6e, the absorption intensity represents the dye-loading capacity of the TiO2 film (NC > MS400 > SP200), which corresponds to the actual objects (Fig. 6f). Obviously, the scattering layer MS400 plays an assistant role in loading dye. The merit of MS400 as the scattering layer can be elaborated by the schematic diagrams (Fig. S3). Some of the incident light is lost when it passes through the absorbing layer NC, as it can be reflected back into the nanocrystalline TiO2 film by SP200 and MS400. To further quantify the dye-loading capacity of NC, NC-SP200, and NC-MS400, desorption experiments (ESI) were carried out, and the results are summarized in Table 2. Compared with NC, NC-SP200 increased by 8.75%, while NC-MS400 increased by 36.25%.

The J–V characteristics of AZ261 based on three distinct photoanodes are shown in Fig. S5. The photovoltaic performance parameters are summarized in Table 2. Obviously, the NC cell shows the lowest PCE of 6.31% with a Jsc as low as 13.16 mA cm−2. For the NC-SP200 cell, the Jsc is significantly enhanced to 14.52 mA cm−2 with a PCE of 6.94%. Moreover, the Jsc of the NC-MS400 cell is significantly enhanced to 15.94 mA cm−2 with a PCE of 7.35%, which is ascribed to the combined effect of the relatively high specific surface area of the mesoporous spherical TiO2 and light-scattering. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the NC-MS400 cell provides the optimal dual effects of the highest dye-loading and optical confinement, resulting in a noticeable improvement of Jsc and PCE.

The J–V characteristics and IPCE spectra of the dyes based on NC-MS400 photoanode are shown in Fig. 7a and b. The corresponding photovoltaic data are collected in Table 3.

The Jsc values increased in the following order: AZ260 (13.91 mA cm−2) < AZ262 (15.02 mA cm−2) < AZ6 (15.89 mA cm−2) < AZ261 (16.02 mA cm−2) < AZ263 (17.83 mA cm−2). The values of Jsc are closely related to the integral of the IPCE spectra. For example, AZ260 with only one thiophene as the π-linker afforded the lowest Jsc because of the narrowest spectral response and lowest IPCE maximum (71.05% at 490 nm) among these dyes. A comparison of AZ6 with AZ260 demonstrated that the benefit of employing bithiophene is to enhance light-harvesting and improve the photocurrent. Although AZ261, AZ262, and AZ6 contained the same π-conjugated skeleton, AZ261 displayed a relatively high Jsc. This could be mainly attributed to its coplanar structure. However, AZ262 showed a relatively low Jsc in spite of the highest IPCE maximum (83.50% at 490 nm). This phenomenon could be explained by its spectral limitation caused by the twisted structure. Among these dyes, AZ263 gave rise to the highest Jsc because electrons could be more easily transferred through the coplanar structure into the TiO2; moreover, the planar configuration causes a remarkably broadened absorption band, which is beneficial to the improvement of the light-harvesting capacity. In addition, the IPCE spectrum of AZ263 exhibited a significantly larger area than the others.
The Voc values increased in the following order: AZ260 (709.0 mV) < AZ263 (719.2 mV) < AZ6 (729.2 mV) < AZ261 (739.4 mV) < AZ262 (749.4 mV). The EIS was investigated to further elucidate the Voc results and obtain more interfacial charge transfer information. In the Nyquist plots (Fig. 7c), the larger semicircle in the low frequency region corresponds to charge-transfer resistance (Rrec) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface; e.g., a larger radius indicates a larger Rrec and slower electron recombination. In addition, the electron lifetime could be calculated from the Bode phase plots (Fig. 7d). The calculated results increased in the order of AZ260 (21.1 ms) < AZ263 (21.8 ms) < AZ6 (24.5 ms) < AZ261 (29.5 ms) < AZ262 (32.2 ms). Both the Rrec and electron lifetime coincided well with Voc. The enlarged Rrec and lengthened electron lifetime further indicated that the electron recombination between the injected electrons and the electrolyte was decreased, resulting in an increased Voc. Under the same π-conjugated conditions, the Voc gradually increases with the introduction of alkyl substituents into π-linkers (AZ6 < AZ261 < AZ262). This is because the twisted nonplanar structures can reduce intermolecular aggregation and suppress the electron recombination. However, AZ263 showed a lower Voc than AZ261 because of the introduction of one double-bond in AZ263, resulting in a narrower Eg as mentioned above, or a faster electron recombination.
The differences in PCE are caused by the different Jsc and Voc. Among these DSSC devices, DSSC based on AZ260 delivered a poor PCE of 6.73% due to its lowest Jsc and Voc. In comparison with AZ6, AZ261 offered relatively high Jsc and Voc, resulting in a higher PCE of 7.42%. However, AZ262 yielded a lower PCE of 6.91% due to the lower Jsc caused by the narrower IPCE spectra. Encouragingly, the DSSC from AZ263 with the highest Jsc of 17.83 mA cm−2, which overwhelms the unfavorable effect of Voc, exhibited a PCE as high as 8.24%.

In summary, four cyclic thiourea functionalized dyes have been synthesized and their DSSC performances were evaluated as well. On the premise of coplanar structure, the absorption bands were broadened by increasing the length of the π-conjugated linker, i.e. the augmentation of the conjugated thiophene number or the insertion of the double-bond, which can enhance the light-harvesting and improve the Jsc. The steric hindrance of the dye molecule was efficiently increased by introducing alkyl substituents into the bithiophene linker, which can suppress the intermolecular π–π aggregation and the electron recombination, resulting in an increased Voc. Moreover, a comparison of AZ263 with AZ6 showed that the introduction of one double-bond along with a hexyl chain into the π-linker not only drove up the HOMO level but also drove down the LUMO level, resulting in the improvement of Jsc. In addition, the double-layered photoanode (NC-MS400) with 400 nm mesoporous spherical TiO2 film as the scattering layer provided the optimal dual effects of the highest dye-loading and optical confinement, resulting in a noticeable improvement of Jsc. Our systematic investigation of the Jsc and Voc from two aspects of π-linker modification and photoanode selection will provide a wealth of opportunity for designing new efficient organic dyes and optimizing DSSCs' performance.
