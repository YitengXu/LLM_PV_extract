With the cooperative effects of pre-treatment with a polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG4000) additive and post-treatment with sulfuric acid (H2SO4), the conductivity of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) was improved remarkably. By this method, the pre-treatment PEG4000 additive would form hydrogen bonds with the PSS in PEDOT:PSS, which can effectively reduce the interactions between PEDOT and PSS. Subsequently, the post-treatment H2SO4 could efficiently wash away the intrinsic PSS together with the insulating PEG4000 additive, which not only improved the crystallization but also further optimized the conformation of the PEDOT chains. Meanwhile, the work function of the resulting PEDOT:PSS (S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5 wt%)) was remarkably reduced and it became more suitable for use as a cathode, compared with pristine PEDOT:PSS. By means of these simple process technologies, a highly conductive and transparent PEDOT:PSS film was achieved. A polymer solar cell device using S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5 wt%) as the cathode realized a notable power conversion efficiency of 8.1%, which was even superior to an indium tin oxide cathode based device.

The transparent electrode, as an integral part of modern electronic equipment, still has actual research value, due to technological advancement and growing industrial demands. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), applied as a transparent electrode material, is the dominant candidate for replacing fragile indium tin oxide (ITO) in upcoming wearable electronic devices. PEDOT:PSS exhibits many advantages which are not available with ITO; for example, it is an affordable commercial product, but also can be prepared by solution processes. Meanwhile, treated PEDOT:PSS has excellent photoelectric properties, although these are slightly inferior to ITO.

Highly conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) can be easily dissolved in water by exploiting the interaction between PEDOT and the commonplace dispersant polystyrene sulfonate (PSS). However, a conductivity of less than 1 S cm−1 is shown by PEDOT:PSS film without any treatment, which is a fatal flaw in the electrical performance of any electronic device. Many reports have expended a great deal of effort exploring ways to improve this ultra-low conductivity, such as pre-treatment methods of adding additives (polyethylene glycol (PEG), sorbitol, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), etc.), post-treatment methods using various chemical reagents (methanol, sulfuric acid (H2SO4), ethylene glycol (EG), formic acid, etc.), thermal treatment and light treatment (UV light, UV-ozone). The mechanism for the increase in conductivity is mainly attributed to a conformational transition and reduction in the PSS content. However, there are still many drawbacks to those methods. For example, the smooth morphology of the PEDOT:PSS film is destroyed by adding a DMSO additive. Introducing an insulating PEG additive restricts the maximum conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. The highest conductivity so far is obtained by post-treatment with H2SO4, which is a more effective method when compared with post-treatment with other chemical reagents. The work function of PEDOT:PSS can be adjusted by UV-ozone treatment, however the film will be etched off and a small number of holes will appear due to excess plasma treatment. To break the bottlenecks of its energy level limit and low conductivity, new experimental ideas are urgently needed now.
Herein, we put forward a new concept based on previous experience to improve the quality of PEDOT:PSS by a combination of polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG4000) pre-treatment with H2SO4 post-treatment. This is expected to improve the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS without introducing too much insulating material into the film. The S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%) film shows a conductivity of 4027.4 S cm−1 with approximately 89% transmittance at 550 nm. This is ascribed to the optimized conformation of PEDOT, the decrease in the insulating PSS content and the low residual amount of insulating PEG4000. In addition, the work function of PEDOT:PSS can be substantially reduced by this combined treatment, so that the S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%) film becomes more suitable as a cathode. It has also been successfully applied in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell devices as a cathode, and an ITO-free device achieved a decent efficiency of 8.1%.

Different weight ratios (1.3%, 2.6%, 6.5%, 13%) of polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG4000) additive were added separately into a commercial PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (Clevios PH1000), and then shaken well before cold storage at between 2 and 8 °C. To evaluate the effect of the molecular weight on the properties, polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG6000) was also included. The same method of preparation was employed to obtain a PEDOT:PSS solution with 2.6 wt% of the PEG6000 additive.


Different types of PEDOT:PSS ink (pristine PEDOT:PSS and hybrid PEDOT:PSS) were spin-casted at 1500 rpm onto cleaned and dried glass substrates treated with ozone (3 minutes), followed by thermal annealing at 120 °C for 30 minutes on a hot plate. Eventually, pristine PEDOT:PSS, PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 and PEDOT:PSS:PEG6000 films serving as transparent electrodes were obtained after cooling to room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. Furthermore, the above-mentioned films (pristine PEDOT:PSS, PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 and PEDOT:PSS:PEG6000) were immersed in an H2SO4 (90%) solution for 10 or 20 minutes, and then were washed in a deionized water bath (10 minutes) prior to thermal annealing (120 °C, 15 minutes). Eventually, acid-treated PEDOT:PSS transparent conductive films (S-PEDOT:PSS, S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 and S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG6000) (∼40 nm) serving as transparent electrodes were obtained after cooling to room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere.

The film sheet resistances (Rsheet) were estimated adopting the four-point probe technique, and the corresponding film thicknesses (D) were acquired by a surface profilometer. Meanwhile, the relevant values for the resistivity can be calculated from the values of Rsheet and D, and the resistivity is the derivative of the conductivity. Transmittance spectra, X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra, Raman spectra, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, atomic force microscopy (AFM) images, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded by UV-Vis spectroscopy, a D8 FOCUS powder diffractometer (Bruker), an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo-VG Scientific), an InVia Raman Microscope system, a QuanTA-200F field emission environmental scanning electron microscope (FEI), a high resolution scanning probe microscope (Bruker), and a JEOL-2100F transmission electron microscope, respectively. The testing samples for TEM were prepared on copper grids using film transfer technology. In addition, the testing samples for XRD were obtained by drop-casting onto silicon substrates and the immersion time was adjusted to 3 hours in H2SO4 (90%) to get distinct XRD patterns.

The devices can be divided into two types: one is the conventional structure, glass substrate/anode/PEDOT:PSS Al 4083/active layer/lithium fluoride (LiF)/aluminum (Al), the other is the inverted structure, glass substrate/cathode/zinc oxide (ZnO)/active layer/molybdenum trioxide (MoO3)/silver (Ag). For the conventional devices, a cleaned indium tin oxide (ITO) anode or the prepared PEDOT:PSS anodes underwent ultraviolet-ozone treatment (4 minutes), followed by spin-coating with PEDOT:PSS Al 4083 on the anode, and then annealing at 120 °C (20 minutes). After that, an active layer of polythieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7):(6,6)-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) (1:1.5 w/w) with a DIO additive (97:3, v/v) was spin-coated on PEDOT:PSS Al 4083 (2 minutes, 1000 rpm) which was left to stand (25 °C, 1.5 h, nitrogen atmosphere), or an active layer of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):(6,6)-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) (1:0.8 w/w) was spin-coated on PEDOT:PSS Al 4083 before thermal annealing (150 °C, 10 minutes) in a glovebox. Finally, LiF (0.7 nm) and Al (100 nm) layers were applied by evaporation in sequence (6 × 10−4 Torr), obtaining the devices (with a 0.15 cm2 effective area for each cell). For the inverted devices, the ZnO precursor solution was spin-coated on the ultraviolet-ozone treated cleaned cathode, then thermally annealed (150 °C, 30 minutes). The conditions for forming the active layer are the same as those for the above-mentioned devices. Eventually, the devices were completed by applying MoO3 (5 nm) and Ag (90 nm) by evaporation. Each cell had an effective area of 0.15 cm2. The J–V curves were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter (Abet Solar Simulator Sun2000) under an AM 1.5G light source (100 mW cm−2).


The electrical and optical properties of pristine PEDOT:PSS films and PEDOT:PSS films pre-treated with 2.6 wt% of polyethylene glycols with different molecular weights (4000, 6000) (defined as PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (2.6%) and PEDOT:PSS:PEG6000 (2.6%)), and the corresponding films with sulfuric acid (H2SO4) post-treatment (S-PEDOT:PSS, S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (2.6%) and S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG6000 (2.6%)) are studied. Fig. 1a shows the electrical conductivity (σdc) of various PEDOT:PSS films. The immersion time of the films in H2SO4 solution was 10 minutes. This is consistent with previous reports that the σdc of pristine PEDOT:PSS can be increased by adding a PEG additive, and the σdc decreases gradually with an increase in the molecular weight (≥600) of the PEG. Compared to the conductivities of pristine PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (2.6%) or PEDOT:PSS:PEG6000 (2.6%), the σdc values of S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (2.6%) and S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG6000 (2.6%) show remarkable improvements. The above mentioned result could be predicted before the experiment on account of the breathtaking σdc of S-PEDOT:PSS films. The highest σdc of 2910.3 S cm−1 has been obtained for S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (2.6%). The inset in Fig. 1a indicates that the transmittance of a S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (2.6%) film isn’t affected by adding 2.6 wt% PEG4000 additive. Although the transmittance of PEDOT:PSS films pre-treated with PEG4000 is reduced recognizably upon increasing the PEG4000 additive content, the transmittance of the corresponding films employing H2SO4 post-treatment is not influenced until the PEG4000 additive content reaches 13 wt% (Fig. S1, ESI).

The σdc can be further enhanced by optimizing the immersion time of the PEDOT:PSS hybrid films in H2SO4 solution or adjusting the additive content. As presented in Fig. 1b, the optimized PEG4000 additive content is 6.5 wt%. In terms of the electrical properties, H2SO4-treated PEDOT:PSS films with different weight ratios of PEG4000 additive have a higher σdc with a smaller standard deviation when the immersion time of the films in H2SO4 solution is changed from 10 to 20 minutes. The H2SO4-treated PEDOT:PSS film with 6.5 wt% PEG4000 (S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%)) achieves the highest value of σdc-max of 4027.4 S cm−1. In the following test results, if not specified, the immersion time of the films in H2SO4 solution is 20 minutes.
The critical index indicating the properties of a transparent electrode can be assessed by the following equation:
where
σDC/σOp represents the ratio of the direct current (DC) conductivity vs. the optical conductivity of the film and T is the transmittance of the film at a wavelength of 550 nm. The higher the σDC/σOp value, the better the performance of the transparent electrode. In order to identify the properties of the electrodes, we make a comparison with some valuable results, as illustrated in Fig. 1c. It is evident that the film of PEDOT:PSS pre-treated with 6 vol% ethylene glycol has a low σDC/σOp of 22.9, whereas the PEDOT:PSS film treated with 2 vol% polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG200) shows a high σDC/σOp of 39.0. After H2SO4 treatment, the modified PEDOT:PSS film demonstrates a higher σDC/σOp of 40.9 with a transmittance of 80%. When using formic acid instead of H2SO4, the PEDOT:PSS film exhibits a relatively low σDC/σOp of 30.9 with a transmittance of 92.1%. In fact, the σDC/σOp value is 35.5 for the pristine PEDOT:PSS film employing the vapor phase polymerization technique. Prospectively, S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%) displays the highest σDC/σOp of 50.6, which makes it an ideal material for a transparent electrode.

To pursue the mechanism of the rapidly increasing conductivity, the orientation, chemical composition and conformation of PEDOT:PSS were investigated. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of pristine PEDOT:PSS, S-PEDOT:PSS and S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%) are shown in Fig. 2a. The four peaks at 2θ = 3.7° (d = 23.9 Å), 6.7° (d = 13.2 Å), 17.8° (d = 5.0 Å) and 25.7° (d = 3.5 Å) are the characteristic peaks of pristine PEDOT:PSS, where d refers to the lattice spacing. The first two diffraction peaks are attributed to the lamellar stacking distance d(100) of the obvious alternating structure of PEDOT and PSS, while the last two diffraction peaks correspond to the amorphous configuration of PSS and the interchain π–π stacking distance d(010) of PEDOT. The above results are close to others’ calculated results from simulated crystalline PEDOT:PSS where, as shown in Fig. 2b, d(100) = 14 Å and d(010) = 3.4 Å. For S-PEDOT:PSS, stronger and sharper peaks appear at 2θ = 6.3° and 12.4° in accord with other available reference literature, which indicates that S-PEDOT:PSS is more inclined to lamellar stacking between the obvious alternating structure of PEDOT and PSS. Moreover, when treated with H2SO4 or treated sequentially with PEG4000 additive and H2SO4, the d(100) peak of pristine PEDOT:PSS at 2θ = 6.7° is offset to a lower angle, but its d(010) peak at 2θ = 25.7° shifts to a higher angle, which suggest a broadened d(100) spacing and reduced d(010) spacing, respectively. The broadened d(100) spacing shows that PEDOT crystallites tend to an expanded-coil or linear conformation resulting in more planar lamellar stacking. The reduced d(010) spacing shows a decrease in the interchain π–π stacking distance of PEDOT, which implies crystallization enhancement, in terms of size or quantity. Surprisingly, the half-height peak width of the d(100) peak near 2θ = 6.7° is wider for S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%), compared to S-PEDOT:PSS, which indicates that the grain size is smaller. Besides this, the absence of the characteristic peaks of PEG4000 proves that the PEG4000 can be removed by H2SO4, which is evident at 2θ = 19.1° and 23.3° in PEDOT:PSS with 6.5 wt% PEG4000 (PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%)) (Fig. S2a, ESI).
Changes in the active ingredient content are further understood by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The two distinct peaks between 162 and 166 eV are the S(2p) characteristic peaks of the sulfur atoms (S) in the PEDOT molecules, and the S(2p) characteristic peaks of the S in the PSS molecules are located within the range of 166–172 eV, as demonstrated in Fig. 2c. Compared with pristine PEDOT:PSS, S-PEDOT:PSS shows a higher S(2p) intensity ratio of PEDOT vs. PSS. The intensity ratio further increases after adding PEG4000 and H2SO4 post-treatment. This means there is a decrease in the PSSH chain content of PEDOT:PSS. Furthermore, the PSS/PEDOT peak area ratio decreases from 3.49 to 1.55, then to 1.48, in sequence from pristine PEDOT:PSS to S-PEDOT:PSS and S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%) (Fig. S2b, ESI). The changes in the PSS/PEDOT peak area ratio demonstrate that the insulating PSS can be effectively removed by the sequential treatment of PEDOT:PSS with the PEG4000 additive and H2SO4.
There are two typical ground-state structures for PEDOT crystallites. One is a benzoid state preferring a coiled conformation, and the other is a quinoid state tending to an expanded-coil or linear conformation. The quinoid state is more dominant than the benzoid state in high-conductivity PEDOT:PSS hybrid films. A transition from the benzoid state to the quinoid state can be conjectured based upon a red-shifted Raman signal in the range of 1400–1500 cm−1. As displayed in Fig. 2d, compared with pristine PEDOT:PSS, S-PEDOT:PSS shows an apparent red-shift and a narrower band, and a further red-shift is observed for S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%). This result indicates that S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%) has a more quinoid PEDOT structure, presenting more of an expanded-coil or linear PEDOT conformation. This is one of the reasons for better conductivity than even S-PEDOT:PSS.
For in-depth insight into the evolution of PEDOT:PSS films with different treatments in terms of morphology, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI), the interface morphologies of pristine PEDOT:PSS, S-PEDOT:PSS and S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%) are relatively smooth without obvious differences, but PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%) differs. Nevertheless, compared with pristine PEDOT:PSS, a fairly rough surface and heterogeneous phase distribution can be seen by AFM in the PEDOT:PSS treated with different amounts of the PEG4000 additive (Fig. 3 and Fig. S4, ESI). After further treatment with H2SO4, there is a much smoother and more uniform surface for treated PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 3 and Fig. S5, ESI). This again proves that the PEG4000 additive can be eliminated from the PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%) film by H2SO4 treatment. The corresponding three-dimensional graphs clearly present more intuitive information on the morphology.
In addition, we find that two distinct phases of pristine PEDOT:PSS (uniform color) cannot be distinguished via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) because most of the PEDOT:PSS component exists in the film in the form of aggregates (Fig. 4a). However, the phase separation (∼68 nm, the two colors are arranged alternately in an orderly manner) is evident after H2SO4 treatment arising from the induction of the rigid quinoid structure in the PEDOT chains (Fig. 4c). Moreover, the nanofibril shape is more apparent for S-PEDOT:PSS than pristine PEDOT:PSS. After adding PEG4000 to the pristine PEDOT:PSS, no conspicuous change can be observed in addition to the appearance of the two phases (Fig. 4b). This result is caused by the formation of hydrogen bonds between the PEG4000 additive and PEDOT:PSS. However, S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%) shows greater phase separation (∼80 nm) than even S-PEDOT:PSS, which implies the emergence of a different mechanism (Fig. 4d).
Based on the above experimental results and analyses, a reasonable hypothesis for the mechanism is displayed in Fig. 5. The PEDOT chains gather together presenting a coiled conformation in pristine PEDOT:PSS, while a conformational transformation occurs and the separation of the two phases is less clear after adding the PEG4000 additive because of the formation of hydrogen bonds between PEG4000 and PSS weakening the interaction between PEDOT and PSS. The PEG4000 additive is removed via further H2SO4 treatment and a greater phase separation now exists between PEDOT and PSS. Furthermore, the PEDOT chains present more of an expanded-coil or linear conformation than even S-PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 5 and Fig. S6, ESI). This is probably because the sulfuric acid molecules are more easily able to penetrate into the PEG4000-weakened interaction region between PEDOT and PSS, resulting in the formation of a more rigid quinoid PEDOT backbone. Following the deionized water wash and heat treatment, the un-needed PSS chains and water are removed. An additional mechanism diagram for the PEDOT:PSS film treated with H2SO4 is shown in Fig. S6 (ESI).
It is a predictable discovery that introducing the PEG4000 additive can greatly decrease the work function, compared to pristine PEDOT:PSS, from 4.8340 eV to 4.1420 eV, as found by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) (Fig. 6a and c). Besides this, the work function of S-PEDOT:PSS is only slightly reduced from 4.8340 eV to 4.7330 eV compared to pristine PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 6a and b). However, it is an impressive discovery that the work function of S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%) is 4.5760 eV (between 4.1420 eV and 4.7330 eV), due to the PEG4000 additive being removed by the H2SO4 post-treatment (Fig. 6d). The above results are based on gold (Au) as the reference standard, and are consistent with ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (Fig. S7, ESI). The corresponding work functions of pristine and treated PEDOT:PSS, and a KPFM image of Au are calculated and summarized in Tables S1, S2 and Fig. S8 (ESI), respectively. According to our experience of device fabrication, S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%) may be more suitable as a cathode.
In order to thoroughly understand the optoelectronic properties of the S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 electrode, both conventional structure and inverted structure polymer solar cells were prepared with different anodes or cathodes, respectively. Two kinds of active layer were selected to make the experimental data more persuasive: one was poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM), and the other was polythieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene:[6,6]-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PTB7:PC71BM). The corresponding device architectures are displayed in the illustrations in Fig. 7 and the device parameters are summarized in Tables S3 and S4 (ESI). Comparing the devices based on a P3HT:PC61BM active layer, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) is improved markedly by using an S-PEDOT:PSS cathode instead of a PEDOT:PSS cathode, and can be further increased by using an S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (2.6% or 6.5%) electrode, where a weight ratio of 6.5% achieves the best Jsc (Fig. 7a and b). The reasons for this phenomenon are not only related to the S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%) electrode having the highest conductivity, which is favorable for the collection of charge carriers, but also to it having the lowest insulating PSS content, therefore decreasing carrier recombination (Fig. 1 and 2c). In addition, the improved current matches up with the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra that can estimate the Jsc value (Fig. S9, ESI). Moreover, the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the device with the S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%) electrode is superior to those of the devices with S-PEDOT:PSS or pristine PEDOT:PSS electrodes. The Voc of the device with an S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%) electrode and an inverted structure is also higher than that of the device with this electrode and a conventional structure (Fig. 7a and b). This is consistent with our previous speculation that the work function of S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%) is more beneficial for electron collection in an inverted device (Fig. 6). In terms of fill factor (FF), there is a slight improvement with the S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%) electrode, but it is still lower than that of the ITO electrode in Fig. 7a and b. We speculate that this may be connected with the change of the electrode morphology. Finally, the device based on S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%)/zinc oxide (ZnO)/P3HT:PC61BM/molybdenum trioxide (MoO3)/silver (Ag) produces a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.2%, even better than the efficiency of the device with the same structure using an ITO cathode.
Furthermore, similar phenomena also appear for the devices based on PTB7:PC71BM active layers (Fig. 7c and d). It is surprising to find that the FFs of various devices based on a PTB7:PC71BM active layer are greatly improved compared to those of the devices based on a P3HT:PC61BM active layer. The enhancement of the FF is closely correlated with the high conductivity and morphology and the appropriate work function of the S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%) cathode although the exact reason is still not clear. Among these devices, this inverted device with an S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%) cathode shows the highest PCE of 8.1%, even exceeding the device with the same structure with ITO in Fig. 7c.

To sum up, a simple experimental idea is proposed, which combines the advantages of two methods reasonably, and also eliminates their own defects, yielding an efficient PEDOT:PSS cathode material with a high conductivity and a low work function. S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%) shows a greater σdc-max, of 4027.4 S cm−1, than S-PEDOT:PSS under the same experimental conditions, because of the emergence of greater phase separation, more conformational transformation from the benzoid state to quinoid state and lower insulating PSS dispersant content. Meanwhile, the work function of pristine PEDOT:PSS is effectively lowered by the introduction of the PEG4000 additive, and is optimized by H2SO4 treatment resulting in a suitable work function, which implies that the prepared film can be used as a cathode. Eventually, an impressive PCE of 8.1% is realized using S-PEDOT:PSS:PEG4000 (6.5%) as a cathode, which can be expected to be used instead of ITO in fully flexible solar cells by transfer technology.
