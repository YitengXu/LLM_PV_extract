Ternary non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated with J71 as a donor and mixed ITIC:MeIC2 as acceptors. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the ternary PSCs reaches 11.6% for 20 wt% MeIC2 in the acceptors, which is larger than the 10.7% or 10.2% for binary PSCs with ITIC or MeIC2 as an acceptor. The PCE improvement of ternary PSCs is mainly attributed to the simultaneously enhanced short circuit current density (JSC) of 18.1 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 70.5%. The photon harvesting of ternary active layers can be optimized by adjusting MeIC2 content due to the complementary asborption of ITIC and MeIC2, leading to the enhanced JSC. Meanwhile, phase separation of ternary active layers can be further optimized for efficient exciton dissociation and more balanced charge transport. The improved FF can be well explained from the more balanced charge transport evaluated by the ratios of hole mobility to electron mobility in the active layers.

The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells (PSCs) has been constantly improved during the past few years due to the rapid development of versatile non-fullerene materials with adjustable molecular structures, energy levels and high absorption coefficients. Non-fullerene based PSCs also exhibit relatively higher PCEs compared with fullerene based PSCs, which are mainly attributed to the enhanced photon harvesting, the small driving force for exciton dissociation, the less energy loss and well controllable phase separation. Recently, PCEs of over 13% have been reported for non-fullerene PSCs with narrow bandgap materials. There is also some potential to further improve the performance of PSCs. The photon harvesting range of donor:acceptor blend films is still restricted due to the narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of about 100 nm of the absorption spectrum for organic materials. The adequate photon harvesting of active layers is the prerequisite to improve the performance of PSCs. Use of tandem PSCs has been reported as an efficient method to improve photon harvesting by connecting two sub-cells with a semi-transparent intermediate electrode, and some exacting requirements should be simultaneously satisfied for achieving efficient tandem PSCs. As a candidate solution, ternary PSCs exhibit great potential in photon harvesting and device fabrication processes. There are also challenges in phase separation and charge transport in ternary active layers, which strongly depend on the compatibility and energy levels of used materials. Up to now, most ternary PSCs have been prepared with complementary absorption spectra of used materials, and the photovoltaic parameters of binary PSCs should be taken into consideration to combine the advantages of binary PSCs into one cell. The selection criteria of materials for highly efficient ternary PSCs can be summarized as two factors: (i) the complementary absorption spectra to maximize photon harvesting; and (ii) the similar highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) or lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of two donors or two acceptors. The similar HOMO or LUMO levels of two donors or two acceptors can avoid the formation of deep charge traps in ternary active layers, which should be beneficial to intermolecular charge transfer and charge transport for achieving a high FF for ternary PSCs.

In this work, a wide bandgap polymer J71 as a donor and a medium band gap non-fullerene material ITIC as an acceptor were selected to fabricate binary PSCs. Zhang et al. firstly reported the wide bandgap polymer donor J71 and a PCE of 11.41% for PSCs with J71:ITIC as active layers. After that, most J71 based PSCs exhibit PCE values of about 10.5% with different non-fullerene acceptors, which may strongly depend on the purity of the polymer donor. Another medium bandgap non-fullerene material MeIC2 was selected as the third component to fabricate ternary non-fullerene PSCs with two acceptors. The experimental details are described in the ESI. The chemical structure of used materials and a schematic diagram of the device structure are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. The absorption spectra of neat J71, ITIC and MeIC2 films were measured and are shown in Fig. 1c. The absorption coefficient spectra of neat ITIC and MeIC2 films were measured and are shown in Fig. S1. The maximal absorption coefficients of ITIC and MeIC2 are 0.98 × 105 cm−1 at 700 nm and 1.22 × 105 cm−1 at 750 nm, respectively. The relatively large absorption coefficient of MeIC2 is beneficial to improve photon harvesting in the long wavelength range of ternary active layers. The complementary absorption spectra of used materials can be obviously observed for better coverage of the solar light spectrum in the long wavelength range. In fact, the HOMO and LUMO levels of used materials also play key roles in determining charge transfer and transport in ternary active layers. The energy levels of used materials are shown in Fig. 1d. The HOMO and LUMO levels of MeIC2 were measured by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method and the C–V plots of the neat MeIC2 film are shown in Fig. S2. The small LUMO level offset between ITIC and MeIC2 is beneficial to electron transfer and transport in ternary active layers. The PCE of binary PSCs with ITIC as an acceptor reaches 10.7% with a short circuit current density (JSC) of 16.4 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.930 V and a fill factor (FF) of 70.0%. The PCE of binary PSCs with MeIC2 as an acceptor reaches 10.2% with a JSC of 16.9 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.885 V and a FF of 69.4%. Both binary PSCs exhibit high FFs over 69%, suggesting good compatibility of J71 with ITIC or MeIC2. The difference of VOCs can be well explained from the LUMO level offset between ITIC and MeIC2. A PCE of 11.6% is achieved in ternary PSCs with 20 wt% MeIC2 in acceptors, resulting from the simultaneously enhanced JSC of 18.1 mA cm−2 and FF of 70.5%. The advantages of two binary PSCs can be efficiently inherited into one cell with a relatively high FF due to the good compatibility of used materials. It means that the third component MeIC2 also plays a vital role in optimizing the morphology or phase separation degree of ternary active layers, in addition to the enhanced photon harvesting in the long wavelength range.

The absorption spectra of blend films were measured to investigate the effect of MeIC2 content on photon harvesting of active layers, as shown in Fig. 2a. It is apparent that the red-shifted absorption peak of ternary blend films can be observed in the long wavelength range along with the increase of MeIC2 contents. Meanwhile, the absorption intensity is markedly decreased in the spectral range from 600 nm to 710 nm due to the decreased ITIC content in blend films. The optimized photon harvesting of ternary active layers should be achieved by adjusting the contents of ITIC and MeIC2, which is a prerequisite for obtaining highly efficient ternary PSCs. A series of PSCs were fabricated with J71 as the donor and the constant donor:acceptor(s) weight ratio as 1:1, and the only difference is the MeIC2 content in acceptors. The current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of all PSCs were investigated, as shown in Fig. 2b. According to the J–V curves, the detailed key parameters of all PSCs are summarized in Table 1. The ITIC based binary PSCs exhibit a PCE of 10.7%, with a VOC of 0.930 V and a JSC of 16.4 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70.0%. The MeIC2 based binary PSCs exhibit a PCE of 10.2%, with a VOC of 0.885 V, a JSC of 16.9 mA cm−2 and a FF of 69.4%. For the two binary PSCs with the same donor and device structure, the VOCs should strongly depend on the LUMO levels of acceptors. The large VOC of ITIC based binary PSCs is due to the relatively high LUMO levels of ITIC compared with that of MeIC2, as shown in Fig. 1c. The JSC of MeIC2 based binary PSCs is slightly larger than those of ITIC based binary PSCs, which may be due to the more efficient photon harvesting of MeIC2 in the long wavelength range. The more than 69% FFs of both binary PSCs indicate the appropriate phase separation in binary active layers due to the good compatibility of used materials, which is a necessary condition for preparing highly efficient ternary PSCs. The PCEs of ternary PSCs are increased and then decreased with the incorporation of more MeIC2. The champion PCE of ternary PSCs reaches 11.6% when the MeIC2 content is 20 wt% in the acceptors. The PCE improvement of ternary PSCs should be attributed to the simultaneously enhanced JSC of 18.1 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70.5%, which can amply compensate for the slight loss of VOC. More than 8% PCE improvement can be obtained by using the ternary strategy compared with two binary PSCs. The JSC improvement of ternary PSCs should be attributed to the enhanced photon harvesting of active layers. The FF improvement of ternary PSCs may be due to the optimized phase separation for better charge transport, which can be further confirmed from the variation of series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSH) of PSCs. The optimized ternary PSCs exhibit the maximum RSH of 1121 Ω cm2 and the minimum RS of 4.50 Ω cm2, which is beneficial to charge transport for obtaining the largest FF. More than three hundred PSCs were fabricated to confirm the positive effect of the ternary strategy on the PCE improvement, and the average PCEs were calculated with twenty cells prepared from different batches.

To further investigate the effect of MeIC2 content on the performance of PSCs, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of all PSCs were measured and are shown in Fig. 3a. The JSC of PSCs can be calculated according to the EQE spectra, as listed in Table 1. The calculated JSCs are slightly lower than the measured values. The discrepancy may be attributed to three reasons: (i) different light illumination conditions for J–V and EQE measurements. The J–V curves were measured under simulated sunlight. The EQE spectra were measured under single wavelength light from 300 nm to 850 nm with intervals of 10 nm. (ii) a small deviation (the size of the light spot or flatness of the sample) may lead to a reduced EQE. (iii) performance decay during EQE measurements in the atmosphere for PSCs without any encapsulation. However, EQE spectra of ternary PSCs can be expanded toward the long wavelength range. Meanwhile, EQE values can be slightly enhanced in the whole spectral range by incorporating appropriate amounts of MeIC2, which can be confirmed from the EQE spectral difference (ΔEQE) between the optimized ternary and ITIC based binary PSCs, as shown in Fig. S3. The contribution of MeIC2 to the PCE improvement should be attributed to three reasons: (i) enhanced photon harvesting in the long wavelength range; (ii) optimized phase separation for improving exciton utilization efficiency; (iii) improved exciton utilization efficiency through energy transfer from ITIC to MeIC2. The Jph–Veff curves of binary and the optimized ternary PSCs were investigated to gain more insight into photon harvesting, exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency in the PSCs, as shown in Fig. 3b. The detailed parameters of binary and the optimized ternary PSCs are listed in Table 2.

The Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, in which JL and JD are the current densities under a standard simulated light source and in the dark, respectively. The Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − V, V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 and V is the applied bias. Here, Jsat is the saturation current density, Jsat = qLGmax, where q is the elementary charge, L is the thickness of the active layer, and Gmax is the maximum exciton generation rate. The Jsat of the optimized ternary PSCs is 19.5 mA cm−2, which is larger than that (18.2 or 19.3 mA cm−2) of corresponding binary PSCs. The enhanced Jsat should be attributed to the more photon harvesting in the optimized ternary active layers. The corresponding Gmax values are 1.14 × 1028 m−3 s−1, 1.20 × 1028 m−3 s−1 and 1.22 × 1028 m−3 s−1 for the binary and the optimized ternary PSCs, respectively. The exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency should be improved according to the slightly large EQE values of the optimized ternary PSCs in the whole spectral range, which can be further confirmed from the relatively large Jph/Jsat of 92.6% or 80.4% under short circuit or maximal power output conditions. The enhanced exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiencies indicate that the phase separation degree can be optimized by incorporating appropriate amounts of MeIC2.
To further investigate the effect of incorporating MeIC2 on charge transport and collection, the J–V curves of binary and the optimized ternary PSCs were measured under different light intensities, as shown in Fig. S4. According to the J–V curves of all PSCs under light illumination with different intensities, the JSC and VOC dependence on the logarithm of the light intensity (Plight) are described in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The relationship between VOC and ln(Plight) can be expressed by the following formula:
VOC ∝ nkT/lnPlight
where
k is the Boltzmann constant, T is absolute temperature, and q is the elementary charge. If the n value is close to unity, it indicates the negligible trap-assisted recombination in active layers. As shown in Fig. 4a, the n of 1.08 for the optimized ternary PSCs is very close to unity and lower than that of 1.23 or 1.16 for ITIC or MeIC2 based binary PSCs, suggesting that the trap-assisted recombination can be efficiently restrained in the optimized ternary active layers. The relationship between JSC and Plight can be expressed as JSC ∝ Plights according to the power law. If the s value is close to unity, it indicates the weak bimolecular recombination in the active layers. The s value of 0.93 for the optimized ternary PSCs is slightly larger than that of 0.91 for both binary PSCs, as shown in Fig. 4b. The relatively large s value indicates that bimolecular recombination can be suppressed in the optimized ternary PSCs. Both s and n values are close to unity, suggesting that the loss of photogenerated carriers can be efficiently decreased in the optimized ternary PSCs. The photogenerated electrons and holes should be efficiently collected by the individual electrode. It is known that balanced charge transport also plays the key role in determining the performance of PSCs. To further investigate the underlying reason for the effect of incorporating appropriate amounts of MeIC2 on performance improvement of PSCs, electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) in the active layers were measured according to the space charge limited current (SCLC) method.

The hole-only and electron-only devices were fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layers/MoO3/Ag or ITO/ZnO/active layers/PDIN/Al, respectively. The active layers were prepared under the same conditions used in preparing PSCs. The J–V curves of hole-only and electron-only devices were measured under dark conditions, the corresponding ln(Jd3/V2)–(V/d)0.5 curves are shown in Fig. 5. The electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) can be calculated according to the Mott–Gurney equation with the Poole–Frenkel correction:
where
ε is the dielectric constant of 3 for common organic materials,ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, μ0 is the charge mobility, V is the applied voltage, d is the active layer thickness (∼100 nm), and γ is the ratio coefficient. The μe and μh in the different active layers and the corresponding μh/μe values are summarized in Table 3. The μh and μe in J71:ITIC blend films are 3.68 × 10−4 and 2.33 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which are slightly lower than those of 4.62 × 10−4 and 3.70 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in J71:MeIC2 blend films, respectively. The μh and μe in the optimized ternary blend films are in between those of binary blend films, suggesting that charge transport channels can be simultaneously optimized by incorporating 20 wt% MeIC2 in acceptors. The balanced charge (electron and hole) transport and collection are very vital for obtaining efficient PSCs. The calculated μh/μe value of 1.18 for the optimized ternary blend films is closer to unity compared with that of 1.57 or 1.25 for J71:ITIC or J71:MeIC2 blend films, indicating the more balanced charge transport in the optimized ternary active layer. The relatively low loss of photogenerated carriers can well explain the enhanced FF of the optimized ternary PSCs.

The performance improvement of ternary PSCs may be also attributed to the enhanced exciton utilization efficiency through energy transfer from ITIC to MeIC2. Some excitons in ITIC may not diffuse at J71/ITIC interfaces for dissociation, which can transfer its energy onto MeIC2 through Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) And then excitons in MeIC2 generated by FRET can be dissociated into free charge carriers at J71/MeIC2 interfaces, which may improve the exciton utilization efficiency generated in ITIC and enhance the EQE values in the short wavelength range. This means that energy transfer from ITIC to MeIC2 may provide an additional exciton dissociation route in the ternary PSCs. To investigate energy transfer from ITIC to MeIC2, the absorption spectrum of MeIC2 and the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of ITIC are shown in Fig. S5. According to FRET theory, energy transfer from ITIC to MeIC2 may exist due to the obvious spectral overlap between the absorption spectrum of MeIC2 and the PL spectrum of ITIC. To further confirm the energy transfer from ITIC to MeIC2, photoluminescence (PL) spectra of neat and blend acceptor films were measured under excitation with 710 nm light, as shown in Fig. 6a. The PL emission peaks of neat ITIC and MeIC2 films are 780 nm and 810 nm, respectively. The PL intensity of blend films is markedly enhanced along with the increase of the MeIC2 content, even for the blend films with 10 wt% MeIC2. Meanwhile, the PL intensity of blend films with 10 wt% MeIC2 was also prominently decreased in the spectral range with a wavelength less than 760 nm. Apparent red-shifted PL emission peaks of blend films can be observed along with the increase of the MeIC2 content, as shown in Fig. 6b. An approximately 15 nm red-shifted PL emission peak is observed for the blend film with 10 wt% MeIC2 compared with the neat ITIC film. The energy transfer from ITIC to MeIC2 may occur according to the PL spectral variations of neat and blend films. To give more solid evidence on the energy transfer from ITIC to MeIC2, PL spectra of neat and blend solutions were measured and are shown in Fig. 6c. A very similar phenomenon can be observed from the PL spectra of solutions. The PL emission of ITIC can be markedly quenched by incorporating small amounts of MeIC2. Meanwhile, apparent red-shifted PL emission peaks can be observed as shown in Fig. S6. The quenched PL emission of ITIC may be due to the energy transfer or exciton dissociation at ITIC/MeIC2 interfaces. The special devices were prepared with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layers/PDIN/Al to exclude exciton dissociation at ITIC/MeIC2 interfaces, and the active layers were prepared from neat ITIC, MeIC2 or their blend solutions, respectively. The J–V curves of the special devices were measured under AM 1.5G illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and are shown in Fig. 6d. The rather low JSCs of all devices can be well explained due to the absence of the donor in the active layers. The JSCs of devices with ITIC:MeIC2 (1:1, wt/wt) as the active layers are in between those of devices with ITIC or MeIC2 as the active layers, suggesting that exciton dissociation (charge transfer) should be negligible between ITIC or MeIC2. The energy transfer from ITIC to MeIC2 provides an additional path for improving exciton utilization efficiency in ITIC, which can be further confirmed from the ΔEQE spectra shown in Fig. S3.
To investigate the effect of the MeIC2 content on the phase separation degree of active layers, TEM images of binary and ternary blend films were measured and are shown in Fig. 7. It is known that the bright or dark region represents the donor-rich domain or acceptor-rich domain due to their different electron densities, respectively. No obvious characteristics can be observed from the TEM image of J71:ITIC blend films, suggesting that the small phase separation degree is due to the homogenous distribution of J71 and ITIC. The small phase separation degree should be beneficial to exciton dissociation and be detrimental to charge transport in the blend films. The distinctly dark and light domains can be observed from the TEM image of J71:MeIC2 blend films, indicating the relatively large phase separation degree. It is known that the large phase separation degree should be beneficial to charge transport; however, exciton dissociation may be limited due to the insufficient donor/acceptor interface in the blend films. In fact, the appropriate phase separation with a nanometer-scale is necessary to form bicontinuous interpenetrating networks for efficient exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport. As seen from the TEM images of binary and ternary blend films, the phase separation degree can be slightly optimized by adjusting the MeIC2 content. The optimized phase separation degree of ternary active layers may be achieved by incorporating 20 wt% MeIC2 in acceptors, which can further confirm the performance of the corresponding PSCs. More than 8% PCE improvement can be obtained in the optimized ternary PSCs compared with two binary PSCs. The performance improvement of ternary PSCs should be attributed to the simultaneously optimized photon harvesting and phase separation of the ternary active layers with 20 wt% MeIC2 in acceptors.

Non-fullerene PSCs were fabricated with J71 as a donor and with different bandgap non-fullerene materials ITIC or MeIC2 as an acceptor. Both binary PSCs exhibit a PCE of over 10% and FF larger than 69%. A series of ternary non-fullerene PSCs were fabricated by adjusting the MeIC2 content in acceptors to improve the performance. The optimized ternary PSCs exhibit a PCE of 11.6% with 20 wt% MeIC2 in acceptors, resulting from the simultaneously enhanced JSC of 18.1 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70.5% compared with those of the two binary PSCs. The PCE improvement of ternary PSCs should be mainly attributed to the enhanced photon harvesting and the optimized phase separation of the optimized ternary active layers. The ternary strategy can be further confirmed as an efficient approach to improve the performance of PSCs, while also having a simple device fabrication process.
