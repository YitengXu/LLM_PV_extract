We report the synthesis of highly crystalline, small sized, α-NiS nanocrystal inks for the fabrication of a counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells. Monodisperse α-NiS nanocrystals (about 7 nm) are obtained via a noninjection, solution-phase chemical synthesis method. During the growth process of α-NiS nanocrystals, the Ni–oleate complex, which is generated in situ from the reaction of nickel chloride and sodium oleate, is decomposed and acts effectively as a growth source in synthesizing monodisperse nanocrystals. By controlling the reaction temperature, the resultant nanocrystal sizes and crystallinity can be well tuned. Compared to conventionally obtained NiS bulk materials, monodisperse α-NiS nanocrystals possess abundant catalytic reaction sites for dye-sensitized solar cells due to their small particle size and high crystallinity. First-principles calculations have been employed for the first time to investigate the adsorption energy of I3− molecules on the (111) surface of α-NiS with equilibrium shape. DSSCs based on monodisperse α-NiS nanocrystal ink with higher crystallinity display a power conversion efficiency of 7.33%, which is comparable to that based on the Pt cathode (7.53%), but significantly higher than that based on the bulk NiS (4.64%) and relatively low-crystalline α-NiS nanocrystals (6.32%). It can be attributed to more reaction catalytic sites due to the surface effect of small α-NiS nanocrystals, and the highest work function level (5.5 eV) that matched the redox shuttle potential. We believe that our method paves a promising way to design and synthesize advanced counter electrode materials for energy harvesting.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted extensive attention over the past quarter century, due to their low cost and high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Typically, standard DSSCs consist of three main parts: a dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode, a redox electrolyte traditionally containing an iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) couple, and a counter electrode (CE). As an important component of DSSCs, the CE collects electrons from the external circuit and reduces I3− to I−. Generally, platinum is considered to be the best counter electrode material and widely used currently. Unfortunately, Pt is relatively scarce and expensive, which forms a large obstacle for scale-up application of DSSC devices. Therefore, lower-cost alternatives for the Pt CE in DSSCs need to be urgently sought.

Recently, extensive effort has been made to develop high-efficiency and low-cost Pt-free CE materials. Among them, transition metal nitrides, carbides and sulfides have been researched as CE materials due to both their preferential electrocatalytic activity and facile synthesis. In this respect, nickel sulfide is one of the most efficient candidates due to their high conductivity and excellent electrocatalytic activity. The small size of nickel sulfide can provide more catalytic sites, and high crystallinity can ensure fast charge transfer. These factors determine the CE properties of DSSCs. Different morphologies of NiS have been fabricated as CEs. Wei et al. fabricated highly crystalline NiS nanosheet CEs via a one-step hydrothermal route and obtained high efficiency, which is comparable to that of Pt-based DSSCs. Our group previously in situ synthesized a NiS/Ni3S2 nanorod composite array on Ni foil as a FTO-free counter electrode for DSSCs, and it displayed a comparable PCE with Pt-based DSSCs. Chen et al. used NiS hollow spheres as the CE for DSSCs. Kim et al. prepared highly crystalline nickel sulfide nanoparticles with a size of ca. 40 nm, and it exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity due to the increase of catalytic sites. Also, Meng et al. synthesized NiS nanoparticles and nanosheets as CE materials, respectively. Although NiS nanoparticles are large in size (ca. 40 nm) and aggregated severely due to their electrochemical synthesis method, DSSCs based on NiS nanoparticles exhibited higher PCE than DSSCs based on NiS nanosheets. But it is difficult to synthesize NiS nanocrystals with further decreased size (<10 nm) because the conventional synthesis methods lack enough tactics to prevent the particle size growth. So, synthesis of NiS nanocrystals with smaller size may be a challenge for further improving the PCE of DSSCs.
In this work, monodisperse α-NiS nanocrystals with a small size of ca. 7 nm have been controllably synthesized via a noninjection, solution-phase chemical route based on the Schlenk line system. Compared with previous reports, there are two advantages in this work. First, the prepared NiS nanocrystals with small size and high crystallinity possess higher catalytic properties in theory. Second, we provide a tactic to control the growth of small sized NiS nanocrystals. During the growth process of α-NiS nanocrystals, the Ni–oleate complex, which is generated in situ from the reaction of nickel chloride and sodium oleate, is decomposed and acts effectively as a growth source in synthesizing monodisperse nanocrystals. The existence of long-chain ligand reagent (1-octadecene, oleic acid) could encapsulate the NiS nanocrystals effectively and confine further growth. Moreover, by controlling the reaction temperature, highly crystalline α-NiS nanocrystals can be obtained. First-principles calculations have been employed for the first time to investigate the adsorption energy of I3− molecules on the (111) surface of α-NiS with equilibrium shape. DSSCs based on higher crystalline α-NiS nanocrystal ink CEs exhibit a PCE of 7.33%, which was much higher than that of DSSCs based on relatively low crystalline α-NiS nanocrystal CEs (6.32%), and comparable to that of Pt-based DSSCs (7.53%). Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Tafel polarization measurements revealed their excellent electrocatalytic activities towards the I3−/I− redox reaction. The scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) image indicates that the work function of higher crystalline α-NiS is the highest among Pt-free materials. And it is comparable to that of Pt, which matched the redox shuttle potential. It has been revealed that highly crystalline, small sized, monodisperse α-NiS nanocrystals are promising candidates as environmentally benign and low-cost Pt-free CE materials for DSSCs.

Nickel chloride, sulfur powder, 1-octadecene (ODE), oleic acid (OA), oleylamine (OLA), ethanedithiol (EDT), ethanol, acetonitrile, hexamethylene and sodium oleate were purchased from standard source. Fluorine doped SnO2 glass (FTO) (15 Ω per square, Nippon sheet glass, Japan) was used as the electrode substrate. The used Ru complex dye was cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis-tetrabutylammonium (N719, Solaronix SA, Switzerland). The redox shuttle electrolyte was a blend of 0.1 M LiI (anhydrous, 99%, Acros), 0.05 M I2 (anhydrous, 99.8%), 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (99%, Aldrich), 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate (99%, Aladdin Co.) and 0.6 M 1-propyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (99%) in methoxyacetonitrile (99%, Fluka). All chemicals were used as received without any further purification.


The calculations were performed by means of CASTEP package in the density functional theory (DFT) framework. The Perdew–Wang local density approximation form (LAD-PWC) of the exchange correlation energy has been used. During the calculations, the plane-wave and pseudopotential techniques were used, and the energy cutoff was set to 300 eV. To obtain a good numerical sampling of electron densities in the Brillouin zone, a (2 × 2 × 1) Monkhorst–Pack mesh was applied. For the geometry optimization, the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm was used, and the optimization procedure was repeated until the force, the stress, and the displacement on each atom were less than 0.05 eV Å−1, 0.1 Gpa, and 0.002 Å, respectively. This set of parameters also ensured that the total energy of the system can be accurately evaluated, and the energy convergences of systems are within 2.0 × 10−5 eV atom−1. To determine the stable surfaces of α-NiS nanocrystals, we have first calculated the surface energies by taking the energy difference between the relaxed slabs and the bulk structure with the same amount (n) of α-NiS formula units as the slab, divided by the surface area of the slab, which can be expressed using the following eqn (1):

(1)
where
Es is the total energy of the slab, Ea is the total energy of bulk NiS per formula unit, and S is the surface area of the slab. A vacuum layer of 20 Å is adopted for all the calculations, which has been proven enough to remove any spurious interaction between the repeated slabs in the normal direction of the surface.

Based on the surface energy calculations, the equilibrium shape of α-NiS nanocrystals was first obtained through the Wulff construction. Then, the adsorption energy between the I3− molecule and α-NiS surface with equilibrium shape has been investigated in order to explain the electrocatalytic activity of the α-NiS counter electrode in DSSCs. The absorption energies (Eb) are defined as eqn (2)
Eb = EI3−-NiS − (ENiS + EI3−)
(2)
where
EI3−-NiS represents the total energy of the I3− and α-NiS surface with equilibrium shape interacting with each other, ENiS is the total energy of the α-NiS surface with equilibrium shape, and EI3− is the total energy of the isolated I3− molecule.


Monodisperse nickel sulfide nanocrystals with small size have been fabricated in a controlled manner by a noninjection, solution-phase chemical synthesis based on the Schlenk line. The overall synthetic procedure is depicted in eqn (3) and (4), and the detailed preparation process is as follows. First, the homogeneous reaction solution has been obtained. In detail, 0.30 g of sulfur powder was heated to 60 °C to be dissolved in 10.0 mL of OLA by vigorous stirring. Nickel chloride (1.00 g), sodium oleate (3.50 g), distilled water (10.0 mL), ethanol (10.0 mL), and hexamethylene (20.0 mL) were then added to the above reaction mixture to obtain the precursor nickel oleate and dissolved sulfur. Finally, 30.0 mL ODE and 1.0 mL OA were added into the reaction system in order to tune the whole solution polarity and boiling limit. Second, the reaction solution was heated at 150 °C for 30 min under the protection of nitrogen flow with intense stirring to remove impurities and water because of their lower boiling points, and then the reaction temperature was increased to 300 °C for 1 h to obtain the monodisperse α-NiS nanocrystals. Finally, the obtained samples were thoroughly purified by multiple precipitation and redispersion using ethanol and hexamethylene. As a control, α-NiS nanocrystals with different crystallinities have also been obtained just by adjusting the reaction temperature to 250 and 320 °C. The NiS samples obtained at different reaction temperatures X (X = 250, 300, 320) are denoted as NiS-X. Also, the NiS nanoparticles with big size are obtained according the literature. For large-scale production of α-NiS nanocrystals, all of the reactants were scaled up to several times than the above recipe with a flask.

A thin layer of α-NiS nanocrystal ink was deposited onto the FTO substrate by a spray coating method, and then the CEs were heated at 400 °C for 30 min under a nitrogen atmosphere. Due to the heat treatment, the NiS nanocrystals are somewhat aggregated (Fig. S1a). Kim et al. also reported a similar phenomenon. The thickness of the film is about 6.0 μm (Fig. S1b). The CEs fabricated with NiS-X (X = 250, 300, 320) and bulk-NiS were labeled as ENiS-250, ENiS-300, ENiS-320, and Ebulk-NiS, respectively. As a control, mirror-like Pt CEs (EPt) were prepared according to the standard routine.

The dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes were prepared according to the conventional method. The dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode was assembled with a CE into a sandwich-type cell. After the injection of the redox electrolyte, the sandwich-type cell was further sealed with a thermoplastic hot-melt Surlyn (30 μm). The fabricated DSSCs based on cathodes of ENiS-250, ENiS-300, ENiS-320, Ebulk-NiS and EPt were labeled as CNiS-250, CNiS-300, CNiS-320, Cbulk-NiS and CPt, respectively. And the dummy cells with two identical ENiS-250, ENiS-300, ENiS-320 and EPt were fabricated for EIS and Tafel polarization measurement. They were labeled as DCNiS-250, DCNiS-300, DCNiS-320 and DCPt, respectively.

The composition of the materials was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), which was recorded using a Rigaku D/max-IIIB diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on a VG ESCALAB MK II with an Mg Kα (1253.6 eV) achromatic X-ray source. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiment was performed on a JEM-3010 electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken using a Hitachi S-4800 instrument operating at 15 kV. The particle size was measured by a dynamic light scattering method with a SZ-100 nanometer particle/zeta potential analyzer (SZ-100, Japan). The scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) measurements (SKP5050 system, Scotland) have been performed at normal conditions of laboratory (in an ambient atmosphere). A gold electrode was used as the reference electrode and the air gap between the probe and sample was kept at 70 μm. The vibration of the tip electrode was 50 μm.

Photovoltaic measurements were carried out with a solar simulator (Oriel, USA) equipped with an AM 1.5G filter (Oriel, USA). The power of the simulated light was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 by using an Oriel solar simulator radiometer. Current–voltage (J–V) curves were measured with a BAS100B electrochemical analyzer (Zahner Elektrik, Germany). The area of DSSCs is 1.5 cm2, and the irradiation area is 0.12 cm2 with a photomask. The NiS films were made in the same batch. Each value for cell performance was determined as an average of at least 3 samples. EIS was performed on a dummy cell with a computer-controlled IM6e impedance measurement unit (Zahner Elektrik, Germany) and carried out by applying sinusoidal perturbations of 10 mV, and the frequency ranges from 10 mHz to 1 MHz. The obtained spectra were fitted with ZsimpWin software in terms of appropriate equivalent circuits. The Tafel polarization measurements were carried out with a BAS100B electrochemical analyzer in a dummy cell. The CV curves were obtained in a three-electrode system in a nitrogen-purged acetonitrile solution, which contains 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI and 1 mM I2, at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1. The Pt worked as an auxiliary electrode versus the Ag/Ag+ reference electrode.

According to eqn (1), the calculated surface energies for eight surfaces of α-NiS are listed in Table 1. Among these investigated orientations, the (111) surface presents the lowest energy (0.53 J m−2). The surface energies of all orientations increase in the order of (111) < (101) < (110) < (201) < (102) < (210) < (001) < (010). Based on the surface energy calculations, the equilibrium shape of α-NiS nanocrystals was obtained through the Wulff construction (Fig. 1a). In general, the lower in energy a surface is, the more area it contributes to the Wulff shape. The (111) and (101) surfaces with relatively low surface energies in the equilibrium shape contribute to the most surface area. Therefore, the surface properties of α-NiS nanocrystals are mainly controlled by surfaces (111) and (101).

To determine the energetically preferred adsorption, the I3− complex was placed initially on the most stable (111) surface, and after geometry optimization, the converged structures were obtained (Fig. 1b). The calculated adsorption energies of I3− on the α-NiS surfaces were −1.83 eV. The result indicated that when I3− adsorbed on the α-NiS surface, the adsorption energy decreased significantly, which suggests that the interaction between I3− and the α-NiS surface is strong. The original bond length of I1–I2 in the free I3− complex was 0.298 nm and increases to 0.303 nm as it was attached to the α-NiS surface. Due to the strong interaction between I1 and the α-NiS surface, the electron clouds of the I1 atom adsorbed on the α-NiS surface shift away from the near I2 atom, thus decreasing the interaction between the I1 and I2 atom. So, the I1–I2 bond length is increased. The longer the I1–I2 bond, the more activated the I3− is. So, the α-NiS has an excellent catalytic activity for I3−.
To further reveal the interactions between I3− and α-NiS, the total and partial density of states (PDOSs) were calculated (Fig. 2). In all calculations, the Fermi energy was taken as zero point (E − Ef = 0 eV). After I3− is adsorbed on the α-NiS surface, the DOSs of α-NiS and the I3− system are changed significantly. It is found that the 5p states of the I atom changed obviously and shifted to a lower energy position, while the DOSs of the contacting metal atoms also varied significantly. According to the partial density of states, it can be further identified that the changed states mainly originated from Ni 3d states. Therefore, the interactions between I 5p and Ni 3d states can be confirmed. So, the α-NiS nanocrystals are efficient for the regeneration of I3−/I− redox couples in DSSCs. The α-NiS nanocrystal ink as counter electrodes may obtain a satisfying PCE in DSSCs.

The α-NiS nanocrystals with small size have been controllably synthesized following the above described reaction process. During the growth process of α-NiS nanocrystals, the Ni–oleate complex, which is generated in situ from the reaction of nickel chloride and sodium oleate, is decomposed and acts effectively as a nickel source, reacting with dissolved sulfur, resulting in synthesis of monodisperse α-NiS nanocrystals. XRD measurements were carried out to characterize the crystallinity and structure of the NiS nanocrystals (Fig. 3). The diffraction peaks at 30.19°, 34.88°, 46.07°, 53.67° and 73.33 °can be observed for NiS-250 and NiS-300, which is assigned to the (100), (101), (102), (110) and (202) planes of the hexagonal phase of NiS (α-NiS, P63/mmc) (JCPDS, PDF no. 02-1280). The Full Width and Half Maximum (FWHM) values with different planes of NiS-250 and NiS-300 samples are calculated and listed in Table S1. It can be seen that the FWHM value of NiS-300 is smaller than that of NiS-250, therefore the NiS-300 has a relatively high crystallinity. The Scherrer formula was used to calculate the nanocrystal size of NiS-300 using the (101) plane (Fig. S2), the calculated nanocrystal size is ca. 13 nm. When the temperature was increased to 320 °C, there appears the rhombohedral phase of NiS (β-NiS, JCPDS, PDF no. 12-0041) and a small amount of Ni9S8 (JCPDS, PDF no. 22-1193), besides α-NiS.

The high-resolution XPS spectra of Ni 2p and S 2p were measured to determine the oxidation states of the α-NiS constituent elements (Fig. 4). The binding energies of the Ni 2p3/2 peaks are 855.4 eV for NiS-300 (Fig. 4a), which indicated that the oxidation state of Ni was +2. The binding energies of the S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 peaks are 162.4 and 161.4 eV, indicating that most of the S species exist as S2− (Fig. 4b). The result is close to the previously reported values for NiS. Therefore, a hexagonal α-NiS phase was obtained via a noninjection, wet solution-phase chemical synthesis based on the Schlenk line. Moreover, the XPS spectra were also measured to determine the oxidation states of NiS-250 and NiS-320 (Fig. S3). The binding energies of the Ni 2p3/2, S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 peaks for NiS-250 are the same as that of NiS-300, which indicated that the Ni and S species exist as Ni2+ and S2−. But for NiS-320, the binding energies of the Ni 2p3/2 peaks are 855.0 eV, which is less than that of NiS. This is because of the existence of Ni9S8. The binding energies of the S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 peaks have no change. The XPS data are consistent with the XRD data.
The TEM image shows that the fabricated NiS-300 is monodisperse nanocrystals with a small size of ca. 7 nm (Fig. 5a and d). The particle size of NiS is detected by dynamic light scattering measurements and it has been shown in Fig. S4 in the revised manuscript. The result shows that the prepared NiS-300 is monodisperse nanocrystals with a small size of ca. 7.7 nm. The dynamic light scattering measurements results agree with the TEM results. It further confirmed that NiS-300 nanocrystals with a small size of ca. 7 nm have been controllably synthesized. The Scherrer formula was also used to calculate the nanocrystal size of NiS-300 using the (101) plane (Fig. S2). And the calculated nanocrystal size is ca. 13 nm. The NiS nanocrystals have been dried before the XRD measurement, which results in the aggregation of nanocrystals. So, the size deviation formed between the calculated data based on the XRD and the measured data based on the TEM image and dynamic light scattering. The lattice spacing of 0.29, 0.19 and 0.26 nm could be clearly observed in the HRTEM image (Fig. 5b), which corresponds to the (100), (102) and (101) planes of α-NiS, respectively. And the HRTEM image showed distinct lattice fringe patterns, indicating the highly crystalline nature of the nanocrystals. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern also verified that α-NiS was polycrystalline (Fig. 5c). It could be seen that NiS-250 and NiS-300 have the same diffraction ring spacing, which corresponds to the same (100) plane of α phase NiS (Fig. S5a and 5c). The spots in the diffraction ring of NiS-300 are brighter than that of NiS-250, which means that the NiS-300 has better crystallinity than NiS-250 to some extent. The diffraction ring spacing of NiS-320 has changed, which corresponds to the (110) plane of β phase NiS (Fig. S5b). Because the increase of reaction temperature results in the highest crystallinity, the spots in the diffraction ring of NiS-320 are the brightest.
The TEM images of NiS-250 and NiS-320 nanocrystals are also shown in Fig. S6. As the reaction temperature increases to 320 °C, the α-NiS nanocrystals become bigger and polydisperse. The interplanar spacings of 0.24 nm and 0.25 nm could be observed in the HRTEM image of NiS-320, which corresponds to the (220) and (021) of β-NiS, respectively. It further confirmed that NiS-320 has a β phase, besides α-NiS. The obtained bulk NiS particle is about 200 nm. The EDS indicates the formation of NiS (Fig. S7). All the measurements indicated that the monodisperse α-NiS nanocrystals with small size and high crystallinity were synthesized.

The prepared α-NiS was used as the counter electrode to obtain high-efficiency DSSCs. The NiS nanocrystals were typically passivated with ca. 2.5 nm long alkyl ligands (OA and OLA), which were harmful to the charge transfer due to the ligand preventing close α-NiS nanocrystal packing. The α-NiS film counter electrodes were subsequently dipped in 15 mM EDT in an acetonitrile solution for 20 s to remove the long chain ligands from the α-NiS surfaces and to reduce the interparticle spaces of nanocrystals. The J–V curves of DSSCs are shown in Fig. 6. The photovoltaic parameters of the DSSCs, including open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE are listed in the table inset in Fig. 6. The PCE of CNiS-300 reaches 7.33%, which is better than that of CNiS-250 (6.32%), CNiS-320 (6.85%) and Cbulk-NiS (4.64%) (Fig. S8). It shows the best performance among Pt-free counter electrodes, and is comparable to that of Pt-based DSSCs (7.53%). CNiS-250 shows comparatively poor cell performance due to lower crystallinity of NiS-250. Although the crystallinity of NiS-320 further improved, the Jsc, Voc and PCE of CNiS-320 decrease compared with those of CNiS-300. It may be attributed to increased interface charge transfer resistance owing to the presence of β-NiS and a small amount of Ni9S8 in NiS-320. The Cbulk-NiS possessing the lowest PCE is due to fewer active sites exposed in the NiS surface.


It is known that the performance of DSSCs is strongly dependent on the electrocatalytic activity and interface charge transfer of CEs while keeping other cell components identical. In the following, the CV, EIS and Tafel methods are used to study the catalytic activity and electron transfer of the as-prepared CEs in detail.

To understand the eletrocatalytic activity of the counter electrodes, CV of various CEs has been carried out (Fig. 7a). Two typical pairs of redox peaks are observed in all cases, which represented sequential redox reactions of different iodide species, as shown in the below eqn (5) and (6)
I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−
(5)
3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−
(6)
The electrochemical reduction of I3− in the low potential range is the regeneration of the redox species on the CE of DSSCs. As shown in Fig. 7a, two pairs of redox peaks are observed for ENiS-250, ENiS-300 and ENiS-320 cathodes, which are similar to those of Pt cathodes. It is implied that the three Pt-free cathodes operate through a similar catalytic mechanism of Pt cathodes. Remarkably, the cathodic current density of the ENiS-300 is the highest among the three Pt-free cathodes, comparable to that of the Pt cathode, suggesting that the ENiS-300 has better electrocatalytic activity. Fig. 7a clearly shows that NiS-300 has the best catalytic activities among Pt-free nanomaterials, and the DSSCs based on the NiS-300 cathode possess the best PCE among the Pt-free based DSSCs, which agrees with the J–V results.

Fig. 7b shows the consecutive CV curves of the NiS-300 cathode. It can be seen that the NiS-300 cathode has a similar work stability to the Pt cathode (Fig. S9). No obvious current density decline and peak shifts are observed after a 20-cycle test. It indicates that the NiS-300 cathode has excellent electrochemical stability in the I−/I3− electrolyte solution.
Tafel polarization measurement is used to further investigate the catalytic activities of the CEs. Typically, the Tafel curve can be separated into three zones: the polarization zone (low potential), Tafel zone (intermediate potential with a sharp slope), and diffusion zone (high potential). The information about the exchange current density (J0) can be obtained from the Tafel zone. The Tafel polarization curves obtained with a symmetrical dummy cell are shown in Fig. 7c. In the Tafel zone, the tangent slope of the curve provides information about J0, which is closely related to charge transfer resistance (Rct) value according to eqn (7).

where
R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, F is the Faraday constant, and n is the total number of individuals.

The DCNiS-300 exhibited a larger J0 in comparison with that of DCNiS-320 and DCNiS-250, indicating the superior catalytic activity of DCNiS-300 among the three Pt-free CEs and the superior catalytic activity of NiS-300.
EIS represents the intrinsic interfacial charge transfer and charge transport kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The Nyquist plots of dummy cells (DCNiS-250, DCNiS-300, DCNiS-320, and DCPt) are shown in Fig. 7d. In the plot, two semicircles were clearly observed, which were obtained by changing the frequency from 10 mHz to 1 MHz. The high frequency intercept on the real axis represents the series resistance (Rs). The left semicircle in the middle frequency can be attributed to the charge transfer resistance (Rct). Additionally, the right semicircle in the low frequency range reflects the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the redox couple transport in the electrolyte. Fig. S10 shows the equivalent circuit, which is used to fit the experimental EIS data. It can be seen that Rct is 5.45 Ω for DCNiS-300, 18.99 Ω for DCNiS-320, and 22.81 Ω for DCNiS-250. This result demonstrates that the ENiS-300 possess faster interfacial charge transfer than ENiS-250 and ENiS-320. The values of Rs for the DSSCs with DCNiS-250, DCNiS-300, DCNiS-320, and DCPt are 36.08, 32.41, 33.64, and 30.79 Ω, respectively, which indicate that the adhesion property between α-NiS nanocrystal ink and FTO substrate is comparable to Pt. As is well known, the series and shunt resistances are the solo factors to determine the fill factors. In this work, the series resistances are relatively high, which results in the lower fill factor. It agrees with the J–V results.
Taking the above results into consideration, including CV, EIS and Tafel polarization, the CE based on monodisperse α-NiS nanocrystals with higher crystallinity and small size (NiS-300) displays the highest catalytic activity towards the reducing of I3− and fastest charge transfer among the Pt-free CEs. It is also comparable to the Pt CE.

The surface area and crystallinity of α-NiS nanocrystals could affect the DSSC performance significantly. Large surface area and high crystallinity could provide more electrocatalytic sites and faster electron transfer. The monodisperse NiS-300 with a size of 7 nm possess large surface area, so it provides more electrocatalytic activity sites for the reduction of redox shuttle. Moreover, in order to further identify that the monodisperse NiS-300 with high crystallinity is more beneficial for the electron transfer than NiS-250 and NiS-320, the SKP measurement was taken. The SKP is an awfully sensitive instrument capable of discerning subtle molecular interactions using vibrating electromagnetic fields. The electrode based on NiS-300 (ENiS-300) shows a relative flat Fermi level, and the work-function (ϕ) value is 5.50 eV (Fig. 8a). It is the highest value among the Pt-free electrodes (5.45 eV for ENiS-250, 5.47 eV for ENiS-320, Fig. S11(a and b)), which also is very close to that of Pt (5.65 eV). The work function difference affected the barrier height at the NiS/FTO interface. The built-in field and the depletion layer width depend on the doping density. Highly crystalline materials may have lower recombination rate and/or high conductivity. The increased ϕ results in the increased built-in field. So the increased work function results in the increased built-in field for NiS-300, which favor the fast photoelectron transfer across the NiS/FTO interface. So, the NiS-300 is more favorable for the electron transfer than NiS-250 and NiS-320 (Fig. 8b). Therefore, DSSCs based on NiS-300 CEs showed improved photocurrent density among Pt-free CEs. And they showed high PCE that is comparable to that of the Pt CE.


In summary, the monodisperse α-NiS nanocrystals with a small size of 7 nm and high crystallinity have been prepared via a noninjection, solution-phase chemical synthesis method. The first-principles calculation results indicated that the bond length of I–I increased from 0.298 nm in the free I3− complex to 0.303 nm as it was attached to the (111) surface of α-NiS with the equilibrium shape. A PCE of 7.33% was achieved when the DSSCs are fabricated with monodisperse α-NiS with higher crystallinity (ENiS-300), which is comparable to that of the Pt CE. The enhanced performance arises from abundant active sites and fast interface charge transfer of ENiS-300. The electrochemical tests can further identify that the ENiS-300 has high electrocatalytic activity and fast charge transfer for redox shuttle. These results may pave the way for the further study of environmentally friendly, stable, highly efficient counter electrodes for DSSCs.
