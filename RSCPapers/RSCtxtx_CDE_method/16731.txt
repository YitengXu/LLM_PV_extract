Two novel porphyrin-polythiophene star-shaped polymer (P-bs1 and P-bs2) containing triphenylamine terminated poly(3′-hexyl-2,2′-bithiophene) and poly(3′-hexyl-2,2′-bithiophene) as four arms in the peripheral of porphyrin core were synthesized by Stille reaction. The thermal, photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the porphyrin-polythiophene derivatives were investigated. The porphyrin-polythiophene derivatives showed broad absorption in the region of 350 ∼ 650 nm. In particular, the absorption intensity at 450 ∼ 650 nm was greatly enhanced for the meso-substituted polythiophene derivatives, P-bs2. The photoluminescence spectra indicated that the emission peaks of porphyrin units were suppressed by the intensive emission of thiophene units. The electrochemical properties indicated that the porphyrin-polythiophene derivatives are potential electron-donor materials for bulk heterojunction solar cells and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Polymer bulk heterojunction solar cells based on P-bs2:PCBM (1:1, w/w) showed power conversion efficiencies (PCE) up to 0.61% under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2, which increased by 69% compared to that of P-bs1 (0.36%). Meanwhile, higher PCE of 2.17% and 3.91% based on P-bs1 and P-bs2 polymer-sensitized solar cells were attained. The better photovoltaic properties benefited from longer arms of polythiophene derivatives.

Extensive research has been focused on soluble π-conjugated polymers in the field of photovoltaic devices, especially for the exploitations of electron-donor polymer materials, which offer advantages such as lightweight, flexible, low-cost and environmentally friendly for solar cells. Polymer solar cells have developed fast in recent years since Heeger and co-workers first reported the so-called bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell based on MEH-PPV/C60 in 1995. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells have been significantly improved with the highest PCE of over 6% based on the classical polythiophene (P3HT). In terms of enhancing the PCEs of photovoltaic devices, the design and synthesis of polymers with broad absorption and better charge transport properties are one of the most useful methods.

Porphyrins are preferable photosensitizers for utilizing solar energy since they played an important role in the photosynthesis of plants. Therefore, inspired by its natural light-harvesting ability, porphyrin and its derivatives have been intensively studied for photovoltaic materials because they possess large planar π-conjugated structure, unique electronic properties, good photochemical and thermal stability. Polythiophene as one of the classical and excellent donor materials in photovaltaic devices have also attracted extensive attention. Some porphyrin dyes and polymers containing thiophene units have been applied to photovoltaic devices, such as the π-extend porphyrin dyes reported by Imahori et al., copolymers of porphyrin-dithienothiophene reported by Bo et al. Up to now, the PCEs of bulk heterojunction solar cells based on poly(porphyrin-thiophene) are still low. The main factor of the limited cell performance is the relative narrow absorption spectra of porphyrins. Recently, three thiophene-linked porphyrin derivatives as efficient photosensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells were reported by our group, and the introduced thionphene units on one of the meso-aryl positions of porphyrin improved the light-harvesting ability. To the best of our knowledge, there are few reports on the modification of the four meso-aryl positions of porphyrins by polythiophene derivatives.
In this paper, combining the advantages of porphyrin and thiophene units, we have designed and sythesised two soluble porphyrin-polythiophene derivatives P-bs1 and P-bs2 (see Scheme 1) with the structure of the porphyrin-cored and polythiophene derivatives arms substituted the four meso-aryl positions of porphyrin core. The introduction of the poly(3′-hexyl-2,2′-bithiophene) into the four meso-aryl positions of porphyrin core can widen the absorption spectra and improve the charge transport properties of the porphyrin derivatives. The hexyl on thiophene units can improve solubility and reduce aggregation of the porphyrin derivatives. To investigate the influence of the polythiophene derivative arms length on the photophysics, electrochemistry and photovoltaic performances of porphyrin-polythiophene derivatives, 4-bromotriphenylamine was introduced as end-capper in the polymerization and formed P-bs1, and P-bs2 without triphenylamine end-capper was obtained with longer polythiophene chains. Meanwhile, P-bs1 and P-bs2 were used in bulk heterojunction and dye-sensitized solar cells to demonstrate their potential application.

The general synthetic strategy for monomers and the porphyrin-polythiophene derivatives is depicted in Scheme 2. Tetra-4-bromophenyl-porphyrinzinc (PZn) was synthesized by the condensation of 4-bromobenzaldehyde and pyrrole, and then treated with Zn(OAc)2 for 4 h.P-bs1 was synthesized by Stille coupling with PZn and 5 in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 as catalyst. Following the polymerization of monomer 3 and 4 at the ratio of 1:1, oligo(3′-hexyl-2,2′-bithiophene) 6 was obtained with seven repeated units. P-bs2 was synthesized by palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling of PZn and 6. The number-average molecular weights of P-bs1 and P-bs2 determined by GPC in THF are about 4000 and 7400, respectively. The structure of P-bs1 was confirmed by 1H NMR spectra, FT-IR absorption spectrum and UV-Vis absorption spectrum. The 1H NMR spectra of P-bs1 exhibited the chemical shifts of porphyrin-H at 9.02–7.98 ppm, TPA-H at 7.78–7.41 ppm and Th–H at 7.16–6.99 ppm. The FT-IR absorption of N–H and UV-Vis absorption of porphyrin unit showed at 3433 cm−1 and at 430 nm, respectively. The structure characterization of P-bs2 was similar to that of P-bs1 except that the chemical shifts of porphyrin-H were unobvious due to the relative low content of porphyrin.


The thermal properties of P-bs1 and P-bs2 were tested by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements, and the corresponding data were summarized in Table 1. The TGA curves (shown in Fig. 1) of P-bs1 and P-bs2 exhibited high thermal stability with 5% weight loss temperatures (Td) observed to be 386 °C and 419 °C, respectively. As shown in Table 1, the glass transition temperatures (Tg) of P-bs1 and P-bs2 were found to be 159 °C and 163 °C. No crystallizing or melting peaks were detected. The results indicated that P-bs1 and P-bs2 were amorphous polymers. It is clear that the favorable thermal stability of P-bs1 and P-bs2 benefit from the rigid porphyrin macrocyclic structure. Compared with P-bs1, the higher decomposition temperature and glass-transition temperature of P-bs2 are due to its higher molecular weight.

The UV-Vis absorption properties of P-bs1 and P-bs2 were investigated in dilute CHCl3 solutions and thin films on quartz plates. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of P-bs1, P-bs2 as well as reference (PZn) in CHCl3 are shown in Fig. 2. PZn displayed two typical absorption bands that a strong Scort band at 420 nm and a weak Q band at 549∼589 nm. In comparison with PZn, P-bs1 and P-bs2 exhibited broad absorption bands in the UV-visible region, which largely broadened and redshifted with the increase of the polythiophene derivatives arms length as the reported literatures.P-bs1 showed three distinctive peaks located at 430 nm, 550 nm and 590 nm, which exhibited a red shift ca. 10 nm in the Soret band compared with that of PZn. The absorption intensity of P-bs1 between the Soret band and the Q band was enhanced, caused by the thiophene units around the porphyrin core. P-bs2 showed a larger red shift with two maximal peaks at 433 nm and 475 nm. More interestingly, the absorption intensity at 450∼650 nm was greatly enhanced, which can be explained by the longer conjugation chain of polythiophene derivatives around the porphyrin core. The absorption intensity of P-bs2 in the range of 450∼650 nm is nearly with the same of porphyrin unit at 433 nm, which matches better with the solar spectrum.


Fig. 3 showed the absorption spectra of P-bs1 and P-bs2 films on quartz plates. The two absorption bands of P-bs1 and P-bs2 centered at 448 nm and 528 nm, the maximum absorption peaks showed red-shifts about 18 nm and 95 nm in comparison with that of solutions, which may be due to the enhancement of the interchain interaction in the solid states. Larger redshift for P-bs2 may be due to the longer conjugated polythiophene chains.
The PL spectra of P-bs1, P-bs2 as well as the reference (PZn) were measured in CHCl3 solution with the exciting peaks of the Soret bands (see Table 2 and Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4, the emission spectra of P-bs1 and P-bs2 were dominated by that of thiophene units. The stronger high energy emission bands at 565 nm and 568 nm were attributed to conjugated thiophene units, and the low energy emission peaks at 603 nm and 612 nm attributed to the porphyrin units. As the emission peaks of porphyrin units were suppressed by the intensive emission of thiophene units, thus the emission peaks at 603 nm and 612 nm belonged to porphyrin core in P-bs1 and P-bs2 were greatly reduced. Compared with P-bs1, the emission peaks of P-bs2 exhibited a slightly red-shift, which was consistent with the results of the UV-visible absorption spectra. The fluorescence of P-bs1 and P-bs2 in thin films upon excitation at Soret or Q-band was hardly observed presumably due to the PL photoluminescence quenching resulted from the aggregation of the porphyrin-polythiophene derivatives films.

Cyclic voltammograms of P-bs1 and P-bs2 were illustrated in Fig. 5, the corresponding data are shown in Table 2. Both of P-bs1 and P-bs2 showed two irreversible oxidation peaks and one quasi-reversible reduction peak, this may be due to the presence of electron-rich porphyrin units. The former has onset oxidation and reduction potential at 1.20 V and −1.27 V, the latter has onset oxidation and reduction potential at 0.81 V and −1.24 V. The HOMO/LUMO values of the P-bs1 and P-bs2 are estimated to be −5.60/−3.13 eV and −5.21/−3.16 eV according to the following equations.
EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.4) (eV)
ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.4) (eV)
Eg = EHOMO - ELUMO (eV)
The higher HOMO energy level of P-bs2 may be due to the introduction of more thiophene moieties in comparison with P-bs1, indicating that the charge-injection and transporting properties have been improved. According to the reports of Meskersand Brabec, we can draw a conclusion that P-bs1 and P-bs2 are potential electron-donor materials because their HOMO energy levels are lower than −5.2 eV and LUMO energy levels are higher than −3.8 eV.

The bulk heterojunction solar cells based on P-bs1 or P-bs2 and the typical acceptor PCBM have been fabricated. The employed device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(P-bs1 or P-bs2):PCBM(1:1,w:w)/Ca/Al. Fig. 6 showed the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices, which were measured in dark and illumination from solar simulator at 100 mW cm−2 light intensity. The parameters of the photovoltaic properties such as open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices are summarized in Table 3. As shown in Fig. 6, the power conversion efficiency of P-bs2 (0.61%) was increased by 69% in comparison with that of P-bs1 (0.36%). As we know, the power conversion efficiency is related to the open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current (Jsc) of the photovoltaic device. From Table 3, we presumed that the slight increase of Voc for P-bs2 could be explained by the better charge-injection ability resulting from its higher HOMO energy level. As we expected, the greatly enhanced light absorption ability of P-bs2 at the range of 450 ∼ 650 nm may be responsible for its higher PCE value. Moreover, the higher PCE value of P-bs2 can be benefited from its higher molecular weight, for which can result in a better contact of P-bs2 and PCBM, thus enlarge the interface for the dissociation exciton. Though the photovoltaic performance of porphyrin-polythiophene derivatives are best among all the porphyrin derivatives reported in bulk-heterojunction solar cells, there is still potential to improve the PCEs of P-bs1 and P-bs2.

To further investigate the porphyrin-polythiophene derivatives for the application of solar cells, the dye-sensitized photovoltaic devices based on P-bs1 and P-bs2 were fabricated. The prepared TiO2-coated FTO (SnO2:F glass) films, the electrolyte and the measure conditions are similar to the literature except that the TiO2 electrodes were made by immersing TiO2 films into the solution of containing 0.3 mg mL−1P-bs1 or P-bs2 in CHCl3 and 0.3 mg mL−1 CDCA (as a co-sensitizer) for 24 h. Fig. 7 showed the current density-voltage characteristics of P-bs1 and P-bs2 under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2. They displayed similar trend of Jsc, Voc, FF, and the PCE values in comparison with the bulk junction solar cells. It is worth noting that PCEs increase with the increase of the polythiophene arms length. P-bs2 exhibits a maximum power conversion efficiency of 3.91%, which is higher than that of P-bs1 (2.17%).

In summary, two star-shaped polymers with the structure of porphyrin as core and four polythiophene derivatives as arms were synthesized and characterized. The effects of the arms length of polythiophene derivatives on the photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties have been extensively investigated. P-bs2 with longer arms of polythiophene derivatives has a strong absorption in the range of 350 ∼ 650 nm, which is unprecedented in the reported porphyrin derivatives. The bulk heterojunction solar cells based on P-bs2 exhibited an open-circuit voltage of 0.63 V, a short-circuit current density of 3.36 mA cm−2, an overall power conversion efficiency of 0.61%, and the dye-sensitized solar cells based on P-bs2 exhibited an open-circuit voltage of 0.69 V, a short-circuit current density of 8.63 mA cm−2, an overall power conversion efficiency of 3.91%.


Pyrrole, 4-bromobenzaldehyde, thiophene, 3-hexylthiophene, n-butyllithium, n-tributyltin chloride, 4-bromotriphenylamine and Pd(PPh3)4 were purchased from Alfa Aesar and Shanghai Medical Company (China). THF and toluene were refluxed over Na/benzophenone, and freshly distilled prior to use. Column chromatography was performed using silica gel (200 ∼ 300 mesh). All other commercial grade reagents were used without further purification unless otherwise stated.


1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra recorded using a Bruker AVANCE 400 spectrometer. Molecular mass was determined by matrix assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) using a Bruker Aupoflex-III mass spectrometer. FT-IR spectra, UV-Vis absorption spectra and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the porphyrin-polythiophene derivatives were obtained on Perkin-Elmer Spectra One, Lamada 25 spectrometer and LS-50 luminescence spectrometer, respectively. The molecular weight of P-bs1 and P-bs2 was measured by using a Waters 1515 gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with THF as eluent and polystyrene as standard. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements of P-bs1 and P-bs2 were performed under nitrogen at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 with TA Q50 analyzer and TA DSC Q10 instrument, respectively. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was performed on EG&G Princeton Applied Research Model 273 electrochemical workstation with a Pt disk as the working electrode, a Pt plate and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as counter electrode and reference electrode in a 0.1 M Bu4NClO4 acetonitrile solution.

Bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells were constructed with indium tin oxide (ITO) glass as a positive electrode, Al as a negative electrode, and a blend film of P-bs1 or P-bs2 and PCBM as a photoactive layer. The fabrication process was as follows. On a precleaned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate, a layer about 30 nm of poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxy-thiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, from Bayer AG) was spin-coated from an aqueous solution, and it was dried subsequently at 150 °C for 30 min. The photoactive layer was prepared by spin-coating a blend solution of P-bs1 or P-bs2 and PCBM (1:1, w/w) in chlorobenzene with the concentration of 18 mg mL−1 on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode, and then dried at 85 °C for 30 min in a nitrogen-filled glove box. A metal negative electrode, which made up of 100 nm Al, was then deposited on the active layer by vacuum evaporation at 4 × 10−4 Pa. The effective area of one cell was 9 mm2. Current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics were measured by a computer controlled Keithley 2602 source measurement unit in dark and under AM 1.5 illumination conditions, 100 mW cm−2. All these measurements were performed under ambient atmosphere at room temperature.

Dye-sensitized solar cells based on P-bs1 and P-bs2 were fabricated as follows. The TiO2 suspension was prepared from P25 (Degussa AG, Germany) and 1 wt% magnesium acetate solution. The suspension was deposited on a transparent conducting glass by using a doctor blade technique. The film was sintered at 450 °C for 30 min in air, then treated with 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min and annealed again at 450 °C for 30 min. After the film was cooled to 80 °C, it was immersed into dye solution containing 0.3 mg mL−1P-bs1 or P-bs2 in CHCl3 and 0.3 mg mL−1 CDCA (as a co-sensitizer) for 24 h. The sensitized electrode was rinsed with ethanol, then dried. One drop of electrolyte solution, consists of 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in 3-methoxypropionitrile, was deposited onto the surface of the electrode and penetrated inside the TiO2 film via capillary action. The photovoltaic measurements were performed in a sandwich cell consisting of the porphyrin-polythiophene sensitized TiO2 electrode as the working electrode and a Pt foil as the counter electrode. The instrument and methods of measuring PCE are same as above.

The synthetic routes of the monomers and P-bs1, P-bs2 are shown in Scheme 2. The detailed synthetic pathways are as follows.


In a 250 mL three-necked round-bottomed flask, 4-bromobenzaldehyde (14.8 g, 80 mmol) were dissolved in 200 mL propionic acid. The solution was heated to reflux at 140 °C. Pyrrole (5.36 g, 80 mmol) was added dropwise and stirred for another 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, half of the solvent was evaporated and 100 mL CH3OH was added. The mixture was placed in a refrigeratory overnight and filtrated under suction. The crude production was purified by column chromatography (petroleum ether/dichloromethane = 2/3 as an eluent).

Finally, a solution of porphyrin monomer 2 (0.08 g, 0.08 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (in 10 mL toluene) was dropwise slowly and stirred for 3 days. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation and the residue was poured into 50 mL CH3OH. The precipitate was collected by filtration from methanol and further purified successively by Soxhlet extraction in methanol, hexane and chloroform for 24 h. The chloroform fraction was evaporated under reduced pressure, then precipitated in methanol, filtered and finally dried over 24 h to obtain a dark purple solid P-bs1 of 82 mg.
