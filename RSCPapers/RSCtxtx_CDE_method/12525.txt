We report an efficient method to adjust the compositions of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite by controlling the working pressure of CH3NH3I and its effects on perovskite films in a vacuum co-deposition process. Thermal heating of the CH3NH3I source in a vacuum chamber increases the working pressure, which can be an indicator for the control of the ratio of CH3NH3I for the perovskite in the vacuum thermal co-deposition process. Under different working pressures, the physical properties of the films with various compositions differed significantly. At the optimum working pressure, the perovskite solar cell fabricated using an all-vacuum process showed a maximum power conversion efficiency of 14.5% with high reproducibility, implying successful formation of the film using the pressure-controlled vacuum co-deposition.

Recently, organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells have emerged as one of the most promising future candidates for photovoltaics with remarkably high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). One of the most critical issues in this field is the optimization of the growth conditions for the perovskite films using various deposition methods, since the properties of the perovskite vary significantly depending on the deposition processes. In addition, the growth of high-quality perovskite films is challenging since the film is sensitive to the compositions of the components in the perovskites, moisture/air, types of solvents, and annealing conditions. Therefore, a variety of approaches, such as sequential deposition, solvent engineering, a hot casting technique, a vapour-assisted solution process, growing the films under controlled humid conditions, hybrid processes, and vacuum co-deposition processes, have been introduced to enhance the quality of the films, overcoming the above problems. These methods resulted in the successful formation of perovskite films exhibiting high PCEs when used as the active layer in the solar cells. Among these methods, vacuum co-deposition is one of the promising methods because the high purity of the materials and easy controllability without effects of solvents or the atmosphere ensure the high quality of the films with good reproducibilities. In addition, since the vacuum process does not affect under-layers, whereas the solution process limits the under-layers because of the solvent effect of the top layer, it can be readily employed to optimize the device architectures with various charge transport layers. Unlike vacuum sequential deposition, the vacuum co-deposition process does not require a substrate heating process; thus, a room-temperature process is easily achievable. However, considering that there have been over 1000 papers published in the organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite field, a few groups have reported the vacuum co-deposition process. The reasons are probably the difficulties of controlling CH3NH3I in the vacuum chambers, because CH3NH3I increases the vacuum pressure and it is difficult to calibrate the thickness of CH3NH3I and, consequently, the deposition rates because of the poor adsorption properties of CH3NH3I. Effective control of deposition rates of CH3NH3I would be the key for the growth of the perovskite films, because the compositions significantly affect the properties of the perovskite films. With the solution processes, there have been various reports about the effects of the compositions on the properties of the perovskite films, such as the morphologies, grain sizes, electrical and optical properties, and device performances. In these reports, the compositions were controlled using different precursor ratios between CH3NH3I and PbI2 in one-step depositions or different concentrations of CH3NH3I solutions in two-step depositions. However, in the vacuum co-deposition process, only limited information about the effect of the composition on the perovskite films is available. Therefore, introducing an effective method to control CH3NH3I and establishing a framework for the effects of the compositions on the perovskite in a vacuum process would be significant.

Here, we report an effective method for controlling the compositions of the perovskite films in a vacuum co-deposition process using the working pressures monitored by a vacuum gauge. The compositions of the perovskite were able to be adjusted with the working pressures of CH3NH3I. Using this method, the properties of the films with various compositions were revealed; they showed significant differences under different working pressures. Furthermore, we show the application of the fabricated perovskite films in solar cell devices composed of molybdenum oxide (MoO3), N,N′-di(1-napthyl)-N,N′-diphenyl-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine (NPB), and C60 layers as the charge transport layers via the all-vacuum process. The optimum pressure of CH3NH3I resulted in the maximum power conversion efficiency of 14.5% with good reproducibility.


Fig. 1a displays a schematic illustration of the vacuum chamber for the perovskite films. The deposition rate of PbI2 was monitored by sensor 1, and was fixed at 0.5 Å s−1. When CH3NH3I is deposited, sensor 2 reads the rates of both PbI2 and CH3NH3I, while sensor 1 reads the rate of PbI2. The vacuum pressure (working pressure) read by the ionization gauge increases when CH3NH3I is thermally evaporated as previously reported. The working pressure was maintained constant by controlling the temperature of the CH3NH3I crucible. Fig. 1b shows the thicknesses or the deposition rates of the perovskite films fabricated under different pressures with a fixed PbI2 deposition rate for 1 h. Overall, the thicknesses increased from 180 to 320 nm as the pressure increased. However, the thicknesses were maintained constant when the working pressure increased from 4.1 × 10−5 torr to 6.5 × 10−5 torr. The reason why there are plateaus in the figure is not clear at this moment and requires further study.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the fabricated perovskite films are shown in Fig. 2a. The main peaks, (110) and (220) planes, of the tetragonal phase (space group I4/mcm) of the perovskite appeared at all the pressures as previously reported. The intensities of the main peaks increased until the pressure reached 6.5 × 10−5 torr, and then decreased at 8.3 × 10−5 torr, as well as the calculated crystal size from the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) as shown in Table S1. In Fig. 2b, we show that the peak of the (001) plane of PbI2 appears at the low pressures. The intensity of this peak of PbI2 gradually decreased as the pressure increased, and this peak had almost disappeared at 4.1 × 10−5 torr. Therefore, it can be inferred that at the low pressures, the amount of CH3NH3I is insufficient to convert all the PbI2 to the perovskite and the perovskite and PbI2 are homogeneously dispersed in the film.

Fig. 3a shows the absorbance spectra of the fabricated perovskite films on the glass substrates. The absorption edge of PbI2 is ∼540 nm, and the absorbance after this wavelength of the PbI2 film is attributed to the reflectance of PbI2 as shown in Fig. S1 and in ref. 37. Under the low working pressures, 0.6–3.2 × 10−5 torr, the absorbances at 540 nm increased gradually causing the red shift of the absorption edges. Accordingly, determining the absorption edges became difficult because the films were inhomogeneously blended with PbI2 and the perovskite, as shown in Fig. 2. At the pressures of 4.1–6.5 × 10−5 torr, the absorbances apparently increased for all wavelengths and the absorption edges shifted to ∼780 nm, indicating that the perovskite with a bandgap of 1.55–1.60 eV was formed. At a pressure of 8.3 × 10−5 torr, the absorbance increased further owing to the increased thicknesses. Fig. 2b shows the absorbance at 550 nm, near the absorption edge of PbI2, at different pressures. As shown, the increase in absorbance at 550 nm with the pressure indicated that the films were optically changed from PbI2 to the perovskite, and this tendency was similar to the change in thickness shown in Fig. 1b. Fig. 3c shows the obvious color changes of the films caused by the shift of the absorption edges.

Fig. 4 shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the perovskite films grown on the same substrate shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 4a, the deposited PbI2 film shows a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 7.5 nm and a relatively high peak-to-valley value of 118 nm considering the thickness of the film, which is caused by partially protruded areas. These values decreased with the incorporation of CH3NH3I, and the RMS roughness and peak-to-valley values decreased to 3–5 nm and 33–68 nm, respectively, in the low-pressure-fabricated film shown in Fig. 4b–d. At a pressure of 4.1 × 10−5 torr (Fig. 4e), similar to the tendencies of the thickness and absorbance, a radical change in the morphology occurred with the increase of particle sizes, and the RMS values increased to ∼12 nm. The particles seemed slightly sharper at 5.1 × 10−5 torr with a negligible change in the RMS values (Fig. 4f), and the particles apparently became larger upon a further increase in the pressure to 6.5 × 10−5 torr (Fig. 4g). At a pressure of 8.3 × 10−5 torr (Fig. 4h), the particles appeared to have irregular shapes compared to the previous cases and gave the highest RMS roughness values. As expected, an overly excessive amount of CH3NH3I in the films caused the poor morphologies of the perovskite films. The tendency of these changes in the particle sizes corresponds to the calculated crystal sizes from the XRD data, shown in Fig. 2. Additional information about the morphologies, RMS values, and three-dimensional images are presented in Table S2 and Fig. S2.

Fig. 5a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the best performing perovskite solar cells at different pressures. The photovoltaic parameters are tabulated in Table 1. The device structure is indium tin oxide (ITO)/MoO3 (5 nm)/NPB (20 nm)/perovskite/C60 (50 nm)/bathocuproine (BCP) (8 nm)/Al (100 nm). The structure is identical to that used in a previous work, where all the layers were deposited by vacuum thermal deposition. The MoO3 and NPB layers are used as hole extraction and transport layers, respectively, the C60 layer is used as an electron-transporting layer, and BCP is used as a buffer layer. Interestingly, the performances differed significantly with the pressure of CH3NH3I. As the pressure increased from 0.6 × 10−5 torr, the short-circuit current density (JSC) increased and showed a remarkable change at 4.1 × 10−5 torr, similar to the previously discussed properties of the films. Therefore, it can be inferred that the perovskite was properly formed at certain pressures with the appearance of considerable changes in the physical properties discussed above, and the film works efficiently as an absorber in the solar cells. Upon further increase of the pressure to 5.1 × 10−5 torr, the JSC was maximized and decreased after this pressure. The open-circuit voltage (VOC) values showed virtually no change until the pressure of 5.1 × 10−5 torr and then decreased after this pressure as well. The values of the fill factor (FF) showed a tendency similar to those of the JSC and VOC, exhibiting the highest value at a pressure of 5.1 × 10−5 torr; hence, the PCE was maximized at this pressure. The best-performing device showed a PCE of 14.1%, JSC of 19.7 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.05 V, and FF of 0.69. Fig. 5b shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra at the different pressures. The different shapes in the IPCE spectra were probably caused by the different optical properties, refractive indices, and morphologies. The values of experimental JSC and integrated JSC from the IPCE spectra are tabulated in Table S3. At the pressures of 0.6 and 5.1 × 10−5 the deviations of these values were less than 5% implying that the spectral mismatch is less than 5%. However, at the other pressures, especially at 3.2 × 10−5 torr and 8.3 × 10−5, the experimental JSCs values showed relatively large deviations. The reason is not clear yet, but it may be attributed to the changes in the recombination mechanisms in the different compositions.

In order to check the reproducibility of the vacuum-pressure-based control, additional batches were fabricated under the optimized conditions. As shown in Table 1, the average PCE of 23 devices from three batches was 12.7% (standard deviation (s.d.) ±0.84%). In addition, considering the other parameters such as JSC, VOC, and FF that exhibit reasonably small standard deviations shown in Table 1, the vacuum-pressure-based control is regarded as reproducible. Fig. S4 shows the hysteresis and Fig. S5 shows the scan-rate-dependent behavior of the solar cell fabricated under the optimized condition, 5.1 × 10−5 torr. As shown in Fig. S5, it is worth noting that the J–V curve shows negligible changes with the different scan rates and even slightly high performances at a slow scan rate, 3 mV s−1, which would be closer to the steady state for the measurement than the fast scan rates. With this scan rate, 3 mV s−1, the best-performing device showed increased photovoltaic parameters: JSC of 20.1 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.00 V, and FF of 0.72 resulting in a PCE of 14.5%. The average values and standard deviations of PCE, JSC, VOC, and FF with this scan rate were 13.4% (s.d. ±0.78), 19.1 mA cm−2 (s.d. ±0.74), 1.02 V (s.d. ±0.02), and 0.65 (s.d. ±0.04), respectively, with the same devices and batches shown in Table 1.

Fig. 6 and Table S5 display energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) data of the fabricated perovskite films directly indicating how the working pressures affect the compositions in the perovskite films. The ratio of I to Pb increased with the pressure. At the low pressures, the ratio showed relatively small changes and began to increase considerably at a pressure of 4.1 × 10−5 torr, which is analogous to the other physical properties discussed above. Therefore, it can be concluded that the working pressure of CH3NH3I can be an efficient indicator to control the composition of the perovskite in the vacuum co-deposition process. It is rather surprising that the films grown at the pressure of 6.5 × 10−5 torr and 8.3 × 10−5 torr showed lower efficiency than the film grown at the pressure of 5.1 × 10−5 torr even with better crystallinity, higher absorption and stoichiometry closer to 3. The reason is not very clear yet even though there are several reports that solution processed PbI2 rich films with I/Pb = 2.85 or less show better performance than the stoichiometric films with I/Pb = 3 and PbI2 passivation of the perovskite grains under PbI2 rich-conditions reduces the carrier recombination. Further studies are required for the quantitative analysis of the growth mechanism and the structure–performance relationship of the perovskite film under vacuum.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated an effective method to control the composition of CH3NH3I in perovskite films for vacuum co-deposition. The increased working pressure of CH3NH3I in the vacuum chamber can be a suitable indicator for controlling the composition in the perovskite films. The thicknesses, absorbances, XRD spectra, morphologies, device performances, and compositions changed significantly with the working pressure of CH3NH3I. At the optimum pressure, the device showed a maximum efficiency of 14.5% with good reproducibility, and all of the layers were deposited under vacuum. These results will provide a useful guide for the fabrication of perovskite films using the vacuum co-deposition process.


Solar cells were fabricated on ITO-coated glass substrates with a thickness of 150 nm pre-cleaned with acetone and isopropyl alcohol. All of the materials, except the perovskite, were thermally deposited at a base pressure of ca. 2 × 10−6 torr without breaking vacuum. Perovskite layers were grown by co-deposition of PbI2 (Alfa Aesar) and CH3NH3I (Jida Ruibo Optoelectronics Technology Co.) where the deposition rate of PbI2 was fixed at 0.5 Å s−1 and the pressure of CH3NH3I was varied as a deposition parameter. The deposition rates and vacuum pressures were monitored by a crystal thickness sensor (INFICON, 5 MHz) and an ionization gauge (Varian 572, Agilent Technologies), respectively. A 2 nm thick PbI2 layer was deposited before heating up the CH3NH3I source. When CH3NH3I was heated in the chamber, the vacuum pressure (working pressure) was gradually increased, and it was heated until the vacuum pressure reached 0.6, 1.7, 3.2, 4.1, 5.1, 6.5, and 8.3 × 10−5 torr. The relative gas sensitivity (gas correction factor) was set to 1.0 which corresponds to the value for N2. The pressures were maintained within ±0.1 torr from the setting pressures for 1 h during the deposition by controlling the input power of the heating module of the CH3NH3I source manually. The perovskite layers were formed without annealing.

The UV-vis absorption and reflectance spectra of the films were recorded with a Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis spectrophotometer. The AFM topographic images of the perovskite film on the ITO/MoO3/NPB substrate were taken using a PSIA XE-100 scanning probe microscope in the noncontact mode. XRD measurements were performed on a D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker) using Cu Kα radiation. The structure of the devices was ITO/MoO3 (5 nm)/NPB (20 nm)/perovskite/C60 (50 nm)/BCP (8 nm)/Al (100 nm), with an active area of 4 mm2. All of the materials, except perovskite, were thermally deposited at a base pressure of ca. 2 × 10−6 torr without breaking vacuum. MoO3 (Sigma-Aldrich) was deposited at a rate of 0.3 Å s−1 and NPB (Nichem) at a rate of 1 Å s−1 before the deposition of the perovskite layer. After the deposition of the perovskite layers, the substrates were transferred to another chamber without breaking the vacuum to deposit C60 (SES Research) and BCP (Nichem) at a rate of 1 Å s−1 and aluminum at a rate of 4 Å s−1. MoO3 (Sigma-Aldrich) was deposited at a rate of 0.3 Å s−1; NPB (Nichem), C60 (SES Research), and BCP (Nichem) were deposited at a rate of 1 Å s−1; aluminum was deposited at a rate of 4 Å s−1. The calibration of the deposition rates and measurement of the perovskite layers were performed by using a profilometer (KLA-Tencor Alpha-Step IQ). After the deposition, the devices were encapsulated using an epoxy resin with glass cans in a N2 environment. The J–V characteristics were measured under 100 mW cm−2 of simulated AM 1.5G sunlight using a Newport (91160A) solar simulator, and recorded using a Keithley 237 source measurement unit at room temperature. The light intensity was calibrated using a standard Si-solar cell (NREL). The general scan step of the J–V characteristics was 0.02 V at intervals of 0.3 s for each step (0.067 V s−1), and the scan direction was from negative to positive voltage. For the experiment involving changing the scan rates, the various scan steps were 0.1, 0.08, 0.04, 0.005, and 0.001 V, which resulted in scan rates of 0.333, 0.267, 0.133, 0.033, 0.017, and 0.003 V s−1, respectively. The IPCE was measured using a 1000 W Xe lamp combined with a monochromator, and its intensity was calibrated with a Si photodiode. The IPCE was measured without light bias under short-circuit conditions using a lock-in amplifier with monochromatic light from the chopped Xe lamp with 1 kHz. The EDX and SEM data were measured using a MERLIN Compact (FE-SEM).
