Arylamine-based push–pull molecules were successfully grafted onto various chiral diols (isomannide and isosorbide) or glycerol moieties, used as central biosourced cores, for the preparation of multichromophoric materials. Once their optical and electrochemical properties were investigated and rationalized, these new photoactive multimers were evaluated as potential donors in simple, air processed organic solar cells.

Energy is one of the key elements for the well-being of humanity and a current major concern. Its generation, collection and storage are indeed the object of intense research. Among possible sources, and in the context of inevitable shortage of fossil fuels, the photoconversion of solar energy appears to be an ideal alternative and would ensure a serene future for mankind. In nature, photons are harvested and converted into chemical energy via photosynthesis. This impressive efficiency, optimized over millions of years, has aroused the interest and curiosity of many researchers from various fields. Similar to the synthesis and evaluation of π-conjugated light absorbing materials, chlorophyll pigments have, for instance, been extracted and directly sandwiched between two mercury and chromium electrodes to prepare the first natural photovoltaic cells. However, this strategy led to the modest photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of ca 0.1% due to difficult charge separation and extraction. In such contexts, electron acceptors have even been added to the active layers to create heterojunctions but conversions remained low. Another strategy involving the replacement of chlorophyll with other dyes/pigments extracted from biomass did not appear promising with the reported PCE values of <1%. Thus it appears that in vivo effects cannot be “easily” transposed to organic solar cells and/or at least require the chemical modification of the biosourced materials. For instance, modification of the chlorophyll pigments with cyano groups was found to allow fine-tuning of the frontier molecular orbital levels to complement those of acceptors used in the photoactive layer. As a result, the photovoltaic performances were significantly improved, with PCE values reaching up to 2%. Other relevant examples, such as a guaiacole end-capped benzothiadiazole that was recently reported as a molecular donor led to promising efficiencies of ca 6% once blended with PC71BM and application of isoindigo-based polymer donors led to even higher photoconversion efficiencies of ca. 8%. Lastly, it would be impossible to list examples of biosourced key building blocks for organic electronics without mentioning furan. Obtained from lignocellulose, this chalcogenophene has been widely associated with petroleum-based derivatives for the preparation of efficient donors in OPV or p-type materials for OFETs or OLEDs.

Today, PCE values have increasingly exceeded 15% with petroleum-based active layers which can be any polymer or a polymer/small molecule mixture. One drawback is the lengthy synthetic route often required in order to obtain the most interesting and efficient structures. Improving the performance of solar cells can be achieved by small modifications of the molecular structure or by optimizing the devices themselves. For example, the addition of a third complementary compound can sometimes significantly enhance the PCE, even up to 19%. On the other hand, it has been reported in the literature that on identical blends, layer-by-layer fabrication was more efficient than bulk blending. Most recently, a cell fabricated via the layer-by-layer approach achieved a conversion of 17.8%. A large number of approaches are therefore plausible to break away from the current research. For our part, our research focuses on the functionalization and use of biobased building blocks for the preparation, using few steps, of simple and accessible push–pull based molecular donors for organic photovoltaics. Known to combine the advantages of both small molecules and polymers in terms of purification (monodispersity) and processability, we report herein the synthesis of new multimers, built by grafting thiophene or furan-based push–pull moieties onto different bio-sourced central connectors. For this study, three different cores were used, namely, isohexide (ISOS), isomannide (ISOM), and glycerol (Gly) (Fig. 1). In order to rationalize their impact in optoelectronics, their charge transport and photovoltaic properties were evaluated.

The synthetic route to the different multimers, depicted in Scheme 1 is simple, straightforward and ecofriendly.

First, the commercially available bromotriphenylamine was engaged in a Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction with either (5-formylchalcogenophene)boronic acid 1 or 2 to afford the corresponding aldehyde 3 or 4, respectively. In parallel, the three selected biosourced polyols, i.e., isohexide (ISOS), isomannide (ISOM) and glycerol (Gly), were successfully esterified with cyanoacetic acid under acid (PTSA) catalyzed conditions. The resulting compounds (5, 6 and 7) were lastly engaged in a Knoevenagel condensation reaction to afford the target multimers.
Once isolated, their optical properties were investigated and compared. UV-vis experiments were carried out on both solutions (in dichloromethane) and thin films spun cast on glass sheets (Fig. 2 and Fig. S1–S3, ESI).
In solution, all the spectra were found to be similar, as expected, with an absorption maximum at ca 486 nm for the compound bearing thiophene and 490 nm for the furan derivative. This corresponds to an internal charge transfer (ICT) going from TPA to an electron-deficient moiety, characteristic of these push–pull moieties. In the solid state, ICT bands broaden and shift toward the longer wavelengths resulting in onsets measured at ca 579 nm, 576 nm, 574 nm and 596 nm, corresponding to optical band gaps (Eoptg) of 2.14 eV, 2.15 eV, 2.16 eV and 2.08 eV for ISOS-F, ISOS-T, ISOM-F and Gly-T respectively (Fig. 2b and Fig SI1–3 in ESI). Attributed to aggregation, these results clearly revealed that both the chalcogenophene and stereochemistry of the dianhydrohexitols (ISOS and ISOM) have limited effects on the optical and self-assembly properties.
With good solubility in common organic solvents, the electrochemical properties of the multimers were subsequently evaluated using Bu4NPF6 0.1 M as a supporting electrolyte in acetonitrile (Fig. 3).
Although all compounds showed a reversible oxidation wave at ca 0.59 V, assigned to the formation of stable radical cations, irreversible processes were systematically observed in the anodic region (Epc = −1.44V). Interestingly, while the reduction of each of the push–pull derivatives occurred simultaneously in the case of ISOS-T and Gly-T, a second irreversible process at lower potentials was observed for ISOS-F and ISOM-F, as though redox-active molecules were electronically connected to each other. The optical and electrochemical data are gathered in Table 1. Besides this experimental curiosity, results provided by cyclic voltammetry are consistent with optical data, confirming the minor impact of both the chalcogenophene and central core on the electronic properties.

Designed as molecular donors, as shown by the HOMO–LUMO level alignment (Fig. 5), for organic photovoltaic applications, the potential of all four multimers was subsequently evaluated in fullerene-based bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. To this end, various ratios between the donor materials and PC71BM were evaluated and the best PCE were obtained when 1:4 (w/w%) donor(D):acceptor(A) blends were used. The corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves recorded under AM 1.5G simulated solar illumination (100 mW cm−2) are plotted and compared in Fig. 4A. With PCE values being tightly bunched, the impact of the central core on photoconversion is not obvious upon first examination. However, a close look at the overall photovoltaic parameters gathered in Table 2 reveals subtle differences. First, comparison of the chalcogenophene effect from ISOS-F and ISOS-T emphasizes a better PCE achieved with the thiophene derivative mainly due to better short circuit current (Jsc) and slightly improved fill factors (FF) despite a lower open circuit voltage (Voc). Hole mobility measurements performed on neat donor films actually revealed an order of magnitude difference in favor of the furan based derivative. This counterintuitive result suggests hindered charge extraction once blended with the PC71BM. Now regarding the impact of the central core, a slight difference in PCE was first observed when the two dianhydrohexitols (ISOS and ISOM) were compared. In the latter cases, Jsc and FF values increase along with the mobility when moving from ISOM to ISOS. On the other hand, even if the best results were achieved with the trimer due to larger Voc and better FF, modest Jsc were recorded despite the highest hole mobility value being measured for the series. The EQE supports the solar cell results; the spectra show lower conversions for ISOS-F and ISOM-F and slightly higher for Gly-T. From the EQE plots, the Jsc was determined via their integrations and was found to be slightly lower than the Jsc measured from the I/V curves. Further device optimization would be necessary to fully understand and confirm the physical phenomena behind the reported trends.

Even if far from the state-of-the-art in terms of PCE, the series synthesized and characterized herein demonstrated that biosourced building blocks can be used for the preparation of simple and accessible photo-active materials. With great film forming properties and good charge transport, the promising, although modest photovoltaic performances clearly suggest that there is room for improvement in terms of power conversion efficiency, particularly through an in-depth investigation and optimization of the morphology of the blend. However, efforts will focus on the preparation of fully biosourced π-conjugated photoactive structures.
