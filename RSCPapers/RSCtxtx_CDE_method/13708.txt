In this work, we have successfully utilized a facile hydrothermal method to prepare crystalline Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles (ZSO NPs) and applied them as an efficient electron-transporting layer (ETL) via a simple room-temperature solution process for perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). The superior semiconducting properties of this ZSO-based ETL enable an efficient (PCE: 17.7%) inverted p–i–n PVSC to be fabricated with respectable ambient stability. It can retain over 90% of its original PCE after being stored under ambient conditions for 14 days under 30 ± 5% relative humidity. Moreover, it also facilitates the fabrication of efficient conventional n–i–p PVSCs with a PCE of ∼14.5% and ∼11.4% achieved on a glass/ITO rigid substrate and PEG/ITO flexible substrate, respectively.

Organometallic halide perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have drawn enormous attention since their first appearance in 2009. Currently, the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the state-of-the-art PVSCs has already reached 22.1% in spite of their very short development time, which can rival that of the existing inorganic photovoltaics such as silicon and CdTe. Such rapid progress in increasing their efficiencies combined with the facile solution processability of perovskites has improved their candidacy as a cost-effective photovoltaic technology that can address the scalability issue of renewable energy.

Similar to other thin-film photovoltaic devices, PVSCs possess a multi-layered device configuration, which consists of a photoactive perovskite layer, charge-transporting interlayers (CTLs), and collecting electrodes. The CTLs can be used to effectively mitigate the interfacial energy barriers at the perovskite/electrode interfaces to suppress charge recombination and photovoltage loss in devices, thereby maximizing the device's performance. Hence, some of the recent PVSC research studies have been shifted to develop efficient, low-temperature solution processable CTLs for facilitating the fabrication of PVSCs on flexible substrates.
In general, PVSCs have two different device architectures, conventional (n–i–p) and inverted (p–i–n) configurations, for which the sequence of the employed hole-transporting interlayer (HTL) and electron-transporting interlayer (ETL) is reversed. Hence, the CTLs must meet distinct requirements while employed in different positions inside the stratified devices. For example, when a CTL is used underneath a perovskite layer, it should possess compatible surface energy with perovskite to facilitate homogenous film formation and crystallization. In addition, it should also have high transparency to reduce parasitic light absorption of the top perovskite layer. While a CTL should not cause erosion of the underlying perovskite film during deposition, it would be beneficial if it can also function as an encapsulation layer to prevent or slow down the penetration of moisture into the perovskite to enhance the device lifetime.
Thus far, various inorganic and organic CTLs have been exploited for high-performance PVSCs. Initially, the HTL development is mainly focused on organic-based semiconductors, such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-dimethoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulphonate (PEDOT:PSS) that have been widely used in both conventional and inverted PVSCs. More recently, inorganic HTLs have been explored to realize efficient PVSCs, such as CuSCN, CuI, Cu2O, CuO and NiOx. In contrast, the development of ETLs for PVSCs was initially based on inorganic transition metal oxides (TMOs), such as TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, and Zn2SnO4 (ZSO), while the evolution of organic ETLs was based on the fullerene-based derivatives. In general, crystalline (and amorphous for some cases) inorganic semiconductors possess superior electronic properties, higher ambient stability, and lower production cost compared to organic semiconductors. However, to achieve the required crystallinity of inorganic CTLs, more sophisticated processing procedures than those of the organic counterparts are needed, which significantly impede their widespread application in devices. Therefore, it is desirable to develop milder synthetic routes for preparing efficient inorganic CTLs to facilitate interfacial engineering of PVSCs.
Recently, ZSO NPs have been proven to be a promising ETL for PVSCs since it can not only be processed through orthogonal solvents for perovskites but also possess a high electron mobility of 10–25 cm2 V−1 s−1, wide optical bandgap (3.8 eV), and well-aligned conduction band edge (∼−4.1 eV) compared to that of CH3NH3PbI3. Besides, ZSO is chemically stable towards acid/base and ambient environments. However, the synthesis of a ternary ZSO system is not straightforward due to its easy phase separation. To alleviate this, several approaches have been reported to yield pure and crystalline ZSO. For example, Seok et al. have lately reported a solution-based synthesis of ZSO NPs at a reduced temperature of below 100 °C which led to the development of efficient PVSCs. More recently, they have further synthesized ZSO NPs and quantum dots at reduced temperature and employed them as ETLs to realize an efficient (PCE: 16%) flexible n–i–p PVSC. Nevertheless, the solvents they used contain hazardous hydrazine, which is unfavorable for widespread application.
In this study, we have successfully utilized a facile hydrothermal method to prepare crystalline ZSO NPs and applied them as an efficient ETL for PVSCs via a simple room-temperature solution process. Compared to that reported by Seok et al., our approach adopts environmentally friendly solvents and much simplified processing procedures. Benefitting from its superior semiconducting properties, this ZSO NP ETL facilitates efficient electron transfer and extraction in the derived devices. Moreover, its good ambient stability also enables the derived inverted p–i–n PVSC to have better ambient stability, while its room-temperature processability facilitates the fabrication of an efficient flexible conventional n–i–p PVSC. This demonstrates the merits and general applicability of hydrothermally derived ZSO NPs as an efficient ETL for solar cells.

In this study, a modified hydrothermal method was utilized to synthesize ZSO NPs, where tetramethylammonium hydroxide pentahydrate (TMAH·5H2O) was used to adjust the basicity of the precursor solution to avoid the formation of stannate, zincate, or coordination with Sn4+ or Zn2+. In particular, the ZSO NPs were prepared in a high pressure autoclave with 0.25 mmol of (NH4)2CO3 dissolved in a mixed solvent of 5 mL deionized water and 5 mL ethanol. Then, 0.5 mmol of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.25 mmol of SnCl4·5H2O were added in this ammonium carbonate solution with vigorous stirring, followed by the addition of 2.5 mL of 1 M TMAH·5H2O aqueous solution. After stirring for 20 min, the solution was transferred into a 25 mL autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 12 h. The obtained products were collected and washed with deionized water and ethanol by centrifuging three times. Finally, the product was vacuum-dried at room temperature. For device fabrication, the obtained ZSO NPs were dispersed in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) with different concentrations. The preparation of a TiO2 film adopts the procedures reported in the literature. In brief, a TiO2 ETL was deposited onto a cleaned FTO by spin-coating a precursor solution made of 0.5 mL of titanium butoxide and 50 μL of 38% HCl solution in 6 mL ethanol at 4000 rpm for 60 s, followed by sintering at 500 °C for 1 h.


For inverted p–i–n PVSCs, the NiOx solution was prepared by dissolving nickel(II) acetylacetonate in ethanol (0.1 M) with 8.3 μl of HCl (38 wt%) in the solution, followed by stirring in a sealed glass vial at 50 °C for 2 h. ITO glass substrates were cleaned via ultra-sonication in the sequence of detergent, DI water, acetone, and 10 min immersion in isopropanol, and then treated with UV-ozone for 10 min. Afterward, the NiOx layer was spin-coated onto the ITO glass at 3000 rpm for 60 s and annealed at 400 °C for 1 h in air. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared according to our previous work. MAI (0.8 mmol) FAI (0.2 mmol), PbI2 (0.8 mmol), and PbBr2 (0.2 mmol) were dissolved in a mixed solvent of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (300 μL) and γ-butyrolactone (GBL) (700 μl). The perovskite film was spin-coated in three steps: 500 rpm for 5 s, 1000 rpm for 15 s, and 5000 rpm for 40 s. Anhydrous toluene (500 μl) was added dropwise at the third stage for 20 s before stopping the spin-coating. Then, the perovskite film was annealed at 100 °C for 10 min in a glovebox. For the PCBM layer, 15 mg PCBM was dissolved in chlorobenzene and then spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at 1500 rpm for 60 s. Afterward, the ZSO NP layer (15 mg mL−1 in IPA) was spin-coated at a speed of 4000 rpm for 60 s 3 times. Finally, a 150 nm thick top Ag electrode was evaporated under high vacuum (<2 × 10−7 Torr), and the area was defined as 3.14 mm2.

For conventional n–i–p PVSCs, the ZSO ETL was deposited onto the ITO glass by spin-coating the ZSO NP precursor solution (15 mg mL−1 in IPA) at 4000 rpm for 60 s 3 times, followed by depositing PCBM and perovskite layers; the processing conditions for both layers are the same as those of the methods described for inverted PVSCs. Afterwards, a solution of 24.5 mg of spiro-OmeTAD, 10 μl of 4-tert-butyl pyridine, and 20 μl of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI) solution (175.1 mg Li-TSFI in 1 mL acetonitrile) in 1 mL of chlorobenzene was spin-coated on the perovskite layer as the HTL. Finally, a 150 nm thick top Ag electrode was evaporated under high vacuum (<2 × 10−7 Torr), and the area was defined as 3.14 mm2.

The ZSO NPs and perovskite films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (FEI Sirion XL30 SEM operated at 5 kV), X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Bruker F8 Focus Powder XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Tecnai G2 F20 TEM at 200 kV). The absorption spectra were measured by using a Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR. The J–V curves and steady-state photocurrent of PVSCs were measured by using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter under AM 1.5 G illumination of a filter solar simulator (100 mW cm−2). The EQE spectra were measured by combining a monochromated 450 W xenon lamp (Oriel) with a sourcemeter (Keithley 2400) and calculated using a calibrated Si photodiode (OSI-Optoelectronics). The steady-state photoluminescence spectra were obtained by using a Horiba Fluorolog FL-3 with an excitation wavelength of 550 nm.


The crystallinity of ZSO powders prepared by the modified hydrothermal method was measured by XRD as shown in Fig. 1a. The characteristic diffraction peaks of ZSO powders in accordance with its standard peaks (PDF#24-1470) are clearly shown. According to the Scherrer formula, the size of the prepared NPs is ∼12 nm. It is important to note that the characteristic peaks of ZnO and SnO2 are absent, confirming that there is no obvious phase separation for the prepared ZSO NPs.

SEM and TEM were then utilized to characterize the morphology of the derived film and the associated crystallinity. As shown in Fig. 1b and S1, by optimizing the concentration of precursor solutions, the ZSO NPs can form a homogenous film even on a nonpolar PCBM layer via simple spin-coating at room temperature. This capability is conducive in preventing the short circuit problems for the derived PVSC. The TEM image shown in Fig. 1c confirms that the sizes of ZSO NPs are mostly around 10–15 nm while the inserted corresponding electron diffraction pattern verifies their polycrystalline nature. The high crystallinity of these prepared ZSO NPs is further confirmed by their high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image as presented in Fig. 1d, where the measured lattice spacing of 0.217 nm is congruent with the inter-planar spacing of the (400) plane of the ZSO crystal.
The absorption and transmission spectra of ZSO NPs were measured and compared with those of conventional TiO2 films. As shown in Fig. S2, the ZSO NPs possess a larger bandgap (Eg) (3.97 eV) than TiO2 (3.50 eV), which is in accordance with the values reported in the literature. Given the same thickness for both films, ZSO shows a slightly lower absorbance than TiO2. Combined with its larger Eg, ZSO yields an improved high transmittance in the wavelengths between 300 nm and the near infrared region as compared to TiO2 (Fig. S3). This high transparency can effectively avoid the parasitic absorption of the perovskite absorber to maximize the resultant photocurrent of the derived PVSC.
The conductivity of the prepared ZSO film was examined by the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of a simplified device (ITO/ZSO/Ag) and compared with that of the TiO2 film (FTO/TiO2/Ag) as shown in Fig. S4a. The DC (direct current) conductivity (σ0) of the ZSO film estimated from the I–V slope according to the formula of (σ0), I = σ0Ad−1V, where A is the device area (3.14 mm2) and d is the thickness of the TMO film (both are 30 nm thick), is ∼0.0082 mS cm−1. It is about 45 times higher than the value (∼0.00018 mS cm−1) of the TiO2 film estimated from its ohmic contact region (Fig. S4b), manifesting the superior charge-transporting properties of the ZSO film.
To understand the potential of ZSO functioning as an ETL in PVSCs, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is performed to evaluate the charge transfer efficiency between the perovskite layer and the ZSO film. As depicted in Fig. S5, all samples exhibit an emission peak around 760 nm originating from the perovskite layer. While the perovskite layer is deposited on various ETLs, different degrees of PL quenching can be observed. Encouragingly, the ZSO ETL shows slightly better PL quenching than the PCBM ETL due to its superior charge mobility. The PL quenching can be further improved by employing a bilayered ZSO/PCBM ETL for better electronic coupling between the perovskite and PCBM in the bilayered ETL. Hence, the bilayered ZSO/PCBM ETL was employed to fabricate both inverted p–i–n and conventional n–i–p PVSCs hereafter.

To examine the efficacy of the ZSO ETL in inverted p–i–n PVSCs, a device with the configuration of ITO/NiOx/perovskite/PCBM/ZSO/Ag is fabricated as illustrated in Fig. 2a. The SEM cross-sectional image of the device shown in Fig. 2b clearly illustrates the planar structure of the fabricated PVSC, where the thickness of NiOx, perovskite, PCBM, and ZSO layers is ∼20 nm, ∼220–250 nm, ∼90 nm, and ∼100 nm, respectively. Fig. 2c presents the energy level diagram of the fabricated inverted PVSC. As shown, the valence band maxima (VBM) of the NiOx HTL is well aligned with that of the perovskite while the conduction band minima (CBM) of the ZSO ETL is well aligned with that of the perovskite, which is beneficial for maximizing the built-in voltage of the fabricated device to result in optimum open-circuit voltage (VOC). As mentioned earlier, a PCBM layer is employed at the perovskite/ZSO interface to facilitate the electron transfer from the perovskite to the cathode. Besides, it can also passivate the perovskite surface traps to reduce hysteresis in devices.

The J–V characteristics of the devices were compared in Fig. 2d using PCBM and ZSO/PCBM ETLs and measured under a medium scan rate of 0.1 V s−1 and AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). All the relevant photovoltaic parameters including VOC, short-circuit current (JSC), and fill factor (FF) are summarized in Table 1. Very encouragingly, the ZSO/PCBM-based PVSC yields a high PCEMAX of 17.76% with a high VOC of 1.15 V, a JSC of 21.34 mA cm−2, and a FF of 72.3%, outperforming the performance (PCEMAX: 13.46%, VOC: 1.11 V, JSC: 17.89 mA cm−2, and FF: 68.0%) of the PCBM-based PVSC. This enhanced PCE can be clearly attributed to the improved electron transport properties of the ZSO-based ETL than those of the simplex PCBM film (6.1 × 10−2 cm2 V s−1). Moreover, the ZSO ETL has a much deeper-lying VBM of −7.9 eV than PCBM (−6.0 eV) which can provide better hole blocking to suppress charge recombination at the interface, which will contribute to higher VOC of the ZSO/PCBM-based PVSC.

To investigate whether hysteresis is forming in the resultant devices, the J–V curves of the inverted PVSC were measured by various scan rates (0.01 V s−1 and 1 V s−1) under reverse and forward scans. As shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1, no apparent J–V hysteresis could be observed, which explains the role PCBM might play. As mentioned earlier, the PCBM layer has been reported to effectively passivate the perovskite interface to improve the electron coupling at this corresponding interface. To confirm the reliability of the fabricated PVSC, the stabilized photocurrent was measured at a constant bias of 0.91 V near the maximum power point. As shown in Fig. 2e, a steady-state JSC of ∼19.2 mA cm−2 can be obtained, corresponding to a stable PCE of ∼17.5%. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the top-performing device is plotted in Fig. 2f. As shown, a broad EQE plateau of over 70% across the wavelengths between 380 and 750 nm can be seen, suggesting the superior photo-response of the perovskite absorber. Note that the JSC (∼20.5 mA cm−2) integrated from the EQE spectrum is consistent with the value obtained in J–V measurements.
To date, the most challenging issue for PVSCs lies in its long-term stability, especially its ambient stability. Because the ZSO film is quite stable under ambient conditions, it should be possible to provide shielding for the derived devices against moisture if it is applied on top of them. To verify this, the surface energy of the studied ETLs was examined and shown in Fig. 3a and b. As clearly shown, the surface of the ZSO-based ETL is more hydrophobic than that of the simplex PCBM ETL, where the contact angle increases from 66.7° to 88.7°. This suggests that the bilayered PCBM/ZSO ETL may be able to introduce better ambient stability for the derived devices.
With this in mind, the ambient stability of the studied inverted PVSCs was tested at room temperature without any encapsulation. Fig. 3c and d present the PCE of PCBM- and PCBM/ZSO-based inverted PVSCs as a function of storage time under different environments of controlled humidity. The PCBM/ZSO-based device clearly shows better ambient stability, for which the PCE remains over 90% of its original value after 14 days under ambient conditions under a relative humidity of 30 ± 5%, while the PCE of the PCBM-based device drops rapidly to 45% of its initial value under the same testing conditions. This improved ambient stability clearly illustrates the advantage of the ZSO ETL for self-encapsulation to prevent the underlying layers from being exposed to moisture.

Given its good solution processability at room temperature, the ZSO ETL was also explored in the conventional n–i–p configuration for fabricating flexible PVSCs. To verify its efficacy as the ETL in n–i–p PVSCs, a device with the configuration of ITO/ZSO/PCBM/perovskite/Spiro-OmeTAD/Ag is first fabricated on a glass substrate (Fig. 4a) to compare with the results from the reference device using a TiO2/PCBM ETL.

It has been reported that the film quality and surface morphology of the perovskite layer will significantly affect the performance of the derived devices. As shown in Fig. S7, the perovskite film grown on the ZSO/PCBM ETL exhibits a homogeneous surface morphology with a densely packed grain size of ∼200–300 nm, which is slightly larger than that of the film grown on the TiO2/PCBM ETL (∼100–200 nm). The larger perovskite grain size is beneficial for better charge transport and dissociation due to reduced grain boundaries and associated charge recombination.

Fig. 4b displays the cross-sectional SEM image of the fabricated conventional PVSC, where the thickness of the ZSO, PCBM, perovskite, and Spiro-OMeTAD layers is ∼60 nm, ∼40 nm, ∼220–250 nm and ∼110 nm, respectively. Similar to the ZSO-derived inverted PVSC, the fabricated conventional device also possesses a nice planar structure. Fig. 4c presents the energy level diagram of the device, where the CBM and VBM of the perovskite layer are well aligned with those of the employed ETL and HTL.

Fig. 4d illustrates the J–V characteristics of these fabricated conventional PVSCs under a medium scan rate of 0.1 V s−1 and AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The related photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. As shown, the ZSO/PCBM-derived device shows a PCEMAX of 15.01%, with a VOC of 1.08 V, a JSC of 21.08 mA cm−2, and a FF of 65.9% under reverse scan, surpassing the performance (PCEMAX: 13.74%, VOC: 1.04 V, JSC: 19.77 mA cm−2, and FF: 66.8%) of the reference device using the regular TiO2/PCBM ETL. The enhanced JSC of the ZSO/PCBM-based device compared to that of the TiO2/PCBM-based devices should be the result of higher conductivity and transparency of the ZSO layer, as discussed earlier.

Fig. S8 presents the J–V curves of the top-performing conventional PVSC measured at different scan rates (0.01 V s−1 and 1 V s−1) under reverse and forward scans and the summarized performance is shown in Table S2. The PCE of the devices obtained from the scan rate of 0.01 V s−1 and 1 V s−1 is 14.48% and 14.49%, respectively. A small hysteresis is observed, which might stem from the interfacial charge traps in the device. Its stabilized photocurrent measured at a constant bias of 0.81 V near the maximum power point is shown in Fig. 4e, wherein a steady-state PCE of ∼14.3% is observed. All these results suggest good reliability of the fabricated conventional PVSC. Plotted in Fig. 4f is the EQE spectrum of the top-performing conventional device, where a broad EQE profile of over 70% across the wavelengths between 390 and 750 nm is observed. In addition, the JSC (∼20.1 mA cm−2) calculated from the EQE spectrum matches well with that measured from the J–V curve.
Following this success, the flexible device was fabricated next on a ITO-coated poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrate (PET/ITO). Shown in Fig. 5 are the resultant J–V curves and the photo of a real device. Encouragingly, the ZSO ETL can endow flexible PVSCs to be fabricated with a high PCEMAX of 11.61%, with a decent VOC of 1.05 V, a JSC of 17.35 mA cm−2, and a FF of 63.8% under reverse scan (Table S3). The lower JSC and FF of the flexible device compared to those of the rigid one are due to the higher sheet resistance of ITO on the PET substrate. Further improvement can be expected by engineering an ITO-free electrode.

In summary, we have successfully utilized a facile hydrothermal method to prepare crystalline ZSO NPs and applied them as an efficient ETL via a simple room temperature solution process to realize both efficient conventional n–i–p and inverted p–i–n PVSCs. The superior properties of the ZSO NP based ETL enable an efficient PVSC (PCE: 17.7%) to be fabricated with enhanced ambient stability (over 90% of the initial PCE can be retained after 14 day storage under ambient conditions under 30 ± 5% relative humidity). Moreover, it also can facilitate the fabrication of efficient conventional n–i–p PVSCs to be fabricated on a PET/ITO flexible substrate. This demonstrates the merits of hydrothermally derived ZSO NPs as an efficient ETL for solar cells.
