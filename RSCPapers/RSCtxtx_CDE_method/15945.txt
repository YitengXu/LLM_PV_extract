Solution-processed phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) was investigated as a hole extraction layer for organic solar cells without any post-annealing processes. PMA is a stable, cost-effective, and commercial soluble oxide cluster, which dramatically simplifies the device fabrication process as well as reduces the cost. The PMA-based device with an active layer of poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexl)carbonyl]thieno [3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7) mixed with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 8.32% compared with 7.46% for an evaporated MoO3 (e-MoO3)-based device. Transient electrical output characteristics, optical measurements as well as scanning Kelvin probe microscopy were utilized to investigate the improvement in the performance of the device. The results indicated that the enhanced PCE was due to suppressed charge recombination as well as an improved optical path across the device, which led to an enhanced short-circuit current density and fill factor. In addition, the PMA-based device displayed improved long term stability in ambient conditions compared to the e-MoO3-based device.

Organic solar cells offer great technological potential for renewable electrical energy, with the attraction of a cost-effective and low temperature fabrication process. The most widely studied organic solar cell is that with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure, which consists of donor and acceptor materials, usually conjugated polymers as the donors and fullerene derivatives as the acceptors. Great efforts have been made in recent years to improve the performance of polymer–fullerene derivative BHJ solar cells and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 10% have been achieved recently. Both the donor polymer and the acceptor fullerene derivative play important roles in the performance of BHJ solar cells. In order to establish electronic equilibrium and minimize the charge extraction barrier, increased attention has been paid to the metal/organic interfacial layers. These additional layers, called charge (hole or electron) extraction layers, are used to improve charge collection. These layers are essential for achieving high-performance organic solar cells.

Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is commonly adopted as a hole extraction layer because of its easily solution-processable ability, the smooth character of the resulting interlayer and the energy level alignment of its work function (4.8–5.2 eV) to the HOMO level of many donor materials. However, its acidic and hygroscopic nature has been associated with substantial device instability. Therefore, transition metal oxides, such as MoO3, V2O5, WO3, and NiOx, have been employed as alternatives to PEDOT:PSS due to their large work function and marked hole extraction properties. In addition, relatively stable devices based on metal oxides have been demonstrated. However, the most widely used method for metal oxide deposition is based on vacuum deposition techniques, which do not satisfy the requirement of a low-cost manufacturing process. Therefore, many studies have been focused on solution-based methods to fabricate metal oxide films. Solution processing from nanoparticle dispersions has been reported. Nevertheless, a substantial drawback of the approach is the aggregation of nanoparticles into larger clusters and excessive film roughness, which are unfavorable for large scale device fabrication. Another solution-processed method for transition metal oxide films is the sol–gel technique. This method requires a post-annealing process so that the precursor can be converted to a metal oxide film by hydrolysis, making it incompatible with inverted organic solar cells because many organic materials cannot tolerate an annealing process. Very recently, solution-processed MoO3 film has been fabricated using a very low annealing temperature (70 °C), which shows comparable performance to a process utilizing PEDOT:PSS in an organic solar cell. However, an annealing process at any temperature may still be incompatible with some active layers for an inverted organic device, which remains an open issue to be addressed in the future.
Phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) is a type of stable, commercially-available and cost-effective soluble oxide cluster. It consists of a phosphorus anion and twelve molybdenum oxyanions forming a closed three-dimensional framework. All the oxyanions are free of any dangling bonds and are expected to be self-passivating. As an environmentally friendly material, PMA possesses many advantages such as solubility, excellent thermal stability, highly tunable structural properties, and high transparency in the visible spectrum. It displays excellent solubility in many polar solvents such as alcoholic solvents.
In this work, we investigated PMA as a hole extraction layer both in normal and inverted organic photovoltaic devices. The active layer was composed of poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). The PMA layer can be functionalized well by a spin coating process without any further treatment. Particularly, this kind of device employing PMA exhibited better optical properties and less charge recombination compared with an evaporated MoO3 (e-MoO3) device, resulting in improved device performance. In addition, excellent long term stability of the PMA device has been demonstrated in this work.

PC71BM (Solenne) was commercially available. PTB7 and PMA powder (purity: 98%) were purchased from 1-Material Co. and Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, respectively. Zinc acetate dehydrate, ethanolamine 2-methoxyethanol, chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,8-diiodineoctdane were used as purchased. Deionized water with a resistance of >18 MΩ cm was supplied by a Nanopure Diamond system.


Zinc acetate dihydrate (1 g) was dissolved in a mixture of ethanolamine (275 μL) and 2-methoxyethanol (10 mL) under vigorous stirring for 12 h in an ambient environment for a hydrolysis reaction. PMA powder was dispersed in isopropanol with different concentrations of 0.5 mg mL−1, 1 mg mL−1, 2 mg mL−1 and 2.5 mg mL−1 for tuning the film thickness.


The inverted structure of the organic solar cell is depicted in Fig. 1(a). The ITO-coated glass was ultrasonically cleaned in deionized water, ethanol and acetone in sequence, and then subjected to UV–ozone treatment for 15 min. The ZnO precursor was spin coated onto the ITO substrate at 4000 rpm for 1 min and then annealed at 150 °C for 90 min. Next, an active layer of PTB7:PC71BM was spin coated on the top of the ZnO films in nitrogen. The weight ratio of PTB7:PC71BM was 1:1.5 (in CB with 3% 1,8-diiodineoctdane). Then the PMA solution was spin coated onto the active layer without any post-treatment. For comparison, MoO3 with different thicknesses was thermally evaporated onto the PTB7:PC71BM film as a reference sample. Finally, 80 nm thick Ag was evaporated through a shadow mask under 10−6 Torr. The active area of each pixel was 8.25 mm2 corrected by the microscope.


The photovoltaic characterization was conducted in an ambient environment. All of the electrical data was recorded by a Keithley 2612 source meter. A Newport 91160 solar simulator equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp and an air mass (AM) 1.5 filter were used to generate a simulated AM 1.5 solar spectrum irradiation source. The irradiation intensity was 100 mW cm−2 calibrated by a Newport standard silicon solar cell 91150. A Newport monochromator 74125 and power meter 1918 with silicon detector 918D were used for the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. For transient electrical output characterization, a 532 nm diode laser was used as the optical perturbation. The pulse duration and the repetition rate were set to be 1 μs and 100 Hz, respectively. The photovoltage transients were measured over a range of light intensities from approximately 0.001–1 sun, corresponding to a Voc range of 0.1–0.7 V. The photocurrent was measured by short-circuiting the device using the 50 Ω input termination of the oscilloscope.


The UV-vis absorbance was recorded on an Analytik Jena SPECORD S600. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted in a KRATOS ULTRA-DLD ultrahigh vacuum surface analysis system with a monochromatic aluminum Kα source (1486.6 eV). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectrum (UPS) measurements were carried out by using an unfiltered He I (21.2 eV) gas discharge lamp and a total instrumental energy resolution of 100 meV. The morphologies and surface potentials of the PMA films were obtained using an atomic force microscope (AFM) and a scanning Kelvin probe microscope (SKPM) (Veeco, Multimode V), respectively. The element mapping images were obtained by a FEI Quanta 200 FEG high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM).


The Keggin structure of the (PMo12O40)3− anion of PMA consists of a phosphate and twelve molybdenum oxyanions, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The structure is quite stable and easily dispersed in isopropanol, as shown in Fig. 1(c).

These properties are particularly beneficial to device processing and stability. The short-circuit current density (Jsc), the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the fill factor (FF) and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted organic solar cells based on PTB7:PC71BM with different buffer layers under AM 1.5 at 100 mW cm−2 are summarized in Tables 1 and S1. The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of devices with buffer layers of optimal 6 nm thick e-MoO3 and 1 mg mL−1 PMA are shown in Fig. 2(a). A high PCE of 8.32% was achieved in the device with the PMA hole extraction layer, while a PCE of 7.46% was obtained for the reference e-MoO3 device. The improved performance was attributed to the higher Jsc (17.38 mA cm−2vs. 15.65 mA cm−2) and FF (0.68 vs. 0.66). The EQE spectra, as shown in Fig. 2(b), also exhibited improved photon–electron conversion in the whole spectrum range. Jsc can be calculated by integrating the EQE curve with elementary charge from an AM 1.5 solar photon flux spectrum. The calculated Jsc was within 6% of the corresponding measured Jsc. However, the Voc of the device based on PMA was slightly lower than that of the reference.

It is well known that the work functions of hole extraction layers play an important role in the overall performance of inverted organic solar cells due to the energy level alignment of the donor material and metal anode. The work function values can be evaluated by subtracting the cutoff value from the excitation source of 21.2 eV. From the spectra shown in Fig. S1, work functions of 5.0 eV and 5.2 eV were obtained for the PMA film and e-MoO3 (air-exposed), respectively. Thus, the obtained lower Voc of the PMA device was due to the lower work function of the PMA film.
In order to verify the good hole extraction properties of PMA, the surface potential difference between the PTB7 and PMA films was directly probed using SKPM. The PTB7 film was partly covered with a PMA layer in order to form a large interface. The sample was prepared by drop casting a small amount of PMA solution onto the PTB7 film and then letting it spread slowly while it dried to form the interface. The topographic and corresponding surface potential images of PMA–PTB7 are shown in Fig. 3.
At the interface of the two materials, the topography showed an abrupt bump due to accumulated material caused by the drop casting process. In addition, the surface potential at the interface area was not uniform, which might be associated with the intermixing of these two materials by diffusion. However, the surface potential of the two distinct parts tended to be uniform away from the interface area, with a potential difference of approximately 50 mV shown. The negative surface potential of PMA indicated that there existed a microscopic electric dipole moment with the negative charge end pointing toward the Ag electrode and the positive charge end pointing toward the active layer. The direction of this dipole moment would reinforce the built-in potential across the device, which originates from the asymmetric contact at the electrodes. Besides, the incorporation of a PMA buffer layer also created an enhanced electric field at the active layer/anode interface that would strongly favor charge transport and extraction.
As a hole extraction layer, the PMA morphology also plays a critical role in the overall performance of organic solar cells. A certain thickness of PMA is required to obtain a compact layer to avoid any leakage current; too thick a film increases the series resistance (RS) of the device. Thereafter, an optimum PMA thickness was essential to achieve the optimal device performance. The layer thickness was tuned by varying the PMA concentration with constant film fabrication conditions. AFM images of the different PMA films on the PTB7:PC71BM film are shown in Fig. 4. The left half in each template shows the phase image while the right one shows the three dimensional height image. The root mean square (RMS) roughness values were 0.974, 3.67, 5.32, 11.2 and 12.1 nm for PMA concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 2.5 mg mL−1, respectively. The J–V characteristics of devices with different thicknesses of PMA are displayed in Fig. 5 and summarized in Table 1.
As the concentration of PMA was increased, the film RMS roughness increased, and at high concentrations the PMA formed a compact layer. When the concentration of PMA was 0.5 mg mL−1, the active layer was partially covered with small domains instead of a uniform film as shown in Fig. 4(b). In this condition, there existed two kinds of interfaces containing active layer/metal and active layer/PMA/metal. The direct contact between the metal and active layers would result in a deteriorated device performance. When the concentration of PMA was increased to 1 mg mL−1, the size of the small islands changed to approximately 30 nm.
As shown in Fig. S2, the surface roughness away from the islands (RMS: 1.65 nm) was larger than that of the pristine PTB7:PC71BM film (RMS: 0.64 nm) in the same selected range, which indicated that there existed a compact PMA film on the PTB7:PC71BM layer. A PMA concentration of 1 mg mL−1 achieved the optimal device performance. However, as the PMA concentration (2 mg mL−1 or more) continued to increase, the device performance decreased. This phenomenon was ascribed to overgrown PMA islands (∼60 nm) formed in the interface as shown in Fig. 4(d) and (e), which increased the series resistance (RS) and thus deteriorated the FF of the device. As a result, the optimum PMA concentration for fabricating the buffer layer was 1 mg mL−1. In addition, we demonstrated that isopropanol hardly had any effect on the morphology of the active layer, as shown from the AFM images in Fig. S3. These results exclude the solvent effect on the active film morphology.
As discussed above, PMA was proven to be a good candidate for the hole extraction layer in inverted organic solar cells. Besides that, the device with the PMA buffer layer displayed slightly better performance than that with e-MoO3, which mainly resulted from a larger Jsc and FF. Therefore, in order to figure out the origin of the improved performance, we also measured the optical absorption spectra of PMA and e-MoO3 films. The thicknesses of both materials were as the same as those used in the device fabrication process. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the optical reflectance spectra of PTB7:PC71BM-based inverted organic solar cells with e-MoO3 or PMA as the hole extraction layer were also measured. The reflectance of the PMA-based device was lower than the e-MoO3-based one in the visible light region, which further verified that there was more light reflected by the metal electrode and consequently absorbed by PTB7:PC71BM in the PMA case. The schematic diagram of the light propagation is shown in Fig. 6(c). Therefore, the better optical properties of PMA over that of e-MoO3 increased the photon collection and charge generation, which was one of the important reasons for the enhanced Jsc and FF.
In addition, the non-optimized normal-structure device to replace PEDOT:PSS also displayed a PCE of 7.01%, as shown in Fig. S4 and Table S2, which revealed that the PMA layer functioned well in both structures. Meanwhile, the AFM images of the ITO surface with and without a PMA film are displayed in Fig. S5. It was obvious that a continuous PMA film was formed on top of ITO, as shown in the phase images. Furthermore, the SEM images of the PMA film on ITO and the corresponding element mapping images measured by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy are shown in Fig. S6. By comparing the coverage ratio of the elements indium, phosphorus and molybdenum, we further confirm that PMA can serve as a continuous and fully functional hole extraction layer in the normal-structured device.
Transient photovoltaic (TPV) measurements were carried out to further understand the improvements of Jsc and FF with PMA as a hole extraction layer in inverted devices according to previous reports. The typical photovoltage and photocurrent transient curves are plotted in Fig. S7. The capacitance (C) at each Voc was calculated using the following equations:
(1)
(2)
where
I is the value of the transient photocurrent, ΔQ is the value of charge injected by the pulse and ΔV0 is the peak value of the transient voltage (10 mV). The capacitance results are shown in Fig. 7. Finally, the carrier concentration (N) was calculated by integrating the capacitance with respect to voltage:

(3)
where
A is the device area, e is electronic charge, and d is the device thickness.

It was found that at Voc no external current could flow through the external circuit so the charge carriers generated corresponded to the stored charge in the bulk of the junction, which was also proportional to the trap state density. As shown in Fig. 7, the PMA-based device always displayed lower carrier concentrations than that of the e-MoO3-based one, which indicated enhanced charge extraction. This result was in agreement with the improved Jsc and FF of the PMA device. The improved charge extraction capability of PMA was assigned to its unique metal–oxygen cluster anion. All the molybdenum oxyanions are non-covalently bonded with phosphate cations. There is no dangling bond for the oxide, where molybdenum is in a +6 chemical state, exhibiting intrinsically inert properties and therefore less charge trap states. In order to further verify this, the XPS spectra of the Mo 3d orbital in e-MoO3 and PMA films are displayed in Fig. 8. Only one valence state of molybdenum in the PMA film was extracted from the XPS spectrum, which was fitted by two 3d doublets in the form of a Gaussian function. The binding energy peaks at 232.8 eV and 236.0 eV are typical values of the 3d orbital doublet of Mo6+. However, two different valence states of molybdenum in the e-MoO3 film were observed. The major contributing peak corresponded to Mo6+, while the minor ones centered at 231.7 eV and 234.7 eV were assigned to the 3d orbital doublet of Mo5+, which indicated that dangling bond sites existed in e-MoO3 where charges could be trapped.
As we know, unlike inorganic semiconductors, most organic ones are intrinsically more sensitive to chemical degradation, especially in the presence of oxygen and water; therefore, the stability issue is also an important aspect for organic solar cells. The stability of inverted devices based on PMA or e-MoO3 was measured upon storage in air without encapsulation. As shown in Fig. 9, after being stored in air for 30 days, the PCE of the e-MoO3 device degraded by ∼26%, while the PMA device only degraded by ∼7%, which indicated that PMA could serve as a superior buffer layer to prevent undesired physical and chemical reactions between the electrodes and the active layer.

In conclusion, we demonstrated efficient and stable inverted organic solar cells based on the PTB7:PC71BM active layer by inserting solution processed PMA as a hole extraction layer. PMA is a low cost and commercially available chemical, which simplifies the device fabrication process. The PMA layer showed suitable hole extraction properties by analyzing the electrical output characteristics in combination with the measurement of the surface potential difference between PMA and the donor polymer. Compared with e-MoO3, the improved optical properties of PMA and depressed charge recombination within the device resulted in a higher Jsc and FF, thus leading to better performance. Also, the PMA device displayed significant long term stability in ambient conditions. All these results indicated that this kind of hole extraction layer provides an important opportunity for achieving low cost, efficient and stable polymer photovoltaics.
