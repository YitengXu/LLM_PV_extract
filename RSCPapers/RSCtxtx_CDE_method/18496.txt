Carboxylated oligothiophenes were evaluated as interfacial modifiers between the organic poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and inorganic TiO2 layers in bilayer hybrid polymer solar cells. Carboxylated oligothiophenes can be isolated using conventional purification techniques resulting in pure, monodisperse molecules with 100% carboxylation. Device prototypes using carboxylated oligothiophenes as interfacial modifiers showed improved performance in the open-circuit voltage and fill factor over devices using unmodified oligothiophenes as interfacial modifiers. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies supported the idea that interface layer adhesion was improved by functionalizing oligothiophenes with a carboxyl moiety. Wide-field fluorescence images revealed that devices made using carboxylated oligothiophenes had fewer aggregates in the P3HT layers atop the modified TiO2 surface. Hysteresis seen in the fluorescence intensity as a function of applied bias, obtained from In-Device Fluorescence Voltage Spectroscopy (ID-FVS), was found to be a diagnostic criterion of the quality of the hybrid interface modification. The best interfaces were found using oligothiophenes functionalized with carboxylates, which created smooth layers on TiO2, and showed no hysteresis, suggesting elimination of interfacial charge traps. However, this hysteresis could be re-introduced by increasing the scan rate of the applied bias, suggesting that smooth P3HT layers created by carboxylated oligothiophene interface modifiers were necessary but not sufficient for sustaining improved photovoltaic properties especially during long-term device operation.

Recent ground-breaking enhancements in the efficiencies of organic/polymer solar cells can be attributed to the engineering of interfaces formed between the diverse materials that constitute these devices. For instance, the inclusion of side-chain functionalized polymers has been shown to favorably modify the donor–acceptor interfaces of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and phenyl–C61–butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). Dye molecules, functionalized oligomers, and other designer molecules have also been successfully employed for optimizing the complex donor–acceptor interfaces both in BHJ and bilayer devices. Additionally, inorganic material (e.g., perovskite, metal sulfide) based absorber/modifier layers have been deployed in hybrid solar cells to reduce the incompatibility between the hydrophilic inorganic acceptor layers (e.g., TiO2, ZnO) and the hydrophobic polymer layers (e.g., P3HT, poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] or MEH-PPV), and to enhance interfacial charge transfer properties at the heterojunction. However, the exact role of such interface engineering in altering the pathways of charges inside a device is difficult to evaluate. For example, energetic charge traps present in various layers (e.g., polymer, oxide) and at their hybrid organic–inorganic interface can lead to enhanced charge carrier recombination rates, and can, therefore, influence device performance.

We previously reported the first use of a bias-dependent fluorescence modulation technique, namely In-Device Fluorescence Voltage Spectroscopy (ID-FVS), to directly probe the hybrid organic–inorganic interface between pristine and carboxylated P3HT and a TiO2 acceptor layer. Since excess charges are efficient quenchers of fluorescence, this technique can use the fluorescence intensity modulations in conjugated polymers to probe charge injections/ejections, which can reveal details related to charge trapping processes in conjugated polymers. Large hysteresis was observed in the fluorescence intensity as a function of voltage bias in the case of P3HT compared to carboxylated P3HT (P3HT-COOH) suggesting the presence of charge traps in the former. Accordingly, prototype devices containing P3HT-COOH showed an improved open circuit voltage and fill factor compared to P3HT. A challenge with this work, however, was that due to synthetic limitations the carboxylated polymeric materials were not completely functionalized leading to a mixture of both P3HT and P3HT-COOH in the organic/polymer layer.
Here, we overcome this limitation of partially carboxylated P3HT-COOH by synthesizing well-defined oligothiophenes and using them as the interfacial modifier between P3HT and TiO2. The oligothiophenes offer the advantage that they are discrete, monodisperse molecules and are, therefore, a more well-defined system than the corresponding polymer, which inherently exists as a distribution of molecular weights. Second, pure carboxylated oligothiophene can be isolated from any unfunctionalized oligomers via column chromatography and recrystallization. Devices using these carboxylated oligothiophene layers between P3HT and TiO2 demonstrated improved open circuit voltage and fill factors compared to unmodified P3HT–TiO2 heterojunctions. As in the case of P3HT-COOH, we find by ID-FVS that the hysteresis seen in unmodified or pristine P3HT–TiO2 devices is eliminated by functionalizing the TiO2 surface with carboxylated oligothiophenes prior to spin coating the P3HT layer, suggesting that the COOH moieties reduce the distribution of charge traps at the interface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies supported the idea that interface layer adhesion was improved by functionalizing oligothiophenes with a carboxyl moiety. Wide-field fluorescence images also demonstrated that devices made with carboxylated oligothiophenes had smoother P3HT layers atop the modified TiO2 surface compared to unmodified oligothiophenes. We find that the hysteresis seen in ID-FVS spectra varies with the quality of the interface, suggesting that interfacial modification techniques can be utilized to alter the pathways of charges and provide new avenues to enhance device properties. ID-FVS can thus complement standard photovoltaic device characterizations to probe the behavior of charges at interfaces between diverse materials.

A homopolymer of regioregular P3HT was synthesized following a modified literature procedure. Analysis by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) revealed the following characteristics: Mn = 12.6 kDa; Mw/Mn = 1.3.


3,3′′′-Dihexyl-2,2′:5′,2′′:5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophene (oligothiophene) and 3,3′′′-dihexyl-2,2′:5′,2′′:5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophene-5-carboxylic acid (carboxylated oligothiophene) were synthesized as previously reported. Spectroscopic data of the oligomers were in agreement with literature values.


Tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) [Ti(OC4H9)4] and 2,4-pentanedione used to synthesize the TiO2 sol–gel were purchased from Alfa Aesar and used without further purification. As reported previously, 10 mL of TBT was first dissolved in 100 mL of anhydrous ethanol by continuous stirring, followed by 10 mL of glacial acetic acid (CH3COOH) to stabilize the gel, 10 mL of 2,4-pentanedione for promoting uniform particle size distribution, and 10 mL of deionized water to hydrolyze the gel. The mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature for at least 30 min before adding each solvent. The resulting liquid was pale yellow in color and was stored in the dark for a week prior to use.


Indium-doped tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates (sheet resistance = 10 Ω □−1) were purchased from Nanocs (New York, NY). High purity (99.999%) gold (Au) wires and tungsten wire baskets for thermal evaporation were purchased from Alfa Aesar and SPI supplies, respectively.

ITO-coated glass substrates were cut into 1 inch × 1 inch square pieces, patterned by slow etching in a mixture of 7.5 mL of deionized water, 0.5 mL of HNO3, and 2 mL of HCl, at 60 °C. The substrates were subsequently rinsed and cleaned by successive sonication in aqueous detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, and finally dried in flowing nitrogen. The TiO2 sol–gel was spincoated onto these cleaned substrates at 3000 rpm with a Chemat KW4A spincoater, sintered in an air furnace at 450 °C for 120 min, and cooled slowly to room temperature. The sintered electron-transporting thin film of anatase TiO2 was transparent with a thickness of ∼100 nm, as determined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM).
12.8 mg of oligothiophene was dissolved in 20 mL of chlorobenzene to form a clear solution at room temperature. The solution was spincoated onto the TiO2-coated substrates at a speed of 1500 rpm, and then annealed at 135 °C for 20 min and cooled slowly overnight. The oligothiophene layers were ∼50–65 nm thick, as per atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. 6 mg of the polymer (P3HT) was dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene by continuous stirring at 50 °C and the solution was filtered through a 0.20 μm pore size PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) membrane syringe filter (Pall Life sciences). The P3HT solution was spincoated onto the oligothiophene-coated substrates at 1500 rpm to form the hole transport layer. The P3HT layer was ∼50 nm thick, as confirmed using a Dektak 3 surface profilometer and AFM. The final polymer–oligothiophene–TiO2 thin film composites were created by heating the substrates at a temperature of 185 °C for 8 min and cooling slowly overnight. The hybrid solar cell devices were completed by thermally evaporating ∼150 nm thick Au electrodes (deposition rate = 1–2 Å s−1) at vacuum levels better than 10–7 Torr inside a JEOL thermal evaporator. The final active area of the hybrid solar cells was 3 mm × 3 mm, as defined by a metal shadow mask. Prior to testing, the devices were annealed at 135 °C for 60 min and allowed to equilibrate in the dark for several hours.

Photovoltaic parameters (open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) were measured for a total of 20 cells for each type of device. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured inside an argon-filled glovebox without using a UV blocking filter. An Oriel 91160 300 W solar simulator was used as the excitation source (100 mW cm−2 white light illumination under AM 1.5G conditions).

ID-FVS measurements were performed on a home-built apparatus based on an inverted microscope (Zeiss, Axiovert 200) with a 5× objective lens (NA 0.12). The excitation source was the 488 nm line of an Ar–Kr ion laser (Melles Griot, model 35 LAL-030-208). The excitation beam was focused onto the device and the emission was detected by an avalanche photodiode (APD) (Perkin-Elmer Optoelectronics SPCM-AQR-15). A master function generator was used to synchronize both a function generator (Wavetek, model 29) and a multichannel scalar board (MCS, Becker Hickle PMS-400). For typical experiments, the applied bias to the device was programmed to be a triangular waveform of 0–1–0–(−1)–0 V as each cycle was set to be of 1 s duration (4 V s−1). Acquisition time per point was 10 ms and 4000 points were recorded for each measurement. In these experiments, the excitation intensity was minimized (∼800 mW cm−2) to mimic the power range of a solar simulator and the voltage bias rate was adjusted to match the solar cell testing conditions. Fluorescence modulation results were acquired for 40 cycles and they were synchronously averaged to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. When the applied bias varied, the peak voltage changed to ±0.5, 2, or 4 V. To determine whether changes arose from the scan rate or the expanded bias window, the scan rate was maintained at 4 V s−1 for one set, giving cycle times of 0.5, 2, and 4 s, respectively, and varied with another set, giving scan rates of 2, 8, and 16 V s−1, respectively, for 1 s cycle times. The acquisition time per point was kept at 10 ms and 4000 points were still recorded for each measurement, so the number of cycles synchronously averaged varied with the applied bias. At 0.5 V, 80 cycles were averaged; at 1 V, 40 cycles; at 2 V, 20 cycles; and at 4 V, 10 cycles were averaged.

The structures of the oligothiophene and monocarboxylated oligothiophene used in this work are shown in Fig. 1. Oligomers with alkyl groups on the terminal thiophene units were chosen to ensure adequate solubility in organic solvents as well as to maximize its compatibility with the P3HT overlayer. The oligothiophene was synthesized according to the procedure reported by Kanato et al. Briefly, 5,5′-dibromo-2,2′-bithiophene was reacted with 2-bromomagnesio-3-hexylthiophene via a Ni-catalyzed Kumada coupling. Monocarboxylation of the oligothiophene was achieved by treating the oligomer with n-butyllithium and quenching the resulting lithiated material with CO2. It should be noted that any unreacted or dicarboxylated species formed during the carboxylation step could be separated from the desired monocarboxylated oligomer by column chromatography. This is an important distinction from our previous work, wherein the monocarboxylated polymer (P3HT-COOH) could not be separated from the uncarboxylated homopolymer. A final recrystallization step afforded pure monocarboxylated oligothiophene, as verified by 1H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.


We employed a bilayer device structure (Fig. 2) to examine how incorporating the oligothiophenes affected the photovoltaic properties of P3HT–TiO2 hybrid solar cells. Such an architecture employing thin films (∼50 nm) of the oligothiophene and P3HT enabled us to focus on the properties of the interface formed between these layers, without getting influenced by phenomena in the “bulk” of the films, located away from the interface under investigation. The sol–gel derived TiO2 layer was deposited by spincoating and was a ∼100 nm dense layer that served as the primary electron transport layer. A 50–65 nm layer of oligothiophene at the interface between P3HT and TiO2 was prepared via spincoating as such a design was envisioned to enable others to use a similar structure to study any number and combination of modifiers at such interfaces. The modifiers can be incorporated by solution based processes, as is demonstrated here, or alternatively by vacuum based techniques. The polymer P3HT (with a number-average molecular weight Mn ∼ 13 kDa) overlayer served as the primary hole transporter and was deposited by spincoating to form a ∼50 nm thick film.

Depositing uniform layers of the oligothiophenes from solution is a process that is sensitive to processing conditions. We obtained the most repeatable results when the films were spincoated from chlorobenzene. These samples were utilized for the optimized device characterization. Other films were deposited with dimethylformamide (DMF) or by other solution-based processes, such as drop casting or soaking the substrate in a bath of the oligothiophene solution. All of these alternate approaches resulted in poor quality and/or non-uniform films. Such unoptimized films further resulted in poor device performance and hysteresis in ID-FVS.

Table 1 summarizes the three main types of optimized devices fabricated and analyzed in this work. The baseline standard was the P3HT–TiO2 hybrid solar cell, which features an unmodified bilayer hybrid organic–inorganic interface. The rough TiO2 surface (Ra ∼ 2.5 nm) typically results in devices with extremely low fill factors (∼27%), owing to multiple shunting paths created during the process of spincoating of the thin (∼50 nm) P3HT layer. However, as seen in Fig. 3, all three photovoltaic properties, open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) improved upon incorporating the oligothiophene interlayers. The devices incorporating carboxylated oligothiophenes showed significant improvements in Voc and FF, an increase by five times and three times, respectively, compared to the baseline P3HT–TiO2 devices. The improvement seen in the fill factor is particularly important as this suggested that incorporating the carboxylated oligothiophenes at the P3HT–TiO2 interface improved the interaction between P3HT and TiO2. Overall, these carboxylated oligothiophene-based devices showed an order of magnitude increase in power conversion efficiency compared to the baseline P3HT–TiO2 devices.

Since the P3HT overlayer and the oligothiophene are deposited from the same solvent (chlorobenzene), we questioned whether the two materials formed discrete layers within the device, or an interfacial “blend” was formed after deposition of the materials. To test, we fabricated devices incorporating premixed blends of P3HT and a carboxylated oligothiophene. As seen in Table S1 (ESI), these devices behaved poorly compared to the bilayer devices in Fig. 3, thereby suggesting to us that the formation of such a blend was not the origin of the observed photovoltaic improvements.

To further understand the effect of the oligothiophene interlayers on the hybrid device performance, we applied ID-FVS to these devices. Fig. 4a and b depict the effect of a triangular bias sweep on the fluorescence intensity observed from the P3HT layer in a bilayer TiO2–P3HT device. The fluorescence intensity reduced (quenching) during the application of a positive bias voltage and recovered during negative bias. This unique polarity of the bias phenomena can be attributed to backward electron transfer process from the TiO2 into the P3HT layer, as previously reported. While the fluorescence quenching polarities remained the same upon introducing the oligothiophene layer at the P3HT–TiO2 interface, the extent of quenching or quenching depths varied, as tabulated in Table 2. The primary difference, however, was seen in the amount of hysteresis in the fluorescence intensity versus bias plots shown in Fig. 4c. A large hysteresis was clearly visible in the case of bare P3HT–TiO2 devices, which reduced slightly when an unmodified oligothiophene layer was introduced at the P3HT–TiO2 interface. The biggest change was observed upon introducing carboxylated oligothiophenes at the P3HT–TiO2 interface, as in this case the hysteresis was almost completely eliminated. This confirms our previously reported results with carboxylated polythiophenes (P3HT-COOH), where we also observed that the hysteresis disappeared. Wide-field fluorescence images (Fig. 5) comparing the morphology of P3HT spun on top of TiO2 layers modified with unmodified and carboxylated oligothiophenes indicated that the latter had a smoother, less aggregated P3HT layer.

Calculating the enclosed absolute area between the forward and reverse curves of the fluorescence intensity versus bias plots and plotting these values against photovoltaic parameters like Voc and FF reveal an interesting correlation. We find that the samples modified with the carboxylated oligothiophenes show the smallest enclosed area (i.e. smallest hysteresis) and highest Voc and FF when compared with the bare samples. This relationship between the degree of hysteresis and photovoltaic properties is depicted in Fig. S2 (a and b) in the ESI. Such a correlation can potentially enable ID-FVS to be used as a diagnostic tool to study charge injection, transport, or trapping at interfaces within polymer solar cells.
It must be noted that if we are indeed modifying the samples under the applied bias, then this effect could show up as changes in the P3HT emission spectrum. However, it would be surprising if any chemistry in these systems is in fact reversible. The fact that the fluorescence reappears when we cycle the bias argues against there being any such redox chemistry. While it is possible that there exists some aggregation, we do not have any indication of this. In order to support this hypothesis, we show that the emission spectra of the P3HT polymer with and without bias are identical (Fig. S3, ESI).

There can be several possibilities that explain the improved photovoltaic behavior demonstrated by bilayer devices incorporating carboxylated oligothiophenes at the hybrid interface. The presence of COOH moieties in carboxylated oligothiophenes may assist in the formation of a smooth, uniform, modifying layer on the TiO2 surface; likewise, the absence of such an interaction in the uncarboxylated oligothiophenes may explain their non-uniform layers. In our previous work, we found that spincoating thin (∼50 nm) P3HT layers directly over the rough TiO2 surface led to the formation of aggregates, which resulted in shunting paths (i.e., low fill factor), and in some cases, device shorting. Hence fabricating TiO2–P3HT devices with solution-deposited 50 nm P3HT layers was not trivial and the use of carboxylated P3HT (P3HT-COOH) helped reduce the formation of such aggregates, resulting in devices that displayed improved performances. Nevertheless, the presence of these aggregates resulted in non-uniform polymer layer thicknesses, which made it difficult to conduct systematic studies with the P3HT and P3HT-COOH based systems. Here, we find that when the P3HT layers were spincoated onto the smooth carboxylated oligothiophene modified TiO2 surfaces, aggregates were not formed in the P3HT film (Fig. 5), thereby reducing shunting paths within the device.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was used to indirectly probe for chemical signatures of such possible interactions between COOH functional groups and the TiO2 surface. These interactions could be physical (i.e., physisorption) and/or chemical (i.e., chemisorption). A straightforward way to test for physisorption is to check if the carboxylated oligothiophene layers can be washed away through rinsing with a good solvent (e.g., chlorobenzene). As seen in Fig. 6, the carboxylated oligothiophene layers remained intact even after three rinsing steps, as indicated by the S 2p signal from the thiophene rings, while the unmodified oligothiophene layers were easily washed away. This result clearly demonstrates that there exists an interaction between the COOH groups and TiO2 surface that causes the carboxylated oligothiophene layers to uniformly absorb onto the TiO2 surface, unlike the unmodified oligothiophene.
In addition to improved coating of the inorganic TiO2 surface, the surface passivation of charge traps by the COOH groups could also explain the improved photovoltaic behavior (see Fig. 3). Passivation could result from a chemical bonding of the COOH groups and TiO2, However, XPS analysis of the Ti 2p and O 1s spectra of the oligothiophene coated TiO2 samples did not reveal new peaks or shifts in the position of the existing peaks that would reflect such a chemical interaction (Fig. S4, ESI). A model that examines the surface concentration of oxygen atoms that could interact with the COOH groups was developed (Fig. S5–S7, ESI). The model revealed that only about 0.2–2% of the surface oxygen atoms probed by the XPS were available to interact with the COOH groups. Such a small interaction would be challenging to probe with XPS. Fig. S8 (ESI) further indicates that coating with the oligothiophene layer did not modify the appearance and absorption spectra of the TiO2 layer. Therefore, coating with oligothiophenes does not modify properties like the band gap of the TiO2 layer.
Device fabrication steps can in turn benefit from the improvements in the adhesion between the P3HT and TiO2 layers resulting from modifying the TiO2 layer with the carboxylated oligothiophenes. The higher fill factor seen in Table 1 could result from this improved interface. The local electric field introduced by the ordering of –COOH molecular dipoles at the interface in the case of carboxylated modifiers could influence both the behavior of charges at the interface and even assist in de-trapping of charges resulting in improvements in photovoltaic parameters such as Voc.

ID-FVS can be used to provide further insight into changes in the interfacial layer. The main parameter that ID-FVS probes, namely hysteresis in fluorescence response to an applied bias, can change as the devices are utilized. Fig. 7c shows the ID-FVS curve for a carboxylated oligothiophene based device as a function of total applied voltage (Fig. 7a). Fig. 7d shows the results for varying bias rates (Fig. 7b). The hysteresis, which is typically absent in carboxylated oligothiophene devices, can gradually return as either the magnitude of the bias voltage or the scan rate of the applied bias is increased. The results obtained from changing the applied bias voltage window at a constant scan rate (Fig. 7c) suggest that this return of the hysteresis was primarily controlled by the rate of the bias changes and not by the magnitude of the bias voltage.

Since increasing the scan rate of the applied bias was observed to slowly re-introduce the hysteresis, the phenomenon can provide interesting insights into the mechanism of the bias-dependent fluorescence modulation process. As the rate of change of the applied bias increased, the rate of the backward electron transfer process also apparently increased. The data suggests that at these energies, kinetic processes dominate thermodynamic ones. The difference between the forward and reverse waves of the fluorescence intensity vs. bias plots increased at increased scan rates but not at increased applied bias voltages. This hysteresis re-introduction demonstrated that smooth P3HT layers created by carboxylated oligothiophene interface modifiers were necessary but not sufficient for sustaining improved photovoltaic properties, especially during continued device operation. Further studies are ongoing to fully understand these effects, which could have implications for understanding long-term stability of organic photovoltaic devices.

Bilayer TiO2–P3HT prototype devices were used to evaluate the role of oligothiophenes as interface modifiers. Devices with carboxylated oligothiophene modifying layers show improved photovoltaic properties and bias dependent fluorescence modulation tests show absence of hysteresis in these devices, suggesting the reduction of traps. XPS also shows improved surface coverage of the TiO2 layer by the carboxylated oligothiophenes. However, hysteresis can be reintroduced by varying the bias suggesting that even with a good interface the phenomenon of interfacial trapping is not solved. From an application perspective, these results provide insight into the use of modifiers to enhance interfacial interactions between the diverse materials employed in organic solar cells. Collectively, these results are expected to lead to the rational design of novel organic photovoltaic devices with long-term stability.
