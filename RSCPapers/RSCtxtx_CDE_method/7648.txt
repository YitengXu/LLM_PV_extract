A series of p-type copolymers based on oligothiophene and benzothiadiazole units was synthesised via Stille coupling and their physical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties were evaluated. The polymers varied in the number and type of oligothiophene units as well as in the position of the solubilizing alkyl chains relative to the benzothiadiazole unit. These differences in the polymer structure had a significant impact on the thin-film transistor mobility and the solar cell power conversion efficiency, thus illustrating the importance of these design factors for polymers in optoelectronic applications.

Organic bulk heterojunction solar cells, which utilize interpenetrating networks of a polymeric donor and a soluble fullerene-based acceptor, have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their potential for extremely low cost fabrication. A major hurdle to the large-scale commercialization of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is the relatively low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of current material systems. One of the strategies for improving the PCE of OPVs is to design donor polymers with small band-gaps to improve light absorption, high hole carrier mobilities for efficient charge extraction, optimally positioned frontier orbitals to ensure efficient exciton dissociation while minimising energy losses in the charge transfer step, and good solubility for easy processing. It has been predicted that PCEs of above 10% are possible if a donor material with appropriate electronic properties can be found.

The use of alternating donor (D) and acceptor (A) units on a polymer chain is a widely used design concept for small band-gap polymers. In recent years, D–A type polymers have been successfully applied in the field of OPVs, achieving PCEs of up to 8%. Due to the large number of possible combinations of the D and A building blocks, judicious selection of these units is necessary to achieve polymers with suitable properties for OPV applications.
The thiophene building block has been used successfully to create polymers for organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) applications. Oligothiophene-based polymers such as poly(3,3′′′-dialkyl-quaterthiophene) (PQT) and poly(2,5-bis(3-alkylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) (PBTTT) have delivered excellent hole transport mobilities of between 0.2 and 0.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 when used in OTFT applications. However, these polymers have not performed well when used as donor polymers in organic solar cells, due largely to the limited absorption spectra of these polymers as well as their tendency to aggregate and form large domains when blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester. The incorporation of acceptor moieties such as 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole into the polythiophene backbone has resulted in polymers with lower band-gap and improved absorption covering the entire visible spectrum. However, solar cells associated with these polymers are yet to deliver high power conversion efficiencies, with the highest reported efficiency being 2.23%. Further fine-tuning of the polymer structure is thus needed for this class of polymers.
Apart from choosing the appropriate type of donor and acceptor moieties in the polymer structure, the positioning and type of solubilizing alkyl groups is also an important design consideration as they can affect not just the solubility but also the optical and electronic properties of the polymer. In our previous communication, we reported our work on an oligothiophene–benzothiadiazole polymer POD2T-DTBT. By incorporating long, branched alkyl chains into the structure, a polymer with high molecular weight and good processability was achieved. OPV cells fabricated using POD2T-DTBT:PC71BM blends gave PCEs of up to 6.2% for spin-coated films and 6.7% for blade-coated films, thus demonstrating the potential of this family of polymers in high efficiency OPVs. In this work, we explore the structure–property relationships of a number of benzothiadiazole–oligothiophene polymers which differ from each other by the position of the alkyl substituents and the number and type of oligothiophene units in the backbone. We demonstrate that these factors affect the charge transport properties and solar cell performance significantly and are therefore critical in the design of high performance polymers in this family.

The structures of the polymers described in this work are shown in Fig. 1.

5,5′-Bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene and 2,6-bis-trimethylstannanyl-dithieno[3,2-b;2′,3′-d]thiophene were synthesised using literature methods. The syntheses of 4,7-bis(2-trimethylstannylthien-5-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, 5,5′-dibromo-4,4′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-2,2′-bithiophene and POD2T-DTBT have previously been reported. The synthetic procedures for the other monomers are shown in Scheme 1.
3-(2-Octyldodecyl)thiophene 1 was synthesised using a Grignard coupling procedure. Lithiation with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and quenching with 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane gave the corresponding 4-(2-octyldodecyl)-2-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolanyl)-thiophene 2. This was then reacted with 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole via microwave-assisted Suzuki coupling followed by bromination with N-bromosuccinimide to give monomer 4 in a good yield.
Monomer 6 was synthesised by the Stille coupling of 5,5′-dibromo-4,4′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-2,2′-bithiophene with 2-tributylstannylthiophene to give the quaterthiophene 5, followed by bromination with NBS.
The synthetic routes for the polymers are shown in Scheme 2. These polymers were synthesised using the same Stille copolymerisation procedure which was previously reported for the preparation of POD2T-DTBT. These polymers were obtained in good yields of between 72 and 84%, with high number-averaged molecular weights (Mn) of between 17 and 56 kg mol−1 (Table 1).

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were performed on the four polymers. The polymers exhibited excellent thermal stability, with all the polymers having 5% weight loss temperatures (Td) of above 300 °C (Table 1). POD2T-DTBT and P2T-ODTBT had the best thermal stability, with their 5% weight loss temperatures being over 400 °C.

The DSC scans of the polymers are shown in Fig. 2. Glass transition temperatures were not detected for all of the polymers. Each polymer exhibited an endothermic peak upon heating and an exothermic peak upon cooling, which can be attributed to the melting and crystallisation of the polymer backbone respectively. POD2T-DTBT and POD4T-DTBT, which differ in their structures by two thiophene rings, had similar transition temperatures. POD2T-DTBT had a higher melting transition than P2T-ODDTBT, which could be due to its higher molecular weight and better packing of polymer chains. PDTT-ODDTBT had the highest melting point of 279 °C.
Unlike their parent polymer PQT,P2T-ODDTBT and POD2T-DTBT did not exhibit any liquid crystalline behaviour. This could be because the branched alkyl chains used in these polymers do not facilitate the side-chain interdigitation which is seen in PQT and hence do not self-organise as readily as PQT.

UV-Visible spectra of the polymers were recorded in 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution and in thin films that were drop cast from 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. POD2T-DTBT and POD4T-DTBT exhibited strong aggregation peaks in solution at around 700–710 nm (see ESI), which disappeared upon heating. The absorption peaks of these two polymers shifted to around 560–575 nm upon heating (Table 2). For all the polymers, the peaks of the thin film spectra were red-shifted by over 50 nm and showed significant broadening compared to the solution spectra, indicating strong inter-chain interactions in the solid state. POD2T-DTBT exhibited a stronger red-shift compared with the other polymers, suggesting that the solid state ordering in this polymer is relatively strong. The absorption of all the polymers extended to 750 nm or more, allowing them to absorb light across the entire visible spectrum.

From the absorption onsets of the polymer thin films, their optical band-gaps were calculated. POD2T-DTBT had the lowest optical band-gap of 1.59 eV; the other polymers had slightly higher band-gaps of between 1.63 and 1.66 eV.

Cyclic voltammetry was performed on thin films of the polymers and the results are shown in Fig. 4. Clear oxidation peaks were observed for all of the materials and the HOMO levels of the polymers were determined from the onsets of these peaks (see Experimental section). The calculated values of the HOMO levels were between −5.11 eV and −5.27 eV. Under the same conditions, the HOMO level of P3HT was determined to be −5.00 eV. The new polymers thus have lower lying HOMOs than P3HT, implying improved air stability and potentially higher open-circuit voltage in solar cell applications. Interestingly, the HOMO levels of POD2T-DTBT and P2T-ODDTBT differed by almost 0.1 eV despite their structures differing only in the position of the alkyl chains. Density functional theory calculations (see Section 3.4) were made on these two structures to investigate the reasons for this difference.

The LUMO levels of the polymers were determined from the HOMO levels and the optical band-gap, and ranged from −3.45 eV to −3.64 eV. The offset between the LUMO levels of the polymers and PCBM (ca. 0.36 to 0.55 eV) are greater than the 0.3 eV regarded as necessary to provide a driving force for charge separation. The energy levels of the polymers are summarised in Table 2.

It has previously been shown that the positioning of the alkyl chains within the repeat unit of a thiophene-based polymer can affect the dihedral angles between the aromatic rings significantly. The structures of two repeat units for POD2T-DTBT and P2T-ODDTBT (Fig. 5) were optimized using density functional theory (DFT) software DMol, at the level of theory GGA-PW91-DSPP/DNP (cutoff 4.0 Å). All the side chains were represented as –CH2CH(CH3)2 to reduce the time needed for the calculations. Dihedral angles and HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated at the optimized geometry of the ground state. The dihedral angles were taken from the central portion of the structure to reduce end effects. The isosurfaces of the HOMO and LUMO (Fig. S2 and S3 in the ESI) were plotted with isovalues ±0.03 (‘+’ green and ‘−’ orange).

The results of our calculations show that placing the alkyl units at the B position instead of the A position significantly increased the dihedral angle R2 (Table 3), while having little effect on R1. This increased steric twisting, which is possibly due to the proximity of the thiadiazole rings and the alkyl chains in the B position (Fig. S2 and S3), led to reduced π-orbital overlapping between the thiophene and benzothiazole rings and therefore lowered the HOMO level and increased the band gap. This is consistent with our observations from cyclic voltammetry and UV-Vis measurements. The positioning of the alkyl chains on the polymer backbone relative to the benzothiadiazole units can thus be a powerful tool for controlling the electronic properties of the polymer.

To investigate the charge transport properties of the polymers, bottom-gate, top-contact TFT devices were fabricated. Each device consisted of a polymer semiconductor layer that was spin-coated onto a heavily n-doped silicon wafer substrate with 220 nm of surface oxide as the gate dielectric. Gold was evaporated through a shadow mask to form the top electrode. TFTs with 8 different channel dimensions were fabricated on each substrate (channel widths of 4000 μm and 1000 μm, and channel lengths of 50 μm, 100 μm, 150 μm and 200 μm for each channel width). The results of the characterisation are shown in Table 4.

The POD2T-DTBT TFT devices which were annealed at 200 °C exhibited high hole mobilities of up to 0.25 cm2 V−1 s−1 as well as excellent on/off ratios of around 106. By comparison, the unannealed devices exhibited lower hole mobilities of 0.10 to 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1.
X-ray diffraction studies of films of POD2T-DTBT indicated that the polymer exhibited some degree of ordering even without annealing (Fig. 6). Annealing at 200 °C greatly increased the ordering, as seen by the six-fold increase in the intensity of the peak at 2θ = 4.5°, which corresponds to an inter-chain d-spacing of 19.5 Å. A second-order peak at 9.0° also appeared upon annealing. Clearly, this increased ordering is reflected in the improved TFT mobility of annealed devices.
Annealed PDTT-ODDTBT TFT devices also exhibited good hole mobilities of around 0.17 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off ratio on the order of 106, however the TFT hole mobilities and on/off ratios of P2T-ODDTBT and POD4T-DTBT were substantially lower than the other two polymers, which could be due to their lower crystallinity as shown by the lack of higher-order peaks in the XRD scattering patterns.

To evaluate the performance of the polymers as donor materials, solar cells with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Al were fabricated. A detailed description of the fabrication and testing procedures can be found in the Experimental section. Variables such as the weight ratio of polymer to PC71BM and the spin-rate of the spin-coating process were investigated and a 1:1 weight ratio of polymer to PC71BM was generally found to give the best results. The device results for 1:1 weight blends of the polymers and PC71BM are shown in Table 5 and the typical current density–voltage and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are shown in Fig. 7.

Cells prepared using POD2T-DTBT gave the best performances with an average PCE of 6.12%, a high average short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.43 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.720 V and a fill factor (FF) of 68.4%. The Jsc values of these cells were much higher than those of the other polymers, and were a key factor behind the excellent performance of the cells. The high Jsc was likely due to the wider absorbance spectrum of the polymer compared with the other polymers which allowed comparatively more photons to be absorbed, as well as its high charge carrier mobility, which contributed to efficient charge collection. Indeed, a typical EQE spectrum for POD2T-DTBT:PC71BM cells (Fig. 7b) shows photocurrent generation up to longer wavelengths than cells based on the other polymers, as well as a higher EQE across the entire spectral range.
Besides the absorption spectra and carrier mobilities of the polymers, device performance is also highly dependent on the morphology of the blend film. The atomic force microscope height images (Fig. 8) of the polymer:PC71BM films showed a clear difference in morphology. POD2T-DTBT:PC71BM films contained many long fibres which are believed to correspond to the polymer phase. In contrast, the domains in the other films were large and granular, and appeared to be uneven. The nanofibrous network in the POD2T-DTBT:PC71BM films likely facilitated efficient charge transport and provided a large donor–acceptor interfacial area for exciton dissociation, contributing to higher FF and Jsc, respectively, and thus an improved PCE compared to cells based on the other polymers. A combination of good absorbance, favourable morphology and good charge carrier mobility thus contribute to the good solar cell performance of this system.

P2T-ODDTBT cells had a Voc of 0.760 V, which was 0.040 V higher than POD2T-DTBT. This could be due in part to the difference in HOMO energy levels of these polymers – P2T-ODDTBT had a HOMO level that was 0.09 eV lower than that of POD2T-DTBT as measured by cyclic voltammetry. The Jsc values of these cells were however much poorer than those of POD2T-DTBT.
During the preparation of this manuscript, we noted that a polymer with the same structure as P2T-ODDTBT was published by another group. Solar cells fabricated from blends of this polymer with PC61BM achieved a Jsc of 5.6 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.74 V, FF of 63% and PCE of about 2.6%. These results are quite consistent with ours, except for the lower Jsc which is likely due to the lower absorbance of the PC61BM compared to PC71BM.
Although the fine morphology of PDTT-ODDTBT:PC71BM appeared favourable for efficient bulk heterojunction solar cells, the device performance was relatively poor, with an average PCE of only 1.59%. This polymer had poor solubility in 1,2-dichlorobenzene due to the presence of rigid bridged dithienothiophene units (PDTT-ODDTBT). High solution temperatures of 80–90 °C coupled with a reduction in the concentration of the polymer to 5 mg mL−1 were therefore necessary to ensure solubility. As a result of the reduction in concentration, the films were much thinner (65 nm) than those of the other polymers (105–110 nm). Attempts to increase the film thickness by increasing the concentration of the polymer in the solution were unsuccessful as they resulted in poor quality films which gave even poorer solar cell performance. The much poorer solar cell performance of PDTT-ODDTBT despite its comparable charge carrier mobility with POD2T-DTBT and fine film morphology illustrates the importance of solubility and processability in solar cell performance.
Due to the high molecular weight of POD4T-DTBT and thus the high viscosity of the POD4T-DTBT:PC71BM blend solutions, the films which were spin-coated at 500 rpm were much thicker (about 240 nm) than films spin-coated from the other polymer blends, which led to a low fill factor of 49.5% and a low PCE of 1.37%. Spinning the films at a higher spin rate resulted in reduced film thicknesses of around 110 nm, hence resulting in an improved fill factor of 59.1% and a better solar cell performance of 3.00%. Compared with the POD2T-DTBT cells, the POD4T-DTBT cells had significantly lower Voc, which could be due partly to the shallower HOMO level of POD4T-DTBT compared to POD2T-DTBT.

A series of low band-gap donor polymers based on oligothiophene and benzothiadiazole has been synthesised and characterised. The combination of the benzothiadiazole moiety and the high mobility oligothiophene unit resulted in reduced band-gaps compared with typical polythiophenes. The use of long, branched alkyl chains ensured that the polymers could be solution-processed.

All the polymers exhibited hole mobilities of at least 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, and up to 0.25 cm2 V−1 s−1 when applied in TFT devices. When applied in organic solar cell devices, average PCEs ranging from 1.59% to 6.12% were obtained. The positioning of the alkyl chains relative to the benzothiadiazole units, the introduction of bridged thiophene rings and the number of thiophene rings in the polymer structure have thus been shown to influence the electronic properties, TFT mobility and solar cell performance of the polymers.

The dibromo and bis-stannylated monomers (1 equivalent each) were added to a reaction vial equipped with a magnetic stirrer. The vial was then transferred to a glovebox where tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (4 mol%), tri(o-tolyl)-phosphine (16 mol%) and anhydrous chlorobenzene (20 mL) were added. The vial was then heated at 120 °C for 72 hours using an oil bath. The reaction mixture was poured into 200 mL of methanol and 10 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid and stirred overnight to remove the stannylated end-groups. The polymer was filtered and subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol (12 h), hexanes (12 h), and chloroform (12 h). Extraction with chlorobenzene (12 h) was also carried out if there was any polymer left in the extraction thimble. The chloroform and chlorobenzene fractions were then concentrated, precipitated into 200 mL of methanol, filtered and dried to obtain the final product.


The title compound (212 mg, 84%) was obtained as a black solid from the chloroform fraction.

Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed using an Autolab potentiostat (model PGSTAT30) from Echochimie. The experiments were performed at room temperature in a glovebox with a conventional three electrode configuration consisting of a glass carbon working electrode, a platinum counter electrode, and a silver wire as a quasi-reference electrode. The electrolyte was 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in acetonitrile. The polymer sample was drop cast onto the working electrode from chlorobenzene. Ferrocene was used as an internal standard for calculating the redox potentials of the samples following each batch of samples, and the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple was assumed to have an absolute value of 4.8 eV below the vacuum level. The onset of the first oxidation peak was used to calculate the value of the HOMO.


Top-contact, bottom-gate OTFT test devices were prepared on a silicon wafer under ambient conditions without taking any special precautions to exclude air, moisture and ambient light. A heavily n-doped silicon wafer 〈100〉 with a 220 nm surface layer of silicon dioxide (SiO2) was used as the substrate/gate electrode, with the top SiO2 layer serving as the gate dielectric (capacitance 15.6 nF cm−2). The SiO2 surface of the Si wafer substrate was cleaned by sonication in acetone, and then immersed in piranha solution (volume ratio of H2SO4 to H2O2 was 2:1) for 8 minutes at room temperature. The cleaned wafer was then immersed in a 0.1 M solution of octyltrichlorosilane (OTS-8) in toluene at 60 °C for 30 min, followed by rinsing with toluene and then drying with N2. The semiconductor layer was deposited on top of the OTS-8-modified SiO2 surface by spin coating a hot solution of polymer in 1,2-dichlorobenzene at 1000 rpm for 60 s and vacuum annealed at 200 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, a series of gold source/drain electrode pairs were deposited by vacuum thermal evaporation through a shadow mask to create a series of OTFTs with various channel length (L) and width (W) dimensions. Silicon oxide at the backside of the silicon wafer of the TFT device was removed with sandpaper to provide a conductive gate contact. The TFT devices were then characterized using a Keithley SCS-4200 probe station under an ambient environment with relative humidity level of 65%. The TFT mobility was extracted using the following equation in the saturation regime from the gate sweep:
ID = μCi(VG − VT)2(W/2L)
where
ID is the drain current, μ is the field-effect mobility, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer (SiO2, 220 nm, Ci = 15.6 nF cm−2), and VG and VT are respectively the gate voltage and threshold voltage. VT was derived from the relationship between the square root of ID at the saturated regime and VG by extrapolating the measured data to ID = 0.


The polymer and PC71BM were dissolved separately in anhydrous 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB). The polymer solution was heated on a magnetic hotplate stirrer at 70 °C for 2 h; while the PCBM solution was stirred at 40 °C for 2 h. The two solutions were then mixed together according to the desired mass ratio and the solution was stirred overnight at 40 °C. The final polymer concentration of the blend was between 5 to 10 mg mL−1, depending on the solubility of the polymer in DCB. Devices were prepared on indium tin oxide (ITO) patterned glass substrates. The ITO patterned glass substrates were first sonicated in a detergent (Hellmanex) bath for 30 min, followed by two rounds of sonication in de-ionized water for 10 min. This was followed by successive sonication in acetone and isopropanol for 15 min and 20 min respectively. The cleaning step was concluded by blow-drying the substrates using a nitrogen-gun. The substrates were then placed in an oven at 80 °C for at least an hour. The substrates were subjected to a UV ozone treatment for 10 min before a PEDOT:PSS (CLEVIOS™ P VP Al 4083) layer of 40–45 nm thickness was spin-coated onto the ITO surface. The PEDOT:PSS-coated substrates were then annealed at 120 °C for 10 min. Next, the active layer was spin-coated at the desired spin rate in an inert glove-box (N2 atmosphere). The wet film was dried slowly in a covered Petri dish. Lastly, 100 nm of aluminum was deposited by thermal evaporation as the cathode followed by post-annealing for 10 min at 100 °C. The active area of the devices were 0.09 cm2. The thicknesses of the films were measured using a surface profiler (KLA-Tencor P10 surface profiler). Current density–voltage (J–V) measurements were carried out in an inert environment (MBraun glovebox, N2 atmosphere) under 1 Sun (AM1.5G) conditions using a solar simulator (SAN-EI Electric XES-301S 300 W Xe Lamp JIS Class AAA) with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The EQE as a function of wavelength was measured with a custom-built setup consisting of an Oriel 300 W Xe lamp in combination with an Oriel Cornerstone 130 monochromator and a SRS 810 lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems). The number of photons incident on the device was calculated for each wavelength by using a calibrated Si diode as reference.
