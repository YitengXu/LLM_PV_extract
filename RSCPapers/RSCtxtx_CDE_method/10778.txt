The perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 was prepared on a mesoscopic TiO2 film, starting from electrodepositing PbO, to iodination to PbI2, and then interdiffusion reaction with CH3NH3I. The as-prepared film was used as a light absorber for the perovskite solar cells, exhibiting a high PCE of 12.5% under standard AM 1.5 conditions.

Evolving from the dye-sensitized solar cells, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials such as CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) have attracted great attention as light absorbers in efficient photovoltaic cells since the first report by Miyasaka group in 2009. The perovskite active materials can be deposited from the precursor solutions at low temperatures, possessing most of the properties required for the low-cost and highly efficient solar cells: desired direct band gaps, high absorption coefficients, low fundamental energy losses, large bipolar transport mobility and long carrier diffusion lengths. These properties enabled the feasible construction of mesoscopic or planar structured devices with various architectures, having power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) ranging from 8% to 16%.

In the mesoscopic solar cells, the perovskite materials were usually deposited on mesoporous metal oxide scaffolds, typically TiO2 and Al2O3, through the spin coating technique. In the early stage, one-step spin coating method was employed to directly deposit the perovskite materials from a mixture of PbI2 and CH3NH3I in a polar solvent, delivering a power conversion efficiency of 10%. However, effective infiltration of the perovskite within the mesoscopic film is a challenge. The resulting devices usually display widespread photovoltaic performance due to the difficulty in controlling the morphology over the whole deposited area. Following that, a sequential deposition method, originally developed by Mitzi et al., was employed for the formation of the crystalline perovskite within the porous films. In this method, highly concentrated PbI2 solution was first infiltrated at elevated temperatures into the films, and then PbI2 was in situ transferred to the highly crystalline perovskite in the porous film through the solid–liquid intercalation reaction in CH3NH3I solution. By this method, a large amount of PbI2 was confined within the film to ensure sufficient loading of perovskite materials on the porous film for highly efficient light harvesting, which is responsible for the high conversion efficiency of 15%. In both the cases, however, the challenge is to fully fill the pores with the perovskite materials without leaving voids for the sufficient light harvesting. In this case, the naked TiO2 surface with no perovskite coverage could directly make contact with the hole-transport layer or the electrode, and result in serious back charge transfer, leading to poor open-circuit voltage and thus low device performance. Thus, the desirable deposition technique is of crucial importance with effective filling of the perovskite in the porous film for highly efficient mesoscopic solar cells.
Electrochemical deposition is a versatile technique for producing surface coatings, owing to its precise controllability, room temperature operation, rapid deposition rate, and relatively low cost. More importantly, electrodeposition can provide superior coverage to relatively inaccessible surfaces of the substrate, especially for the coating in the mesoporous scaffold films. Here, we report a facile and efficient method for the fabrication of the perovskite in the mesoscopic TiO2 film. As schematically illustrated in Scheme 1. PbO is first electrochemically deposited on the TiO2 film, then in situ transformed to PbI2 by iodization and finally converted to CH3NH3PbI3 by interdiffusion reaction with CH3NH3I. Using this technique, the perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 was fully filled in the porous TiO2 film with a dense and flat perovskite upper layer on the surface. The resultant solar cells yielded a power conversion efficiency of 12.5% under standard AM 1.5 conditions. The technique is environmentally sound for the production of the perovskite mesoscopic solar cells at a large scale.
Electrodeposition of metal oxide films is usually conducted by cathodic reactions in the aqueous solutions. The formation mechanism of the metal oxide films was postulated as follows: OH− ions generated at the cathode react with metal cations, such as Pb2+, to form corresponding metal oxide PbO or metal hydroxide Pb(OH)2 (eqn (1) and (2)). The latter can be converted to PbO after dehydration.
Pb2+ + 2OH− → PbO + H2O
(1)
Pb2+ + 2OH− → Pb(OH)2
(2)
Pb(OH)2 → PbO + H2O
(3)
Here, the PbO electrodeposition was carried out in a single-compartment cell, where the mesoporous TiO2 coated – FTO-glass was used as a working electrode, a Pt wire as a counter electrode. The deposition baths consisted of aqueous solutions of 2 mM Pb(NO3)2 and 0.2 M H2O2. The experimental details can be found in the ESI. The freshly deposited film appears light yellow, indicating that PbO could be directly deposited under standard reaction conditions, and the reaction would proceed according to eqn (1). The generated base in the reaction would come from the reduction of hydrogen peroxide rather than the reduction of nitrate ions at the low concentration of Pb(NO3)2.
After the electrodeposition, a slight opaque yellow color was observed on the TiO2 film, indicating the formation of PbO. The top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of the as-deposited PbO film are clearly different from those of the bare TiO2 film (Fig. 1a–d). It can be observed that the PbO was well filled in the pores of the TiO2 film, as evidenced by the darker areas and the diminished contrast features in the TiO2 layer. Interestingly, the film was covered with a layer of low-crystalline PbO, different from the highly crystalline thin platelet PbO film deposited on the ITO-substrate by the electrodeposition method. In addition, the EDX linescan for the cross sectional film of the PbO coated mesoscopic TiO2 film was characterized, and the results showed that the electrodeposited PbO was well filled on the mesoscopic TiO2 film, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI). The as-prepared PbO film was exposed in iodine vapors with the active layer downwards in an enclosed dark glass chamber. After iodination at 80 °C for 20 minutes, the slight opaque yellow film became bright yellow and transparent. The film surface was fully covered by a layer of interconnected rice-shaped PbI2 crystals, which is highly crystalline with the grain sizes of 100–200 nm and the thickness of ∼200 nm, as shown in Fig. 1e and f. The formation of the upper layer of PbI2 is probably due to the volume expansion from the interdiffusion reaction of the layered PbO and iodine vapors. This upper layer is beneficial to the further formation of the perovskite for improving light harvesting capacity and thus the device performance, which is intensively expected in the sequential deposition for the perovskite mesoscopic solar cells. For the formation of the perovskite, the PbI2 film was deposited with a layer of methylammonium iodide (MAI) by the spin coating technique, followed by thermal annealing according to the interdiffusion methods. After the interdiffusion reaction at 150 °C for 2 h under a N2 atmosphere, the dark brown perovskite was formed, as shown in Fig. 1g and h, where the perovskite crystals were fully inlayed on the surface of the TiO2 film with a dense and flat perovskite upper layer. As compared with the PbI2 coated film, the grain size and the film thickness increase to 200–1000 nm and 350 nm, respectively, due to the volume expansion. In Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI), EDX patterns of the cross sectional PbI2 and CH3NH3PbI3 coated mesoscopic TiO2 film showed that the atomic ratios for Pb and I are about 1:2 and 1:3 for PbI2 and CH3NH3PbI3, respectively, indicating that iodination of PbI2, and interdiffusion reaction with MAI could be well processed. In addition, the formed PbI2 film also emerged in the MAI-2-propanol solution for the formation of the perovskite according to the reported dipping method. Different from the former film, the dipping method gave highly crystallized perovskite crystals, which scattered on the TiO2 film with a highly rough perovskite upper layer, as shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI.
For further investigation of the evolution, UV-vis absorption spectra and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded for the deposition at different stages. As shown in Fig. 2a, the absorption spectrum of the deposited PbO on TiO2 film is in the visible short-wavelength region with the absorption onset at ∼520 nm, similar to that of the previous report. After the iodination, the absorption spectrum is red-shifted with a typical absorption peak at 500 nm for PbI2. After the interdiffusion reaction between PbI2 and MAI, the film shows the typical absorption spectrum of the perovskite with the onset at 770 nm. Fig. 2b shows the XRD patterns of PbO, PbI2 and MAPbI3 on the TiO2 films. For comparison, the XRD pattern of the bare TiO2 films was recorded. After the PbO deposition, two apparent new peaks appeared at 28.3° and 32.4°. After the iodization, the two peaks disappeared, and four new peaks appeared at 12.9°, 25.6°, 38.9°, and 53.2°, corresponding to the (001), (002), (003) and (004) lattice planes of the 2H polytype PbI2 (hexagonal structure). After the interdiffusion reaction, new peaks appeared at 14.2°, 20.1°, 28.5°, 31.9° and 40.7°, assigned to the (110), (112), (220), (310), and (224) planes of the tetragonal perovskite CH3NH3PbI3. These results indicate that the perovskite was successfully deposited on the porous TiO2 film by the sequential deposition process starting from the electrodeposited PbO.
The in situ formed perovskite films were used as the photoanode in combination with a hole transport material and the Au back electrode for perovskite solar cells. The detailed fabrication process and characterization are described in the Experimental section in the ESI. Briefly, the FTO glass is coated with a compact layer of TiO2 (∼80 nm), then with a mesoporous layer of TiO2 (∼350 nm). On the film, PbO was electrodeposited, followed by iodination of PbI2, and solid–solid or solid–liquid interdiffusion reaction with MAI. Then, spiro-MeOTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene) was deposited as a hole transport layer, followed by evaporation of 80 nm thick Au as the back electrode.
Two devices were fabricated for examining the photovoltaic performance, where solid–solid (the PbI2 layer and the MAI layer) and solid–liquid (PbI2 film immersed in an isopropanol solution of MAI) interdiffusion reactions between PbI2 and MAI were carried out for device 1 and device 2, respectively. In Fig. 3a, we show the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves measured under simulated AM 1.5 illumination. The most efficient device 1 gave a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 19.81 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.91 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.69 to yield an power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.5%, while device 2 having a Jsc of 18.86 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.78 V, a FF of 0.61, and a PCE of 9.0%. The primary difference in the efficiency of both the devices is the low open-circuit voltage and the fill factor of device 2, nearly 150 mV and 0.09 lower on average than those for device 1, as shown in Table 1. The low Voc and FF of device 2 would be ascribed to the highly rough perovskite upper layer of the TiO2 film with poor surface coverage, leading to increased charge recombination. Thus, it seems that the solid–solid interdiffusion technique is of benefit to the high-quality perovskite film and in turn to high photovoltaic performance.

Fig. 3b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the two devices. Both the devices show a similar spectral sensitivity spanning from the visible to the near-IR region (400 to 800 nm) with device 2 showing a slightly lower EQE, which is consistent with the measured short-circuit current density. Very recently, an in situ technique was reported for the preparation of the perovskite film, in which a thick (∼6 μm) PbO/TiO2 film was employed. The film was prepared by spin-coating a mixture of TiO2 colloid and PbI2, followed by sintering at high temperature. The resultant device gave a PCE of 8%, which is in contrast with the PCE of 12.5% obtained herein using a thin TiO2 film (∼350 nm). The results demonstrate that the electrodepositing PbO on mesoscopic TiO2 film is a desirable approach for the fabrication of the perovskite solar cells. In addition, device 1 exhibited high reproducibility with an average PCE of 11.3 ± 1.1%, as shown in Table 1.
In the work reported here, the perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 was in situ deposited on the mesoscopic TiO2 film starting from electrodepositing PbO, iodination for PbI2, and interdiffusion reaction with MAI. It was found that the perovskite was well filled in the porous TiO2 film with a dense and flat upper layer on the surface using this new technique. The as-prepared film was used as a light absorber for the perovskite solar cells, exhibiting a high PCE of 12.5% with high reproducibility. Moreover, this approach can afford large-scale production without the waste of Pb-containing materials encountered in the existing techniques. Thus, our findings open new routes for the fabrication of perovskite in mesoporous metal oxide film, and the technique is environmentally sound for the production of the perovskite mesoscopic solar cells at a large scale. Further optimization of the device performance is now under investigation.
