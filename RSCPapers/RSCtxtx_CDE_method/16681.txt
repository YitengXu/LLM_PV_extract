Further development of solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (ssDSSCs) requires good fill factor as well as high photon to electron conversion efficiency. We synthesized a pyrazolium-based dication organic ionic conductor with good thermal stability and high ionic diffusion coefficient, Py2C6. This pyrazolium-based electrolyte for ssDSSC achieves an efficiency of 7.30% with a fill factor of up to 79.6% and an open-circuit voltage of 779 mV, which are superior to the respective parameters reported in the previous literature. The obtained cell was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Tafel plot. The results show 24.43 Ω series resistance and 3.31 kΩ shunt resistance, very close to the values for the device with a frequently used liquid-state electrolyte, and these are the major contributors to the high fill factor. The back reaction of photoelectrons at the TiO2/electrolyte interface can also be markedly restrained as a result of the large recombination resistance, thus prolonging the electron lifetime. These factors, together with the remarkable catalytic activity of the counter electrode, lead to good photovoltaic parameters of the cell containing Py2C6. In stability tests, this device shows excellent long-term stability, maintaining 92% of the initial efficiency after 1000 h.

Research on dye-sensitized solar cells (ssDSSCs) employing all-solid-state electrolytes has gained considerable momentum due to their good stability, long-term operation capability and processability in efficient roll-to-roll manufacturing. For ease of transport, solid-state ionic conductors have been developed to replace liquid electrolytes or quasi-solid electrolytes. Most of the research about them has been devoted to organic cation-based solid-state ionic conductors, stemming from their attractive adjustability of molecular structure. Up to now, several materials have been tried, such as the functionalized imidazolium-based ionic conductors investigated by Wang, the nitrogenous compounds-based organic ionic crystals developed by Yan, and the pyrrolidinium and benzothiaozole-based dicationic crystals synthesized by our group.

Fill factor (FF) is one of the key parameters of DSSCs that determine the maximum obtainable efficiency of the cell, along with open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current density. Although efficiencies above 7% have been reported for ssDSSCs based on solid-state organic ionic conductors, FF values for ssDSSCs in most of the literature are around 0.6 to 0.7, obviously lower than those of devices with liquid electrolytes. Another important photovoltaic parameter, open-circuit voltage (Voc), is also apparently below those of liquid electrolyte-based cells (as shown in Table 1). Here, we report a bis-pyrazolium-based solid-state ionic conductor with which the device achieves not only a high energy conversion efficiency of 7.3% at 100 mW cm−2 but also a high fill factor of 0.79. As far as we are aware, the fill factor of 0.79 achieved with N719 dye is one of the highest reported values for ssDSSCs.

The pyrazolium cation has a similar heteroaromatic ring structure to the imidazolium cation except for the position of the nitrogen atoms. Pyrazolium-based compounds are generally characterized by high conductivity with relevant electrochemical properties that are appealing for application as electrolytes in electrochemical devices. However, there have been few studies of the pyrazolium-based compounds and their application, apart from several pyrazolium-based ionic liquids. Previous research by Lebdeh's group has demonstrated that a series of solid-state compounds based on pyrazolium can be synthesized by tailoring the structures of the cation. Enlightened by this, we have synthesized the bis-pyrazolium-based ionic crystal (Py2C6) on the basis of our group's previous research into dicationic ionic conductors. After studying its crystalline structure and thermal properties, we used this compound as the electrolyte matrix in a ssDSSC, thus achieving a photoelectric efficiency of 7.30% with a fill factor of 79.6%. Compared with the corresponding monocationic compound, this crystal has evident advantage in photoelectric performance, and is even better than the ionic liquid 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII).

Pyrazole, bromoethane, 1,6-dibromohexane, 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII), and 4-tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Co. and used without any treatment. Iodine, potassium sulfocyanate and chloroplatinic acid were received from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. These reagents were all analytical grade. Organic solvents were used in this work after the standard purification process. FTO transparent conductive glass and Pt counter electrode were bought from Wuhan Geao Science Instruments Co. TiCl4 (AR) and dye sensitizer (N719) were obtained from Tianjin Kemiou Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd and Wuhan Jingge Solar Energy Tech. Co., Ltd, respectively. P25 particles were obtained from Evonik Degussa (China) Co., Ltd.


Pyrazole (8.17 g, 120 mmol) and potassium hydroxide (10.10 g, 180 mmol) were dissolved in DMSO (40 mL) in a flask, and this solution was stirred at 80 °C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the flask was moved to an ice-water bath. Bromoethane (8.95 mL, 120 mmol) in DMSO (30 mL) was added dropwise to the above mixture over a period of 1.5 h, and then the reaction was continued for 12 h in an ice-water bath. A 100 mL volume of H2O was added to the resulting solution after the reaction had ended. The crude product was extracted with chloroform five times. The combined organic phase was dried, filtered and then distilled; the fraction collected at about 140 °C was the pure product.


Ionic conductors based on the pyrazolium structure were prepared as described in Scheme 1. The procedure includes two steps, the nucleophilic substitution reaction of 1-ethylpyrazole with bromoalkane and the anion exchange of pyrazolium bromides. 1-Ethylpyrazole (4.81 g, 50 mmol) and dibromohexane (1.51 mL, 10 mmol) (or 1.40 mL of 1-bromohexane) were added into 15 mL of acetone. The resulting solution was stirred under a N2 atmosphere at 135 °C for 72 h. After reaction, the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation and a light yellow solid was obtained. This crude product was washed successively with diethyl ether, acetone and ethyl acetate. The pure products were obtained after vacuum drying at 40 °C for 24 h. 1H NMR, 13C NMR and ESI-MS spectra of PynC6 (n = 2, 1; anion = Br) were recorded (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI).

The anion exchange step was carried out by a metathesis reaction of the bromide salt with KSCN. Pyrazolium bromide (5 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of acetone, and this solution was treated with 25 mmol of KSCN. The resulting mixture was stirred at 35 °C for 24 h and then filtered to obtain a pink precipitate. The crude product was washed successively with acetone, petroleum ether and diethyl ether. After drying under vacuum at 40 °C for 24 h, the final product was obtained. 1H NMR spectra of PynC6 (n = 2, 1) are shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI). IR spectra for PynC6 (n = 2, 1) are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI).

The electrolyte consists of four parts: ionic conductor matrix, I− source, I2 and charge recombination inhibitor. In this work, we used 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII) and 4-tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) as I− source and charge recombination inhibitor, respectively. These constituents were blended in the molar ratio of 0.1:0.1:0.02:0.01 and uniformly ground to form a solid-state electrolyte before the characterization and fabrication of the DSSC.


FTO conductive glass was successively washed with hydrochloric acid, ethanol, isopropanol and distilled water in an ultrasonic cleaning machine for 30 min. The FTO glass was soaked in 0.05 mol L−1 TiCl4 aqueous solution at 80 °C for 1 h to form a compact TiO2 layer. Then, pieces of adhesive tape were stuck along the sides of the FTO glass, leaving only a 0.36 cm2 area uncovered. A thick film of 20 nm-sized P25 particles was deposited onto the FTO glass using a doctor-blade technique. The resulting FTO glass with TiO2 film was annealed at 450 °C for 30 min, forming a mesoporous TiO2 film. The obtained photocathode was cooled to 80 °C and immersed in 0.5 mol L−1 of N719 ethanol solution at room temperature for 15 h to complete the sensitizer loading. The dye-sensitized photocathode was washed with anhydrous ethanol to remove the non-absorbed dye and dried in a vacuum drying oven.

The Pt counter electrode was prepared by pyrolysis. A solution of 0.05 mol L−1 H2PtCl6 in isopropanol was placed dropwise on the cleaned FTO glass. After drying completely in air, the resulting FTO glass was subjected to a final 380 °C heat treatment for 30 min. This annealing process was repeated twice, producing the final Pt counter electrode.
The solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell had a sandwich structure. The ionic crystal-based electrolyte was filled into the space between the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and the Pt counter electrode by the knife coating method, forming a sheet 0.36 cm2 in area. The two electrodes were clipped together by hot pressing (under 0.18 MPa of pressure at 135 °C for 35 s) with the help of a 100 μm-thick heat-sealing film.


1H NMR and 13C NMR were conducted using a Bruker Avance 400 MHz spectrometer. IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer. Molecular weights were measured with a MALDI-TOF Bruker mass spectrometer. XRD measurements were performed on a Rigaku D/Max-RA X-ray diffractometer with graphite-monochromatized high-intensity Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Surface morphology was determined by an environmental scanning electron microscope (SEM) (FEI Quanta 200). The thermal properties of crystals were measured using a Thermoanalyzer Systems Q1000DSC + LNCS + FACS Q600SDT at a scanning rate of 10 °C min−1 in the temperature range 20–600 °C under N2 atmosphere.

Electrochemical impedance measurement was employed to evaluate the ionic conductivity of electrolytes on a CHI660d electrochemical workstation using an ordinary cell composed of a Teflon tube and two square conductive glass electrodes with 1 cm side at room temperature over the frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz. Steady-state voltammetry was performed using an electrochemical cell equipped with a 0.01 mm radius platinum ultramicroelectrode as the working electrode, a platinum foil counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode as reference electrode.
The photo-current intensity vs. photo-voltage (J–V) curves of the device were obtained using a Keithley 2400 source meter under standard AM 1.5 solar illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and in the dark. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of cells were acquired with a CHI660d electrochemical workstation under dark conditions at various forward bias voltages from −0.70 V to 0.8 V in the frequency range 0.01 to 105 Hz, employing three identical stainless steel electrodes as the working, counter and reference electrodes respectively. The Tafel plot of cells was obtained using a CHI600d electrochemical workstation, voltages from −0.8 V to 0.8 V, and a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Incident monochromatic photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves of devices were obtained using a QTest Station 2000 IPCE Measurement System (Crowntech, USA).

As shown in Fig. 1, Py2C6 is a pink solid powder and displays an irregular crystal shape with a size of ∼15–40 nm. Although we tried to obtain a single crystal of Py2C6 by the vapor-diffusion method to further study the structure of Py2C6, we failed. XRD patterns of PynC6 (n = 2, 1; anion = Br) and PynC6 (n = 2, 1) are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI).

The essential thermal properties of Py2C6, including phase transition and thermal decomposition, were examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA, 5% weight loss points; Fig. S7, ESI). As depicted in Fig. S8a in the ESI, the DSC curve shows that Py2C6 exhibits a solid–liquid transformation at 170.3 °C, before which there is no solid–solid transition. With the increase of test temperature, Py2C6 shows one-stage decomposition at approximately 225.8 °C (as shown in Fig. S8b, ESI). These data demonstrate that Py2C6 has good thermal stability in the range of the working temperature of the DSSC outdoors. The high melting point and decomposition temperature could be attributed to the influence of dipole–dipole interaction because cationic centers of pyrazolium with lower symmetry would produce stronger electrostatic attraction with anions. The TGA (5% weight loss) and DSC results for PyC6 and PynC6 (n = 2, 1; anion = Br) are shown in Fig. S7 and S8, ESI.
Materials that can be used as the electrolyte in photovoltaic devices must guarantee fast transfer of charge carriers. Hence, the conductivity of Py2C6 containing the solar cell additives was measured by electrochemical impedance, as shown in Fig. 2a, and the data calculated according to the equation given in Fig. 2a are presented in Table 2, where σ is the conductivity in S cm−1, R is the ohmic resistance of the electrolyte, l is the distance between the two electrodes and S is the area of the electrodes. For better illustration, the analogous monocationic compound, 1-ethyl-2-hexylpyrazolium sulfocyanate (PyC6), was introduced for comparison. In addition, PMII, which is the candidate of choice for high efficiency liquid-state DSSCs, also served as a point of reference to illuminate the potential of Py2C6 as an excellent electron-transfer material. As shown in Table 2, the conductivities of Py2C6, PyC6 and PMII are 4.57 × 10−4 S cm−1, 5.97 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 5.44 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively. Given that molecular weight and ion size are factors influencing conductivity, the bulky cation of Py2C6 could be the main reason that Py2C6 has the lowest conductivity of the three. But the 4.57 × 10−4 S cm−1 conductivity for Py2C6 is still superior to those of benzothiaozolium/pyrrolidinium-based ionic conductors and other imidazolium-based ionic crystals.

In practical electrolytes, the concentration of I3− is much lower than that of I− and the diffusion of the former is slower than that of the latter. Hence, the ionic diffusion of I3− can reflect the demand for high performance DSSCs more exactly than ion conductivity. The apparent diffusion coefficients (Dapp) can be estimated from the steady-state current Iss by the equation given in Fig. 2b, where n is the number of electrons per molecule, F is the Faraday constant, C is the concentration, and r is the radius of the electrode. The calculated diffusion coefficients of I3− are summarized in Table 2. The changing trend in Dapp(I3−) is distinctly different from that of the conductivity. Clearly, the diffusion coefficients of I3− for the two pyrazolium-based ionic conductors are both higher than that of PMII. Especially, the value of Dapp(I3−) for Py2C6 (5.988 × 10−6 cm2 s−1) is more than twice that of PMII (2.763 × 10−6 cm2 s−1). Yanagida et al. report diffusion coefficients varying in the order DMHI+ < TBA+ < Na+ < Li+. The cation density affects the diffusion coefficient to some extent.

Interfacial compatibility is a major challenge that must be overcome in order to achieve high photovoltaic efficiency for a solid-state electrolyte. There must be good penetration of the electrolyte into the TiO2 pores so that the transport of electrons can be achieved successfully. To clarify the infiltration of electrolyte on the surface of the photoanode, cross-section SEM images were obtained, as shown in Fig. 3. It is clear that the 24 μm layer of electrolyte becomes about 5.6 μm thick after hot pressing, suggesting good penetration of electrolyte into the mesopores of TiO2 in the photoanode. Excellent interfacial contact between the dye-sensitized TiO2 and the solid-state electrolyte is achieved.

To further investigate the applied performance of Py2C6, we used it as the matrix to formulate a solid-state electrolyte. For comparison, photovoltaic measurements of the homologous cells with PyC6 and PMII were also performed. Fig. 4 shows the J–V curves of DSSCs with Py2C6, PyC6 and PMII, respectively, under AM 1.5 sunlight intensity illumination and in the dark. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. The open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) of the device with Py2C6 are 779 mV, 11.78 mA cm−2 and 79.6%, respectively, yielding an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.3%. The photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE) of the device with PyC6 are 766 mV, 8.99 mA cm−2, 79.4%, and 5.47%, respectively. Compared with the PMII-based electrolyte (754 mV, 7.97 mA cm−2, 81.7% and 4.91%), the electrolyte with Py2C6 displays obvious superiority, especially in Jsc and Voc. Further data, including Tafel (Fig. 5), EIS (Fig. 6), and IPCE (Fig. 7), are collected for detailed discussions.

Since Jsc is proportional to the number of charges arriving at the collecting electrode per unit time, it shows a strong dependence on the diffusion of I3−. From Tables 2 and 3, the results of Jsc for Py2C6-, PyC6- and PMII-based electrolytes agree quite well with their difference in Dapp(I3−). Hence, the advantage in Jsc for the Py2C6-based device can be ascribed mainly to the enhanced diffusion coefficient of I3−. Moreover, the regeneration rate of I− by the reduction of I3− at the counter electrode also has a noticeable effect on the above-mentioned number of charges. According to the results for the internal resistances in the devices with Py2C6, PyC6 and PMII (as shown in Fig. 6a and Table 4), the Rpt value (resistance at the counter electrode) of 6.29 Ω for the Py2C6-based device is the lowest of three. This means that the Pt counter electrode shows remarkable catalytic activity in the Py2C6-based cell, which favors the reduction of I3− to I−. This result is also confirmed by the peak current densities of cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a symmetrical Pt electrode sandwiched with electrolyte (as shown in Fig. S9, ESI).

V
oc values of 700 mV or slightly higher are typically obtained for nanocrystalline TiO2-based DSSCs using Ru-based dyes under the most favorable conditions. Our obtained Voc of 779 mV is superior to those of the cells with PMII and other solid-state electrolytes (as shown in Table 1). In theory, the value of Voc is equal to the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of electrons in TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte. For a given redox potential, the shift in the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 can result in a change in the value of Voc, and the back reaction of photoelectrons in TiO2 film with I3− in the electrolyte is the major factor influencing the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2. Generally, slower recombination kinetics shift the quasi-Fermi level toward the conduction band of TiO2, leading to an increase in Voc. From Fig. 4b, we can see that the value of Voc for the Py2C6-based device in dark conditions has a positive shift of 50 mV and 84 mV compared with those of the cells based on PyC6 and PMII, respectively. According to the equation in Fig. 4b, where k and T are the Boltzmann constant and absolute temperature respectively, Iinj is the injection current from dye to semiconductor, ncb is the electron density in the conduction band of the semiconductor, and ket is the rate constant for I3− reduction, the greater Voc implies a smaller rate constant for I3− reduction. The ket[I3−] of the cell based on the ionic liquid PMII is the greatest of three, which agrees with the previous research result that one of the main limiting factors in ionic liquid-based electrolytes is the high recombination rate constant. The trend in ket[I3−] for the three electrolytes can be interpreted by the recombination resistance. The recombination resistance at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, Rr, can be obtained from the second arc of the EIS curve in the middle frequency range (1–100 Hz) (as shown in Fig. 6a and Table 4). An Rr of 47.54 Ω for the Py2C6-based device is the greatest for the three cells, implying the most difficult recombination of photoelectrons. Hence, the enhancement of Voc for Py2C6-based cell owes a good deal to the suppression of the back reaction.
The above results for the recombination resistance can be verified by Tafel analysis. Fig. 5 shows the Tafel polarization curves of the devices with Py2C6, PyC6 and PMII in the dark condition. The exchange current density (j0) is an exact indicator of the electron transfer rate under the equilibrium condition. The value of j0 can be calculated from the intersection of the linear anodic and cathodic branches of the polarization curves. The exchange current density of the cell with Py2C6 was about 4.94 × 10−9 A cm−2, which was much lower than those of the devices with PyC6 and PMII, 3.39 × 10−8 A cm−2 and 1.33 × 10−7 A cm−2. This indicates that the ionic conductor Py2C6 used as the matrix of the electrolyte for the ssDSSC can effectively suppress the back reaction. The dark current affects not only the open-circuit voltage but also the short-circuit current. Hence, the suppression of the back reaction contributes to the increase of both current and voltage. One possible explanation for the inhibition of the dark current might be a much greater increase of the cation concentration on the TiO2 surface. The earlier literature has reported that the adsorption of certain organic molecules can insulate the TiO2 surface from recombination. The enhancement of Van der Waals forces in organic molecules can raise this adsorption concentration on the TiO2 surface. The increase in Van der Waals forces in Py2C6 results in better absorption than in PyC6 and PMII, leading to the best inhibitive effect.
The outstanding advantage of the electrolyte with Py2C6 lies in the fill factor (FF) of up to 79.6%, which is obviously higher than 60–70%, the commonly-found value in ssDSSCs. Generally, the studies on FF for DSSCs were conducted using the equivalent circuit models, simulating a p–n junction solar cell with an ideal diode, series resistance Rs, and shunt resistance Rsh (as shown at Fig. S10, ESI). It is the series resistance and shunt resistance that influence the fill factor in the cell. In theory, Rs can be obtained from the intercept of the EIS curve with the real axis at high frequency range, which determines the vertical sharpness of the J–V curve at open circuit, and Rsh can be ascertained from the slope of the J–V curve of the cell at J = Jsc (V = 0), which determines the flatness of the J–V curve at short circuit. For an ideal cell, Rs is zero and Rsh is infinitely large, both of which contribute to the theoretical maximum FF. In order to further investigate the internal resistance of cells, EIS studies were performed as shown in Fig. 6, and Table 4 presents the parameters of the cells measured. From Table 4, the values of Rs in the DSSCs with Py2C6, PyC6 and PMII are 24.43 Ω, 25.46 Ω and 21.04 Ω, respectively. Clearly, the Rs of Py2C6 is quite close to the Rs of the liquid-state electrolyte based on PMII. And the value of Rsh in the cell with Py2C6 is also slightly smaller than that of the device with PMII. Hence, it is suspected that the high FF of the device using Py2C6 is attributable mainly to the small series resistance and the greater shunt resistance, which benefits from the better diffusivity and recombination control of the large cation in the Py2C6-based solid-state electrolyte.
It is a common view that the effective lifetime of the electron (τe) before recombination in the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode can also influence the photovoltaic parameters Voc and FF of DSSCs. A longer photoelectron life results in a smaller dark current, which means a higher FF. The value of τe can be estimated as τe = 1/2πfmax, where fmax is the maximum frequency of the mid-frequency peak of the Bode phase plot. The values of fmax and τe are also summarized in Table 4. The middle-frequency peak shifts positively from 14.60 Hz to 32.76 Hz and 86.43 Hz for the cells with Py2C6, PyC6 and PMII, implying a change of τe from 10.90 ms to 4.86 ms and 1.84 ms. So the long electron lifetime for the device with Py2C6 is one of the reasons why the photovoltaic performance of this cell is superior to those of the two other cells.
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curve of DSSC with Py2C6 is shown in Fig. 7. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies exceed 50% in the spectral range from 400 to 600 nm, reaching a maximum of 65% at 530 nm.
To test the stability of the Py2C6-based electrolyte for DSSC, the fabricated cell was subjected to 1000 h of use. Fig. 8 presents the photovoltaic data of the device during this 1000 h. The performance was remarkably stable over this period, with only 8 mV Voc decay, 0.54 mA cm−2 decrease of Jsc and 0.61% reduction of PCE. The detailed data can be seen in Fig. S11 and Table S1 in the ESI.

A pyrazolium-based solid-state electrolyte for DSSCs has been synthesized. The unevenly distributed cationic center and the dicationic structure endow the ionic conductor Py2C6 with high ion diffusion coefficients which ensure good photovoltaic parameters for the device. By characterization of photoelectrochemical parameters, we found that the electrolyte with a bis-pyrazolium-based conductor has the evident advantage in the internal resistance of the device, showing ideal values of Rs and Rsh very close to those of the PMII-based electrolyte. In addition, the 47.54 Ω recombination resistance can effectively suppress the back reaction, leading to a 10.90 ms photoelectron lifetime. The achievement of 7.30% conversion efficiency and 79.6% fill factor can be attributed to the above factors. Further studies are in progress to understand the detailed mechanism of the photovoltaic performance. We believe that our findings concerning this new ionic conductor will prove useful for the further improvement of solid-state electrolytes with good photovoltaic parameters.
