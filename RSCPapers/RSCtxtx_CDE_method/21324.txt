The effect of organic electron transporting layers (ETLs) on organic solar cells (OSCs) has been evaluated. Thermally deposited small molecule OSCs utilizing the electron transporting material 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP), and the pyridine-containing derivatives 1,3,5-tri(m-pyrid-3-yl-phenyl)benzene (TmPyPB), bis-1,2-(3,5-di-3-pyridyl-phenyl)benzene (B3PyPB) and diphenyl-bis[4-(pyridin-3-yl)phenyl]silane (DPPS) as ETLs have been fabricated and studied. Impedance spectroscopy and current density–voltage characteristics show that the device performance is closely related to the intrinsic electron mobilities of the ETLs. It was demonstrated that the compound TmPyPB, which possesses good thermal properties, high transparency, high refractive index, and low ionization potential, as well as high electron mobility, is a promising material as an ETL in OSCs, resulting especially in lower series resistance and higher shunt resistance. The devices adopting TmPyPB as an ETL show exceptional characteristics with high fill-factor (FF) and very high power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 53% and 6.3%, respectively, which are great enhancements compared to cells using conventional BCP as an ETL material.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) possessing the unique advantages of low-cost, low energy consumption in the fabrication process, and compatibility with flexible substrates have been regarded as one of the most potential green energy technologies. Among them, small molecule organic solar cells (SMOSCs) which utilize both small molecule electron donors and small molecule electron acceptors as active materials are of great interest to the research community and industry due to their predominant advantages such as well-defined molecular structures, easier purification, amenability to large-scale production, and better batch-to-batch reproducibility. To date, considerable efforts have been dedicated to enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of SMOSCs by researching different approaches, including development of new electron-donor materials, controlling surface morphology, or improving the collection of charge carriers. Remarkable PCEs of SMOSCs in excess of 5% in either solution-processed or vacuum-deposited fabrication techniques have been successfully achieved. In conventional SMOSCs, an electron transporting layer (ETL) is usually inserted between the active layers and cathode to improve the electron transportation, block excitons and protect the underlying organic layers from damage during metal deposition. Various electron transporting materials such as 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP), 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTCDA), 1,3,5-tris(phenyl-2-benzimidazolyl)-benzene (TPBi), and 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Bphen) have been integrated into SMOSCs. Among them, BCP, which was already widely used as an ETL in organic light emitting devices, has become the most popular ETL in SMOSCs. Hence, BCP was naturally selected as an ETL material in our previously reported SMOSCs. Although the cells incorporating BCP as an ETL showed good performances, it has been reported that several disadvantages exist in BCP, such as thermal instability and easy crystallization in the presence of moisture and at high temperature. Provided that the performance has to be retained or even enhanced, finding an alternative for BCP is essential and highly desired for SMOSCs. Accordingly, in this work, including typical BCP, we systematically evaluated a series of pyridine-based organic electron transporters, 1,3,5-tri(m-pyrid-3-yl-phenyl)benzene (TmPyPB), bis-1,2-(3,5-di-3-pyridyl-phenyl)benzene (B3PyPB) and diphenyl-bis[4-(pyridin-3-yl)phenyl]silane (DPPS) for their potential as ETLs in SMOSCs utilizing a model system with DTDCTB:fullerene as an active layer due to its favourable PCE as high as 4.4% (C60) to 5.8% (C70). The mobilities of these pyridine-based compounds range from 10−6 to 10−3 cm2 v−1 s−1, and they have already been utilized in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), showing promising performances. A high correlation between the electron mobilities of the ETLs and the OPV device performances was found. Among them, OSCs with TmPyPB exhibiting the highest electron mobility as an ETL showed the best PCE of up to 6.3%, which is a 10.5% enhancement as compared to the parent cell using BCP as an ETL material.


Electron transporting materials, TmPyPB, BCP and B3PyPB were purchased from Nichem Fine Technology Corporation and DPPS was purchased from Luminescence Technology Corporation. Before fabrication of devices, all electron-transporting materials were purified by temperature-gradient sublimation in a vacuum chamber with pressure ∼1 × 10−6 Torr. The metal oxide, organic thin films and metal electrodes were deposited orderly on pre-cleaned ITO glass substrates in a ultra-high vacuum chamber with a pressure of ∼1 × 10−6 Torr. The deposition rate of all organic compounds was between 0.3 and 1.5 Å s−1. The active area of the cells had an average size of 5 mm2 (intersection area between Ag cathode and ITO anode) and were carefully measured device-by-device using a calibrated optical microscope. Devices were encapsulated using a UV-cured sealant (Everwide Chemical Co., Epowide EX) and a cover glass under an anhydrous nitrogen atmosphere after fabrication and were measured in air. Organic films for ellipsometry measurements were vacuum deposited on fused silica substrates. The J–V characteristics were measured with a SourceMeter Keithley 2636A under AM1.5G simulated solar illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (calibrated with a NREL-traceable KG5 filtered silicon reference cell). The current densities were all corrected by spectral mismatch factors. The deviation values were obtained from device-to-device variations of 4–8 devices. The EQE spectra were taken by illuminating chopped monochromatic light with a continuous-wave bias white light (from a halogen lamp) on the solar cells. The photocurrent signals were extracted with a lock-in technique using a current preamplifier (Stanford Research System) followed by a lock-in amplifier (AMETEK). The EQE measurements are fully computer controlled and the intensity of monochromatic light is carefully calibrated with a NIST-traceable optical power meter (Ophir Optronics). The ac impedance spectroscopy measurements were implemented using a Reference 600 (GAMRY Instrument) potentiostat. The frequency range was from 10 Hz to 1 MHz. The obtained data were fitted with EIS300 Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy Software (GAMRY Instrument) in terms of the appropriate equivalent circuits. The lifespan of the solar cells with a 405 nm cut-off long pass filter on the surface were examined using a long-term accelerated aging experiment under a Suntest CPS plus lamp (ATLAS GmbH, 100 mW cm−2) during visible-light soaking at 60 °C.


The molecular structures of BCP, TmPyPB, B3PyPB and DPPS are shown in Fig. 1. Before analyzing the devices’ behaviour, the prerequisite optical properties of an ideal electron transporting material, which is high transparency in the active layer absorption wavelength range should be examined. The optical constants of vacuum-deposited thin films of BCP, TmPyPB, B3PyPB and DPPS are shown in Fig. 2. These ET materials all exhibit zero extinction coefficients (k) value across the 350–900 nm wavelength range and should be appropriate candidates as ETLs in OSCs. The higher refractive index (n) of TmPyPB, and B3PyPB compared to that of BCP could provide the same optical path length using a smaller thickness, which may benefit from better electron transport properties. The electrical properties of BCP, TmPyPB, B3PyPB and DPPS are summarized in Table 1. Usually, ETLs can act as exciton blocking layers to prevent exciton recombinations at the organic/metal interface. To serve this purpose, a low enough ionization potential (Ip) level is needed. As shown in Table 1, all electron transporting materials in this study exhibit lower Ip levels of equal or less than −6.5 eV, while TmPyPB and B3PyPB show even lower Ip levels of −6.7 eV, which could be regarded to perform better exciton blocking ability. It is noteworthy that diverse values of electron mobilities of BCP have been reported. This may be attributed to the poor stability of BCP.

In order to examine the morphological stability of the ETLs, neat films (30 nm) of BCP and TmPyPB were annealed under different temperatures for 20 minutes. Fig. 3 shows the optical microscopic images of BCP and TmPyPB films under various annealing conditions. As shown, the BCP film started to crystallize at 55 °C and the size of the crystallization grain increased at 70 °C. In contrast, the TmPyPB film remained unchanged at annealing temperatures as high as 70 °C. Clearly, the film morphology of TmPyPB is more stable than that of BCP upon thermal treatment.

In our recent work, a donor–acceptor–acceptor (D–A–A) type donor molecule DTDCTB and fullerene were combined to serve as the active materials of OSCs, giving promising efficiencies. Based on this result, we adopted this efficient system to evaluate the influence of the ETLs on solar cell performance. First, fullerene C60 was used as electron acceptor, and planar-mixed heterojunction (PMHJ) devices were configured as: indium tin oxide (ITO)/MoO3 (30 nm)/DTDCTB (7 nm)/DTDCTB:C60 (1:1 by volume, 40 nm)/C60 (20 nm)/ETL (BCP or TmPyPB, 10 nm)/Ag (150 nm). The spectral mismatch corrected current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of these devices are shown in Fig. 4. The performances of the PMHJ devices using BCP and TmPyPB as ETLs are shown in Table 2. It is interesting to see that the device employing TmPyPB as an ETL showed better performance than that of the optimized BCP-based cell. The best PCE of the TmPyPB-based device achieved was up to 4.8%, together with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.81 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 11.34 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.53. The devices incorporating two different ETLs gave nearly the same Voc which could be rationalized by the same active materials and thicknesses that cause the same driving force for exciton dissociation. A slightly higher Jsc of the TmPyPB-based device could be ascribed to the better exciton blocking ability of TmPyPB as compared to that of BCP. Apparently, the most distinguishable difference between these two devices is FF. An over 10% enhancement of FF was found in the TmPyPB device which could be attributed to the better electron extraction and transporting ability of TmPyPB due to its high electron mobility. The assumption was clearly supported by the decrease of series resistance from 15.6 Ω cm2 for the BCP-based cell to 10.6 Ω cm2 for the TmPyPB-based cell.

In order to enhance the photon harvesting, C60 was replaced by C70 due to its higher k values across the 400–550 nm wavelength range. The device architecture was configured as: ITO/MoO3 (5 nm)/DTDCTB (7 nm)/DTDCTB:C70 (1:1 by volume, 40 nm)/C70 (7 nm)/ETL (10 nm)/Ag (150 nm). To investigate the key factors of the ETLs in OSCs, another two electron transporting compounds, B3PyPB and DPPS were selected to compare with those of the BCP and TmPyPB-based devices. It should be worthy of note that the B3PyPB and DPPS possess lower electron mobilities of 10−4 and 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.

The spectral mismatch corrected J–V characteristics and corresponding EQE spectra of the DTDCTB:C70 cells based on these four ETLs are shown in Fig. 5 and the device parameters are summarized in Table 2. In comparison to the DTDCTB:C60 devices, the DTDCTB:C70 devices exhibit a higher Jsc due to higher and broader extinction coefficients of the C70 thin films. In contrast to the BCP and TmPyPB-based devices, the devices employing B3PyPB and DPPS as ETLs showed lower Jsc values. This result can be ascribed to the lower electron mobilities, thus the slower electron extraction rates of B3PyPB and DPPS, which led to an increased possibility of charge recombination due to electron accumulation at the interface of the active layer and ETL. In addition to the varying Jsc values, the FF values of the devices utilizing four different ETLs follow the trend of the electron mobilities. As one might expect, electrons can be transported quickly in the ETL utilizing a high electron mobility material, so choosing TmPyPB as an ETL is more appropriate for another three compounds in this study. Because of the obvious trend of FF, Jsc as well as Voc, the observed highest efficiencies of each ETL cells are in the order of: TmPyPB (6.1%) > BCP (5.7%) > B3PyPB (4.0%) > DPPS (3.4%), which are also highly correlated to the electron mobilities of ETL.

Alternating current (ac) impedance spectroscopy is a powerful technique that has been used to investigate the charge carrier characteristics, and electrical properties of bulk materials and interfaces. The method has already been used to analyze the electrical dynamics in dye-sensitized solar cells and OLEDs. In recent years, the ac impedance characteristics of OSCs have also been studied intensively. Here, ac impedance spectroscopy was applied to dissect the electrical characteristics of each ETL inserted in the OSCs.


Fig. 6(a) depicts the Nyquist plots of the TmPyPB, B3PyPB and DPPS cells operated in the dark and near Voc condition (0.79 V). The devices with different ETLs all possess a similar series resistance (∼1 Ω cm2) and can be modelled with an equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 6(b). The equivalent circuit consists of a series connection of a series resistance (Rs) and two parallel resistance-constant phase elements (R‖CPE). The two R‖CPE represent the two depressed semicircles observed in the Nyquist plots.Table 3 lists the fitted parameters Rs, R1‖CPE1, and R2‖CPE2 of the equivalent circuit and the lines in Fig. 6(a) show the fitted curves. The similar R1‖CPE1 was obtained in all cells can reasonably be regarded as the contribution of the organic active layers. Therefore, the large depressed semicircles and their parameters (R2‖CPE2) indicate the effects of the ETLs. From Table 3, the largest R2 value of the DPPS cell can be attributed to the impeded electron transportation through the DPPS layer which causes the highest Rseries (see Table 2) and thus a lowest FF in these three devices. In contrast, the lowest R2 and smallest semicircles in the TmPyPB cell indicate that the TmPyPB layer can transport carriers more fluently than other ETLs.

To approach the working condition closely, the impedance measurements of the devices were carried out under AM1.5G solar simulated illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun). The measured and fitted results are shown in Fig. 7 and the parameters of the equivalent circuit (Fig. 6(b)) are listed in Table 4. As one might expect, the ac impedances of the illuminated devices follow exactly the same trend as those obtained from the J–V characteristics of the devices under 1 sun illumination with various ETLs. Regardless of if the devices were measured in the dark or under illumination, the depressed semicircles coincident to ETLs in the Nyquist plots have high correlation with the performance of the cells. The results suggest that ac impedance measurements could be a good method to evaluate the performance of carrier buffer layers in OSCs. From the ac impedance data acquired in this study, the high electron mobility for an ETL as a prerequisite is confirmed again.

Finally, in order to pursue higher efficiency and doubly confirm that TmPyPB performs better than BCP in OSCs, tuning the blend ratio of the active layer has been employed. The device parameters, Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE, which are derived from the spectral mismatch correctedJ–V characteristics (Fig. 8) are summarized in Table 2. Compared to the DTDCTB:C70 (1:1) cell, as BCP served as the ETL, the FF of the DTDCTB:C70 (1:1.6) cell dropped to 0.48, in spite of the fact that the PCE could be maintained. On the other hand, as observed in the cells described previously, a largely enhanced FF could be obtained by replacing BCP with TmPyPB. Therefore, it is reasonable to anticipate that the device of DTDCTB:C70 (1:1.6) combined with TmPyPB as ETL should give a better efficiency. The EQE values (inset of Fig. 8) of wavelengths ranging from 400 to 700 nm were further enhanced in this optimal donor–acceptor ratio, resulting in a higher Jsc as compared to the cell with an equal ratio of DTDCTB and C70. As a result, this optimized TmPyPB-based device delivered an impressive performance, with a Voc of 0.8 V, Jsc of 14.97 mA cm−2, FF of 0.53 and PCE as high as 6.3% for the best device behaviour.


The crystallization tendency in BCP film upon thermal stress has been verified in this report (Fig. 3). In addition, the durability of solar cells against higher operational temperature was then examined. The optimized cells using BCP and TmPyPB as ETLs were annealed under different temperatures for 20 minutes to evaluate the influence of morphological changes on the device performance. The PCEs of the solar cells as a function of annealing temperature were shown in Fig. 9. Both BCP- and TmPyPB-based cells maintained their efficiencies across the 40–70 °C temperature range. This result could be attributed to higher film morphological stability when ETLs are sandwiched between a thick metal cathode and an organic layer in the device. Therefore, even though the BCP neat film showed crystallization at 55 °C, the cell performance remained unchanged after thermal treatment within a short period of time (20 minutes). In order to show the superior characteristics of TmPyPB with regard to cell efficiency and stability, light-soaking tests under continuous AM1.5G 1 sun illumination at 60 °C were performed. The evolution of normalized PCEs and fitting curves (inset) are shown in Fig. 10. After ∼600 h one sun irradiation at 60 °C, the PCE of the BCP-based cell dropped to 4.1% (70% of initial value) while the TmPyPB-based cell maintained >5.0%, which is higher than 80% of the initial PCE value. The lower PCE decay rate clearly suggests that TmPyPB is a more stable material as an ETL in OSCs.


In summary, highly transparent organic electron transporting materials, DPPS, B3PyPB, BCP and TmPyPB with electron mobilities ranging from 10−6 to 10−3 cm2 v−1 s−1 have been employed in OSCs. Among them, DPPS, B3PyPB and TmPyPB show superior thermal stabilities compared to the commonly used electron transporting material BCP. We found that the performance of OSCs is highly correlated to the electron mobilities of materials adopted in ETLs. Using higher electron mobility materials as ETLs leads to a better device performance, especially in FF and Jsc. It was demonstrated that the compound TmPyPB, which possess good thermal properties, high transparency, high refractive index and low Ip, as well as high electron mobility, is a promising substitute for BCP as an ETL in SMOSCs, resulting especially in lower series resistance and higher shunt resistance and thus, a high FF up to 0.53 and a greater Jsc in cells with various active layer systems. With the analysis of ac impedance spectroscopy, the performance of the cells with different ETLs can be rationally explained by the various equivalent resistances fitted by the constructed model. Remarkably, by adopting TmPyPB in DTDCTB:C70 (1:1.6) solar cells, a highest efficiency of 6.3% was achieved, which is a 10.5% enhancement compared to the device using conventional BCP as the ETL. The light-soaking experiment of the TmPyPB-based cell showed less decay as compared to that of the BCP-based device, which clearly verified the superior characteristics of TmPyPB as an ETL in OSCs. Our results suggest some important prerequisites of materials for ETLs in OSCs and may trigger advanced efforts in searching and developing new organic electron transporting compounds to boost the device performance of SMOSCs.
