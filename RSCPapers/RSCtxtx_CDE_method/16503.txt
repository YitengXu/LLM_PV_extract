A fused heptacyclic electron acceptor, ITIC5, based on a benzodi(cyclopentadithiophene) core flanked by thiophene-fused termini, is designed, synthesized, and compared with its benzene-fused analogue, ITIC1. ITIC5 with thiophene-fused termini exhibits a narrower optical band gap, stronger and redshifted absorption, and higher electron mobility than ITIC1. The active layer consisting of a wide-bandgap polymer donor J71 and ITIC5 exhibits a smaller acceptor domain, stronger crystallinity, and higher and more balanced mobilities than its J71:ITIC1 counterpart, contributing to efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. J71:ITIC5 based organic solar cells exhibit a high fill factor of 75.5% and a champion power conversion efficiency of 12.5%, a nearly 40% boost in efficiency with respect to the ITIC1-based control device, suggesting that the thiophene-fused end group has great potential for constructing high-performance fused-ring electron acceptors.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) have unique advantages, such as low cost, light weight, abundant raw materials, environmental friendliness, and easy fabrication into semitransparent, flexible and large-area devices, and are attracting considerable attention from academia and industry. The active layer of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs consists of electron donors and electron acceptors. For a long time, fullerene derivatives have been prevailing electron acceptor materials, due to their favorable qualities such as large electron affinity, high electron mobility, and isotropic charge transport. However, fullerenes suffer from some shortcomings, such as limited tunability of chemical structures and electron affinities, weak absorption in the visible region, and thermal instability and photochemical instability. Therefore, there is a growing trend in developing nonfullerene acceptors in the OSC research field.

In 2015, we proposed the concept of fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) and reported a series of FREAs, including the well-known molecule, ITIC. Typically, FREAs consist of two strongly π-electron-withdrawing end groups linked by an electron-donating fused-ring core, which is substituted with side chains projecting above or below the plane. The end groups of FREAs can increase electron affinity by downshifting the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, improve electron transport by facilitating strong π–π stacking, and broaden the absorption spectrum by facilitating intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) when linked with the electron-donating fused-ring core. Previously reported end groups of FREAs include benzotriazole–rhodanine, benzothiadiazole–rhodanine, perylene diimide, 2-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-ylmethylene)malononitrile, and 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (INCN), and its fluorine, chlorine, methyl, methoxy, thiophene, and naphthalene derivatives. However, only INCN and fluorinated INCN end groups are widely used in FREAs.
FREAs based on a benzodi(cyclopentadithiophene) (FBDT) core and INCN end groups exhibit power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 11.0%, which is further improved to 12.12% using fluorinated INCN termini. These studies demonstrate the potential of the FBDT core in constructing high-performance FREAs. However, OSCs based on these FREAs usually exhibit relatively low fill factors (FFs). Yang et al. synthesized ITCPTC by replacing benzene with thiophene in the INCN end groups of ITIC. The introduction of thiophene increases intermolecular interactions, crystallization, and electron mobility, and thus effectively improves the FF from 63.4% to 75.1%. Herein, to improve the FF of FBDT based FREAs, we design and synthesize a new FREA, ITIC5 (Scheme 1), by replacing benzene-fused end groups of ITIC1 with thiophene-fused end groups. ITIC5 exhibits a narrower optical band gap, red-shifted and stronger absorption and higher electron mobility than ITIC1. The OSC based on ITIC5 and a wide-bandgap polymer donor J71 exhibits a FF of 75.5% and a champion PCE of 12.5%, much higher than those of J71:ITIC1 (FF = 62.0%, PCE = 8.99%).

The synthetic route to ITIC5 is illustrated in Scheme S1. ITIC5 was characterized by mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis (see the ESI). ITIC5 has good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene at room temperature. ITIC5 has excellent thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of 346 °C (Fig. S1).

The normalized optical absorption spectra of ITIC1 and ITIC5 in chloroform solution (10−6 M) and thin film are shown in Fig. 1a. These two compounds exhibit strong and broad absorption ranging from 550 to 850 nm. ITIC1 shows an absorption maximum at 702 nm with an extinction coefficient of 1.5 × 105 M−1 cm−1 in solution, while ITIC5 shows a redshifted maximum at 718 nm with a higher extinction coefficient of 1.9 × 105 M−1 cm−1 in solution. ITIC1 and ITIC5 exhibit redshifted absorption spectra in the thin film than in solution, with maxima of 734 and 744 nm, respectively. The optical bandgaps of ITIC1 and ITIC5 estimated from the absorption edge of the thin film are 1.55 and 1.53 eV, respectively (Table 1).

The electrochemical properties of ITIC1 and ITIC5 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) with films on a glassy carbon working electrode in 0.1 M [nBu4N]+[PF6]− CH3CN solution at a potential scan rate of 100 mV s−1 (Fig. 1b). ITIC1 and ITIC5 exhibit irreversible reduction waves and oxidation waves. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO energy levels (Table 1) are estimated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively, assuming the absolute energy level of FeCp2+/0 to be 4.8 eV below vacuum (oxidation potential of FeCp2+/0vs. Ag/AgCl was measured to be 0.45 V). Compared with ITIC1, ITIC5 exhibits the same HOMO (−5.48 eV) and a 0.09 eV lower LUMO (−3.95 eV).
The electron mobilities of ITIC1 and ITIC5 were measured by employing the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with a device structure of Al/ITIC1 or ITIC5/Al (Fig. S2). ITIC5 exhibits an electron mobility (μe) of 1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, higher than that of ITIC1 (9.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).

The previously reported wide-bandgap (1.96 eV) polymer donor J71 (Scheme 1) exhibits strong absorption from 450 to 600 nm with a film maximum extinction coefficient of 9.6 × 104 cm−1, which is complementary to the absorption spectra of the low-bandgap ITIC1 and ITIC5 (Fig. 1a). The energy levels of J71 (HOMO = −5.40 eV; LUMO = −3.65 eV) match well with those of ITIC1 and ITIC5, beneficial to efficient exciton dissociation, and its deep HOMO energy level is beneficial to high open-circuit voltage (VOC). We fabricated BHJ OSCs with a device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/J71:acceptor/zirconium acetylacetonate (Zracac)/Al. The optimization details of the OSC devices are illustrated in Table S1.Table 2 summarizes the VOC, short-circuit current density (JSC), FF, and PCE of the optimized devices. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best devices are shown in Fig. 2a. The as-cast J71:ITIC1 devices exhibit a VOC of 0.904 V, JSC of 16.08 mA cm−2, FF of 57.9%, and PCE of 8.41%. The as-cast J71:ITIC5 devices exhibit a VOC of 0.900 V, higher JSC of 17.47 mA cm−2, higher FF of 70.0%, and higher PCE of 11.0%, due to the redshifted and enhanced absorption, and higher electron mobility of ITIC5. After thermal annealing at 100 °C for 5 min, the annealed J71:ITIC1 devices show a slightly higher performance (VOC of 0.921 V, JSC of 15.74 mA cm−2, FF of 62.0% and PCE of 8.99%). The annealed J71:ITIC5 devices exhibit an obviously enhanced performance: their JSC and FF improved to 18.48 mA cm−2 and 75.5%, respectively, leading to an increased PCE of 12.5%.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimized devices exhibit a broad photoresponse from 300 to 850 nm (Fig. 2b). The photoresponse from 300 to 600 nm is mainly contributed by J71, while the photoresponse from 600 to 850 nm is mainly ascribed to the acceptors. The EQE maxima of the as-cast J71:ITIC1, annealed J71:ITIC1, as-cast J71:ITIC5, and annealed J71:ITIC5 blends are 69.7%, 68.3%, 70.2%, and 71.8%, respectively. The J71:ITIC5 annealed device exhibits a much higher EQE in the 600–850 nm region than the J71:ITIC1 annealed device, which could be ascribed to the red-shifted and stronger absorption of ITIC5. The JSC of the as-cast J71:ITIC1, annealed J71:ITIC1, as-cast J71:ITIC5, and annealed J71:ITIC5 blends calculated from integration of the EQE spectra with the AM 1.5G reference spectrum is 16.19, 15.80, 17.20, and 18.25 mA cm−2, respectively, consistent with JSC values measured from the J–V curves (the error is <5%, Table 2).
We measured the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) to investigate the charge generation and extraction properties (Fig. 2c). At a high Veff of 3 V, all the photogenerated excitons are assumed to be dissociated into free charge carriers and collected by electrodes. Under this condition, the saturation photocurrent density (Jsat) is only limited by the total amount of absorbed incident photons, and the value of JSC/Jsat characterizes the charge extraction under short-circuit conditions. J71:ITIC5 exhibits a higher Jsat than the J71:ITIC1 blend, ascribed to the red-shifted and stronger absorption of ITIC5. The values of JSC/Jsat of the as-cast J71:ITIC1, annealed J71:ITIC1, as-cast J71:ITIC5, and annealed J71:ITIC5 blends are 92%, 92%, 95% and 97%, respectively, indicating more efficient charge extraction in the annealed J71:ITIC5 blend.
The hole and electron mobilities of the blend films were measured by the SCLC method with device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/J71:acceptor/Au (Fig. S3a) and Al/J71:acceptor/Al (Fig. S3b), respectively. The as-cast J71:ITIC1 blend exhibits a hole mobility (μh) of 2.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a μe of 2.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1; the as-cast J71:ITIC5 blend exhibits a μh of 3.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a μe of 4.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. After thermal annealing, the J71:ITIC1 blend exhibits a higher μh of 3.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a higher μe of 2.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. As for the annealed J71:ITIC5 film, the μh and μe increase to 7.5 × 10−4 and 8.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Table 2). The low and unbalanced charge mobilities (μh/μe = 7.1) of the as-cast J71:ITIC1 blend account for the low FF (57.9%) of its corresponding device, while the high and balanced charge mobilities (μh/μe = 0.9) of the annealed J71:ITIC5 blend contribute to the efficient charge extraction and high FF of 75.5%.

The morphology of the blend films was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS). From the AFM height images illustrated in Fig. S4a–d, the root-mean-square roughness (Rq) values of the as-cast J71:ITIC1 and as-cast J71:ITIC5 blends are 1.37 and 0.92 nm, respectively. Thermal annealing slightly decreases the Rq of the J71:ITIC1 film to 1.18 nm, whereas it slightly increases that of the J71:ITIC5 film to 1.03 nm. All active layers display smooth and uniform surfaces, indicating that there are no large aggregates or pinholes. As seen in the TEM images, J71:ITIC5 films present dense and continuous networks, relative to J71:ITIC1 films (Fig. S4e–h).

GIWAXS and GISAXS measurements were carried out to examine the molecular packing and nanoscale phase separation of these thin films (Fig. 3, 4, and S5).Fig. 3 presents two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns of the J71:ITIC1 (as-cast and annealed) and J71:ITIC5 (as-cast and annealed) blend films and the corresponding intensity profiles along in-plane and out-of-plane directions. Both systems exhibit similar scattering patterns with the lamellar peaks concentrated in the in-plane direction (qr ≈ 0.31 Å−1, d ≈ 20 Å) and the π–π peaks concentrated in the out-of-plane direction (qz ≈ 1.7 Å−1, d ≈ 3.7 Å). They all exhibit a preferential face-on orientation, which is beneficial to vertical charge transport. After thermal annealing, the crystallinity of the J71:ITIC1 blend film is barely changed. In contrast, the crystallinity of the J71:ITIC5 blend film is significantly enhanced, as reflected by the great increase of the scattering intensity. The enhanced crystallinity of the annealed J71:ITIC5 blend film contributes to the higher mobilities and FF. This is in agreement with the relatively larger improvement in the device performance of the annealed J71:ITIC5 device.

Fig. 4 presents the 2D GISAXS patterns and the in-plane intensity profiles with the best fittings of the above blends. Pure films of ITIC1 and ITIC5 show quite different GISAXS intensity profiles (Fig. S5). While the profile of the pure ITIC1 film possesses an obvious shoulder at q ≈ 0.01 Å−1, indicating a pronounced aggregation on the length scale of ∼60 nm, the profile of pure ITIC5 does not have such a feature. These blend films manifest similar scattering profiles to their corresponding acceptors. We adopt the Debye–Anderson–Brumberger (DAB) model and a fractal-like network model to account for the scattering contribution from intermixed amorphous phases and acceptor domains, respectively. The correlation lengths of the intermixed phase of the as-cast J71:ITIC1, annealed J71:ITIC1, as-cast J71:ITIC5, and annealed J71:ITIC5 are 1.1, 1.4, 40 and 39 nm, respectively. The fitted acceptor domain sizes (2Rg) are 40, 43, 8.1 and 8.3 nm, respectively. There is little influence of annealing on the domain sizes. However, the domain size of ITIC5 is closer to the exciton diffusion length than that of ITIC1, facilitating charge separation and thus contributing to a higher device performance as observed. The obtained smaller acceptor domain sizes are consistent with the dense and continuous network of donor phases (J71) observed in the TEM images.

In summary, we design and synthesize a new FREA, ITIC5, by replacing benzene with thiophene in the INCN end groups of ITIC1, and investigate the effects of thiophene-fused and benzene-fused termini on energy levels, optical properties, charge transport, morphology and photovoltaic performance. ITIC5 with thiophene-fused termini exhibits a narrower optical band gap, redshifted and stronger absorption, and higher electron mobility than its benzene-fused analogue, ITIC1. The J71:ITIC5 blend exhibits a smaller acceptor domain and higher crystallinity than the J71:ITIC1 blend. The OSC based on the J71:ITIC5 blend exhibits a FF of 75.5% and a PCE of 12.5%, much higher than those of the J71:ITIC1 blend (FF = 62.0%, PCE = 8.99%). The redshifted and stronger absorption of ITIC5 is beneficial to higher JSC; the higher electron mobility of ITIC5 and more balanced charge transport are beneficial to a higher FF; meanwhile, the smaller acceptor domain size and stronger crystallinity of the J71:ITIC5 blend also facilitate enhancement in the JSC and FF. The higher JSC and FF result in a much higher PCE in the J71:ITIC5 blend. Our results demonstrate that the thiophene-fused end group has great potential for constructing high-performance fused-ring electron acceptors.
