In recent years, great progress has been achieved in improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the stability of PSCs is still an obstacle in their commercialization due to the limitation of efficient and stable hole transport materials. Herein, we demonstrate an alcohol-solution-based low-temperature-processed vanadium oxide (VOx) hole transport layer (HTL) for planar heterojunction PSCs. The good crystallinity and morphology of CH3NH3PbI3 grown on this amorphous VOx film is investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. Due to the suitable and matching energy levels of VOx and CH3NH3PbI3, the holes generated in CH3NH3PbI3 can efficiently transfer to VOx HTL. Furthermore, VOx-HTL-based PSCs yield a PCE value of 14.5% with better stability in comparison with PEDOT:PSS-HTL-based PSCs. These results reveal that the low-temperature-processed VOx films can be employed as the HTL for efficient and stable PSCs.

Due to the unique properties of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials, such as high carrier mobility, low exciton binding energy, and high light absorption coefficient, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become the research focus in the solar cell field during the past several years since they were first reported in 2009. Based on the contributions from materials optimization and device engineering, rapid progress in bettering the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been achieved for PSCs, from the initially reported 3.8% to the currently certified 22.7%, which is even higher than those of multicrystalline silicon (22.3%), CIGS (22.6%), and CdTe (22.1%) solar cells.

The first all-solid-state PSC was demonstrated by the Park's group, where methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) nanoparticles were used as the light harvester, mesoporous TiO2 functioned as the electron transport layer (ETL), and spiro-OMeTAD worked as the hole transport layer (HTL). Spiro-OMeTAD HTLs were widely adopted in n–i–p-structured PSCs for later studies. In addition to spiro-OMeTAD, inorganic HTL materials were also developed for n–i–p-structured PSCs. Meanwhile, in p–i–n-structured planar PSCs, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was widely used as the HTL due to its high work function (about 5.0 eV), high transparency, and good wettability with a perovskite layer. The performance of PEDOT:PSS-HTL-based PSCs was continuously optimized by doping with PEDOT:PSS or introducing an interlayer at the interface of the PEDOT:PSS/electrode or PEDOT:PSS/perovskite. However, the acidic and hygroscopic properties of PEDOT:PSS are still harmful for the long-term stability of PSCs. Therefore, the use of metal oxide semiconductors with good stability as charge transport layers seems to be a good solution to resolve this problem.
In PSCs, high work function metal oxide semiconductors like NiO, MoOx, WOx, VOx, and some binary metal cation oxides have been successfully utilized as HTLs. Among them, VOx has drawn considerable attention due to its cost-effective characteristic and superior chemical and thermal stabilities. Solution-processed V2O5 was firstly introduced as the HTL in planar PSCs; however, a high annealing temperature (up to 500 °C) was needed to transform the vanadium oxytriisopropoxide precursor into V2O5. A lower post-annealing temperature of 300 °C has been tried by Xiao et al. to prepare VOx HTL via vanadium oxytriisopropoxide; however, the device's performance was not satisfactory due to its limited crystallinity. An even lower thermal annealing temperature of 210 °C was proposed by Yao et al. to obtain a VOx thin film via metavanadate solution; unfortunately, only 10.47 ± 0.92% PCE can be achieved for VOx-based PSCs due to serious charge carrier recombinations. Furthermore, these annealing temperatures (201–500 °C) are much higher than the heat resistance temperature of commonly used flexible plastic substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET, 120 °C) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN, 175 °C). This significantly restricts the choice of possible substrates, thereby limiting their large-scale roll-to-roll fabrication. To decrease the annealing temperature, VOx sols were prepared by a melt quenching process (V2O5 powder was heated up to 800 °C to form molten liquid) and used as the HTL in planar p–i–n-structured PSCs. Although the annealing temperature of VOx sols can be decreased to 150 °C, the synthesis procedure of VOx sols is very complicated and time-consuming. Recently, VOx/PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS/VOx bilayer HTLs have been reported that can further modify the substrate morphology and enhance performance; however, the devices still use acidic and hygroscopic PEDOT:PSS, which could lead to significant device degradation in the long term.
In this work, we present a solution-processed VOx HTL on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes to replace PEDOT:PSS for improving the stability of planar p–i–n-structured PSCs. VOx HTL can be simply prepared by spin-coating a vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) ethanol solution on the FTO electrode, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 20 min: no sol–gel synthesis and post-aging procedures are needed, which is fairly compatible with flexible plastic substrates and roll-to-roll fabrication methods. Furthermore, VOx HTL is highly transparent in the visible range and exhibits effective hole-transport properties. VOx HTL demonstrates a high work function according to the ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometer (UPS) analysis, which can guarantee that the energy level matches with the CH3NH3PbI3 layer, ensuring effective hole transfer from CH3NH3PbI3 to VOx. A promising and stable PCE value of 14.5% has been achieved for VOx-HTL-based PSCs, which is comparable to that of PEDOT:PSS-HTL-based devices. Moreover, VOx-HTL-based PSCs show much better stability that PEDOT:PSS-HTL-based control devices. The unencapsulated device with VOx HTL retains 65.7% of the initial PCE after aging in an ambient atmosphere with relative humidity (RH) of 25% for 500 h, while the control device with PEDOT:PSS HTL only retains 42.2% of its initial PCE.

Vanadyl (V) acetylacetonate was purchased from Alfa Aesar. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI 4083) was purchased from H. C. Stark. PbI2 and CH3NH3I were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was bought from Solarmer. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.7%+), chlorobenzene (CB, extra dry, 99.8%), ethanol (extra dry, 99.5%), and isopropanol (extra dry, 99.5%) were purchased from Acros.


FTO glass was patterned by the reaction of concentrated hydrochloric acid and zinc powder. Patterned FTO glass was washed twice in detergent, water, deionized water, and ethanol. Cleaned FTO was dried with nitrogen and then treated with UVO for 15 min. VO(acac)2 was dissolved in ethanol and stirred overnight to obtain VOx precursors. These VOx precursors were spin-coated onto the FTO at 2000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 150 °C for 20 min to obtain VOx films. Then, the samples were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glovebox for CH3NH3PbI3 film preparation. The PbI2/DMF (1 M) solution was spin-coated onto a VOx-HTL-modified substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min to form a PbI2 film. A 50 mg mL−1 CH3NH3I/isopropanol solution was spin-coated onto another clean FTO glass with 3000 rpm for 20 s to obtain CH3NH3I films. Subsequently, the two substrates were clamped face to face with a thin hollow aluminum foil gasket for the growth of CH3NH3PbI3 films using the simplified close space sublimation method. After that, the PCBM ETL was deposited onto the CH3NH3PbI3 layer by spin-coating a 30 mg mL−1 PCBM/CB solution at 2000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 100 nm Al electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation under pressure of 3 × 10−4 Pa.


The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UPS tests were performed by ESCALab 250Xi multifunction electronic spectrometer. The VOx film for XPS and UPS tests were deposited onto the ITO substrate and was excited by an Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray source and a He I (21.2 eV) ultraviolet light source, respectively. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of perovskite films were obtained by HITACHI S4800. The crystal structures of VOx and CH3NH3PbI3 were measured by a D8 Advance (Bruker) diffractometer with an X-ray tube for Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskite layer deposited on different substrates were recorded by a FluoroLog-3 Modular spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Scientific) with excitation at a wavelength of 500 nm. The time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra of the samples were obtained by a steady/transient-state fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments), and the samples were excited by a 485 nm laser and the emission light was detected at 770 nm. The intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS: light source is a 625 nm light-emitting diode) measurements are used to determine the electron lifetime with a ModuLab XM system (Ametek, Solartron Analytical, Beijing). The optical microscope images of PEDOT:PSS and VOx HTL were obtained by OLYMPUS DSX-500. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured by Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2), and the scanning speed in the J–V test was 100 mV s−1. Simulated sunlight was provided by SAN-EI (AAA grade) solar simulator and calibrated with a standard Si solar cell. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was performed using QE-R solar quantum efficiency measurements (Taiwan Enli Tech. Co. Ltd). The active area for J–V and EQE tests is 4 mm2.


The hole mobility measurement of VOx was performed using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method. The hole mobility was calculated by the SCLC method by using the following equation:

(1)
where
ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, ε is the relative dielectric constant (assume ε = 3), β is the Poole–Frankel factor, and L is the thickness of VOx. Eqn (1) can be converted into the following:

(2)
Then, the curve in
Fig. 2a was plotted by taking  as the x-axis and  as the y-axis. The fitted line denotes the intercept, and hole mobility was calculated from the intercept of the corresponding lines on the axis of .


The composition of the obtained VOx film from VO(acac)2 was investigated by XPS measurements, as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1a shows the characteristic peaks of V, C, and O in the binding energy range of 0–1000 eV. Fig. 1b shows the O 1s, V 2p1/2, and V 2p3/2 peaks of the VOx film. Each peak of V 2p1/2 and V 2p3/2 can be effectively fitted with the two peaks, implying that V is in two different oxidation states. The peaks of V 2p1/2 at 523.7 eV and V 2p3/2 at 516.3 eV correspond to the 2p doublets of V4+, and the two peaks at the binding energies of 524.8 and 517.2 eV belong to V5+. This result indicates that the V in the VOx film has both V4+ and V5+ oxidation states and the atomic ratio of V5+:V4+ is 2.65:1. The XPS peak of O 1s can be divided into two peaks with binding energies of 530.2 eV and 531.2 eV. According to the NIST XPS database, the XPS peaks of V2O5 and V2O4 corresponding to V5+ and V4+ in VOx are in the range of 529.8–530.6 eV. Therefore, the peak of O 1s at 530.2 eV belongs to VOx, while the peak at 531.2 eV may correspond to H2O from air.

In order to verify the feasibility of VOx as the HTL in PSCs, the hole mobility of VOx thin films was measured by the SCLC method. The current–voltage data of a single-hole device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS (35 nm)/VOx (80 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm)) are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI). The hole mobility of the VOx thin film is calculated to be 1.29 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is in the same order as the PEDOT:PSS 4083 (4.34 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), indicating that the low-temperature-processed VOx film exhibits good hole-transport properties. Besides hole mobility, as the HTL for PSCs, the work function of VOx is another factor that should be taken into consideration. Hence, the energy level of VOx was detected by UPS and the complete view of the UPS spectra is plotted in Fig. S2 (ESI). As shown in Fig. 2a, the secondary electron cut-off edge and injection barrier of VOx are 16.17 and 0.8 eV, respectively. According to the binding energy of He I low-energy photon source (21.22 eV), the work function of VOx is calculated as 5.05 eV. Fig. 2b shows the transmittance of VOx and PEDOT:PSS films on the FTO substrate. The FTO/VOx film shows almost the same transmittance as pristine FTO, and the transmittance of the VOx film is higher than the PEDOT:PSS film in the range of 610–800 nm. Because of the high transmittance of the VOx film in the visible range, VOx HTL is suitable for p–i–n-type PSCs. The p–i–n-type planar PSC with the FTO/VOx/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/Al structure is shown in Fig. 2c. Fig. 2d shows the energy levels of the different layers in the PSCs. The energy levels of VOx are measured by UPS and those of the other layers are cited from the literature. The work function of VOx is slightly higher than the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of CH3NH3PbI3, which helps to form a good ohmic contact between the interfaces of VOx and perovskite film.
Since the HTL functions as the substrate during the preparation of the upper perovskite film in p–i–n-type PSCs, the HTL should have good wettability with the solvent (namely, DMF) of the perovskite precursor, as investigated by the contact angle test. The contact angles of DMF on PEDOT:PSS and VOx films are 9.5° and 4.3° (Fig. 3a and b), respectively, indicating that both PEDOT:PSS and VOx have good wettability to DMF. This is beneficial in perovskite film preparation. In PSCs, the morphology and crystal quality of the perovskite film is critical for high-performance PSCs. Therefore, we investigate the morphology and crystallization of CH3NH3PbI3 films grown on PEDOT:PSS and VOx substrates by SEM and XRD tests, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3c and d, the morphologies of CH3NH3PbI3 film deposited on PEDOT:PSS and VOx substrates show marginal differences with regard to grain size and surface topography. The CH3NH3PbI3 film grown on the VOx substrate has good compactness and there are no obvious pinholes and gaps in the CH3NH3PbI3 film. The cross-sectional SEM image of the FTO/VOx/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM structure is shown in Fig. 3e. Further, there is no gap between the crystal grains of CH3NH3PbI3 in the cross-sectional view, demonstrating the compactness of the film. Fig. 3f shows the XRD patterns of the FTO, FTO/VOx, FTO/VOx/CH3NH3PbI3, and FTO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3 samples. Evidently, the 2θ angle of the diffraction peak in the XRD patterns for FTO and FTO/VOx are the same, and there is no peak corresponding to the polycrystalline structure of V2O5. The XRD results indicate that the low-temperature-processed VOx in this work is an amorphous structure. The strong diffraction peaks at 14.3°, 28.6°, 32.0°, and 40.8° in the FTO/VOx/CH3NH3PbI3 and FTO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3 samples belong to the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. The strong diffraction peaks reflect the excellent crystallization of the perovskite. Meanwhile, the XRD diffraction peaks in FTO/VOx/CH3NH3PbI3 and FTO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3 are similar with regard to intensity and position, indicating the similar crystallinity characteristics of CH3NH3PbI3 on both VOx and PEDOT:PSS HTL substrates. The XRD results are consistent with the similar grain size and morphology exhibited in the SEM images. Thus, from the SEM and XRD tests, it can be concluded that the quality of the CH3NH3PbI3 film on the VOx HTL is comparable to that on the PEDOT:PSS HTL.
After ensuring the quality of the perovskite film, the effective charge transfer between the perovskite and HTL should be considered during the preparation of PSCs. To characterize the charge transportation between the perovskite and HTL, the steady-state PL and TRPL spectra of CH3NH3PbI3, PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3, and VOx/CH3NH3PbI3 films are measured. As shown in Fig. 4a, the monolayer CH3NH3PbI3 thin film prepared on a quartz substrate shows a strong perovskite emission peak, while the perovskite fluorescence in PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3 and VOx/CH3NH3PbI3 thin films is significantly quenched, indicating efficient charge transfer between CH3NH3PbI3 and HTL. Moreover, the emission peak of PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3 is lower than that of VOx/CH3NH3PbI3, indicating that the charge transport between the perovskite and PEDOT:PSS is faster, which may be attributed to the fact that the hole mobility of PEDOT:PSS (4.34 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) is slightly higher than that of VOx (1.29 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). The TRPL data in Fig. 4b also reveals the same information. The fluorescence of CH3NH3PbI3 is significantly quenched when a HTL is inserted between CH3NH3PbI3 and the quartz substrate. Fitting the TRPL decay curves with a biexponential function, the average PL lifetime for CH3NH3PbI3, PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3, and VOx/CH3NH3PbI3 are calculated as 170.94, 6.84, and 8.20 ns, respectively (detailed fitting parameters are listed in Table S1, ESI). The PL lifetime of VOx/CH3NH3PbI3 is slightly longer than that of PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3, which is consistent with the information displayed in the steady-state PL test.
As HTL for PSCs, the thickness of VOx plays an important role in improving the device performance. Therefore, the optimization of VOx HTL thickness is necessary. VOx HTLs with different thicknesses are obtained by spin-coating a VO(acac)2 precursor solution at different concentrations (3, 5, 8, and 10 mg mL−1). The J–V curves of PSCs based on different thicknesses of the VOx layer are shown in Fig. 5a. The best performance is obtained when the concentration of VO(acac)2 precursor is 5 mg mL−1. When the concentration of the VO(acac)2 precursor decreased to 3 mg mL−1, the voltage and fill factor of the device are reduced. This is because a very thin VOx layer cannot completely cover the FTO surface, resulting in a direct contact between the FTO and the perovskite. However, the worse performance of the device with thicker VOx layers (8 and 10 mg mL−1) may be caused by the fact that the internal resistance of the device and optical loss increase as the thickness of the HTL increases. Then, the concentration of VO(acac)2 is fixed at 5 mg mL−1 during further optimization of the device performance. The J–V curves of optimized PSCs based on VOx and PEDOT:PSS HTL are shown in Fig. 5b. The detailed photovoltaic performance parameters of PSCs based on PEDOT:PSS and VOx HTL are listed in Table 1. The PSCs based on VOx HTL yield a PCE value of 14.50% at reverse scan with short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.30 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.96 V, and fill factor (FF) of 74.07%. For forward scan, the PCE, Jsc, Voc, and FF values are 14.01%, 20.21 mA cm−2, 0.97 V, and 71.73%, respectively. The reverse and forward scans show marginal hysteresis. However, the control PSCs based on PEDOT:PSS HTL demonstrate a PCE value of 16.26% in the reverse scan and 15.53% in the forward scan. Fig. 5c shows the EQE curves and integrated current density (Jint) of the PSCs based on PEDOT:PSS and VOx HTL. Both PSCs display high EQE in the wavelength range of 350–750 nm, and the Jint value obtained from the EQE curves of PEDOT:PSS and VOx HTL PSCs are 18.95 and 18.78 mA cm−2, respectively. The J–V and EQE tests’ performance of PEDOT:PSS HTL PSCs is marginally better that that of VOx HTL PSCs. One of the reasons for this is that the charge transfer between PEDOT:PSS and CH3NH3PbI3 is faster than that between VOx and CH3NH3PbI3, according to the PL and TRPL measurements. Besides, the larger series resistance of the VOx HTL device (6.01 Ω cm2) than that of the PEDOT:PSS HTL device (3.52 Ω cm2) also leads to a performance decrease.

According to the energy levels shown in Fig. 2d, the energy difference between the VOx's work function (−5.05 eV) and the CH3NH3PbI3's HOMO level (−5.4 eV) is less than that between the PEDOT:PSS's work function (−5.0 eV) and CH3NH3PbI3's HOMO level (−5.4 eV), implying that the charge transportation should be improved for VOx-HTL-based PSCs. However, the Voc and Jsc values of VOx HTL devices do not show any increase. In PSCs, the Voc and FF values are considerably influenced by the electron recombination at the interface between the perovskite and charge transport layer. To investigate the reason for the Voc loss of VOx HTL PSCs, the electron lifetimes of PSCs are measured using intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS). The samples are illuminated with a 625 nm laser source and the light intensity is increased from 10 to 80 mW cm−2. The IMVS Nyquist plots of the PSCs with PEDOT:PSS and VOx HTL are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI) and the obtained electron lifetimes of the samples are shown in Fig. 5d. The electron lifetime (τn) is calculated using the equation τn = 1/(2πfn,max), where fn,max is the frequency of the maximum semicircle in the IMVS Nyquist plot. As shown in Fig. 5d, the electron lifetime of PSCs with PEDOT:PSS HTL is longer than that of PSCs with VOx HTL. It has been reported that a longer electron lifetime implies a slower interfacial recombination rate. These results demonstrate that the interfacial recombination rate of perovskite/VOx is higher than that of perovskite/PEDOT:PSS, which leads to a decrease in the Voc and FF values of VOx HTL devices. The Jsc value does not show the same trend in improvement: the hole mobility of VOx being slightly lower than that of PEDOT:PSS can be one of the reasons. In addition, in the range of 300–800 nm, the average transmittance of VOx is lower than that of PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 2b), which also has a negative influence on Jsc improvement. This reason can also be verified by the EQE results. As compared to the EQE of PEDOT:PSS HTL PSCs, the EQE of VOx HTL PSCs is higher in the range of 630–750 nm and lower in the range of 300–630 nm, which is corresponding to the transmittance trend.
Although the PCE value of the VOx-HTL-based device is slightly lower than that of the PEDOT:PSS-HTL-based device, the VOx-HTL-based PSCs exhibit better stability. The unencapsulated PSC samples for the stability test are put in a dark environment with RH of about 25%. As shown in Fig. 6, after aging for 500 h, the PCE value of PSC based on PEDOT:PSS HTL decays to 42.2% of the initial PCE, while the PSC based on VOx HTL still retains 65.7% of the initial PCE. The Jsc, Voc, and FF values of VOx HTL devices decrease more slowly with increasing aging time. Because the acidity of PEDOT:PSS may damage the FTO electrode, a much faster decline in the PCE can be observed for PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs. Meanwhile, the hygroscopic properties of PEDOT:PSS can also degrade the perovskite layer. As compared to PEDOT:PSS, the VOx film is less sensitive to water. As shown in Fig. 7, the surface morphology changes of VOx and PEDOT:PSS films are recorded by an optical microscope. Pristine PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 7a) and VOx (Fig. 7b) films are dense and there are no obvious holes observed in their optical microscope images. After putting in air for one week (RH: around 25%), many holes appear in the PEDOT:PSS film (Fig. 7c). Although a small number of voids can be seen in the VOx film (Fig. 3d), they are much fewer than those in the PEDOT:PSS film. When placing the films in a more humid environment (RH: 70–80%) for 1 day, the morphology of PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 7e) and VOx (Fig. 7f) films exhibit a distinct difference. There was no obvious change in the morphology of the VOx film, except for the presence of several voids. However, from the image in Fig. 7e, we observe that the PEDOT:PSS is completely destroyed. Therefore, it can be concluded that VOx is much more stable than PEDOT:PSS, which is beneficial in improving the stability of PSCs.

In conclusion, we demonstrate a low-temperature alcohol-solution-processed VOx film as the HTL for PSCs. According to the XPS analysis, both V5+ and V4+ existed in the low-temperature-annealed VOx film. The work function of VOx is 5.05 eV according to the UPS test, which can form a good ohmic contact with CH3NH3PbI3 and ensure holes transfer from the CH3NH3PbI3 to VOx layers. The results of the PL and TRPL tests also demonstrated the efficient charge transportation between the CH3NH3PbI3 and VOx films. At the same time, the CH3NH3PbI3 films deposited on VOx and PEDOT:PSS HTL substrates exhibit similar morphology and crystallinity properties. The VOx-HTL-based p–i–n-type planar PSCs achieve a PCE value of 14.5% with better stability than PEDOT:PSS-HTL-based devices due to the better stability of VOx. Unencapsulated PSCs with VOx HTL retain 65.7% of the initial PCE after aging for 500 h in ambient environment (RH: ∼25%). Taking into account the good PCE performance and better stability of VOx-HTL-based devices, this low-temperature-processed VOx film can prove to be a suitable candidate as the HTL for efficient and stable PSCs.
