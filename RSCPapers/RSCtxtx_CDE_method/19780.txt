In the present study, a novel solution-processable 1,6,7,10-tetramethylfluoranthene (1), as the smallest fragment of fullerene, is synthesized and systematically studied for use as a non-fullerene acceptor in an organic solar cell (OSC). Molecule 1 has the potential to be synthesized on a large scale. Optical and electrochemical studies revealed that 1 has a high absorption range and an appropriate band gap, which is compatible with poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) as a donor. The morphology showed high intermixed blend with uniform distribution of donor–acceptor molecules. Steady state and time resolved photoluminescence studies showed efficient charge separation from the donor and acceptor. These studies can be confirmed by the conventional OSC device structure employing a blend of P3HT:1, which gives a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 0.71% with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.52 V and a fill factor (FF) of 44.89%. Despite this, the significant stability of the device, even after 60 h in open air, demonstrates that this molecule shows promising output and the result can be enhanced in the future with further optimization.

The development of organic solar cells (OSCs) has been receiving significant attention due to their advantages such as solution-based processability, flexibility of substrates, light weight fabrication of devices, easy deposition methods, environmentally friendly nature, low cost and promise as a technological candidate for commercialization. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the organic solar cell has been reported to be up to 11%. An increased efficiency has been achieved by the development of novel efficient donor–acceptor materials with structural and morphological modifications and the optimization of fabrication processes, such as donor–acceptor blend ratios, solvent/thermal annealing and the thickness of the active layer. For several decades, conjugated polymers have been a widely studied topic of research with their enhanced properties and gradual increase in functionality. A recent study shows that the development of small organic molecules as donors and acceptors is due to its advantages such as high purity and decisive molecular weights compared to conjugated polymers. In the solution-processed bulk heterojunction solar cell, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) are considered to be model and dominant acceptors due to their high electron affinity and high electron mobility. A higher efficiency of OSCs has been attained due to the development of solution-processed small molecules as donors and fullerene/non-fullerene as acceptors. Shortcomings such as low absorption intensity in the visible region, high synthetic cost, morphological instability in thin films and low tuning ability of the present fullerene derivatives, make them less competitive than other non-fullerene acceptors.

The non-fullerene acceptors have demonstrated improved PCE from 5% to 9% in the last few years. The search for novel small molecule acceptors has been performed to achieve properties such as good absorption in the visible region, low cost, easy synthetic processes, simple purification methods and modifiable frontier molecular orbital energy levels to improve charge transfer. Significant research has been carried out on the synthesis of small molecules as an acceptor for high efficiency solution processed OSCs such as diketopyrollopyrole, benzothiazole, perylene diimides, naphthodithiophene diimide, carbazole, quinacridone and pentacene derivatives. Owing to the development of non-fullerene acceptors, other molecules are being substituted to fine tune the optical and electrical properties of existing molecules. Corannulene, being a fragment of fullerene, has also been incorporated in OSC. Among non-fullerene molecules, fluoranthene-based acceptor molecules are currently being studied to better understand their properties, such as tuned band gap, high quantum yields, longer lifetime electrochemical stability and simple functionalization, for their use in OSCs, organic light emitting diodes (OLED's) and as solid state emitters. Recently, a fluoranthene fused imide derivative as non-fullerene acceptors has been reported by Wang and Pie et al. with a PCE of 2.11–2.9%. These derivatives have been synthesized by substituting different electron withdrawing groups with a fine tuning of the LUMO energy levels.
In this article, the synthesis of 1,6,7,10-tetramethylfluoranthene (1) with a broad absorption range, better carrier lifetime and significant device stability has been carried out. Fluoranthene derivative 1 is the smallest fragment of fullerene and is expected to show similar properties and functionality to fullerene due to the resemblance in their electronic spectra. The π-conjugation of the molecular backbone of 1 is expected to promote a broad absorption range in the UV-Visible region. The impact of the symmetrically increased amount of 1 in the P3HT:1 blend has been investigated by measuring the optical properties by UV-visible spectroscopy and the photo-physical properties by steady state and time resolved optical spectroscopy. The fabricated device shows photovoltaic potential with high stability. This may help give a better understanding of the functional properties of 1 and open a new window towards the use of this novel non-fullerene acceptor in OSC with further optimization.

All reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of nitrogen in oven dried glassware with magnetic stirring. All chemicals were purchased from Merck, Aldrich, Loba and SD Fine. Diethyl ether and dichloromethane were freshly distilled by sodium/benzophenone and potassium carbonate, respectively, and stored under a molecular sieve of 4 Å. Other solvents were used as received. 1H and 13C spectra were recorded on an NMR spectrometer (Bruker Avance II; 500 MHz) in CDCl3. Chemical shifts were reported in (δ) units, in parts per million (ppm) downfield from tetramethylsilane. Coupling constants are reported in Hz. FT-IR spectra were measured by a Perkin Elmer Spectrum Two device. Routine monitoring of reactions was performed using thin layer chromatography (TLC) (pre-coated, silica gel 60 plates, Merck). Melting points were determined by a visual melting point apparatus (Lab India) and are uncorrected. Yamazen (Akros-II; ultraflash, 40 μm silica gel columns) flash chromatography systems was used for purification of materials. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a TG 209F1; Libra (NETZSCH). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a Mettler Toledo instrument. High resolution-mass spectrometry (HR-MS) was carried out with liquid chromatography (Waters) and mass spectroscopy (Micromass). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a JOEL, JEM 2100 model.


As shown in Scheme 1, the synthesis of 3a and 3b was carried out as per the reported procedure. Isomers 2a and 2b were synthesized as per the reported procedure with minor modifications. Unlike in the reported procedure, separation of isomers of 3 using Girard's reagent was eliminated and the reaction proceeded with a mixture of isomers to the final stage, where 1 was purified using flash chromatography. Although the synthesis is reported, the reactions are straightforward and demonstrate large-scale preparation of this material. This confers an important advantage over fullerene derivatives and other non-fullerene derivatives reported.



3a and 3b were prepared following the reported procedure. The synthesis of 2a and 2b was carried out using the isomers 3a and 3bin situ by methanolic potassium hydroxide with 3-pentanone by crossed aldol condensation. 2 (2 g) was charged with acetic anhydride (19.4 mL) and 2,5-norbornadiene (2.57 mL) under nitrogen atmosphere and refluxed at 130–140 °C for 3 days in a sealed tube. TLC was used to follow the reaction Rf = 0.7, (petroleum ether). It was then cooled to 20–25 °C and neutralized with a 10% sodium hydroxide solution. The reaction mass was diluted with water (30 mL) and extracted with dichloromethane (15 × 2 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane (15 mL). The combined organic layer was washed with brine (30 mL) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Brown crude was then purified by flash chromatography using petroleum ether as the mobile phase to produce a yellow crystalline solid. (1.02 g, 54%).

Electrochemical measurements were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660D, CH instruments). Herein, a three-electrode system consisting of carbon as the working electrode, platinum mesh as the counter electrode and non-aqueous Ag/Ag+ (saturated with KCl) as a reference electrode. Furthermore, 0.1 M anhydrous tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (NBu4PF6) in acetonitrile (ACN): ortho dichlorobenzene (ODCB) (4:1) was taken as the supporting electrolyte, with a 0.1 mg mL−1 concentration of 1 using a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Ferrocene/ferrocenium was used as a standard for the calibration of potential and for determining the HOMO and LUMO energy levels.


The absorption spectra were measured on a UV-Visible spectrophotometer (Model: UV-VIS 3000+, LabIndia) at room temperature. Photoluminescence was measured by combined steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectrometers (Model: F-900, Edinburgh Instruments).


The samples for UV-Visible spectroscopy and photoluminescence were prepared by dissolving known concentrations of components in ODCB. Moreover, 1, C60 and P3HT solutions were prepared with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1. The different blends were prepared by mixing P3HT and 1 in 1:2, 1:4 and 1:6 ratio concentrations.


The devices were fabricated with the structure: indium tin oxide (ITO)/Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/P3HT:1/Al). For device fabrication, the ITO glass substrates (sheet resistance = 15 Ω □−1) were cleaned by sonicating in soap solution, acetone and isopropanol. Cleaned ITO glasses were then exposed to ultraviolet–ozone irradiation for 20 min. ITO glasses were spin coated with a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (∼40 nm) and dried at 140 °C in air for 20 min. A layer of active layers (P3HT:1) (∼80 nm), with a blend ratio of 1:6 were spin-coated at ∼800 rpm using the solutions (chlorobenzene solvent with 35 mg mL−1) in a glove box. Finally, the Al (∼100 nm) electrode was thermally deposited in high vacuum (∼8 × 10−6 mbar), over the active layer through a shadow mask. The active area of the devices was 1.5 × 1.5 mm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of these devices were measured under a solar simulator (class AAA) with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 with a computer controlled Keithley2420 source meter unit. To measure the current density under illumination, the device was illuminated from the transparent ITO electrode side.


The optical properties of 1 were studied in the range from 280 to 600 nm at room temperature. The absorption peaks, as shown in Fig. 1(a), were observed at 294, 337, 373 nm, and two shoulder peaks were observed at 323 nm and 390 nm. The absorption profiles at 337 and 373 nm originate from π–π* transitions. Similarly, the photoluminescence spectra were studied for 1; the solution was excited at 380 nm, and as shown in Fig. 1(b), the maximum luminescence intensity was observed at 463 nm. From the absorption spectra, the molar absorption coefficient (ε) of 1 in solution was calculated according to following equation:
A = εbc
where,
A represents absorbance, ε represents the absorption coefficient, b represents path-length and c represents the concentration of the solution. The calculated molar extinction coefficient (ε) is 1.8 × 104 cm−1 M−1 for 10 mg mL−1. The optical band gap (Eoptg) can be calculated from the absorption onsets for 1 and was found to be 3.07 eV from the Tauc plot (inset of Fig. 1(a)).



Fig. 2 shows the electrochemical behavior of 1 using cyclic voltammetry (CV). 1 undergoes two reversible reduction events, which determines that the reduced species are electrochemically stable, which is important for operational stability. This can be very well documented from the device stability discussed in a later section. The presence of more reduction events shows that there are a number of low lying excited states that determine the property for charge separation. The redox potential of Fc/Fcb with an energy level of 4.8 eV to vacuum has been considered. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level for 1 was calculated from the onset of oxidation and reduction peaks using the equation E = −e(Ered/Eoxd + 4.8), as listed in Table 1. The band gap (Eg) was calculated to be 2.3 eV. It is to be noted that the measured electrochemical band gap corresponds to the optical band gap calculated from the absorption spectra (Fig. 1(a)). To achieve a maximum Voc, the LUMO energy level of the acceptor should be high yet allow for electron transfer from donor to acceptor. It is known that the minimum LUMO–LUMO offset for effective electron transfer is 0.2 eV. This requirement is fulfilled for wide band gap polymers such as P3HT. It is expected that higher Voc can be obtained due to a higher LUMO level, which improves the stability of the device.

The energy level diagrams showing HOMO–LUMO energy levels have been compared with the existing donor and acceptor molecules used in OSCs, as shown in Fig. 3. The LUMO level of 1 is in close proximity with PC71BM (∼3.9 eV). The comparison between the band gap of different donor and acceptor molecules indicates that 1 can be used as an electron acceptor and can be blended with P3HT for achieving high PCE in OSC.

To understand the morphology of 1 in a blend (prepared with ODCB), the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images shown in Fig. 4 were analyzed. The bright and dark regions can be attributed to the P3HT and 1 rich domains, respectively. The TEM images with different blend ratios of 1:2, 1:4 and 1:6 indicate the effect of increasing the concentration of 1, which leads to more uniform domains in the blend (shown in Fig. 4(a)–(c)). For a blend ratio of 1:6, there is a formation of an interpenetrating network between P3HT and 1 domains with an even distribution of donor and acceptor, which helps in better phase separation. This can lead to dissociation of exciton into free charge carriers necessary for enhanced charge transport.


The thermal stability and phase transition nature of 1 can be interpreted by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under N2 atmosphere at 10 °C rate per min, as shown in Fig. 5. From TGA analysis, it is evident that the decomposition of 1 occurs above 150 °C (Fig. 5(a)). A large plateau is observed up to 310 °C with almost 90.5% weight loss. On the heating cycle in DSC, two exothermic peaks with the phase transition temperatures (Tm) centered at 82.1 °C and 125 °C were seen with no signs of glass transition temperatures (Fig. 5(b)). The thermal transition temperature increase is an indication of enhanced intermolecular interaction, which is due to the presence of π–π stacking.


The absorption profile of 1, C60 and P3HT is shown in Fig. 6(a). The absorption spectrum of a pure P3HT solution in ODCB shows three absorption peaks at 455 nm, 555 nm and 603 nm, which has contribution from both the interchain and intrachain states. The interchain states, which occurred with the π–π* transition at 600 nm, and the intrachain states, which occurred at 455 nm and 555 nm, have been considered to arise from the 0–0 transition and the 0–1 transition, respectively. In the pure C60 solution, the absorption peak is observed at 334 nm (orbitally allowed 1T1u1Ag transition) with a weak tail extending into the near infrared region. The comparison of absorption spectra of C60 and 1 shows an additional peak at 373 nm for 1. Thus, the absorption spectra of 1 and P3HT are complimentary to each other with the increase in the absorption range due to 1, exhibiting its applications in photovoltaics.

The effect of blend ratio in P3HT:1 has been studied through absorbance measurements, as shown in Fig. 6(b). Significant absorption peaks have been observed at 294 nm, 337 nm and 373 nm, while shoulder peaks are located at 323 nm, 390 nm, 455 nm, 555 nm and 603 nm with sufficiently high intensity, demonstrating a good quality of the blend. Furthermore, it is observed that with an increase in the concentration of 1 in the blend, UV absorption increases in the wavelength range of 290 nm to 400 nm. Beyond 400 nm, a decrease in the absorbance is observed for all blend ratios with an increase in the concentration of 1. This observation is in accordance with the physical phenomenon of absorption of light beyond the band gap of the material, (Eoptg) = 3.07 eV for 1, which corresponds to 400 nm. Due to lower absorption in the visible range and higher absorption in the ultraviolet range, the blend material is supposed to have a significant variation in the charge transport behavior. The photo induced dynamics in P3HT:1 blends are mainly dependent on the morphology of the blend, charge carrier lifetime, formation of interface for exciton dissociation and availability of a better path for charge transport. To study the charge carrier lifetime of P3HT:1 blend, steady state and time resolved PL was performed.

In the P3HT:1 blend solution, photoluminescence quenching is observed, as shown in Fig. 7(a). A radiative recombination of photo-induced singlet exciton states causes PL quenching. This quenching indicates excitation of either donor or acceptor species, followed by efficient exciton separation for an effective charge transfer, which is an essential condition for OSC operation. It is observed that a very efficient charge transfer from donor to acceptor occurs at blend ratios of 1:4 and 1:6. To understand the effect of charge transfer lifetime on the bulk photogeneration, time resolved PL decay measurements were performed. The spectra with different blend ratios of 1:2, 1:4 and 1:6 are shown in Fig. 7(b).

All the PL decay curves can be well fitted to a bi-exponential model described by Fit = A + B1exp(−t/τ1) + B2exp(−t/τ2). Average lifetimes are calculated using ((B1τ12) + (B2τ22))/(B1τ1 + B2τ2). The fitting parameters are listed in Table 2. With the increase in the ratio of 1 in the blend, τ2 and τ1 change (values listed in Table 2) due to the charge transport characteristics of the blend. The time constant of the fast channel τ1 results from the dissociation of excitons at the donor–acceptor interface and is close to the sequential resolution of the measurement. With an increase in the concentration of 1, the contribution of τ1 enhances with a reduced recombination, which allows more singlet excitons to reach the interface during their migration. For the 1:6 blend ratio, an increase in τ1 along with an increase in τ2 in comparison with the 1:4 blend was observed. The integral PL and the decay dynamics show a reduction in recombination with an increase in the concentration of 1. This reduction causes better dispersion of donor and acceptor phases, which significantly enhances the density of photogenerated charge carriers with the increase in interfacial area between both phases. As per the data listed in Table 2, when the concentration of 1 is increased with blending ratios of 1:2, 1:4 and 1:6, the time constant diminishes the average exciton lifetime to 14 ns, 13.32 ns and 13.72 ns, respectively. Lower average exciton lifetime is desirable for efficient dissociation of the charge carriers and a better working OSC.

A schematic of the fabricated solar cell and corresponding energy band diagram are shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b), respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P3HT are −5.45 and −3.45, respectively, while for 1 they are −6.07 and −3.85, respectively, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The work functions of various contact materials, e.g., Al (∅ = −4.3 eV), ITO (∅ = −4.8 eV) and PEDOT:PSS (∅ = −5.20 eV), play an important role in efficient charge extraction and utilization. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the work function of PEDOT:PSS is closer to the HOMO energy level of P3HT and significantly below the LUMO energy level. Thus, the charge injection barrier remains high towards LUMO, and hole transport is facilitated through the PEDOT:PSS. The work function of Al is closer to the LUMO energy level of 1 (−3.85 eV) and significantly above the HOMO (−6.07 eV) energy level. Thus, the hole injection barrier is quite high, and electron transport is facilitated through the LUMO level of acceptor (1) only.

The novel fluoranthene-based acceptor has been evaluated for its potential in a BHJ solar cell by preparing the device with P3HT as the donor. P3HT is considered to be the most studied polymer in the OSC field. The optical and photo-physical properties have been well studied with the P3HT:1 blend solution, consequently regarding it as a promising donor polymer. The conventional architecture was chosen for the devices. The devices were fabricated with the configuration glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:1 (1:6)/Al. The light and dark current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for devices with P3HT as the donor molecule and 1 as acceptor molecule in 1:6 concentration as (determined by the PL decay study) are shown in Fig. 9. The photovoltaic device parameters are summarized in Table 3 with the values of short circuit current density (JSC), VOC, FF and PCE as 3.02 mA cm−2, 0.52 V, 44.89% and 0.71%, respectively. The results are comparable to the data reported in literature, as listed in Table 3. A low FF can be attributed to the presence of high series resistance at the active layer-electrode interface, which affects the shape of the J–V curve. The formation of a metal oxide layer at the 1/Al interface and the presence of other defects in the photoactive medium contribute to high series resistance.

The stability of the J–V characteristics of the fabricated device was studied. The device was stored in open air outside the glove box and the J–V characteristics were measured therein. Table 3 shows the change of performance parameters after 60 h of storage in open air conditions. After 60 h, the JSC dropped by 15.56%, FF by 9.15% and PCE by 26.76% with respect to their initial values. The VOC decreased by 3.84%, which is relatively low and indicates its stability as a photovoltaic parameter. It is well known that VOC is dependent on the energy levels and morphology of the active materials, which is evident from its morphology and electrochemical studies discussed in previous sections. This device characterization clearly indicates that 1 shows potential ability as a non-fullerene acceptor with significant stability in OSC.

In summary, a novel solution-processable 1,6,7,10-tetramethylfluoranthene (1) has been studied. Optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic studies of 1 show that it has strong potential as an acceptor in OSC. The material is structurally simple; it is the smallest fragment of fullerene and can be synthesized in high yields. This gives our molecule an advantage over fullerene derivatives that require a lengthy synthetic process and high cost. Fluoranthene derivative 1 shows a broader UV absorption range up to 400 nm, higher absorption coefficient, and a suitable optical band gap of 3.07 eV, offering potential for enhanced photocurrent generation in OSC devices. These also include PL decay time (τ1) in the range of 1.32 ns to 1.62 ns and suitable HOMO–LUMO positions with a band gap of 2.3 eV. This proposed acceptor is effective with one of the most widely studied polymers, P3HT, in the OSC field. The effective photoluminescence quenching shows increased charge generation in this device. Morphological studies reveal its uniform distribution of the donor and acceptor. Finally, the P3HT:1 device shows significant stability even after 60 h in open air conditions, demonstrating the potential of this material in future with further optimization.
