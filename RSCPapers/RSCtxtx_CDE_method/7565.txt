We report a series of structurally analogous cobalt mediators related to [Co-bpy]Z (bpy = 2,2′-bipyrimidine, Z = 2+ or 3+) to demonstrate a linear relationship between the redox potential of the Co(III/II)-based redox couple (Emed) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the DSSC. The Emed values vary from 0.42 to 1.07 V vs. NHE depending on the number of nitrogen atoms and the presence of tert-butyl substituents on the ligand. A 64-mV gain in photovoltage was calculated for every +100 mV shift in Emed. Differences in the mediator sizes, diffusion coefficients, light absorption profiles, and spin state configurations for the complexes were not significant and therefore not expected to contribute to changes in the VOC. A decrease in the photocurrent, downward shift in quasi-Fermi level (EF,n) and shorter electron lifetime (Tn) with increasingly positive Emed were instead attributed to enhanced electron recombination from the TiO2 film to oxidized mediator species in the electrolyte.

The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) converts light into electrical energy through photo-excitation of a TiO2 anode film sensitized with molecular dye molecules. An electrolyte redox mediator subsequently transports charge from the cathode to the photo-oxidized dye to complete the circuit. The open circuit voltage (VOC) of the cell is defined by the energy difference between the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 film (EF,n) and the relevant redox potential of the mediator (Emed). Because the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the photovoltaic cell is proportional to VOC, it follows that affecting a positive shift of the Emed can increase overall cell performance.

Redox shuttles with very positively shifted Emed values, however, often demonstrate low power conversion efficiencies. This effect can be attributed to deleterious electron recombination occurring from either the conduction band or surface states of the TiO2 film and the rates of both these processes are a function of Emed. Recombination from the TiO2 conduction band is typically enhanced with increasingly positive Emed due to a greater thermodynamic driving force for the reaction. Similarly, the improved overlap between the electronic density of states for TiO2 and oxidized mediator species increases with rate of recombination from surface states at higher Emed values. A consequence of the enhanced recombination is a decrease in the short-circuit current density (JSC) as more photo-injected electrons are intercepted by oxidized mediators. As a result of these recombination mechanisms VOC rarely scales linearly with Emed (i.e., a 200 mV increase in Emed corresponds to a less than 200 mV increase in VOC). The overall decrease in VOC caused by interfacial recombination has been linked to a positive shift in the EF,n due to a concomitant increase in the dark current and decrease in TiO2 electron density under illumination.
A number of studies have applied Marcus theory to explain how the driving force of recombination affects recombination kinetics and device performance. Polypyridyl cobalt(III/II) redox mediators are extensively utilized in these comparative studies because they are straightforward to synthesize with a variety of ligand combinations that directly influence Emed. The challenge of these studies lies in comprehensively addressing the additional influences of polypyridyl ligand variance, specifically how the physical and magnetic properties of the mediator impact the recombination reaction. The volume and geometry of the mediator affect both mass-transport coefficients and the interfacial coupling factor which are critical to the recombination rate. Mediator spin state also affects the recombination rate because spin change during the reduction of low-spin Co(III) to high-spin Co(II) requires a larger inner-sphere reorganization energy and acts as a barrier for recombination compared to the reduction of low-spin Co(III) to low-spin Co(II).
We report here the comparison of two sets of structurally analogous tris(2,2′-diimine)cobalt complexes (Fig. 1) to examine the direct effect of Emed on VOC and electron recombination in the DSSC while holding the sizes, absorption profiles, and spin states at near parity. The Emed of these cobalt complexes range from 0.42 V to 1.07 V vs. NHE. The four complexes only differ by the number of nitrogen atoms in the aromatic system and the presence of tert-butyl groups. [Co-bpy]Z, [Co-(bpy-DTB)]Z, and [Co-(bpm-DTB)]Z were balanced by hexafluorophosphate counterions (PF6−), whereas [Co-bpm]Z was balanced by bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide counterions (TFSI−) in consideration of solubility issues. A linear relationship between Emed and VOC was observed when testing each of the four complexes into functional DSSCs. The size difference between complexes with and without tert-butyl groups did not affect the overall trend in VOC, but did appear to influence the accessibility of surface state-mediated recombination according to open-circuit decay measurements.

Cobalt complexes were synthesized by dissolving separately CoCl2 and an excess of the relevant ligand in methanol, combining the two solutions, and refluxing for two hours. Dropwise addition of the CoCl2 solution to the ligand solution was performed in the synthesis of [Co-bpm]2+ and [Co-(bpm-DTB)]2+ to prevent potential bridging coordination of the bipyrimidine ligands. Potassium hexafluorophosphate or lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide salt was added to the solution in order to precipitate the target Co(II) complexes. Excess ligand and salts remain dissolved in solution for facile product separation by filtration, although [Co-(bpm-DTB)](PF6)2 required a modified purification procedure due to high solubility in methanol. The Co(III) forms of the complexes were generated upon reacting the Co(II) complexes with nitrosonium hexafluorophosphate (NOPF6).

All Co(II) and Co(III) complexes were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Attempts to confirm the mass-to-charge ratio of the cationic complexes using high-resolution mass spectrometry were unsuccessful. Even in the case of electrospray ionization it was only possible to infer fragmented ligand ions from the obtained spectra. The structure of the newly-reported complexes [Co-(bpm-DTB)](PF6)2 and [Co-bpm](TFSI)2 were confirmed through single-crystal X-ray diffractometry and elemental analysis respectively.

The two pairs of analogous cobalt complexes exhibit near-identical structures according to single crystal X-ray diffraction data. Crystal structure parameters for [Co-(bpy-DTB)](PF6)2, [Co-bpy](PF6)2, and [Co-bpm](PF6)2 were obtained from the Cambridge Structural Database. The crystallographic and refinement parameters for [Co-bpm-DTB](PF6)2 are shown in Fig. S1, Tables S1 and S2. The Co–N bond lengths and N–Co–N angles are summarized in Table 1 (ϕ represents the N–Co–N angle of the same ligand and θ is the N–Co–N angle between adjacent ligands). All four cobalt complexes exhibit distorted octahedral geometries with comparable metal–ligand bond lengths (ca. 2.1 Å) and angles (ϕ = 76–77°; θ = 90–99°) (Table 1). The estimated molecular radii of the cobalt complexes with tert-butyl groups were 2.2 Å larger than those without the group, but no significant difference in radii was observed between the respective bipyridine and bipyrimidine complexes (Table 2).

Magnetic susceptibilities were assessed using the Evans method and results indicate that all four cobalt complexes exist in a high-spin d7 Co(II) configuration (Table 2). The effective magnetic moments (μeff) fell between 4.4–4.8 Bohr magnetons which is the characteristic range for paramagnetic high-spin Co(II). The spin-state assignment is further validated by the Co–N bond lengths characteristic of high-spin complexes extracted from crystallographic analysis (∼2.1 Å) and the wide chemical shift ranges of 0–105 ppm observed in 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S2). All four complexes exist in a low-spin d6 Co(III) state as indicated by proton resonances located between 7–10 ppm with clearly identifiable JH,H coupling constants in 1H NMR spectroscopy. These features correspond to diamagnetic Co(III) species (Fig. S2).


The four cobalt complexes are weak light absorbers in the visible region with molar extinction coefficients (ε) less than 200 M−1 cm−1 (Fig. 2). The absorption features near 950 nm and 450 nm are respectively consistent with the 4T1g(4F) → 4T2g(4F) and 4T1g(4F) → 4T1g(4P) transitions previously assigned to this family of complexes (Fig. 2 inset, Table S3). The expected 4T1g → 4A2g transition bands were not observed and are likely concealed within the intense intraligand π → π* transition bands at 200 to 400 nm. The spectra of [Co-bpy](PF6)2 and [Co-bpy-DTB](PF6)2 show an additional absorption feature associated with intraligand transitions at 295 nm and a hypsochromic shift of the near-infrared absorption band near 900 nm compared to the spectra of [Co-bpm](PF6)2 and [Co-bpm-DTB](PF6)2. The wavelengths of local absorption maxima (λmax) for [Co-bpy](PF6)2/[Co-(bpy-DTB)](PF6)2 and for [Co-bpm](PF6)2/[Co-(bpm-DTB)](PF6)2 are nearly identical, indicating that the tert-butyl groups do not appreciably affect absorption properties.


Cyclic voltammetry performed in acetonitrile solution revealed a single, quasi-reversible Co(III/II) redox process between 0.42–1.07 V vs. NHE in all four complexes (Fig. 3; Table 2). Emed values for [Co-bpy]Z and [Co-(bpy-DTB)]Z are in agreement with literature values. The tert-butyl groups affect a 0.15–0.18 V decrease in Emed relative to the protio derivative whilst the substitution of bipyrimdine ligands for bipyridine results in a 0.47–0.50 V increase of the measured Emed value. Similar increases in Emed upon substituting bipyridine with bipyrimidine have been reported for related ruthenium, iron, and nickel complexes.

Solution mass transport properties of the Co(II) complexes were derived from diffusion coefficient (DCo(II)) measurements obtained by rotating disk electrode measurements on glassy carbon or gold electrodes in acetonitrile solution. The diffusion coefficients were extracted from the slopes of Koutecky–Levich plots (Fig. S3 and S4) and are tabulated in Table 2. Ferrocene (FcH) was utilized as a reference standard for which the measured value of 2.48 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 is in close agreement with the literature value of 2.43 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. The diffusion coefficient values decreased with increasing molecular size FcH > [Co(bpy)]2+ = [Co(bpm)]2+ > [Co-(bpy-DTB)]2+. Note that measurements for [Co-(bpy-DTB)]2+ and FcH were carried out on a gold working electrode due to irreversible behaviour at glassy carbon. The diffusion coefficient for [Co-(bpm-DTB)]2+ could not be obtained using either Au or GC working electrodes as there was no detectable oxidative current. This absence of current is unusual given the reversible redox behaviour observed by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 3). One possible explanation is that [Co-(bpm-DTB)]2+ may be chemically oxidized by oxygen introduced into the electrolyte by electrode rotation under ambient conditions.

The four cobalt complexes were evaluated as redox mediators in DSSC devices containing a nanoparticulate TiO2 thin-film sensitized with a triphenylamine dye (Dye-I) and platinized counter electrode. The energetics of the dye, cobalt mediators, and TiO2 in the DSSC are presented in Fig. 4. The excited-state redox level (Dye-I*/Dye-I+) of −1.29 vs. NHE was estimated from the intersection of normalized UV-Vis and emission spectra (Fig. S5) and is sufficiently negative for photo-injection into the TiO2 conduction band (i.e. <−0.5 V vs. NHE). The ground state redox potential (Dye-I+/Dye-I) was previously determined by cyclic voltammetry and is sufficiently positive of the Co(III)/Co(II) redox couples (Emed) to facilitate regeneration by these mediators. As the solubility of [Co-bpm](PF6)2 in acetonitrile is limited to ca. 0.027 M4 it was necessary to utilize [Co-bpm](TFSI)2 with an ambient solubility limit of ca. 0.19 M. The remaining Co(II) complexes were utilized as the hexafluorophosphate salts at 0.2 M concentration. The best J–V curves are plotted in Fig. S6, and the average device parameters are summarized in Fig. 5 and Table 3.

A near unity linear correlation between VOC and Emed was observed using the four mediators (Fig. 5). The theoretical gain in VOC for every +100 mV shift in Emed should be +100 mV if the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 (EF,n) is constant, but the experimentally observed gain in VOC was only 64 ± 2 mV. Back calculation of EF,n revealed a positive shift in EF,n from −0.252 V to −0.008 V vs. NHE as Emed increases from 0.42V to 1.07 V vs. NHE (Table 3).
The increase in VOC with increasing Emed is mitigated by a parallel decrease of both the JSC (Fig. 5) and fill factor (FF). The trend of decreasing JSC is also observed in incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. 6) and photocurrent transient measurements (Fig. 7). The maximum IPCE at 420 nm dropped from 74% for [Co-(bpy-DTB)]Z to only 28% for [Co-bpm]Z (Table 3), indicating a significantly lower photocurrent generation at higher Emed. Photocurrent transient plots show that the current densities at the initial peak response are slightly higher than the values at steady-state, but the order in which current densities decrease with increasing Emed remains unchanged. The overall photo-conversion efficiency (PCE) thus tracks the increasing Emed for the bipyridyl complexes, but the effects of decreasing JSC and FF result in significantly lower PCE values for the highest Emed bipyrimidine functionalized mediators (Fig. 5).
Open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements were undertaken to rationalize the role of the deleterious electron recombination process on device performance trends (Fig. S7). The average time an injected electron survives in the TiO2 film (Tn) is derived from VOC decay according to eqn (1) (kb is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, e is elementary charge, and t is time).

Semilogarithmic plots of Tnversus EF,n were constructed to compare Tn in DSSCs containing the four mediators (Fig. 8). A smaller Tn value corresponds to faster VOC decay and faster recombination. Recombination appears to proceed faster with higher Emed mediators, with Tn decreasing in the order [Co-(bpy-DTB)]Z < [Co-bpy]Z < [Co-(bpm-DTB)]Z < [Co-bpm]Z. At 0.2 V vs. NHE the Tn measured for devices containing [Co-bpm]Z is an order of magnitude smaller than that found in devices containing [Co-bpy]Z and [Co-(bpm-DTB)]Z.

The incorporation of additional nitrogen atoms into the heteroaromatic ligand is an effective strategy to alter the electrochemical properties of a complex whilst minimally impacting magnetic properties and physical structure. No appreciable differences in bond length, coordination geometry, and mass transport for [Co-bpy]2+/[Co-bpm]2+ and [Co-(bpy-DTB)]2+/[Co-(bpm-DTB)]2+ imply that steric effects may be ruled out in comparing the complexes for DSSC performance metrics. Note that tert-butyl groups are known to attenuate electronic coupling interactions at electrode surfaces, and the observation of smaller diffusion coefficients for [Co-(bpy-DTB)]2+ compared to [Co-bpy]2+ is consistent with bulkier complexes experiencing slower mass transport in solution.

Inductive effects are thought to be the primary reason for both the positive shift in Emed with increasing number of ligand nitrogen atoms and the negative shift of Emed with the addition of tert-butyl groups. The presence of extra nitrogen atoms in the aromatic ligand decreases the σ-donor strength and increases the π-acceptor strength of bipyrimidine compared to bipyridine. Because the former ligands provide less electron density and stabilization to the Co(II) center a higher potential is required to oxidize the bipyrimidine functionalized complexes relative to the bipyridine congeners. In contrast the electron-donating tert-butyl groups increase σ-donation from ligand to metal and thus [Co-(bpy-DTB)]2+/[Co-(bpm-DTB)]2+ are easier to oxidize and exhibit lower Emed values relative to [Co-bpy]2+/[Co-bpm]2+ respectively.
The high-spin d7 and low-spin d6 states are maintained across all four cobalt complexes regardless of structural variation. Upon reaction with a photo-oxidized dye all complexes are expected to undergo spin crossover which is known to impact the inner-sphere reorganization energy, but the extent of the effect was not experimentally or computationally determined here. This reorganization energy is predicted to be insensitive to the donor strength of bidentate ligands in high-spin Co(II) complexes and is comparable throughout cobalt mediators with varying numbers of ligand nitrogen atoms. The inner-sphere reorganization energies are therefore assumed to be similar for all complexes described here. The comparable molecular radii of [Co-bpy]/[Co-bpm] and [Co(bpy-DTB)]/[Co(bpm-DTB)] similarly leads us to predict comparable outer-sphere reorganization energies for these complexes.


J–V and OCVD data clearly show that recombination proceeds faster as the driving force of the reaction increases and this trend is indicative of Marcus normal-region behaviour for recombination. Faster interfacial recombination at more positive Emed is consistent with increased charge interception and manifests as a decrease in both current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF). VOC is increasingly difficult to improve as any increases of Emed are inversely coupled to a decrease of EF,n. We found the optimal balance between the three device parameters with Emed close to 0.57 V vs. NHE. This balance possibly explains why reports of the best performing DSSCs all employ cobalt redox couples with an Emed near that value. It is imperative, however, to ensure that other factors such as dye regeneration efficiency, light-harvesting ability of the dye, and size-dependent mass transport of mediators are not interfering with the critical analysis of device performance. We justify in the following text that these factors are not responsible for the observed trends in VOC, JSC, and FF.

Inefficient dye regeneration is a potential cause for losses in JSC and FF, but it is unlikely the key contributor in this study. The driving forces for regeneration of Dye-I are calculated to be 0.85, 0.70, 0.38, and 0.20 eV for [Co-(bpy-DTB)]Z, [Co-bpy]Z, [Co-(bpm-DTB)]Z, and [Co-bpm]Z respectively. Feldt et al. found that a regeneration driving force above 0.39 eV can sufficiently regenerate more than 91% of the dye molecule. [Co-(bpm-DTB)] should therefore regenerate Dye-I as effectively as [Co-(bpy-DTB)] and [Co-bpy], yet the JSC and FF are comparatively lower.
It is evident from incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra that the mediators do not alter the light-harvesting ability of the dye or the resultant JSC trend (Fig. 6). Any synergistic dye-mediator effects would present as a change in both the intensity and wavelength profile of IPCE spectra, yet IPCE values were found to decrease uniformly over the wavelengths corresponding to Dye-I absorption (Fig. S5). The peak at around 330 nm is associated with direct UV excitation of the mesoporous TiO2 which becomes more distinct with decreasing IPCE. Competitive light absorption by the mediator is an unlikely contributor to the change in IPCE considering the minimal visible-light absorption in UV-Vis spectra of the individual mediators (Fig. 2). The limited IPCE performance with increasingly positive Emed is hence an indication of enhanced recombination kinetics.
The molecular size of the cobalt mediators does not affect the JSC trend observed from J–V measurements. The initial peak in the photocurrent transient response data corresponds to JSC in the absence of diffusion effects whereas the final, steady-state JSC is limited by diffusion of the mediator (Fig. 7). A more pronounced difference between the peak and steady-state JSC values in photocurrent transient data for [Co-(bpy-DTB)]Z/[Co-(bpm-DTB)]Z than for [Co-bpy]Z/[Co-bpm]Z is consistent with slower diffusion of larger mediators. Under operating conditions a slower diffusion rate can lead to the accumulation of Co(III) species at the TiO2-solution interface and thereby increase the probability of recombination. We assert that size-dependent diffusion limitations do not affect the overall JSC trend observed here as both the peak and steady-state JSC values decrease with increasing Emed.

Our analysis of open-circuit voltage decay plots suggests that tert-butyl groups hinder electron recombination between the mediator and surface states of TiO2. The shape of the semi-logarithmic Tn curves in Fig. 8 provide insight to differences in recombination mechanism across the four complexes. The Tn plots of [Co-bpy]Z (EF,n > 0.0 V vs. NHE) and [Co-bpm]Z (EF,n > 0.6 V vs. NHE) exhibit nonlinear regions that are indicative of recombination mediated by surface states. In contrast the near linear Tn plots for [Co-(bpy-DTB)]Z and [Co-(bpm-DTB)]Z suggest that the dominant recombination pathway is instead from the conduction band of TiO2.Tert-butyl groups presumably act as spacers that prevent close contact of cobalt mediators with the TiO2 film and thus attenuate electronic coupling to the surface states. The electronic coupling factor decreases exponentially with distance between TiO2 and the redox mediator and is proportional to the square-root of the recombination rate constant. The steric bulk of tert-butyl groups relative to methyl groups have previously been shown to affect a 20-fold decrease in electronic coupling factor and 13–50-fold decrease in charge-transfer rate constant in related polypyridyl osmium complexes. We anticipate a similar attenuation trend in this work given the estimated 2.2 Å increase in molecular radii for those cobalt complexes with tert-butyl groups compared to the unsubstituted complexes. In summary the inclusion of bulky alkyl groups could be an effective strategy to deter surface state recombination that is otherwise enhanced for cobalt mediators with an Emed greater than 0.85 V vs. NHE.


We carried out a systematic study of the structurally analogous [Co-bpy]Z, [Co-bpm]Z, [Co-(bpy-DTB)]Z, and [Co-(bpm-DTB)]Z redox mediators to investigate how changes in the Co(III)/Co(II) redox couple affect the VOC of representative DSSCs. The inclusion or omission of ring nitrogen atoms and tert-butyl groups in the bidentate ligand varies the Co(III)/Co(II) redox couple from 0.42 V to 1.07 V vs. NHE without significantly impacting the spin state or light absorption properties, nor the relative size and diffusion coefficients for those complexes with and without tert-butyl groups. The complexes therefore represent an ideal series to unambiguously elucidate structure–property relationships for DSSC redox mediator performance. A clear linear relationship between Emed and VOC was determined for DSSCs incorporating each of the four mediators. An imperfect 64 mV gain in VOC for every 100 mV increase of Emed is ascribed to a parallel increase in TiO2-mediator recombination rates on the basis of IPCE, J–V and OVCD data. Surface state recombination was evident for [Co-bpm]Z and [Co-bpy]Z whereas [Co-(bpm-DTB)]Z and [Co-(bpy-DTB)]Z appear to follow a conduction band recombination mechanism on account of steric screening afforded by the tert-butyl substituents. This study provides insights for the design of next generation metal complex redox mediators. The optimum Emed to maximize both VOC and JSC appears to span the range 0.57–0.89 V NHE, with higher Emed potentials requiring specific measures to mitigate electron recombination reactions.

Magnetic moments were calculated from the magnetic susceptibility values obtained using the Evans method. A sealed capillary tube containing a drop of 1,4-dioxane in CD3CN was inserted into an NMR tube containing a solution of the Co(II) complex (10 mM) and a drop of 1,4-dioxane dissolved in CD3CN. The measured magnetic susceptibilities were corrected and converted to magnetic moments as described in the ESI.
UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 35 UV-vis spectrophotometer with a slit width of 1 nm.

Molar extinction coefficients were calculated by Beer's law using a set of cobalt solutions with known concentrations between 1 μM and 5 mM.
Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were obtained using a CH Instruments CHI660D potentiostat. Measurements were taken in freshly N2-purged solutions of 0.1 M n-NBu4PF6 dissolved in dry MeCN. 0.5 mm diameter Pt wire counter electrode (CHI-115, CH Instruments Inc.) and aqueous Ag/AgCl reference electrode (MF-2052, Bioanalytical Systems Inc.) were used in combination with a 2 mm diameter Au working electrode (CHI-101, CH Instruments Inc.).
Diffusion measurements were taken with a rotating ring-disk electrode set-up (MSR Electrode Rotator model AFMSRCE and E6R1 ChangeDisk RRDE tip, Pine Research Instrumentation) coupled to a potentiostat (CHI920C, CH Instruments Inc.). Pt or Au disk insert of 5 mm diameter (AFED050P040AU and AFED050P040GC, Pine Research Instrumentation) was placed in the rotating electrode tip. Linear sweep voltammetry was performed under ambient conditions in an electrolyte solution containing 0.1 M n-NBu4PF6 and a known concentration of the cobalt(II) species dissolved in MeCN (approximately 1.5 or 2.5 mM). Pt and Au working disk electrodes of 5 mm diameter (Pine Research Instrumentation) were rotated from 100 rpm up to 2500 rpm. Aqueous Ag/AgCl electrode (MF-2052, Bioanalytical Systems Inc.) or 0.5 mm diameter Pt wire (Strem Chemicals) was used as the reference electrode. The counter electrode was a 0.5 mm diameter Pt wire (CHI-115, CH Instruments Inc.). The measured currents were fitted to the Levich-Koutecky equation to calculate the diffusion coefficients.

Following a previously reported procedure, 2-chloropyrimidine (0.67 g, 5.9 mmol), pivalic acid (0.60 g, 5.9 mmol), potassium persulfate (1.6 g, 5.9 mmol) and silver nitrate (0.20 g, 1.2 mmol) were stirred for 16 h in 1:1 DCM/H2O (20 mL) at room temperature with the exclusion of ambient light. The resulting grey suspension was dried under reduced pressure, redissolved in ethyl acetate, and filtered to separate solid precipitates. The filtrate solution was washed with H2O (3 × 10 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and finally purified by silica gel chromatography (1:4 ethyl acetate/petroleum ether, Rf = 0.43) to afford a pale-yellow oil (0.48 g, 2.8 mmol, 48%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN) δ 8.55 (d, J = 5.3 Hz, 1H), 7.43 (d, J = 5.3 Hz, 1H), 1.32 (s, 9H).


Adapting a literature procedure, a mixture of NiCl2·6H2O (1.4 g, 11 mmol), triphenylphosphine (11 g, 42 mmol), and zinc powder (1.0 g, 16 mmol) in DMF (40 mL) were degassed by three successive freeze–pump–thaw cycles and subsequently heated to 70 °C under a gently flowing atmosphere of N2. Once the temperature was stable a separate solution of 2-chloro-4-tert-butyl-pyrimidine (1.7 g, 10 mmol) dissolved in DMF (10 mL) (sparged with N2 for 1 h) was added to the heated nickel suspension. The combined mixture was left to react overnight, cooled to ambient temperature, quenched with NH4OH (100 mL, 4 M) and then left to stir for 30 min. After filtration of excess zinc powder from the mixture the DMF was evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude product was extracted with diethyl ether (100 mL) and washed with H2O (1 L) to remove any remaining DMF. Purification by silica column chromatography was carried out in 1:4 ethyl acetate/petroleum ether to remove the residual metal catalysts and most of the triphenylphosphine followed by 100% ethyl acetate to recover the product. Further purification by temperature-gradient recrystallization from hexane yielded the white crystalline product (0.82 g, 3.0 mmol, 60%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 8.85 (d, J = 5.3 Hz, 2H), 7.40 (d, J = 5.3 Hz, 2H), 1.45 (s, 18H). HRMS (APCI) m/z: [M + H+] calcd for C16H23N4 + 271.1923, found 271.1924.


The procedure was adapted from published methods. Anhydrous cobalt(II) chloride (CoCl2, 1 equiv.) and the substituted 2,2′-diimine ligand (3.1–4.3 equiv.) were dissolved separately in MeOH (approximately 10 mL per 10 mg of CoCl2 and 10 mL per 100 mg of ligand). The CoCl2 solution was added dropwise to the ligand solution over 3 min. The combined solution was vigorously stirred and refluxed for 2 h. Solid potassium hexafluorophosphate (KPF6) or lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) was added in excess to precipitate the product. The precipitate was isolated through vacuum filtration, rinsed minimally with cold MeOH, and redissolved in MeCN. After filtering the solution through a glass frit, the solvent was removed in vacuo to yield the pure product.


Anhydrous CoCl2 (0.027 g, 0.21 mmol), bpm (0.13 g, 0.83 mmol), and KPF6 (0.13 g, 0.69 mmol) reacted to yield the product as an orange powder (0.16 g, 0.19 mmol, 90%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN): 100.63 (s, 6H), 41.02 (s, 6H), 19.55 (s, 6H).


Anhydrous CoCl2 (0.12 g, 0.93 mmol), bpm (0.58 g, 3.7 mmol), and LiTFSI (0.13 g, 0.69 mmol) reacted to yield the product as an orange powder (0.84 g, 0.76 mmol, 83%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN): 100.81 (s, 6H), 41.14 (s, 6H), 19.62 (s, 6H). Anal. Calcd for C28H18CoF12N14O8S4: C, 30.75; H, 1.66; N, 17.93. Found: C, 31.00; H,1.58; N, 17.70.


Anhydrous CoCl2 (0.16 g, 1.3 mmol), bpy (0.63 g, 4.0 mmol), and KPF6 (1.1g, 5.8 mmol) reacted to yield the product as a brown powder (0.19 g, 0.25 mmol, 19%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN): 87.80 (s, 6H), 83.80 (s, 6H), 46.00 (s, 6H), 14.50 (s, 6H).


Anhydrous CoCl2 (0.045g, 0.35 mmol) and bpy-DTB (0.40 g, 1.5 mmol) were reacted in MeOH (50 mL) followed by the addition of KPF6 (0.51 g, 2.7 mmol). The solvent was evaporated and the crude residue redissolved in a minimal volume of dichloromethane (1 mL). Addition of hexane to the solution afforded a precipitate collected by filtration and washed copiously with additional hexane. The solid was redissolved in dichloromethane and again filtered through a glass frit, with the resulting filtrate evaporated to afford the product as a pale orange powder (0.36 g, 0.32 mmol, 90%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN) δ 90.35 (s, 6H), 80.91 (s, 6H), 43.07 (s, 6H), 3.51 (s, 54H). Anal. Calcd for C48H66CoF12N12P2: C, 49.70; H, 5.73; N, 14.49. Found: C, 49.50; H, 5.87; N, 14.39.


Excess oxidant (NOPF6) was dissolved in dry MeCN (5 mL) and the corresponding tris(2,2′-diimine) cobalt(II) salt was added as a solid. The product was precipitated by dropwise addition of the reaction mixture into distilled water (50 mL) to form a fine powder. The precipitate was redissolved in MeCN and directly evaporated within a storage microvial to recover the tris(2,2′-diimine)cobalt(III) product. Although quantitative yields of the products were not obtained 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis indicated successful oxidization of all cobalt(II) tris(2,2′-diimine) complexes to the respective cobalt(III) complex. The purity of isolated powders was inferred from a combined lack of line-broadening and absence of any detectable paramagnetic 1H-NMR spectroscopic resonances corresponding to residual Co(II) complex.


Reaction with NOPF6 and [Co-bpm](PF6)2, followed by salt metathesis with excess LiTFSI yielded an orange powder. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN) δ 9.48 (dd, 6H, J = 4.8, 1.6 Hz), 7.98–7.91 (m, 6H), 7.76 (dd, 6H, J = 6.1, 1.6 Hz).


Reaction with NOPF6 and [Co-bpy](PF6)2 yielded a yellow powder. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN) δ 8.73–8.66 (m, 6H), 8.51–8.43 (m, 6H), 7.73 (t, J = 6.6 Hz, 6H), 7.27 (d, J = 5.7, 6H).


Reaction with NOPF6 and [Co-(bpy-DTB)](PF6)2 yielded a yellow powder. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN) δ 8.63(d, J = 2.1 Hz, 6H), 7.67 (dd, J = 6.4, 2.2 Hz, 6H), 7.05 (d, J = 6.4 Hz, 6H), 1.45 (s, 54H).


Reaction with NOPF6 and [Co-(bpm-DTB)](PF6)2 yielded an orange powder. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3CN) δ 7.91 (d, J = 6.5 Hz, 6H), 7.59 (d, J = 6.5 Hz, 6H), 1.50 (s, 54H).


Photoanodes were prepared by screen printing a nanoparticulate TiO2 paste on a fluorinated tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrate and sintering at 500 °C in an oven. The photoanodes were printed with one nanoparticle layer (∼18 nm particles, 18NR-T paste, Greatcell Solar) and one scattering layer (∼200 nm particles, WER4-O paste, Dyesol) with a total calculated active area of 0.196 cm2 and total thickness between 10–12 μm. The TiO2 substrates were treated in a 40 mM TiCl4(aq) bath at 70 °C for 30 min, and rinsed with H2O then EtOH. After gradual heating to 500 °C over 35 min in air the photoanodes were cooled to 80 °C and then immersed in an MeCN solution of 0.1 mM dye and 1 mM chenodeoxycholic acid for 24 h. The stained films were then rinsed and subsequently immersed in MeCN for 30 min before drying in a desiccator. Cathodes were freshly prepared by coating FTO-glass with a 0.2 mM solution of H2PtCl6 dissolved in ethanol followed by curing at 400 °C for 22 min. Cathodes were maintained in a 100 °C environment until ready for immediate cell assembly. Cells were assembled in a bespoke dry box purged with dry air. Electrodes were sealed together with a 30 μm surlyn gasket (DuPont) by resistive heating. The electrolyte contained 0.1 M LiTFSI, 0.2 M TBP, 0.2 M Co(II) and 0.02 M Co(III) in MeCN. In [Co-bpy]Z, [Co-(bpy-DTB)]Z, and [Co-(bpm-DTB)]Z electrolytes, 0.22 M of Co(II) species were dissolved in MeCN and Co(III) species were generally generated in situ using NOPF6. In [Co-bpm]Z electrolyte, 0.2 M of [Co-bpm](TFSI)2 and 0.02 M of [Co-bpm](TFSI)3 was dissolved in MeCN and only the soluble portion was used. The electrolyte was injected into the sandwiched electrodes through a pre-drilled hole on the cathode. The hole was sealed via a 60 μM thin surlyn film (SX1170-60, Solaronix) and microscope coverslip (18 × 18 × 0.13–0.17 mm, Fisher Scientific). Silver paint (12684-15, Electron Microscopy Sciences) was coated on the electrode edges to ensure electrical contact.


Photovoltaic measurements were recorded with a OAI TriSOL Class AAA solar simulator (MDL 0131-0143-01) equipped with a 300 W xenon short-arc lamp (UXL-302-O, Ushio) light source and Class A filter for DSSC applications to cover from 350–850 nm in 50 nm bandwidth increments. The power output of the lamp was calibrated to 1 sun (1000 W m−2) using a certified Newport Oriel Si reference cell (Model SN 0963). The light output area was 52 mm × 52 mm. All cells were placed and fixed with cellophane tape on a lab jack covered with aluminum foil prior to undertaking photovoltaic characterization. The J–V characteristic of each cell was obtained by applying an external potential to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley digital source meter (model 2400). Incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded with Newport Oriel IQE 200 system. The system was calibrated with a silicon detector (Newport part number IQE-SAMPLE-SI). The light output was modulated from 300 nm in direct current mode. Measurements were taken in 10 nm intervals.

Open-circuit voltage decay was measured by applying zero current bias with the source meter and measuring the decay of photovoltage in the dark following illumination at 1 sun. Acquisition time was controlled through Keithley Kickstart software with the following parameters: bias current = 0 A; delay = 0.0005 s; number of power line cycles (NLPC) = 0.1; and number of data points = 2500. The illumination sequence was manually controlled by illuminating the cell for ca. 10 s and then turning off the lamp for the duration of the measurement. Data acquisition initiated ca. 2 s before the lamp was turned off.
