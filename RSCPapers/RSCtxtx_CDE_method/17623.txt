Most of the electron transport layers (ETLs) used in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are fullerene derivatives, which are relatively expensive due to the complex synthesis process. Here we report coenzyme Q10, composed of quinone as the acceptor group and an alkyl chain as the donor group, which can be used as a low cost ETL alternative in inverted PSCs. The energy level alignments, carrier transport and recombination dynamics were systematically studied in comparison with the benchmark PC61BM. By optimizing the device structure and thickness of the ETL, the device with Q10 exhibits a comparable power conversion efficiency to the PC61BM device under the standard irradiation conditions. The carrier transport and recombination processes were further evaluated through steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, space-charge-limited current, and Mott–Schottky measurements. An accelerated carrier injection ability and a passivated interface defect density between the perovskite and Q10 ETL were observed. Charge density difference from DFT calculations also determined that the band alignment of Q10 promoted easier charge transport from the perovskite. Moreover, the long alkyl chain of the Q10 molecule endows it with excellent hydrophobic properties, which largely improves the water-resistance capability of the Q10 ETL. This work highlights the great potential of Q10 as a cheap alternative for the most popular PC61BM ETL for inverted PSCs.

Perovskites have become a potential material for low cost and high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to their long charge-carrier diffusion lengths, long carrier recombination lifetime and wide absorption range. In the past few decades, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has increased from 3.8% to 24.2%, approaching the efficiency of commercialized mc-Si solar cells and other thin film solar cells such as CdTe and Cu2ZnSn(Se,S)4. Such a rapid development of PSCs is accompanied with great endeavors in the development of alternative electron or hole transporting materials, perovskite component optimization, interface engineering, and novel film deposition processes.

Generally, a PSC device can be classified into an n–i–p structure or an inverted p–i–n structure. In an n–i–p device, metal oxides (TiO2 and SnO2) are usually employed as the electron transporting layer (ETL). However, the high sintering temperature of these metal oxides greatly increases the cost of preparation, and limits the application in flexible substrates. Moreover, the notorious photocurrent hysteresis in this kind of device is evident, which is detrimental to the stable output of PSC device. Inverted PSCs (having a p–i–n structure), are promising in terms of low-cost production and flexible applications in the future. In an inverted planar architecture, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-isomethyl butyrate (PC61BM), a fullerene derivative, is widely used as the ETL. The carrier mobility of the material can meet the needs of PSCs, but due to the complex preparation process, the cost problem is prominent. Meanwhile, the structure of PC61BM is difficult to modify and it prefers to aggregate at high annealing temperature. Moreover, the molecule is found to be oxygen and water sensitive, which raises a critical concern for long-term stability. Therefore, the development of alternative ETL materials is highly desired in this regard.
Organic materials are cost-effective and solution processable, their structures are easy to modify, and the energy levels can be facilely tuned. These advantages make them promising candidates for organic ETLs for inverted PSCs. A qualified ETL should have appropriate energy levels, high electron mobility, and good solubility. Recently, organic molecules such as quinones, naphthodiperylenetetraimide, triphenylamine, and perylenediimide tetramers have been extensively studied in electrochemistry. With a rigid planar π-conjugated structure, quinones can promote proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) and undergo two-electron reduction, accompanied by reaction with up to two protons. Such reactions are beneficial for charge transporting. Several quinone-based small organic molecules were successfully applied in pH electrodes, super-capacitors, and flow batteries. Coenzyme Q10 [2-[(2E,6E,10E,14E,18E,22E,26E,30E,34E)-3,7,11,15,19,23,27,31,35,39-decamethyltetraconta-2,6,10,14,18,22,26,30,34,38-decaen-1-yl]-5,6-dimethoxy-3-methylcyclohexa-p-benzoquinone] is a quinone-based material, composed of quinone and an alkyl chain. Recent application of coenzyme Q10 in lithium batteries has been reported. Its special molecular structure improves the capacitance and stability of lithium batteries. This draws our attention to apply this molecule in PSCs based on the specific molecular structure of Q10. The alkyl chain of Q10 could protect the perovskite from degradation by oxygen and water, and the quinone acceptor group ensures its excellent electron transport ability.
Herein, we demonstrate that coenzyme Q10 can work as an efficient ETL in inverted PSCs. With a typical p–i–n device structure of FTO/NiOx/FAMAPbI3/ETL/BCP/Ag, the Q10 ETL shows a maximum efficiency of 14.34%, with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 23.11 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.90 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.69, which are comparable to those of a control device with the PC61BM ETL (16.30%) under the standard irradiation conditions (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). On the basis of a series of carrier transport and recombination characterization studies, the Q10 molecule is proven to show several advantages including passivated perovskite interfacial traps, excellent electron transport ability and suppressed charge recombination. These results demonstrate that coenzyme Q10 hold promise as a non-fullerene ETL alternative in PSCs.

To determine the energy level of the Q10 molecule, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are first probed using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy. The molecular structures of PC61BM and Q10 are presented in the inset of Fig. 1. Featuring a quinone as the acceptor group and a long alkyl chain as the donor group, the Q10 molecule shows a typical linear structure and can be easily modified. Fig. 1 shows the ultraviolet photoelectron spectra of Q10 and PC61BM. The work function (WF) and valence band maximum (VBM) were calculated from the binding energy cutoff (Ecutoff) in the range of 12–18 eV and the binding onset (Eonset) in the range of 0–8 eV, respectively. The bandgap (Eg) values were determined from the absorption spectra as shown in Fig. S1. The energy diagram of the solar cell is shown in Fig. S2, and the detailed values are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that the HOMO level of Q10 is 6.96 eV, lower than that of PC61BM (5.97 eV), indicating that Q10 has a better hole blocking ability. Moreover, the LUMO level of Q10 is determined to be 4.36 eV, while the LUMO level of PC61BM is 4.04 eV. The lower lying LUMO level of Q10 implies a larger electron driving force for the carrier injection process from the perovskite to the ETL. It is important to note that the price of Q10 is sixtyfold lower than that of PC61BM from commercially available sources as shown in Table 1. DFT calculations were performed on Q10 and PC61BM to study the HOMO and LUMO electronic distribution, as shown in Fig. S3. Due to the strong electron donating properties of the alkyl chain moiety and the electron accepting properties of the quinone moiety, the HOMO of Q10 was mainly dispersed over the alkyl chain moiety, while the LUMO was localized on the quinone moiety. Other than the similar charge distribution at the fullerene part for both HOMO and LUMO, the HOMO of PC61BM exhibits some nonzero charge density on the benzene ring, which is different from the LUMO.

In order to better evaluate the potential of Q10 as the ETL for PSCs, electron-only devices based on the architecture of FTO/ETL/Ag were constructed and the conductivity was studied by fitting the data using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method as shown in Fig. 2a and S4. From the slope of the J–V plot, the conductivity (σ) of the ETL was calculated (see the ESI). The thickness was estimated by profile measurements. As listed in Table S1, the obtained conductivity of PC61BM is 1.66 × 10−2 mS cm−1. Under the same conditions, the conductivity of Q10 is determined to be 3.65 × 10−2 mS cm−1, which is slightly higher than that of PC61BM but still in the same order of magnitude, suggesting that Q10 could work well as the ETL in PSCs in terms of electron transport.
The charge extraction properties were further investigated, through steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy. Obviously, a quenched emission peak can be detected when coated with PC61BM and Q10 (Fig. 2b and c), indicating efficient electron transfer from the perovskite material to the ETL. The similar PL intensity for the sample with the Q10 ETL and PC61BM suggests that Q10 could work efficiently with PC61BM in the carrier extraction and transfer process. Moreover, in order to gain further insights into the electron extraction rate, TRPL decay tests were conducted via monitoring the emission peak located at 809 nm. As shown in Fig. 2c, a fast decay and slow decay process were observed by fitting the PL lifetime constants of TRPL with the bi-exponential decay function. The fast decay lifetime τ1 is attributed to non-radiative recombination at the interface, while the long decay lifetime τ2 is attributed to radiative recombination in the bulk perovskite. The detailed fitted values are listed in Table S2. For the pristine perovskite film, τ1 is fitted to be 6.44 ns. When coated with the Q10 or PC61BM ETL, the τ1 is shortened to 4.06 ns and 3.26 ns, respectively. The PL lifetimes indicate that Q10 has a good electron extraction rate from the perovskite compared with PC61BM, which is in good agreement with the electron conductivity test results.
From the charge density difference plots in Fig. 3a and c, the charge transfer between Q10 or PC61BM and FAPbI3 is indicated by the positive/negative charge parts (blue/yellow). The difference among the atomic electronegativities of Pb, I, C, H, N, and O can explain the reason for charge redistribution during the formation of chemical bonds. In pure FAPbI3, as a result of chemical bond formation, on average, each Pb atom on the surface loses 0.88e, and each I atom on the surface receives 0.57e from the atoms nearby. After the adsorption of Q10 or PC61BM on the surface of FAPbI3, the charge distribution changes. The lost charge quantity (0.89e) of most Pb atoms on the surface is slightly higher, but it is very close to the value (0.88e) of Pb atoms in pure FAPbI3. A Pb atom shows a special lost charge of −0.97e, which is shown in Fig. 3b and d. A similar situation can be found through a comparison of charge changes in I atoms between pure FAPbI3 and complex structures. Overall, the Pb atoms lose more charge, while I atoms receive less charge. Therefore, the redundant charge moves to Q10 or PC61BM.
Physically, the charge transfer is determined by the electronic structures, especially by the band alignments of Q10 or PC61BM and FAPbI3. As shown in the insets of Fig. 3a, the HOMO of Q10 is lower than the VBM of FAPbI3, which induces electron transfer from the high VBM of the perovskite to the low HOMO of Q10 after the electrons are excited. A similar situation can occur in the PC61BM/perovskite structure. The measured Q10/perovskite interface energetic is a type II alignment in the words of semiconductor super-lattices, which helps to prolong the carrier lifetime by separating the excited electrons and holes in different materials.
The partial density of states for each kind of element was plotted for Q10/FAPbI3 and PC61BM/FAPbI3 as shown in Fig. S5. The main contributions of the VBM come from the p orbitals of I atoms, and the CBM mainly comes from the p orbitals of Pb atoms. Furthermore, in Q10/FAPbI3, the p orbitals of C and O atoms contribute to the VBM, and the p orbitals of O atoms contribute to the CBM, although the proportion of C and O atoms is very small. Compared with the results of Q10/FAPbI3, the p orbitals of O atoms do not contribute to the CBM of PC61BM/FAPbI3. This will affect the electron transport properties.
Highly efficient PSCs are strongly dependent on high-quality perovskite films. The crystallization of perovskite films was further tested by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As shown in Fig. S6 and S7, the Bragg peaks located at 14.12, 19.98, 24.53, 28.28 and 31.70° could be assigned to the (110), (011), (111), (002) and (012) planes of the FAMAPbI3 perovskite crystal, which is consistent with the cubic perovskite structure. Interestingly, the XRD patterns exhibited no additional PbI2 peaks, meaning that all of the PbI2 transforms into perovskite. The high intensity of diffraction peaks and the absence of PbI2 peaks indicated the high crystallinity and phase purity of perovskite films. Q10 and PC61BM do not show any diffraction peaks, indicating that Q10 and PC61BM form ultrathin conformal layers on the perovskite film during the spin coating process. Moreover, the UV-vis absorption of perovskites coated with the ETL and BCP was measured, as shown in Fig. S8. From the absorption profile, it can be seen that the mixed cation FAMAPbI3 perovskite showed a wide absorption range from 300 nm to 830 nm. When covered with the ETL and BCP, we found that the film with Q10 showed a stronger absorption in the long wavelength range. This result indicated that adding a BCP layer on top of the ETL formed a bilayer heterojunction between the ETL and the perovskite.
To evaluate the photovoltaic performance, inverted PSCs were fabricated with a configuration of FTO/NiOx/FAMAPbI3/ETL/BCP/Ag, and the photovoltaic performances were studied under 100 mW cm−2 (AM1.5G illumination). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements of the devices with different concentration of Q10 were performed. It was found that the most compact ETL film was observed to have a Q10 concentration of 7 mg mL−1 (Fig. S9). The corresponding device achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.34% with a short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of 23.11 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.90 V and a fill factor (FF) of 68.94% (Fig. S10 and Table S5). Note that the control PSC devices with the PC61BM ETL showed a PCE of 16.30% with a slightly lower Jsc of 21.80 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.95 V and a FF of 78.79% (Fig. 4a). We also noticed that Q10 devices exhibited a slight hysteresis (Fig. S11). From the PL spectra, a smaller quenched emission peak was detected for Q10 devices, which indicated that the capacitive charges are slowly dissipated by the charge separation at the interface between Q10 and the perovskite film, thus leading to a slightly severe hysteresis. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra for Q10 and PC61BM devices are shown in Fig. 4b. Both devices showed a very broad IPCE plateau of over 80% between 400 and 820 nm. It is noteworthy that the Q10 device showed a higher IPCE in the long wavelength range with a slightly broader absorption range. The integrated Jint value for the Q10 and PC61BM ETLs was 22.06 mA cm−2 and 20.41 mA cm−2, respectively, which is in good agreement with the Jsc value from the J–V curve of the devices. The detailed values are listed in Table 2. Fig. 4c shows the steady-state photocurrent over 200 s at the maximum power point to evaluate the stabilized power output. A bias voltage of 0.71 V and 0.82 V was applied to the Q10 and control PC61BM device, respectively. The Q10 device yielded a stabilized Jsc of 19.13 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 13.78%, while the control PC61BM device showed a stabilized Jsc of 18.53 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 14.83%. The measurements of 36 fabricated devices gave an average efficiency of 13.97 ± 0.22% for the Q10 devices and 15.05 ± 0.36% for the control PC61BM devices (Fig. 4f). Notably, Q10 devices exhibited an average Jsc of 22.97 ± 0.17 mA cm−2, while the control PC61BM devices showed an average Jsc of 21.90 ± 0.44 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4d). These results are consistent with the energy level and conductivity of Q10 and PC61BM.

In order to explain the higher Jsc of Q10 devices and further understand the charge recombination and photovoltaic performance, the J–V characteristics were investigated under varying light intensities from 1 to 100 mW cm−2. Fig. 5a shows the logarithmic plot of Jsc for various values of light intensity. The slope (α) of Q10 is 0.932, which is closer to 1 than that of the control PC61BM device (0.919), suggesting suppressed bimolecular recombination at the interface under short-circuit conditions in the Q10 device. In addition, a larger slope (kBTq−1) of Vocversus light intensity implies that trap-assisted recombination is more involved. As shown in Fig. 5b, a slope of 1.44kBTq−1 was estimated for the Q10 device, which is slightly lower than that of the control PC61BM device, 1.47kBTq−1. Therefore, the Q10 device has a lower level of Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination owing to reduced trap states.
Furthermore, space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement was performed to probe the trap state densities of the interface between the ETL and perovskite. The Q10 device exhibited a lower VTFL of 0.953 V than the control PC61BM devices (0.963 V), which corresponds to a trap density of 2.12 × 1016 cm−3 and 2.26 × 1016 cm−3 for the Q10 and PC61BM devices, respectively (Fig. 5c). These results are in good agreement with the device performances and light intensity dependence measurements. Moreover, the properties of the interface between the ETL and perovskite were investigated by conducting capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements. The samples with a structure of FTO/perovskite/ETL/Ag were prepared. In general, the flat-band potential can be estimated by performing Mott–Schottky analysis. The Mott–Schottky curve is shown in Fig. 5d, and the x intercept of the straight-line in the curve provides the flat-band potential (Vbi) values. Because NiOx was used as the HTL in both devices with Q10 and PC61BM, the Voc of the devices is directly correlated with Vbi. The Vbi value of the Q10 sample is 0.082 V, lower than that of the PC61BM sample, 0.119 V. The decrease of 37 mV in Vbi may contribute to the smaller Voc value in the Q10 devices compared to that of PC61BM. The doping density was calculated using the Mott–Schottky equation (see the ESI). When compared with the PC61BM sample, the increased doping density in the Q10 sample could enhance the charge collection efficiency due to the trap passivation effect. In Mott–Schottky analysis, the depletion zone can be regarded as the bulk resistance from the perovskite to ETL, and is expressed with the depletion zone width (Wp). Table S4 shows that the Q10 sample shows a narrower Wp, indicating a better charge extraction ability from the perovskite to Q10 film.
The PC61BM molecule is found to be oxygen and water sensitive, which raises a critical concern for the long-term stability. The water resistivity of PC61BM and Q10 was then studied. As shown in Fig. S12, the water contact angle for the perovskite/PC61BM film is 91.2°, which is lower than that for the perovskite/Q10 surface (96.2°). The device stability using different ETLs was preliminarily evaluated under ambient conditions of 30 °C and 25% relatively humidity. As shown in Fig. S13, a significant PCE decline can be clearly seen for the unencapsulated devices. However, the Q10 device maintained 83% of its initial efficiency for 120 h, showing better stability than the control PC61BM device (68%). From the view of the chemical structure, the long alkyl chains in Q10 as well as the organic frame of the polymer endow it with excellent hydrophobicity, which could protect the perovskite underlayer from moisture invasion more effectively. These results confirmed that Q10 is more hydrophobic than PC61BM and thus can improve the device stability.

In this study, a new kind of low-cost coenzyme Q10 with a long alkyl chain and quinone group was successfully developed as an efficient non-fullerene ETL for inverted PSCs. Bearing a lower LUMO energy level with the perovskite than the benchmark PC61BM, the Q10 ETL was proven to be more effective in passivating the traps at the perovskite and ETL interface by time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, space-charge-limited current and Mott–Schottky measurements. The device with Q10 as the ETL shows a comparable PCE with PC61BM ETL (14.34% vs. 16.30%) under AM1.5G simulated sunlight irradiation. Moreover, Q10 is more hydrophobic than PC61BM due to the long alkyl chain, which can protect the underlying perovskite layer more efficiently. This work demonstrates the great potential of the low-cost coenzyme Q10 to be used as a non-fullerene ETL alternative in inverted PSCs, especially for large-scale modules.

Perovskite solar cells were fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass. FTO was cleaned using detergent, deionized water, ethanol, acetone, and isopropanol for 20 min, respectively. Then, the substrates were treated under UV ozone for another 15 min after nitrogen stream drying. A 15 nm thick NiOx hole transport layer was deposited by the following method. A solution of 0.1 M nickel acetate tetrahydrate in ethanol was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s under ambient conditions. The compact NiOx layer was then annealed at 350 °C for 1 hour in an oven. The substrates were transported to a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The perovskite film was spin-coated using a one-step procedure at 4000 rpm for 40 s, and during the spin-coating, 300 μL of chlorobenzene was dropped onto the substrate after 30 s. Then the substrates were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min and 150 °C for 10 min. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared from a mixture of FAI (1.15 M), PbI2 (1.35 M), and MAI (0.20 M) in 1 mL DMF:DMSO = 4:1 (v/v). An electron-transporting layer was coated with a solution of PC61BM dissolved in chlorobenzene (20 mg mL−1) at 4000 rpm for 30 s or a Q10 solution dissolved in CB (7 mg mL−1) at 2000 rpm for 30 s, and then a saturated BCP solution in isopropanol (1 mg mL−1) was spin-coated at 6000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 100 nm thick silver electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation under high vacuum conditions.


The WF and VBM were measured using a UPS R3000 (Scienta). The crystalline phase and purity of the as-obtained films were studied using a MiniFlex 600 (Rigaku) X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm, 40 kV, 100 mA). The UV-vis spectra of the perovskite films were measured using a UV-2600 spectroscope (Shimadzu) with an integration sphere. Steady-state PL spectroscopy and TRPL decay measurements were performed using a FluoTime 300 (PicoQuant). The J–V characteristics of the solar cell devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter and a solar simulator (San-EI Electric) with standard AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination under ambient conditions. The light intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated with an AK-200 standard silicon solar cell (Konica Minolta). J–V curves for all devices were obtained by masking the cells with a metal mask with an area of 0.096 cm2. Monochromatic IPCE spectra were measured using an QE-R (Enlitech). The conductivity, EIS, SCLC, and MOTS measurements were carried out on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments Inc.). The thickness was estimated using a Dektak XT profiler (Bruker).


Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to calculate charge transfer from the perovskite to ETL. In order to simplify the calculation, we choose FAPbI3 as the perovskite. All calculations were performed using standard DFT through the generalized gradient approximation with the revised Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional, as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP). The charge density differences for two structures are calculated using
ΔP = P(A + FAMAPbI3) − P(A) − P(FAMAPbI3)
where A stands for coenzyme Q10 or PC
61BM.
