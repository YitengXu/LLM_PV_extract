In organic solar cells (OSCs), the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is largely influenced by the number of photo-generated excitons reaching the interface between the donor and the acceptor domains before recombination. To improve the utilization rate of excitons, QAO-DAd, a delayed fluorescence (DF) material with a small singlet triplet energy level difference, was introduced into the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F system. The optimized ternary OSCs show a high average PCE of 12.72%, which is higher than that of the control devices (11.39%). The improved PCE of the ternary OSCs may be due to the prolonged exciton lifetime and diffusion length. The modulated micro morphology of the active layer, and the promoted processes of exciton disaggregation and charge transmission are also important for device performance improvement. Furthermore, the stability of the ternary devices is improved compared to the control devices. Furthermore, when QAO-DAd was applied to the PTO2:IT-4F system, the optimized ternary devices achieved a champion PCE of 14.07%, which was superior to that of the binary OSCs (PCE of 13.01%), indicating the adaptability of the ternary strategy. These results suggested that the ternary strategy of introducing a DF material is effective and handy in achieving high performance OSCs.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the strength of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structures are gaining more and more attention because of their salient features of high efficiency, good flexibility, distinct color and potentially low-cost preparation process. The dynamic process of photo-generated excitons is the key to determine the device performance of OSCs. For organic semiconductors, the exciton diffusion length is usually about 5–20 nm. To obtain effective exciton dissociation efficiency, the phase separation scale of the donor and acceptor blended films should be maintained at the same magnitude. This poses a challenge to the morphological regulation of OSCs based on a BHJ structure. Prolonging the exciton diffusion length is helpful in reducing the high requirements of OSCs in terms of morphology with a BHJ structure. With a prolonged exciton diffusion length, more excitons can diffuse to the interface of the donor and acceptor and the utilization ratio of excitons can be improved.

Generally, most of the excitons are formed in organic semiconductors after absorbing light and have the characteristics of singlet states. There are several ways to increase the diffusion length of singlet excitons: (a) Improving the molecular structure. Adding side chains and improving molecular packing can optimize the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), which can extend the exciton diffusion length. But this method is complicated and has poor versatility. (b) Controlling the crystallinity. In general, materials with high crystallinity show high singlet exciton diffusion lengths. The methods to improve the active layers’ crystallinity include adding high boiling point additives, thermal annealing (TA), solvent vapour annealing (SVA), upside-down TA and upside-down SVA. These methods can be used to improve the diffusion length of excitons but may enhance the active layers’ phase separation, thereby weakening exciton disaggregation and charge transfer performance. Meanwhile, these methods are not precise enough to control the degree of crystallization. (c) Regulate the density of exciton traps. Research shows that exciton quenching traps in organic semiconductors are almost equal in number to electron traps, and they belong to the same species. Adjusting the density of exciton traps can prolong the exciton diffusion length, but the regulation process is unstable, which may decrease the exciton diffusion length. The lifetime of triplet state excitons in organic semiconductors is about 6 orders of magnitude longer than that of the singlet state excitons, and triplet state excitons have no limit of maximum diffusion length in theory. Researchers thus introduced triplet state excitons into OSCs by doping triplet state sensitizers into binary systems or using small molecules or polymers containing heavy atoms as OSC donors. However, triplet excitons have a high binding energy, which limits the progress of OSCs with triplet excitons.
Improving the exciton diffusion length of OSCs is challenging in material selection, morphology control and molecular location. And the methods mentioned above are not universal for different OSCs. The ternary device has the advantages of an easy preparation process, enhanced photon capture of the active layer, improved active layer morphology, reduced voltage loss and improved device stability. And the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs based on the ternary strategy has exceeded 17%. It is an efficient and easy-fabrication approach to improve the photovoltaic performance of a device and it can be applied to improve the exciton diffusion length. The selection of the third materials needs to meet the conditions of a complementary absorption spectrum, matching energy level structure, excellent compatibility and complementary optical parameters to those of the binary devices. Delayed fluorescence (DF) materials, which have a small single–triplet energy splitting (ΔEST), are expected to extend the exciton diffusion length of the active layer of ternary OSCs. In this type of material, the long lifetime triplet excitons can be converted into singlet excitons through the process of reversed intersystem crossing (RISC). When adding DF materials as the third component in binary OSCs, the excitons in the blended films may undergo the following processes. The singlet state excitons are formed after absorbing photons by the DF materials. Some singlet excitons reach the triplet state by means of intersystem crossing. The triplet state excitons with long lifetimes can form singlet state excitons through the RISC process. The singlet state excitons with long lifetimes can transfer energy to the main system materials through the FRET mechanism. These processes are expected to prolong the exciton lifetime, increase the diffusion coefficient and then increase the exciton diffusion length. With the extension of exciton diffusion length, more excitons diffuse to the donor and acceptor interfaces, which can improve the exciton dissociation efficiency and increase the short-circuit current (JSC) value of the OSCs. In this way, the performance of OSCs containing DF materials can be improved.
In our work, we selected the DF material 7-(tert-butyl)-3,11-bis(9,9-dimethylacridin-10(9H)-yl)quinolino[3,2,1-de]acridine-5,9-dione (QAO-DAd) as the third material, which has a small ΔEST and good solubility. For the main system, we chose poly-[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th) as the polymer donor, whose absorption spectrum overlaps with the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of QAO-DAd. 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-(((4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-sindaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(methanylyidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (IEICO-4F) was utilized as a small molecule acceptor. This system is conducive to the occurrence of FRET. When QAO-DAd content is 10%, the achieved PCE is 13.01%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.71 V, a JSC of 25.94 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 71.56%. The average PCE of the ternary OSCs (12.72%) was higher than that of the binary OSCs (11.39%). The addition of QAO-DAd enhanced the exciton dissociation efficiency and improved the active layer's morphology. Furthermore, QAO-DAd was also used in the PTO2:IT-4F system, which meets the FRET condition. The average PCE of the optimized devices reached up to 13.59%. The results indicate that adding a suitable DF material as the third component of OSCs can prolong the diffusion length of excitons and thus improve device performance.

QAO-DAd was synthesized by our lab's own synthesis method that has been published in previous articles. The donor and acceptor materials were bought from Solarmer Materials Inc. For the purpose of guaranteeing the reliability of the experimental results, the same batch of materials was used in the experiments. Poly(2,3-dihydrothieno-1,4-dioxin)–poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and MoO3 were bought from Xi’an p-OLED Technology Corp. Other related materials and solutions used in this work were purchased from Alfa Chemical Inc. or Sigma-Aldrich Co. and used directly.


In this work, all devices adopted an inverted structure, and the device structure is indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. ZnO (30 nm) was obtained by hot annealing in air with a mixture of 110 mg of zinc acetate dihydrate, 31 mg of ethanolamine and 1 mL of 2-methoxyethanol. After cleaning the glass substrates covered with ITO (sheet resistance = 15 Ω sq−1) to remove surface dust and stains, ultrasound was successively used in the environments of ethanol, acetone and ethanol for 30 minutes each. Then, an ultraviolet-ozone lamp was used to illuminate the substrate for 30 minutes to improve its surface environment. The ZnO solution was applied via spin-coating onto the substrate and then placing on an annealing table at 200 °C for 1 h to promote the formation of ZnO films (30 nm). The parameters of the rotator were 5000 rpm for 30 s. Chlorobenzene (CB) was selected as the active layer materials’ solvent; it was necessary that the solution was prepared one day in advance, and it was stirred in a nitrogen environment for more than 10 h and then spin-coated on the ZnO films. For the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F system, the rotator's parameters were 1500 rpm for 40 s, and for the PTO2:IT-4F system, the rotator's parameters were 1000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, 10 nm of MoO3 and 150 nm of Ag were obtained above the active layer as the cavity transport layer and anode of the device, respectively, using vacuum evaporation with a shadow mask.


The absorption spectra of the monomer and the blended films were measured using a Hitachi U-3010 UV-VS. PL spectra and transient PL spectra were recorded using an F-4600 spectrophotometer and an Edinburgh FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer, respectively. Surface free energy was studied using the contact angle of H2O and CH2I2 using a CAM200 instrument. The current density versus voltage (J–V) curve was determined with AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight using a Newport Oriel Sol3A simulator and processed by the software of a Keithley 2400 source meter instrument. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was determined using a QEX10 Quantum 16 efficiency measurement system (PV Measurements Inc.). Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was measured at the BL16B station of the Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Shanghai for the analysis of molecular crystallization and accumulation characteristics. All the samples were irradiated with 10 keV X-ray and the incidence angle for the test sample was 0.09–0.15°. The surface morphology of the active layer was characterized via atomic force microscopy (AFM, MFP-3D-BIO) and the phase separation of the blend films was characterized via transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Hitachi HT7700). The space-charge limited current (SCLC) method was used to calculate the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities. The hole- and electron-only devices were made with the structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MOO3 (10 nm)/Au (80 nm) and ITO/ZnO/active layer/LiF (1 nm)/Ag (120 nm), respectively. And the corresponding calculation formula is

and

in which
εr represents the relative permittivity, ε0 stands for the vacuum permittivity, V symbolizes the applied voltage, L represents the thickness of the active layer (≈130 nm), β is a field-dependent factor and is positively related to the Poole–Frenkel coefficient, μ0 represents the zero electric field mobility and μ represents the device field-dependency mobility. Vbi stands for the calibration voltage (for calculating μh, Vbi = 0, and for calculating μe, Vbi = 0.45).


The OSCs were fabricated by applying an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag, and the active layer adopted the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:QAO-DAd system, in which the quantity of QAO-DAd changed. Fig. 1(a) shows the molecular structures of PTB7-Th, IEICO-4F and QAO-DAd. It can be seen that IEICO-4F is a main-chain planar molecule, which benefits the improvement of the OSCs’ charge transport performance. QAO-DAd has two hydroacridine (DMAC) and one tertiary butyl group, which improves the solubility of the molecule. Meanwhile, acridine has strong electron donating ability, which can promote the exciton transmission process. Fig. 1(b) shows the normalized absorption spectra of the pure PTB7-Th, IEICO-4F and QAO-DAd films, respectively. The absorption range of QAO-DAd is 300 to 500 nm, which is complementary to the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F system, improving the absorption capacity of the active layer. The absorption spectra of PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F films with different concentrations of QAO-DAd are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI). After adding QAO-DAd, the blend films exhibit extensive absorption characteristics in the range of 300–880 nm. The enhanced absorption may be due to the complementary absorption between QAO-DAd and the main system material and the improved morphology of the active layer.


Fig. 1(c) shows the energy-level diagram of the materials applied in the inverted OSCs. QAO-DAd holds the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level of −5.05 eV and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level of −2.49 eV. QAO-DAd and PTB7-Th form a cascade-energy-level structure, which can facilitate the charge transmission process. To study the charge transfer between QAO-DAd and PTB7-Th, OSCs with the structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:m% QAO-DAd/MOO3/Ag were fabricated, where the PTB7-Th concentration was fixed at 8 mg mL−1, and m represents the mass ratio of QAO-DAd and PTB7-Th (m = 0, 30, 50, 80 and 100 wt%). The J–V curves of the corresponding OSCs are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI). Fig. S2 (ESI) shows that the JSC values of the blend films are lower than that of the pure PTB7-Th device, indicating that charge transfer did not occur between PTB7-Th and QAO-DAd. It is worth mentioning that QAO-DAd has a low ΔEST of 0.01 eV, which can promote the RISC process and extend singlet exciton lifetime.

Fig. 2(a) exhibits the normalized PL spectra of the PTB7-Th:QAO-DAd system (excitation wavelength = 450 nm) and the normalized absorption of the PTB7-Th film. The PL spectrum of the pure QAO-DAd film is 500–750 nm with a peak at 585 nm, which overlaps with the absorption spectrum of PTB7-Th, indicating that efficient energy transfer from QAO-DAd to PTB7-Th may occur. For the blend films, the emission signals of QAO-DAd disappear, which is the result of FRET between QAO-DAd and PTB7-Th. For the PTB7-Th:QAO-DAd system, QAO-DAd acts as an energy donor and PTB7-Th acts as an energy acceptor. QAO-DAd can capture photons and transfer the energy of the excited state to PTB7-Th. This process can improve the ability of the active layer to capture photons and thus improve the JSC of the OSCs. Fig. 2(b) shows the transient PL decays of unmixed QAO-DAd, unmixed PTB7-Th and PTB7-Th:10% QAO-DAd based films, for the sake of clarifying whether QAO-DAd's excitons have been transferred to PTB7-Th. Table S1 (ESI) displays the relevant photophysical parameters. The blend film is excited at 430 nm (the intrinsic absorption peak of QAO-DAd) and its emission wavelength is at 760 nm. There is almost no absorption intensity of PTB7-Th at 430 nm; however, its fluorescence emission intensity can be easily detected at this wavelength, indicating that the excitons in PTB7-Th are transferred from QAO-DAd to PTB7-Th via FRET again. From the data presented in Table S1 (ESI), the pure QAO-DAd shows a clearly delayed fluorescence phenomenon with a lifetime of 10.7 microsecond, while the pure PTB7-Th exhibits an ultra-short lifetime of 6.1 nanosecond. After adding 10% QAO-DAd into PTB7-Th, the lifetime of the blended film lengthened obviously, with a lifetime of 4.5 microsecond. The fluorescence lifetime of the blended film is longer than that of the pure PTB7-Th film, which indicates that the lifetime of the excitons in PTB7-Th has been extended.

Fig. 2(c) displays the measurement results of the contact angles. The surface free energy of the different materials can be calculated through contact angle measurement, to comprehend the location of the third component in the ternary blended films. Generally, materials with a similar surface free energy tend to be distributed in the same phase domain. The surface free energy of QAO-DAd, PTB7-Th and IEICO-4F was calculated to be 50.63, 32.75 and 41.48 mN m−1, respectively. QAO-DAd has the largest value compared with the other molecules, from which we can infer that QAO-DAd molecules could be in the middle of the crystallized PTB7-Th and IEICO-4F domains (as shown in Fig. 2(d)). The distance between PTB7-Th and QAO-DAd is closely related to the efficiency of FRET and also affects device performance.
A longer exciton lifetime ensures that more excitons spread to the donor and acceptor interfaces for dissociation. At the same time, the QAO-DAd molecule is located between the donor and the acceptor, and it can pass long-lifetime excitons to the vicinity of the boundary of the donor domain through FRET, promote the diffusion of excitons near the donor boundary, and reduce the influence of exciton diffusion caused by exciton traps inside the crystal domain. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the addition of DF material QAO-DAd on the exciton diffusion length of the active layer. Exciton diffusion length is designated according to the root mean square displacement of the particle from the beginning position caused by the diffusion process. The specific calculation formula is as follows:
(3)
where
Z is the dimensionality, D represents the diffusion coefficient and τ stands for particle lifetime.

It can be seen from eqn (3) that the diffusion coefficient and particle lifetime determine the exciton diffusion length, which is positively correlated with them. From the previous analysis, it can be concluded that the addition of QAO-DAd can prolong the lifetime of the active layer excitons, and FRET can raise the exciton diffusion coefficient in the active layer. Therefore, the diffusion length of excitons can be extended by adding a delayed fluorescence material as the third element into the OSCs.
To find the appropriate QAO-DAd content to obtain the best device performance, J–V curves were plotted, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The relevant photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The optimized PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F binary OSCs achieved a champion PCE of 11.46% (VOC = 0.71 V, JSC = 24.43 mA cm−2 and FF = 66.55%). After adding 10% QAO-DAd to the active layer, the PCE of the OSCs was improved to 13.01% (VOC = 0.71V, JSC = 25.94 mA cm−2 and FF = 71.56%). Compared to the binary devices, the enhancement of the JSC in the ternary devices benefits from the increase of exciton lifetime and diffusion length by the introduction of QAO-DAd. The enhanced FF was due to the balanced charge transport and morphology improvement in the active layer. Upon further increasing QAO-DAd content, the JSC decreased, which may be due to the enhancement of a bimolecular effect resulting from the increase of the exciton diffusion length, thus affecting the charge transmission and collection. The FF drops off possibly because of trap-assisted recombination and the variation of morphology.

EQE characteristics are demonstrated in Fig. 3(b) to understand the photoresponse of the OSCs. With the introduction of QAO-DAd, the EQEs show a significant improvement at 340–440 nm, which is attributed to the absorption of QAO-DAd, because QAO-DAd has an absorption peak in this range, while PTB7-Th and IEICO-4F present low absorption. QAO-DAd transfers long-lifetime excitons to PTB7-Th through FRET, which increases the exciton amount in PTB7-Th and promotes the process of exciton dissociation and charge transport. And the increased EQE around 610 nm may due to the improved exciton dissociation efficiency caused by the improved ternary device morphology. Finally, the EQE presents an overall improvement with an obvious enhancement in the range of 340–440 nm. Through inspection, the deviation between the Jcalc values of OSCs obtained by EQE spectra and the measured JSC values was found to be less than 5%.
To study the impact of the DF material on cell stability, we put the unpacked binary and ternary OSCs in an air environment and tested the PCE changes with time under the conditions of 1 sun illumination and 60 °C heating. The thermal stability of the binary and ternary OSCs can be seen in Fig. 3(c). After heating for 300 minutes on a 60 °C hot bench, the ternary devices with 10% QAO-DAd maintained 88.73% of their original performance, while the binary components maintained 75.58% of their original performance. Fig. 3(d) shows the photostability of the binary and ternary OSCs measured under 1 sun continuous illumination. After 300 minutes of irradiation, the ternary devices keep 57.97% of their original device PCEs, while the binary devices keep only 41.23% of their original device PCEs. The stability of the QAO-DAd-based ternary devices is somewhat higher than that of the binary devices in the same testing environment, indicating that the introduction of QAO-DAd can actually help improve the light stability of the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F system. The test results of thermal stability and optical stability indicate that the introduction of QAO-DAd can improve the stability of the devices, which is valuable for the practical application of ternary OSC devices.
For the purpose of researching the recombination behavior in the active layers after doping QAO-DAd, we researched the relationship of light intensity with JSC and VOC. Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the related results. Normally, the relationship between JSC and light is JSC ∝ Pslight, in which Plight represents light intensity. If the exponential factor s is close to unity, bimolecular recombination is inhibited. It can be seen from Fig. 4(a) that the s values of the OSCs based on PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:QAO-DAd containing 0%, 10% and 20% QAO-DAd are 0.982, 0.993 and 0.989, respectively, indicating that adding QAO-DAd into the active layer can suppress bimolecular recombination. The formula VOC ∝ nKT/qln(Plight) is used to describe the degree of trap-assisted recombination, in which K represents the Boltzmann constant, T stands for absolute temperature and q is the elementary charge. In Fig. 4(b), the s value represents the slope of the VOC–Plight curve, which should be far from 1.00KT/q when trap-assisted recombination is involved. The s values of the devices with 0%, 10% and 20% QAO-DAd are 1.62, 1.44 and 1.59 KT/q, respectively, indicating that the introduction of QAO-DAd can restrain trap-assisted recombination. In summary, adding 10% QAO-DAd to PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F OSCs can suppress bimolecular recombination and trap-assisted recombination.
To analyze the charge dynamics process in the active layers, the photocurrent density (Jph = JL − JD) dependence and the effective voltage (Veff = V0 − V) of the OSCs were investigated, as shown in Fig. 4(c). JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark. V0 represents the voltage when Jph = 0 mA cm−2. V symbolizes the applied voltage. When Veff is about 2 V, the Jph values of the OSCs reach saturation, and we record the Jph value as the saturation value (Jsat). The ratio of JSC/Jsat can be calculated to obtain the exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss), and the ratio of Jpower/Jsat can be calculated to obtain the charge collection efficiency (ηcoll), in which Jpower represents the current density at which the maximal product of the applied voltage and the corresponding current value can be obtained. The ηdiss/ηcoll values of PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F containing 0%, 10% and 20% QAO-DAd were calculated to be 90.87%/72.36%, 94.24%/84.21% and 89.24%/71.90%, respectively. That indicates introducing an appropriate amount of QAO-DAd can promote the generation and dissociation of excitons, so the electrode can collect more charges. The result is consistent with the fact that adding QAO-DAd can prolong the exciton lifetime and increase the exciton diffusion length.
The SCLC method was implemented to study the effect of the addition of QAO-DAd on the charge transmission properties. The corresponding mobility curves are shown in Fig. 4(d) and (e). The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F OSCs with different QAO-DAd contents are exhibited in Fig. 4(f). The μh and μe of the binary devices are, respectively, 9.90 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.37 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 having a high μh/μe value of approximately 29. With the increased content of QAO-DAd, μh decreases and μe increases, thus the μh/μe value moves gradually closer to 1.00. When adding 10% QAO-DAd, the μh and μe of the OSCs are, respectively, 6.94 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.72 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, reducing the μh/μe value to approximately 4. The addition of QAO-DAd as the third material into OSCs is helpful to the balance of charge transmission, thus promoting exciton dissociation and charge transport efficiency.
The mobility value in the OSCs is tightly bound to the molecular arrangement in the active layer.43 For the research of the molecular arrangement and crystallization of the blended films, the GIWAXS images of the blended films were measured. The 2D GIWAXS images and the 1D cut-line profiles in the out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) directions are shown in Fig. 5. Compared with the binary film, the 10% QAO-DAd-containing ternary film showed a smaller scattering signal at 3.25 nm−1 in the IP direction, with a smaller lamellar stacking distance of 19.32 Å to that of the binary film (19.47 Å). For the control film, the π–π stacking peak (010) is obvious at 18.37 nm−1 (d = 3.42 Å) in the OOP direction. The (010) peak is mainly related to the crystallization of IEICO-4F. The strong (010) peak indicates that the active layer is more inclined to the face-on orientation, which benefits the charge transfer process. With the addition of QAO-DAd, the position of the OOP (010) diffraction peak moves to a higher q value position, indicating that the IEICO-4F stacking interval becomes smaller. When 10% QAO-DAd is added into the binary film, the (010) peak moves to a slightly larger q (= 18.52 nm−1) in the OOP direction, and the corresponding stack spacing is 3.39 Å. When the content of QAO-DAd increases to 20%, the (010) peak appears at 18.63 nm−1 (d = 3.37 Å) in the OOP direction. In order to measure the size of the crystallites, the crystal coherence length (CCL) was calculated from the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the (010) peak of IEICO-4F using the Sherry equation  and the related parameters are recorded in Table 2. The CCL values of PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:QAO-DAd blended films with 0%, 10% and 20% QAO-DAd contents are 3.13, 3.22 and 3.39 nm, respectively. The slight increase of CCL values indicated that introduction of QAO-DAd could facilitate electron transport and increase electron mobility. In conclusion, the addition of QAO-DAd can improve the poor aggregation of IEICO-4F and facilitate the formation of the acceptor domain, thus promoting the dissociation and transmission of charge, which corresponds with the improved JSC and FF. Furthermore, the addition of QAO-DAd did not disrupt the accumulation properties and crystal orientation of the host system, which proved that the QAO-DAd molecule may be located out of the donor and acceptor domains.

To study the influence of QAO-DAd on the morphology of the blended films, we measured the active layer morphology using AFM and TEM. It can be seen from Fig. 6(a)–(c) that the root-mean-square roughness (RMS) increases gradually when adding QAO-DAd to the binary film. PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:10% QAO-DAd shows a relatively higher roughness with the RMS value of 3.42 nm, higher than that of the control film (RMS = 3.05 nm). The RMS of the 20% QAO-DAd content film (RMS = 3.48 nm) is similar to that of the 10% QAO-DAd content film. The increase of RMS may be related to the enhancement of IEICO-4F crystal growth upon adding QAO-DAd. Fig. 6(d)–(f) display the TEM images of the blended films. The binary film shows distinct phase separation, which may block charge transfer and decrease FF. The film with 10% QAO-DAd content shows excellent phase separation at the nanometer level, and the mixing of donor and acceptor is more uniform, which is helpful to exciton disaggregation and charge transfer. When the QAO-DAd content increased to 20%, a larger crystalline block appears, which may be caused by over-crystallization of IEICO-4F. These phenomena suggest that adding a proper amount of QAO-DAd can improve the morphology of the blended films, benefit the charge transmission and improve the performance of OSCs. The optimized morphology may also improve the stability of the OSCs.
Furthermore, we added QAO-DAd to the PTO2:IT-4F system to study the universality of DF materials in extending the exciton diffusion length of OSCs and improving device performance. Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI) show the molecular structure and energy levels of PTO2 and IT-4F. Fig. 7(a) exhibits the normalized absorption spectra of PTO2 and IT-4F. PTO2 shows strong absorption at 400 nm to 600 nm, which overlaps the PL spectrum of QAO-DAd, indicating that high-efficiency FRET may happen between QAO-DAd and PTO2. The absorption spectra of the control device and the optimal ternary devices are shown in Fig. 7(b). It can be seen that adding QAO-DAd to the PTO2:IT-4F system can slightly improve the absorption intensity, which is conducive to photon capture. The contact angles for pure PTO2 and IT-4F were measured and their calculated surface free energies are 35.71 mN m−1 and 36.40 mN m−1, respectively. The result indicated that QAO-DAd molecules could be in the middle between the crystallized donor and acceptor domains. Fig. 7(c) shows the J–V curves of the PTO2:IT-4F binary device and the optimal ternary device with 10% QAO-DAd content, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are collected in Table 3. The optimized ternary OSC achieves a champion PCE of 14.07% (JSC = 22.87 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.90 V, and FF = 68.11%), better than that of the control device (PCE = 13.01%, JSC = 21.92 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.90 V, and FF = 66.17%). The higher JSC and FF of the ternary devices are probably due to the high exciton dissociation rate due to the improvement of the exciton diffusion length and the improved morphology. Fig. 7(d) exhibits the EQE curves of PTO2:IT-4F:QAO-DAd OSCs. In comparison with the control device, the EQE values of the ternary device are improved. Fig. 8(a) and (b) show the 2D GIWAXS diagrams of the PTO2:IT-4F and PTO2:IT-4F:10% QAO-DAd containing blended films. For the ternary film, the OOP π–π stacking peak is relatively obvious at 17.59 nm−1 (d = 3.57 Å), compared with the binary film (q = 17.18 nm−1, and d = 3.66 Å). The CCL values of the binary and ternary films are 1.36 nm and 1.43 nm, respectively. The addition of QAO-DAd reduces the crystal spacing, enlarges the domain size of the main materials, and facilitates the exciton dissociation and charge transmission. Fig. 8(c) and (d) exhibit the TEM images of the blended films. The optimized device exhibits nanoscale phase separation, while the binary device has a large crystal domain. After adding an appropriate amount of QAO-DAd, the optimized morphology promotes the process of exciton dissociation, and charge transmission and collection. These studies show that the ternary strategy of adding DF materials can prolong the exciton diffusion length and improve the morphology, which can improve the device performance. However, the selection rules and molecular distribution of DF materials still need further study.

In summary, a new method to extend the exciton diffusion length is presented by introducing the DF material QAO-DAd as the third component into the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F system. QAO-DAd can provide PTB7-Th with long lifetime excitons through FRET, thus improving the exciton diffusion length and promoting exciton dissociation and charge transmission processes. When the content of QAO-DAd is 10%, the ternary devices exhibit the optimal performance with an average PCE of 12.72%, higher than that of the control devices (11.39%). Meanwhile, JSC enhances from 24.43 to 25.94 mA cm−2 due to the increased dissociation rate caused by the extended exciton diffusion length. The enhancement of FF from 66.55% to 71.56% is due to the optimized morphology caused by the introduction of QAO-DAd. The addition of QAO-DAd also improves the thermal and light stability of the ternary OSCs. Moreover, we also applied QAO-DAd to the PTO2:IT-4F system, which meets the conditions of FRET generation and investigated the applicability of the ternary strategy. The optimized ternary devices achieved a champion PCE of 14.07% (JSC = 22.87 mA cm−2, FF = and 68.11%), better than that of the control devices (PCE = 13.01%, JSC = 21.92 mA cm−2, and FF = 66.17%). This demonstrates that QAO-DAd materials have good applicability in improving OSC performance. This work provides an easy and convenient way to enhance the exciton diffusion length of OSCs, and achieves a breakthrough in the OSC performance.
