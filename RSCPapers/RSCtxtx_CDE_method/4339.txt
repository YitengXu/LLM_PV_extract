The effect of double blocking layers on the Sb2S3-sensitized all solid state solar cell are investigated. Thin layers of ZrO2 (blocking layer 1, BL1) and ZnS (blocking layer 2, BL2) are introduced at the TiO2/Sb2S3 and Sb2S3/hole transporting material (HTM) interfaces. The presence of BL1 is found to improve the open-circuit voltage (Voc) from 457 mV to 618 mV, whereas BL2 improves mainly short-circuit current density (Jsc) from 11.1 mA cm−2 to 14.0 mA cm−2. Transient photovoltage confirms that the BL1 efficiently blocks charge recombination, responsible for the Voc enhancement, whereas the BL2 has little effect on suppression of charge recombination. Surface modification of Sb2S3 by BL2, on the other hand, leads to recovery of Sb2S3 from the surface oxidized Sb2O5, which affects the Jsc increment. The present results suggest that the TiO2/Sb2S3 interface is the main pathway for charge recombination rather than the Sb2S3/HTM interface. Double blocking layers enhanced the power conversion efficiency by 30%.

Since the first report on the solid-state sensitized mesoscopic solar cell in 1998, it has been regarded as a platform technology for an inorganic–organic hybrid type p–i–n junction structure. As a sensitizer for this device, diverse materials can be used such as molecular dyes or inorganic semiconductors in the form of quantum dots. The sensitizer is deposited on the mesoporous TiO2 surface, which is in contact with a hole transporting material (HTM) such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-p-dimethoxy-phenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD). Photo-excitation of the sensitizer produces electron–hole excitons that are subsequently separated in the respective electron and hole materials. The photovoltage is determined by the difference in the quasi-Fermi level between the electron- and hole-transporting solids.

The first solid-state sensitized solar cell empolyed a conventional organometallic dye, coded N719, which showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of less than 1%. Synthesis of organic dyes with high absorption coefficients and formulation of spiro-MeOTAD solution have boosted PCEs up to 7%. In the solid-state sensitized solar cell, the mesoporous TiO2 layer thickness is limited to less than 2 μm because of the limited hole diffusion length of HTM materials, which reduces the total surface area for the adsorbing sensitizer. Inorganic semiconductors have been adopted in the thin film TiO2 based solid state sensitized structure because of a higher absorption coefficient than molecular dyes. Among the inorganic sensitizers, Sb2S3 demonstrated the highest PCEs of around 6%, which is in part due to the high absorption coefficient of ∼105 cm−1 in the visible region. More recently, organolead iodide perovskite materials demonstrated PCE higher than 15% and approaching 20%.
Despite the advantages of Sb2S3 such as high absorption coefficients, long-term stability and tunable band gap, it suffers from low photovoltage. The open-circuit voltages (Voc) of the Sb2S3-sensitized solid state devices were reported to be much lower than the theoretical voltage. This problem is often found not only from Sb2S3 but also from most chalcogenide quantum dots. The low Voc could be attributed to a significant recombination at TiO2/Sb2S3 interfaces and/or Sb2S3/HTM interfaces. It was reported that surface treatment of Sb2S3 deposited TiO2 with a 1-decyl phosphonic acid (DPA) improved photovoltaic performance mainly due to longer electron lifetime after the DPA surface treatment. Surface treatment of TiO2 with various insulating oxides in the TiO2/Sb2S3/CuSCN configuration was reported to improve PCE from 2.8% to 4.1% because of surface passivation against recombination of the injected electrons in TiO2. The previous observations indicate that both interfaces could provide the recombination pathways. However, it has not been determined whether both interfaces contribute equally to the charge recombination or if there is a major recombination pathway. Further improvement can be expected if the exact role of each interface is clarified in Sb2S3-sensitized solid state solar cells.
We report here on the effect of double blocking layers at TiO2/Sb2S3 and Sb2S3/HTM interfaces in the Sb2S3-sensitized solid state solar cell on photovoltaic performance to determine a major recombination pathway. ZrO2 is introduced between TiO2 and Sb2S3, which is denoted as a blocking layer 1 (BL1) and ZnS is introduced between Sb2S3 and spiro-MeOTAD, which is denoted as blocking layer 2 (BL2). Investigation of the role of each blocking layer’s photovoltaic performance is investigated for the TiO2/BL2/Sb2S3/BL2/spiro-MeOTAD configuration with double blocking layers. ZrO2 is selected as BL1 due to a higher conduction band edge than TiO2, and its chemical compatibility to TiO2. ZnS is selected as BL2 due to a lower valence band edge than HTM, and its chemical compatibility to Sb2S3.

50 nm-sized anatase TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized using 20 nm-sized TiO2 nanoparticles as a seed. The seed TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by autoclaving a hydrolyzed solution of titanium(IV) isoproxide (97%, Aldrich) at 230 °C for 12 h. To prepare nonaqueous TiO2 paste, water in the TiO2 colloid solution was replaced with ethanol. The ethanol solution of TiO2 nanoparticle was mixed with terpineol (Aldrich, 99.5%), ethyl cellulose (Aldrich, 46 cp) and lauric acid (Fluka, 96%) and ethanol was evaporated to get viscous TiO2 paste. The paste was further treated using a three-roll-mill apparatus to disperse the nanoparticles sufficiently. The nominal composition of TiO2:terpineol:ethylcellulose:lauric acid was about 1.25:6:0.3:0.1. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (Pilkington, TEC-8, 8 Ω sq−1) was cleaned by UV/ozone treatment and sonication with ethanol. The FTO surface was covered with a thin compact TiO2 layer prior to depositing the nanocrystalline TiO2 paste by spin-coating the 0.15 M 1-butanol solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt%, Aldrich) at a stepwise spin rate of 700 rpm for 8 s → 1000 rpm for 10 s → 2000 rpm for 40 s, followed by drying at 125 °C for 5 min. The spin-coating and drying process was repeated using a 0.3 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution. The compact layer was finally annealed at 500 °C for 15 min. The nanocrystalline TiO2 paste was deposited on the compact blocking layer coated FTO glass using screen printing technique and subsequently annealed at 550 °C for 1 h in a muffle furnace to obtain a mesoporous TiO2 film. The thickness of the annealed mesoporous TiO2 layer was measured to be 1.5 ± 0.2 μm by an alpha-step IQ surface profiler (KAL Tencor). The annealed TiO2 film was immersed in the 20 mM TiCl4 (Aldrich) aqueous solution at 70 °C for 10 min. The substrates were washed with distilled water and dried under air flow, which was followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min.


A 2-propanol solution of 0.04 M zirconium(IV) butoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, 80 wt% in 1-butanol) was prepared under an argon atmosphere and used as the precursor solution to form the blocking layer on TiO2 surface. 20 μL of the precursor solution was spin-coated on the annealed mesoporous TiO2 film at a spin rate of 4000 rpm for 20 s. The film was then dried under N2 flow. After drying at room temperature, the film was annealed at 500 °C for 20 min in air. The thickness was controlled by varying the precursor concentration and the number of spin coating/annealing cycles.


The Sb2S3 layer was deposited by chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. Mesoporous TiO2 film pre-treated with UV/ozone for 30 min was dipped in the bath containing 1.3 g SbCl3 (Aldrich, 99.99%) in 5 mL acetone (Samchun, 99.9%), 50 mL of 1 M Na2S2O3 (Fluka) and 145 mL of distilled water for 70 min at 10 °C. The as-deposited films were annealed at 330 °C for 30 min under Ar atmosphere, where the orange color turned to dark brown after annealing. The Sb2S3 deposited substrate was cooled down to 300 °C in Ar atmosphere and then quenched at 300 °C in air.


Precursor solutions for ZnS were prepared by mixing 0.02 M ZnCl (0.01363 g, Sigma-Aldrich, reagent grade, >98%) for Zn2+ source and 0.04 M thiourea (0.01522 g, Sigma-Aldrich, ACS reagent, >99%) for S2− source in deionized water (5 mL) under an Ar atmosphere. 30 μL of precursor solution was spin-coated onto the Sb2S3 coated TiO2 film at a spin rate of 4000 rpm for 20 s and subsequently dried on a hot plate at 200 °C for 10 min.


Solid-state Sb2S3 sensitized solar cells were fabricated by infiltration of spiro-MeOTAD into the Sb2S3 adsorbed mesoporous TiO2 layer. The composition of HTM was 0.08 M spiro-MeOTAD, 0.198 M 4-tert-butylpyridine and 64 mM Li salt as described elsewhere. 30 μL of HTM solution was spin-coated onto the Sb2S3 coated TiO2 film at 0 rpm for 20 s and 2500 rpm for 30 s. The counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation of silver under 1.0 × 10−5 Torr at 7.0–8.0 Å s−1. The thickness of Ag was adjusted to 200 nm. The active area of the device was 0.125 cm2.


The absorption spectra of the film were recorded by a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Agilent 8453) in the wavelength range 300 nm to 900 nm. Photocurrent and voltage were measured using a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A class AAA) equipped with 450 W Xenon lamp (Newport 6279NS) and a Keithley 2400 source meter. The NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with KG-2 filter was used to adjust light intensity to one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). While measuring photocurrent and voltage, the cell was covered with an aperture mask. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a specially designed EQE system (PV measurement Inc.). A 75 W xenon lamp (USHIO, Japan) was used as a white light source to generate a monochromatic beam. Calibration was conducted using NIST-calibrated photodiode G425 as a standard. EQE data were collected at DC mode. The deposited blocking layers of ZrO2 and ZnS were investigated using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra were obtained using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-7600F) to determine the presence of the blocking layers. The time constants for charge recombination were obtained from the transient photovoltage. The cells were probed with a weak laser pulse at 532 nm superimposed on a relatively large, background (bias) illumination at 680 nm. The details on the transient setup and data collection are described elsewhere.



Fig. 1 shows HR-TEM images before and after surface modifications of TiO2 and Sb2S3 with ZrO2 and ZnS. Compared to the bare TiO2 (Fig. 1a), thin layers are seen on the TiO2 surface after surface modification. It is clear from the enlarged TEM images that ZrO2 are conformally coated on the TiO2 surface with thickness of about 1 nm (Fig. 1b). A lattice fringe appears on the surface of TiO2, which is different from that of the core TiO2 particles as can be seen in the inset of Fig. 1b. This indicates that the surface deposited ZrO2 has crystallinity to some extent. For the case of Sb2S3 in Fig. 1c, a thin layer of Sb2S3 forms on the TiO2 surface with thickness ranging between 2.3 and 4.7 nm. After deposition of ZnS on the Sb2S3 layer, a rather conformal coating is made with thickness of about 4.8 nm, which is, however, not obviously distinguished from Sb2S3 (Fig. 1d). The lack of a distinct boundary between Sb2S3 and ZnS is probably related to the similar bond distance between Sb–S and Zn–S due to similar cation radius between Zn2+ (74 pm) and Sb3+ (76 pm). The deposition of blocking layers is further clarified by EDX analysis.

The EDX spectra are obtained with the TiO2/ZrO2 and TiO2/Sb2S3/ZnS samples in Fig. 2. Zr is presented in the TiO2/ZrO2 sample, which indicates that the thin layer as observed from TEM measurement is confirmed to be ZrO2. Zn is also detected along with Sb and S, which implies that the thin layer on the TiO2 surface (Fig. 1d) is composed of both ZnS and Sb2S3.

The effect of ZrO2 (blocking layer 1, BL1) on photovoltaic performance is first investigated. J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters are compared before and after BL1 addition in Fig. 3 and Table 1. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) is significantly improved from 0.457 V to 0.618 V after introduction of BL1 onto the TiO2 surface, while little changes in short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) are observed. As a consequence of the 35% increment in Voc, the PCE increases from 2.87% to 3.82%. The improvement of Voc indicates that the Fermi level of TiO2 is higher for the surface modified TiO2 compared to the bare TiO2, possibly due to an improved electron lifetime by suppression in charge recombination. It can be postulated that the ZrO2 layer blocks the recombination of the injected electrons in TiO2. Transient photovoltage decay is compared before and after the introduction of ZrO2 thin layer on TiO2 surface in order to investigate the recombination behavior.

Fig. 4 shows transient photovoltage profiles of Sb2S3-sensitized TiO2 with and without BL1. A slower decay is observed for the TiO2 with BL1 (Fig. 4b) compared to the TiO2 without BL1 (Fig. 4a), indicative of slower charge recombination in the presence of BL1. The time constant for charge recombination is estimated to be twice as long for the TiO2 with BL1 (τ = 7.73 × 10−4 s) than for the bare TiO2 (τ = 3.88 × 10−4 s). It is thus obvious that the ZrO2 layer effectively blocks charge recombination, which is responsible for the higher Voc.
Before investigating the role of the second blocking layer, the effect of the BL1 layer thickness is investigated. Fig. 5 shows the dependence of photovoltaic parameters on the zirconia precursor concentration. The growth of ZrO2 layer thickness can be controlled by either the precursor concentration or the number of coating cycles. We vary the precursor concentration to control the ZrO2 thickness instead of using the non-reproducible coating cycle method. When the precursor concentration is 0.02, Jsc slightly increases but starts to decrease as the concentration is higher than 0.02 M. Similar tendency is observed for FF. However, Voc increases continuously with increasing concentration upto 0.04 M. Due to the relatively large increment of Voc from 0.45 V to 0.61 V, PCE reaches maximum at 0.04 M. This means that efficiency is mainly dependent on open circuit voltage, which confirms again the role of BL1. For the further study on double blocking layers, we select the precursor concentration of 0.04 M for BL1.

The effect of ZnS (blocking layer 2, BL2) on photovoltaic performance is investigated. In Fig. 6, J–V curves are compared before and after introduction of BL2 on Sb2S3, both Jsc and Voc are improved after surface treatment of Sb2S3 with ZnS. The photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The increment of Jsc from 11.1 mA cm−2 to 14.0 mA cm−2, corresponding to a 26% increment, is relatively more pronounced than the Voc from 0.512 V to 0.545 V (6.4% increment). IPCE spectra in Fig. 6b confirm that photocurrent increases at entire wavelength, where the calculated current density values based on the IPCE data are in good agreement with the observed Jsc values. Due to the fact that the presence of BL2 improves mainly Jsc, the average PCE is improved from 2.99% to 4.55%. Since there is no noticeable enhancement in Voc after the introduction of BL2 on Sb2S3, it can be said that the interface between Sb2S3 and spiro-MeOTAD is less critical for charge recombination compared to the TiO2/Sb2S3 interface.

Transient photovoltage confirms that the surface treatment of Sb2S3 hardly retards the recombination kinetics as can be seen in Fig. 7. Time constants obtained from the best fit are 4.35 × 10−4 s and 4.78 × 10−4 s before and after BL2, respectively. Little difference in the time constant underlines that recombination at the Sb2S3/HTM interface can be negligible. A slightly improved Voc is therefore likely to be related to the increased photocurrent, associated with the increased density of the injected electrons, rather than the recombination issue.
To understand the basis for the increased Jsc by the surface modification of Sb2S3 with ZnS, UV-vis absorbance is measured and compared before and after BL2 in Fig. 8. Absorbance is found to increase after BL2, where the degree of increment in absorbance becomes significant as wavelength decreases from 700 nm to 500, which agrees well with the tendency in the IPCE improvement as observed in Fig. 6b. Since Sb2S3 deposited electrode was quenched in air at 300 °C, Sb2S3 surface could be oxidized to Sb2O5. Surface treatment of Sb2S3 with ZnS may lead to the reduction of the oxidized layer on the Sb2S3 surface. If this process is involved, the absolute amount of Sb2S3 will increase after ZnS treatment. To clarify this possibility, elemental analysis is conducted.

Fig. 9 shows EDX elemental mapping images of the TiO2/Sb2S3 and TiO2/Sb2S3/ZnS particles, and in Table 3 atomic percentage of each component is listed. Little change in the atomic percentage of Sb is observed, while the sulfur atomic percentage is significantly increased after ZnS coating. When taking the S content in ZnS into consideration, the ratio of S to Sb is estimated and found to be largely increased from ca. 9–40% after ZnS coating. In addition, oxygen is relatively reduced after ZnS coating. Elemental analysis implies that the surface Sb2O5 is in part reduced to Sb2S3 by ZnS coating, which eventually leads to an increase in the amount of the adsorbed Sb2S3 on TiO2. The increased Jsc is thus attributed to the increased amount of Sb2S3 by a surface reduction mechanism as depicted schematically in Fig. 10.

Based on the understanding of the main role of each blocking layer, we finally investigate effect of double blocking layers on photovoltaic performance. TiO2 surface is first covered conformally with the 1 nm-thick ZrO2 layer, which is followed by coating Sb2S3 and then Sb2S3 surface is finally modified by ZnS. As can be seen in Fig. 11, Jsc and Voc are substantially improved after the introduction of double blocking layers. Changes in photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 4, where Jsc increases by 14%, Voc by 13% and as a result PCE increases by 30%. From the results on the double blocking layers, it is proven that the increased Voc is due to the suppression of charge recombination at the TiO2/Sb2S3 interface by ZrO2 blocking layer and the increased Jsc is ascribed to the partial reduction of Sb2O5 formed on the Sb2S3 surface by the ZnS coating (Fig. 11b).

In this study, we investigated the major recombination pathway in Sb2S3-sensitized all solid state solar cells by inserting thin layers at TiO2/Sb2S3 and Sb2S3/HTM interfaces. We found that Voc loss occurred mainly at the TiO2/Sb2S3 interface because of charge recombination. Thus BL1 at this interface efficiently blocked charge recombination, leading to a significant improvement in Voc. On the other hand, charge recombination was not noticeable at the Sb2S3/HTM interface. Instead, the partially oxidized surface at Sb2S3 could be recovered by BL2, leading to an increase in Jsc. According to the present studies, we can draw an important conclusion that photo-injected electrons in TiO2 prefer to recombine with oxidized Sb2S3 compared to the holes separated to HTM.
