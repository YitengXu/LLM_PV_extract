Organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells with excellent photovoltaic properties still have some potential for further enhancement in device performance. Charge loss and carrier recombination at interfaces in perovskite solar cells are crucial factors that inhibit the power conversion efficiency. Here, we report a simple approach to overcome the drawbacks via modifying the interfaces between charge transport layers and perovskite layers in the perovskite solar cells with NiO nanocrystals. The optimized device achieves an excellent power conversion efficiency as high as 19.47%. The interface engineering with NiO nanocrystals results in improved interface contact properties, enhanced charge transport dynamics and suppressed charge recombination in the corresponding devices, which further contribute to increased values of open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current density. Therefore, this work provides novel guidelines toward dual interfacial modification engineering to boost the performance of perovskite solar cells.

Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have structures of ABX3, which incorporate an organic cation or inorganic cation [A = methylammonium (MA) CH3NH3+, formamidinium (FA) CH3(NH2)2+, or Cs+], a divalent metal cation (B = Pb2+ or Sn2+) and a halide anion (X = Cl−, Br−, I−, or CN−). Owing to merits such as a large light absorption coefficient in the visible region, long carrier diffusion length and high ambipolar charge mobility, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn enormous attention in the past few years. Moreover, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs is booming from 3.8% in 2009 to the current record of breaking 23% in laboratory situations.

It is well known that the characteristics of materials for fabricating electron transport layers (ETLs) such as TiO2, SnO2 and ZnO nanomaterials, and perovskite layers including different components of A, B and X, and hole transport layers (HTLs) containing the typical NiO, poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS), 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), and so on, have significant influences on the photovoltaic performance and stability of the PSCs. Additionally, the interfaces between charge transport layers and perovskite layers in the PSCs also show important effects on the properties of the PSCs because they influence the energy level structure, charge transport dynamics and dark recombination in the devices. In this regard, tremendous efforts have been put into interface engineering research, including surface defect passivation, energy-level matching, carrier transfer acceleration, and so on. For instance, for regular “n-i-p” planar heterojunction PSCs, an ultrathin wide bandgap dielectric MgO nanolayer was inserted into the interface between the conductive substrate of fluorine-doped tin oxide conductive glass (FTO) and the SnO2 ETL, acquiring a PCE of 18.23%, which can be attributed to the MgO passivation for reducing FTO surface defects and enhancing electron transporting and hole blocking properties. With respect to the interface between HTL and the perovskite layer, a thin polymer film, such as polystyrene, is deposited on top of the perovskite layer, which can enhance the stability of the device while maintaining high performance.
Nevertheless, researchers usually pay close attention to modifying one of the interfaces in the PSCs, and the simultaneous modifications of double or triple interfaces in the PSCs have been rarely investigated. In this work, we intend to modify the interfaces between charge transport layers and perovskite layers in the planar PSCs with NiO nanocrystals (NCs) at the same time. This brings about improved interface contact properties, enhanced charge transport dynamics and suppressed charge recombination in the corresponding devices, which contribute to an obviously enhanced PCE from the original 16.31% to an excellent value of 19.47%.

All of the solvents and the reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corp, unless specifically mentioned, and used as received without further purification. Formamidinium iodide (FAI) and methylammonium bromide (MABr) salts were supplied by Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp, China. The spiro-OMeTAD was supplied by Luminescence Technology Corp, China. FTOs with sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1 and obtained from Nippon Glass Corp were used as conductive substrates. TiO2 and NiO NCs were synthesized according to the methods reported previously.


Firstly, FTOs with sizes of 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 were partially etched using a laser etching machine and cleaned using an ultrasonic bath with isopropanol, acetone, deionized water and ethanol in sequence, and then treated with UV-ozone for 30 min, and plasma for 5 min.

Secondly, the uniform TiO2 ETLs were fabricated by spin-coating on the patterned and cleared FTOs at 4000 rpm for 30 s, and then dried at 150 °C for 30 min. For modifying the interfaces between TiO2 ETLs and perovskite layers in the planar PSCs, toluene solutions of oleylamine-capped NiO NCs (NiO–toluene solutions) with various concentrations were spin-coated onto the TiO2 ETLs at 4000 rpm for 30 s, and soon afterwards were heated at 150 °C for 30 min in air.
Thirdly, the cesium-containing triple cation perovskite layers were deposited on the NiO NCs modified surfaces using one-step spin-coating in an argon filled glovebox. Typically, the perovskite precursor solution was prepared as follows: 0.507 g of PbI2, 0.0807 g of PbBr2, 0.172 g of CH3NH3I and 0.0224 g of CH3NH3Br were dissolved in the mixed solution containing 760 μL of DMF and 190 μL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and then 50 μL of CsI solution (0.389 g of CsI dissolved in 1 mL of DMSO) was added. After that, the acquired solution was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The precursor solution was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 10 s and then at 6500 rpm for 20 s. 130 μL of chlorobenzene was poured on the spinning substrate as an anti-solvent with the procedure lasting for 25 s. This was followed by annealing at 100 °C for 50 min to form a cesium-containing triple cation perovskite layer. Then, for modifying the interfaces between HTLs and perovskite layers, the NiO–toluene solutions with various concentrations were spin-coated on the surfaces of as-prepared perovskite layers at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by heating treatment at 100 °C for 10 min.
Fourthly, the spiro-OMeTAD was spin-coated on the perovskite layers at 4000 rpm for 30 s with the solution containing 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 17.5 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg of Li-TSFI dissolved in 1 mL of acetonitrile) and 1 mL of chlorobenzene. All of the samples were stored in a dry cabinet for 8–12 h to carry out spiro-OMeTAD oxidation.
Finally, Au electrodes with thicknesses of about 80–100 nm were thermally evaporated on the spiro-OMeTAD layers under high vacuum through a shadow mask. In order to make comparisons, the control devices were assembled via the same procedures, except for the interfacial modification with NiO NCs.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a SU8000 microscope. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were taken with a Bruker Multimode 8. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were acquired using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific Lumina), which used a xenon lamp as the source, and the excitation wavelength for the PL was 460 nm. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were obtained using the time-correlated single-photon counting technique (Omni-λ Monochromator), and the samples were excited by 507 nm at room temperature with 120 nJ per cm2 per pulse from a pulsed laser diode. The TRPL decay curves were fitted by a bi-exponential equation [eqn (1)]:

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves of PSCs were recorded with a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated AM 1.5 G solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2 with #94043A solar simulator (PVIV-94043A, Newport, USA) in air. The voltage step and delay time were 20 mV and 10 ms, respectively. The forward scan started from −0.1 V to 1.2 V, while the reverse scan was from 1.2 V to −0.1 V. The PSCs with an active area of 0.12 cm2 (calibrated with a black metal mask with an area of 0.3 × 0.4 cm2) and without any encapsulation were prepared for measurements. The stabilized current density (Jsc) and power output were recorded close to the maximum power points, which were extracted from the J–V curves of the PSCs. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using a computer controlled electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Germany) in dark conditions and the measured frequencies ranged from 100 mHz to 2 MHz with 0 V bias. The amplitude was 20 mV.


Fig. 1a is the cross-sectional SEM image of the planar PSC studied in this work and its schematic structure is shown in Fig. 1b. The constituent parts of the planar PSC include a transparent conductive substrate of FTO, a TiO2 ETL, an ultrathin NiO NCs interlayer, a perovskite layer, another ultrathin NiO NCs interlayer, a spiro-OMeTAD HTL, and an Au electrode. Fig. 1c is the energy level structure of the as-prepared planar PSCs. Due to the higher conduction-band energy level of the NiO film (≈−1.8 eV) than that of the TiO2 ETL (≈−4.13 eV), it might not allow extraction of electrons from the perovskite layer to the TiO2 ETL if the surface of the TiO2 ETL is fully covered with the NiO film. Whereas, in the case where the TiO2 ETL is partly covered with an ultrathin NiO film, such as forming an island-like morphology, the formed p–n junction is beneficial for preventing back recombination, facilitating electron extraction and reducing the density of trap states according to the results of the device with a p-type CuI island modified TiO2 ETL reported by Mahdi and co-workers. Meanwhile, the energy level matching among the perovskite layer, NiO film and the spiro-OMeTAD HTL allows for effectively extracting holes and blocking electrons at the same time. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect enhanced photovoltaic performance of the planar PSCs through modifying the interfaces between charge transport layers and perovskite layers with NiO NCs.

To figure out the effect of introducing NiO films in the interfaces between TiO2 ETLs and perovskite layers in the planar PSCs on the photovoltaic performance, we firstly optimize the thicknesses of NiO films through changing the concentrations of NiO–toluene solutions (0.0065 M, 0.013 M and 0.026 M). The performance characteristics and distribution of results for each cell condition are plotted in Fig. 2. It can be clearly observed that the optimal concentration of NiO–toluene solution is 0.013 M and the insertion of the as-prepared NiO film in the planar PSC can bring about a mean PCE of 17.40 ± 0.50% (versus that of the control of 16.17 ± 0.22%), originating from the enhanced values of mean open-circuit voltage (Voc) from 1.07 ± 0.01 V to 1.10 ± 0.01 V, mean short-circuit current density (Jsc) from 22.18 ± 0.36 mA cm−2 to 22.72 ± 0.38 mA cm−2 and mean fill factor (FF) from 67.88 ± 1.16% to 69.71 ± 1.66%. It is seen that the standard deviation of the best-performance devices with NiO NCs modified TiO2 ETLs is ±0.50%, higher than that of the value of ±0.22% of the control ones, which mainly originated from the higher standard deviation of Jsc of the former ones. Furthermore, we can speculate that the NiO films prepared with 0.0065 M NiO–toluene solution are too thin to play a positive role in enhancing photovoltaic performance, whereas the ones fabricated using 0.026 M NiO–toluene solution are too thick to hinder the electron extraction.

Fig. 3 shows the top-view SEM and AFM images of the bare TiO2 ETL and NiO NCs modified TiO2 ETLs. Fig. 3a presents a clean surface of the bare TiO2 ETL. After spin-coating NiO–toluene solutions, the NiO films are observed on the surfaces of the TiO2 ETLs as shown in Fig. 3b–d and the morphologies of the NiO films change from isolated pieces to continuous films by going with the increased concentrations of NiO–toluene solutions from 0.0065 M, 0.013 M to 0.026 M. The morphologies of corresponding AFM images from Fig. 3e–h are identical to these features. Furthermore, the calculated root-mean-square roughness (RMS) values of the bare TiO2 ETL and NiO NCs coated TiO2 ETLs prepared with 0.0065 M, 0.013 M and 0.026 M are 25.3 nm, 23.2 nm, 18.3 nm and 14.6 nm, respectively. Therefore, the surfaces of the modified TiO2 ETLs become smoother compared with the pristine one, which is beneficial for interface contact.
The SEM and XRD measurements are used to detect the influence of NiO NCs modification on the growth of perovskite layers through comparing the morphologies and XRD patterns of the corresponding perovskite layers as shown in Fig. 4. Comparing Fig. 4a and b, it is seen that there are no essential differences in the morphologies. The XRD patterns shown in Fig. 4c reveal that the main diffraction peaks of the perovskite films including (110), (220) and (310) have similar diffraction strengths, respectively. Therefore, the insertion of NiO films in the interfaces between the TiO2 ETLs and the perovskite layers does not interfere with constructing the perovskite films.
The extraction and the transport of holes from perovskite layers to spiro-OMeTAD HTLs also play key roles in influencing the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. The NiO–toluene solutions with various concentrations of 0.005 M, 0.01 M and 0.02 M are used to prepare NiO films on the perovskite layers. The photovoltaic parameters and distribution of results for each cell condition are plotted in Fig. 5. We can find that the optimal concentration of NiO–toluene solution is 0.01 M, which brings about an obviously enhanced mean PEC of 18.40 ± 0.75% with a mean Voc of 1.14 ± 0.01 V, a mean Jsc of 23.04 ± 0.69 mA cm−2 and a mean FF of 69.54 ± 2.05%. The photovoltaic parameters of the planar PSCs with dual modified interfaces of TiO2 ETLs/perovskite layers and perovskite layers/HTLs are all higher than those of the devices only with NiO NCs modified TiO2 ETLs (control ones) because the latter ones show a mean PEC of 17.40 ± 0.50% with a mean Voc of 1.10 ± 0.01 V, a mean Jsc of 22.72 ± 0.38 mA cm−2 and a mean FF of 69.71 ± 1.66%. From these data, we also can see that the insertion of NiO films between the perovskite films and spiro-OMeTAD HTLs can induce a slightly higher standard deviation of PCE of the corresponding devices, which mainly originated from the different standard deviation of FF (±2.05% versus ±1.66%).

Fig. 6 shows the top-view SEM and AFM images of the pristine perovskite layer and NiO NCs (0.01 M) modified perovskite layer. The clear perovskite crystal grains become indistinct due to the cover of newly formed NiO film on the surface. The RMS decreases greatly from an original 22.5 nm to 7.5 nm, which improves interface contact between the perovskite layer and the HTL because of the formation of a smoother surface after spin-coating with NiO NCs.

Fig. 7a shows the J–V curves of the pristine planar PSC and the one with NiO NCs simultaneously modified TiO2 ETL and perovskite layer measured by forward and reverse scans. The pristine planar PSC shows a PCE of 16.31% with a Voc of 1.07 V, a Jsc of 22.18 mA cm−2 and a FF of 68.31% (Table 1); and the device with NiO NCs simultaneously modified TiO2 ETL and perovskite layer shows a much higher PCE of 19.47% with a Voc of 1.15 V, a Jsc of 23.89 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70.95% by reverse scan. Furthermore, the pristine planar PSC achieves a forward-scanned PCE of 15.28%, retaining 93.68% of the reverse-scanned efficiency; and the device with NiO NCs simultaneously modified TiO2 ETL and perovskite layer achieves a forward-scanned PCE of 19.06%, retaining 97.89% of the reverse-scanned efficiency. Moreover, the device has nearly consistent J–V curves under different reverse-scan rates varying from 0.02 to 20 mV ms−1 as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI); and the reverse and forward scans under different rates do not lead to serious J–V hysteresis as revealed by Fig. S2 (ESI). Therefore, the hysteresis problem can be nearly eliminated after dual interfacial modifications with NiO NCs. The device with NiO NCs simultaneously modified TiO2 ETL and perovskite layer also achieves high values of steady-state photocurrent and output as shown in Fig. 7b.

The optical changes of the perovskite films with and without NiO NCs modifications are investigated as shown in Fig. 8a and d. It is seen that the NiO NCs modifications can lead to enhanced absorbance of the ETL/NiO/perovskite and ETL/NiO/perovskite/NiO films in the short wavelength region (<525 nm), whereas the differences are slight in the long wavelength region (>525 nm). The corresponding Tauc plots are also presented in Fig. 8c and d to calculate the bandgaps (Egs) of the samples. We can see that the ETL/perovskite, ETL/NiO/perovskite and ETL/NiO/perovskite/NiO films have Eg values of 1.615, 1.619 and 1.623 eV, respectively, so the NiO NCs modifications can cause slight blue shifts of bandgaps. We also measure the electron trap density in the perovskite films of the samples by the electron-only devices with the structure of FTO/ETL (without or with NiO NCs modification)/perovskite (without or with NiO NCs modification)/PCBM/Ag as shown in Fig. 8c and f. It is found that the perovskite prepared on the NiO NCs modified ETL can decrease the trap density from 2.26 × 1015 to 1.81 × 1015 cm−3, and the dual interfacial modification with NiO NCs on the surfaces of both ETL and perovskite can further decrease the value to 1.21 × 1015 cm−3, which is beneficial for improving carrier dynamics of the samples.
To explore the superior performance of the modified devices, we investigate the charge carrier dynamics through the PL and TRPL measurements.Fig. 9a and b show the PL spectra of the samples of TiO2 ETL (without or with NiO)/perovskite films and perovskite (without or with NiO)/spiro-OMeTAD films, respectively. Clearly, blue-shifted PL peaks are observed in the samples with NiO NCs modified interfaces either between the TiO2 ETL and the perovskite layer (from 767 to 759 nm) or between the perovskite layer and spiro-OMeTAD HTL (from 756 to 753 nm) compared with the pristine ones, which can be ascribed to the reduced surface traps of the perovskite layers after inserting ultrathin NiO films in the interfaces. Moreover, striking quenching effects can be observed in the PL spectra of the samples with ultrathin NiO films in the interfaces, indicating more efficient charge transfer between them.
The TRPL spectra as shown in Fig. 9c and d further confirm the better charge transport dynamics of the samples with ultrathin NiO films in the interfaces. The parameters including a fast extraction time (τ1), a slow radiative recombination lifetime (τ2), the corresponding decay amplitudes (A1 and A2), and the average TRPL decay time (τave) calculated from these data are listed in Tables 2 and 3. For electron extraction from perovskite, the τ1 value for the sample of TiO2 ETL/perovskite is 17.10 ns and it drops to a much lower value of 7.66 ns after inserting an ultrathin NiO film in the interface between TiO2 ETL and perovskite layer, indicating greatly enhanced electron extraction with NiO NCs modification. Although the τ2 value of the sample of TiO2 ETL/NiO/perovskite also decreases from 113.41 ns to 57.30 ns, it might not greatly influence the device performance because of the much lower value of A2versus A1 in the sample (87.24% versus 12.76% of the original one and 86.71% versus 13.29% of the NiO NCs modificated one, respectively). Additionally, the τavg value of the sample of TiO2 ETL/NiO/perovskite (31.89 ns) is about half of the pristine one (63.89 ns). Therefore, the electron extraction has become faster after inserting an ultrathin NiO film in the interface between the TiO2 ETL and the perovskite layer.

For hole extraction from perovskite, the same variation tendencies as those of the above-mentioned also existed as revealed by the data listed in Table 3. That is, the τ1 value drops from 4.98 ns for the original one to 2.06 ns after NiO NCs modification on the perovskite, resulting in a 58.63% decrement and indicating much faster hole extraction. Although the τ2 value also drops from 25.77 ns to 13.47 ns at the same time, the A2 value significantly decreases from 21.48% to 12.04% and the A1 value enhances from 78.52% to 87.96%, suggesting the weakened influence of radiative recombination on the device performance. Moreover, the τavg value of the NiO NCs modified perovskite sample is much smaller than that of the original one (7.43 ns versus 17.16 ns), which demonstrates faster hole extraction after NiO NCs modification on the perovskite again.
The nonradiative recombination (back recombination) in the devices is investigated with EIS to evaluate the internal resistances including series resistance (Rs), contact resistance (Rco) and recombination resistance (Rrec). The Nyquist plots can be well-fitted using the inserted equivalent circuit as shown in Fig. 10a. The first arc in the high frequency area generally displays the Rco in the perovskite/HTM interface. The second arc in the low frequency area is usually attributed to the Rrec in ETL/perovskite. Additionally, the starting point value at the real part of the high frequency corresponds to the Rs. The Rs values for the planar PSC with NiO NCs modified interfaces (ETL/NiO/perovskite/NiO/spiro-OMeTAD) and the control one without modification (ETL/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD) are 7.342 Ω and 6.263 Ω, respectively; and those of Rco values are 136.3 Ω and 137.7 Ω, respectively, so the rangeability of the two resistances is very small. Nevertheless, the Rrec value of the NiO NCs modified one is 1904 Ω, which is much higher than that of the control one of 1085 Ω. The greatly enhanced Rrec value of the NiO NCs modified device (with 175.48% increment versus the control one) indicates effectively suppressed back recombination in the corresponding devices.
Furthermore, the dark J–V curves of the devices as shown in Fig. 10b also demonstrate the effectively suppressed back recombination in the device with dual NiO modifications. Owing to the diode-like behavior of the devices, the saturation current density (J0) and ideality factor (n) can be extracted from the dark J–V curves. It is shown that the device with dual NiO modifications has a much smaller J0 (4.15 × 10−7 mA cm−2) than that of the original one (1.61 × 10−5 mA cm−2), indicating the clearly reduced back recombination. Moreover, the smaller n (1.68) of the former device compared to the latter one (1.87) also verifies the lower loss of charges at the interfaces.
The long-term stability of the PSC with dual NiO NCs modifications is evaluated through recording the changed values of the key photovoltaic parameters including Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE as shown in Fig. 11. One can find that the device without any encapsulation shows a high PCE of 17.10% after storing in an air environment with 50 ± 5% relative humidity at room temperature for 400 h, maintaining about 88.51% value of the original one (19.32%). The good stability of the device can be attributed to the protective effect of the NiO thin films in the interfaces of the device because it has been verified that the protection of interfaces of the PSC with inorganic materials can obviously improve the stability of the device.

In conclusion, we introduce an approach of low-temperature fabricated p-type NiO ultrathin layers into the interfaces of TiO2 ETLs/perovskite layers and perovskite layers/HTLs in the planar PSCs. We find NiO NCs solutions with appropriate concentrations can form uniform films coated on the surfaces of TiO2 ETLs and perovskite layers, which not only realize the surface passivation but also regulate the energy level matching of different function layers. The PCE of the NiO modified device achieves a high value of 19.47% with negligible hysteresis, which is much higher than that of the pristine one without interface modification (16.31%). The results can be mainly attributed to the NiO interface modifying layers which accelerate the charge extraction and transfer rates while suppressing the back recombination. Our achievement opens a new window for p-type semiconductor NCs applied in modifying n-type ETLs. Furthermore, the dual interfacial modification engineering may be an effective way to improve photovoltaic performance and long-term stability of PSCs.
