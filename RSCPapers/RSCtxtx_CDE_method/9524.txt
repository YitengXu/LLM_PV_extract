The highest efficiency of 4.225% for vapor-transport-deposited (VTD) SnS absorber/CdS heterojunction solar cells with good long-term stability over two years is reported. These improved characteristics are attributed to the reduction in interface defects of the heterojunction, which can occur either during the deposition of transparent electrodes or direct annealing of the SnS/CdS heterojunction at 300 °C. The enhanced heterojunction interface quality is supported by the substantially reduced dark saturation current density and shunt conductance of the fabricated devices measured under dark conditions. Although the SnS/CdS device exhibits efficiency over 4%, significant short-circuit current loss mainly due to recombination was revealed by quantum efficiency and optical analysis. Admittance analysis shows the presence of numerous defect densities of Sn and S vacancies (>1017 cm−3) in the VTD-grown SnS absorber. Minimizing bulk and interface defect densities of SnS absorbers will be a key issue in achieving high efficiency (>5%) of SnS-based thin-film solar cells.

Thin-film solar cells (TFSCs) have attracted increasing attention for use in integrated photovoltaics such as building windows and facades. The use of widely popular and commercial CdTe and Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) TFSCs is limited because these contain rare, expensive, and toxic elements. Therefore, earth-abundant, less toxic, and inexpensive materials such as Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe), Sb2Se3, CuSbS2, and CuSbSe2 have attracted nascent attention for solar cell applications. CZTS and CZTSSe solar cells have shown promising results, but synthesizing homogeneously distributed single-phase materials remains difficult.

In recent years, earth-abundant orthorhombic tin monosulfide (α-SnS) has been increasingly investigated as an absorber material for solar cells owing to its ideal electronic properties, including suitable optical bandgap (∼1.3 eV), high optical absorption coefficient (α > 104 cm−1), and intrinsic p-type conductivity. In practice, however, the power conversion efficiency (η) of SnS-based solar cells mostly remained below 4%, except a few cases where η above 4% was successfully achieved. For example, Sinsermsuksakul et al. have reported the highest certified efficiency of 4.36% for atomic-layer-deposited (ALD) SnS-based TFSCs using a Zn(O,S):N n-type buffer layer with a device configuration of glass/Mo/SnS/SnO2/Zn(O,S):N/ZnO/ITO. They have shown that the open-circuit voltage (Voc) was significantly enhanced by introducing a 1 nm SnO2 passivation layer between SnS and Zn(O,S):N. Additionally, the ALD-grown Zn(O,S):N buffer layer required precise control over the S/Zn ratio to provide a small positive conduction band offset (spike-type), and nitrogen doping was necessary to reduce the conductivity. More recently, an uncertified cell efficiency of 4.8% was reported for TiO2/SnS heterojunction solar cells with a superstrate device configuration of FTO/TiO2/SnS/Au. The device performance of the spin-coated SnS-TFSCs was improved by an additional SnCl2 post-treatment of the absorber, which led to the formation of a uniform and densely packed morphology. Despite these interesting results, achieving cell efficiency over 4% for SnS-based TFSCs has remained a serious obstacle.
Chemical bath-deposited (CBD) cadmium sulfide (CdS) is the most extensively used n-type buffer layer for the fabrication of TFSCs in laboratory research as well as commercial PV modules. Likewise, it has also been widely applied for the development of SnS/CdS heterojunction TFSCs. Numerous SnS deposition techniques such as chemical vapor deposition, CBD, spin coating, electrodeposition, thermal evaporation, and vapor transport deposition (VTD) have been employed for the fabrication of TFSCs with a CBD-grown CdS buffer layer. However, the device performance of SnS/CdS heterojunction TFSCs has remained low (mostly η < 3%) and much improvement is required for its practical applications. In our previous work, we demonstrated a simple and facile method to synthesize phase-pure SnS thin films by the VTD process, and fabricated SnS/CdS TFSCs, which exhibited the highest certified (Korea Institute of Energy Research, KIER) efficiency of 2.938%. Afterwards, the deposition temperature and growth duration of the VTD process were further optimized to improve the device performance. The highest cell efficiency of 3.93% (uncertified) was obtained for SnS/CdS TFSCs fabricated with a 1.2 μm-thick SnS absorber grown at an optimal temperature of 600 °C.
In this work, we report the highest efficiency of 4.225% for SnS/CdS heterojunction TFSCs, which was certified at KIER. The device performance was enhanced by improving the hetero-interface quality of the VTD-grown SnS absorber and CBD-grown CdS buffer layer. The optical loss analysis and temperature-dependent admittance spectroscopy were used to examine the SnS-based TFSCs. To understand the optical losses, a detailed short-circuit current density (Jsc) loss analysis was carried out by analyzing external quantum efficiency (EQE), reflectance, and absorption spectra. The density of deep-level defects of the SnS absorber and their energetic position within the bandgap were estimated from temperature-dependent admittance spectroscopy. In addition to achieving over 4% efficiency for SnS/CdS TFSCs, this study provides the possible reasons behind the under-performance of SnS-based TFSCs compared to that of other TFSCs such as CIGS or CZTSSe.

The growth of SnS absorber layers on a Mo-coated soda-lime glass (SLG/Mo) substrate (1 × 1 inch) was carried out using a VTD process in a one-zone furnace (S&R Korea, SRDVF-LV-3B-1608). A detailed description of the VTD setup and deposition process is reported elsewhere. Before SnS deposition, the SLG/Mo substrates were ultrasonically cleaned using isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and deionized water (DI water) for 15 min each and dried in a nitrogen (N2) flow. A ceramic boat containing 0.3 g of SnS source powder (99.999%) was placed at the center of the heating zone of the furnace. The cleaned substrate was then loaded inside the chamber and kept at the end of the heating zone using a suitable quartz substrate holder. Next, the chamber was evacuated using a mechanical pump, and the base pressure of the growth chamber was 5 mTorr. Subsequently, Ar gas flow was introduced into the chamber and the deposition pressure was maintained at 2 Torr. The furnace was heated to 600 °C with a ramping duration of 30 min and held for 30 min under stabilized chamber pressure. After deposition, the VTD chamber was allowed to cool down to room temperature, and the samples were then subjected to device fabrication and characterization.

About a 45 nm-thick n-type CdS buffer layer was deposited on the SnS absorber layer by conventional CBD to fabricate SnS/CdS TFSCs. A detailed optimization of the CBD process parameters of CdS deposition is described in our earlier report. The CdS buffer layer was grown at a bath temperature of 60 °C, and the growth duration was fixed for 18 min. Subsequently, radio frequency sputtering was employed to deposit ∼70 nm-thick intrinsic ZnO and ∼400 nm-thick Al-doped ZnO (AZO) layers. To study the effect of the AZO film deposition temperature on the SnS/CdS device performance, the AZO films were deposited at various temperatures ranging from 150 °C to 350 °C. The Al top contacts (∼1 μm) were deposited using thermal evaporation, and the final device configuration was SLG/Mo/SnS/CdS/i-ZnO/AZO/Al. Each sample was mechanically scribed into eight cells with a nominal area of 0.3 cm2.
The optical and electrical properties of the AZO transparent electrodes were studied by UV/vis/NIR spectroscopy (Varian, Cary 100) and Hall measurements (Ecopia, HMS-3000), respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi, S-4700) was used to analyze the cross section of the fabricated TFSCs. The secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS, CAMECA, IMS7f) technique was used to detect the diffusion of Cd into the SnS absorber. 6 keV Cs+ primary ions with 10 nA current were rastered on an area of 250 × 250 μm2. The in-house photovoltaic parameters were obtained from the current density–voltage measurements (J–V) under 1-sun illumination using a solar simulator AM1.5G (San-ei Electric, XES-301S, 100 mW cm−2) and Keithley 2400 source meter. The dark J–V curves were measured using an HP 4155B Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer. The champion cell was independently characterized at KIER using a Keithley 236 SourceMeter and a class AAA solar simulator (WACOM, WXS-155S-L2) under AM1.5G 1-sun standard conditions. Device parameters obtained from in-house measurements are mainly used in the discussion if not mentioned otherwise.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) in the wavelength range of 300–1100 nm was also recorded using a spectral response system (SOMA Optics, S-9230) at KIER. The optical and electrical losses of the champion device were investigated based on EQE analysis and additional transmittance and reflectance measurements using a UV-Visible spectrometer (Shimadzu, UV-2600) equipped with an ISR-2600 Plus integrating sphere. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) was conducted by using a fluorescence lifetime spectrometer (Hamamatsu, C12132) equipped with laser excitation wavelength λ = 532 nm at a temperature of 90 K controlled by using a LINKAM stage (HFS600). Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was conducted at room temperature. The admittance spectra were recorded with an LCR meter (Agilent, E4980A) in the temperature range of 90–300 K by varying the AC frequency from 20 Hz to 2 MHz with an AC voltage of 30 mV under dark conditions without any lights. The temperature was controlled with an error of ±0.05 K in a liquid nitrogen cryostat (Seongwoo Instruments Inc.).

The optical transmittance, bandgap, and electrical properties of sputtered AZO films deposited at different temperatures ranging from room temperature to 400 °C are shown in Fig. S1 and Table S1 in the ESI. While the optical transmittance of the AZO films is nearly ∼90% for all the cases, the bandgap marginally increased from 3.5 eV to 3.7 eV as the growth temperature was increased from room temperature to 400 °C. The resistivity, carrier concentration, and mobility of the AZO films increased with an increase in the deposition temperatures up to 200 °C. The AZO film deposited at 300 °C showed slightly reduced carrier mobility and concentration. A drastic decrease in carrier mobility led to a large increase in resistivity for the AZO film deposited at 400 °C.


Fig. 1a illustrates the light J–V characteristics of the best-performing SnS/CdS TFSCs fabricated with different AZO films deposited at 150–350 °C, which were all measured by using the in-house setup. All the raw J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. S2. The evolution of solar cell output parameters, namely, Voc, Jsc, fill factor (FF), and η, as a function of the AZO deposition temperature is summarized in box plots of Fig. 1b, and the absolute values of the champion cells are listed in Table 1. It is clear that the AZO deposition temperature has a strong influence on the device performance of SnS/CdS TFSCs. The SnS/CdS device fabricated with AZO films deposited at 150 °C showed relatively poor device performance. The TFSCs displayed a low efficiency of 2.57% due to small Voc (0.295 V), low Jsc (14.88 mA cm−2), and low FF (0.584). With an increase in the AZO deposition temperature to 300 °C, a gradual improvement in the PV parameters is evidenced. With AZO deposited at 300 °C, the TFSC exhibits remarkably improved parameters, including Voc (0.346 V), Jsc (20.53 mA cm−2), and FF (0.604), finally resulting in a significant increase in cell efficiency to 4.30%. A further increase in the AZO deposition temperature to 350 °C results in a degradation of device performance and the cell efficiency is reduced to 3.77% with notably large cell-to-cell nonuniformity (Fig. 1b and Table 1). Cross-sectional SEM images do not show any notable differences between devices with AZO deposited at 150 °C and 300 °C (Fig. S3). Additionally, we performed SIMS analysis on TFSCs with AZO films deposited at 250 °C and 350 °C (Fig. S4). It was revealed that Cd diffusion is relatively severe for the 350 °C-device compared to the 250 °C-device. The observed nonuniformity could be attributed to the Cd diffusion into the absorber.

Interestingly, a better efficiency retention of 97–100% for nearly two years was achieved for devices with AZO deposited at 300 °C and 350 °C, while poor efficiency retention (54–80%) was observed for the devices where AZO films were deposited at 150–250 °C (Fig. S5). During this period, the samples were kept in ambient air without any sealing.
To determine the effect of the AZO deposition temperature on the diode quality of SnS/CdS TFSCs, the J–V characteristics of the best cells for different AZO deposition temperatures were analyzed under dark conditions, and the results are shown in Fig. 1c. The diode parameters such as shunt conductance (Gsh), series resistance (Rs), ideality factor (A), and dark saturation current density (J0) were extracted from the dark J–V curve and plotted against the AZO deposition temperature in Fig. 1d. With an increase in the AZO deposition temperature, a decrease in Gsh is noted, indicating better shunt properties of the SnS/CdS device. This could be due to improved bulk properties of CdS due to densification arising from the annealing effect. On the other hand, Rs remained nearly unchanged up to 250 °C, while a slightly increased value was observed in the temperature range of 300–350 °C. The ideality factor is found to be nearly similar for all the cases. It is well known that the presence of pinholes, grain boundaries, and defects in the absorber or absorber/buffer interface results in high shunt current and thus a higher value of J0, as detected for AZO films deposited at lower temperatures (150–200 °C). A sharp decrease in J0 is seen in the case of an AZO deposition temperature of 250 °C, suggesting significant reduction in interface defects and non-radiative recombination for the device. Nevertheless, marginally increased J0 values are obtained in the cases where AZO films are deposited at an elevated substrate temperature range of 300–350 °C. These observed features in the dark J–V characteristics can be directly related to the PV parameters of the SnS/CdS TFSCs obtained under 1-sun illumination. Clearly, the lower value of solar cell parameters of the SnS/CdS TFSCs fabricated with AZO films deposited at 150–200 °C is associated with the poor diode quality. The highest Voc (0.389 V) obtained for the SnS/CdS TFSCs with AZO films deposited at 250 °C is in line with the lowest value obtained for J0 among the fabricated devices. However, the overall device performance is limited by the small Jsc and FF. Interestingly, the SnS/CdS device with AZO films deposited at 300 °C displayed slightly reduced Voc; however, they exhibited the highest efficiency. This improvement is primarily attributed to the enhanced Jsc and FF (better Gsh). The marginal decrease in the Voc observed in this case is ascribed to the slightly increased J0 compared to that of the device with an AZO film deposited at 250 °C. However, a further increase in the AZO deposition temperature to 350 °C clearly leads to a decrease in Voc and consequently decreases the cell efficiency.
The above results indicate that the diode quality and resultant PV parameters of SnS/CdS TFSCs are significantly improved up to a certain extent with an increase in the AZO film deposition temperature to 300 °C. The temperature dependence of Voc was additionally analyzed to elucidate the recombination mechanism (Fig. S6). The highest activation energy (EA) of 0.83 eV was achieved for the TFSC device with the AZO deposited at 300 °C. The obtained EA is lower than the expected band gap of SnS of 1.3 eV, indicating that the devices are still limited by interface recombination.
Apart from the improved electrical properties of AZO films, the higher AZO film deposition temperature results in improved SnS/CdS heterojunction quality. Such an improvement could possibly occur during the deposition of AZO films. In other words, the annealing of the SnS/CdS heterojunction at 300 °C without following the TCO process can lead to better junction quality. To substantiate this hypothesis, a series of TFSCs have been fabricated: (1) as-deposited SnS/CdS without any junction annealing, (2) annealed SnS at 300 °C in Ar ambient (20 Torr) for 1 h and as-deposited CdS without any junction annealing, and (3) as-deposited SnS/CdS with additional junction annealing at 300 °C in Ar ambient (20 Torr) for 1 h. Here, 20 Torr in Ar ambient was the suitable condition for preserving the good SnS morphology during annealing (Fig. S7). In all these cases, a new home-made sputtering system was used for achieving better electrical properties of AZO films (Fig. S8), where i-ZnO/AZO deposition was carried out at room temperature to exclude any unintended annealing effect. The J–V characteristics of all the devices and the performance parameters are shown in Fig. S9. The highest efficiencies achieved for devices 1, 2, and 3 were 2.04%, 1.61%, and 4.20%, respectively. As seen, the last device exhibits the highest efficiency along with a high Voc of 0.332 V, a high Jsc of 22.07 mA cm−2, and a high FF of 0.575. Note that the overall performance of this device is similar to that of the SnS/CdS TFSC fabricated with AZO films deposited at 300 °C (Fig. 1). This experimental observation clarifies that the improved cell performance essentially comes from the improved SnS/CdS heterointerface quality.
Independently measured J–V characteristics and the EQE spectrum of the champion cell (the SnS/CdS TFSC device with an AZO deposition temperature of 300 °C) at KIER are shown in Fig. 2a and b (test certificates are shown in Fig. S10). For the purpose of comparison, the certified result of our previously reported SnS/CdS TFSC device is also included. The J–V curve and EQE spectra both represent a significant improvement in the device performance compared to that stated in our earlier report. The enhanced carrier collection efficiency in the entire wavelength range in the EQE spectrum is well supported by the increase in Jsc. Meanwhile, an improved EQE of the 4.225%-device in the wavelength range of 400–500 nm may come from a thinner CdS thickness (45 nm) compared to 70 nm-thick CdS used for the 2.938%-device. The integrated photocurrent density extracted from the EQE vs. the wavelength graph also shows similar characteristics in terms of Jsc, as shown in Fig. 2b.
The above-mentioned champion device exhibits the highest efficiency with good long-term stability. However, the efficiency is considerably lower than that of CIGS or CZTSSe solar cells with a similar device architecture. To comprehend the origin of the relatively poor device performance, the optical and electrical losses of the device were systematically analyzed following the procedure described in ref. 30 The optical loss is associated with the reflection from the device surface and absorption in TCO (i-ZnO and AZO) and the buffer layer, and the recombination of photogenerated carriers contributes to the electrical loss. The spectral losses resulting from the different layers of the SnS/CdS device, namely, front reflection, parasitic absorption (TCO and CdS), and recombination along with the EQE spectrum, are depicted in Fig. 2c. The absorbance, transmittance, and reflectance of TCO and CdS buffer layers, and the front reflectance of the final TFSC device without a top metal contact are shown in Fig. S11. The reflection loss is estimated to be 2.83 mA cm−2, whereas the parasitic absorption losses in TCO and CdS buffer layers are 1.85 mA cm−2 and 2.31 mA cm−2, respectively. It is important to note that these estimated values are similar to those calculated for CIGS, CZTSSe, or CdTe solar cells. Here, absorption loss of TCO at wavelengths larger than 600 nm comes from free carrier absorption. However, a large difference is identified in the recombination loss that occurs in the absorber and the absorber/buffer interface. The SnS/CdS solar cell displays a significantly large recombination loss of 8.38 mA cm−2 compared to those of the highly efficient CIGS, CZTSSe, or CdTe solar cells. The recombination loss in CIGS and CdTe solar cells (η > 15%) is found to be in the range of 1–3 mA cm−2, whereas a relatively larger value of 5.2 mA cm−2 is reported for CZTSSe solar cells with an efficiency of 12.6%. The recombination losses are generally associated with the imperfect collection of photogenerated carriers due to the presence of various types of defects in the absorber layer and/or absorber–buffer interface.
The quality of the SnS absorber itself was studied by PL measurements (Fig. 3a), and the minority carrier lifetime was determined from the TRPL spectra (Fig. 3b). The SnS absorber exhibits a broad, but prominent emission peak at 980 nm (1.27 eV), which corresponds to the direct excitonic band-to-band transition. The weighted average carrier lifetime was estimated by fitting TRPL spectra with the biexponential decay function based on the following equations,
where
I is the intensity and A1,2 and τ1,2 are the amplitudes and lifetime values, respectively. The calculated average minority carrier lifetime was 1.3 ns, which is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of thermally evaporated SnS films. It is similar to the value reported for bulk SnS crystals grown from highly pure feedstock. These comparisons indicate the good quality of the VTD-SnS absorber compared to that of SnS films grown by other methods.

Furthermore, admittance spectroscopy was employed to identify the density of defects and their energetic position and distribution within the bandgap of the VTD-SnS absorber. Admittance spectroscopy has been effectively and extensively applied in many PV systems, including Si, CIGS, CZTSSe, and perovskite solar cells, to determine the energy level of defect states and the distribution of defect state density. However, to the best of our knowledge, this technique has not been used to characterize SnS-based solar cells. In this study, we performed admittance spectroscopy for the champion cell to study the defect properties. A representative capacitance–frequency (C–f) spectrum of the SnS/CdS TFSC from 20 Hz to 2 MHz in the temperature range of 300–90 K is shown in Fig. 4a. The inflection point angular frequency (ω) was determined from the C–f curves at different temperatures. Fig. 4b illustrates the corresponding Arrhenius plot of the characteristic transition frequencies derived from the admittance spectra. The energy level of the defect states is obtained from the following equation,
where
ω0 is the angular frequency at the inflection point, ν0 is the emission factor, T is the temperature, Et is the electronic state of defect level, and k is the Boltzmann constant. Two distinctive defect energy levels (N1 and N2) were identified in lower and higher temperature regions, respectively. The shallow (N1) and deep (N2) defect level activation energies are calculated to be 202 meV and 518 meV, respectively. Following the density functional calculations, the N1 defect level is assigned to a shallow acceptor from the Sn vacancies (VSn), and the N2 defect level is associated with a deep donor from S vacancies (VS).

Additionally, the energetic defect distribution is calculated from the differentiated capacitance (C) using the following equation,
where
Vbi is the built-in potential, q is the fundamental charge, W is the depletion width, and ω is the applied angular frequency. Vbi and W are extracted from the capacitance–voltage measurements. The distribution of both the shallow (N1 centered at 202 meV) and deep (N2 centered at 518 meV) defect level densities of the SnS-TFSCs is shown in Fig. 4c. The integrated defect densities are found to be ∼4 × 1017 cm−3 and 0.5 × 1017 cm−3 for VSn and VS, respectively. The intrinsic p-type conductivity in SnS films is attributed to the Sn vacancies. But the presence of S vacancies in the SnS absorber has a detrimental effect on the device performance. Moreover, these defect densities of our VTD-grown SnS absorber are about 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than the reported values for CIGS and CZTSSe absorbers. Our results suggest that a large amount of defects are still present in the device, and this can be underlying reason for the poor device performance of the SnS-based TFSCs compared to that of other efficient TFSCs using CZTSSe or CIGS absorbers. Annealing in a sulfur-containing ambient atmosphere (H2S) is found to be very efficient in reducing the point defects, decreasing the grain boundaries, and enlarging the grain size of the SnS absorber. However, such high-temperature annealing with S-rich conditions often leads to the formation of detrimental Sn2S3 or SnS2 secondary phases. Further studies on finding suitable annealing conditions to minimize the amount of VS while maintaining a compact and flat surface morphology and phase purity of SnS are required to achieve an efficiency over 5% for SnS-based TFSCs.


We have demonstrated that the efficiency of SnS/CdS solar cells is largely influenced by the heterojunction interface quality. A suitable annealing process at 300 °C either during AZO film deposition or right after absorber/buffer formation turned out to be highly effective to reduce the dark saturation current density and shunt conductance. The highest KIER-certified cell efficiency of 4.225% was achieved together with a Voc of 0.346 V, a Jsc of 20.76 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.588. We also revealed by quantum efficiency and optical analyses that the device still experiences significant current loss mainly due to recombination. The admittance spectroscopy measurements also show that a large number of point defects over 1017 cm−3, particularly VSn and VS, exist in the VTD-grown SnS absorber. It is envisioned that the SnS-based cell performance can be further enhanced by reducing the point defects of the absorber and improving the junction interface quality.
