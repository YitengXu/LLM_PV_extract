Small-molecule hole-transporting materials (HTMs) have gained much attention due to their structural flexibility, material properties, and stabilities, allowing for enhanced operational durability in perovskite photovoltaics. We synthesized and investigated a new class of donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) configured ligand type hetero-structured small molecule, WWC106, serving as the HTM to enable high-efficiency mixed-halide lead perovskite solar cells. WWC106 is a benzimidazole-centered dopant-free HTM composed of three donors: two 4-methoxy-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-phenylanilines (TPAs) and one 2-(2,2-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)vinyl)-5-methylthiophene. One of the two TPA donors is linked to the benzimidazole via a pyridine unit. Scanning electron microscopy, photoluminescence (PL) time-resolved PL, and space charge limited current measurements on WWC106 HTMs show perovskite formation with good morphology, efficient hole extraction, and hole mobility. The new D–A–D configured WWC106-based device exhibited a high open-circuit voltage of 1.09 V and a high short circuit current density of 20.76 mA cm−2, with the highest power conversion efficiency of 17.75%.

A new photovoltaic technology named organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has attracted much interest from researchers. In the last decade, PSCs’ power conversion efficiency (PCE) performance has reached new heights. The outstanding progress of PSCs has been attributed to the light-absorbing perovskite materials’ unique properties, which include powerful panchromatic absorption, tunable bandgaps, good ambipolar charge-transporting capabilities, extended carrier lifetimes and diffusion lengths, exceptional defect tolerance, and low exciton binding energy. A crucial component of PSC is the hole-transporting materials (HTMs), which are essential in ensuring efficient hole extraction, transportation, and suppression of photo-generated carrier recombination. These HTMs are designed based on inorganic and organic (small molecules and polymer) materials. Organic HTMs based on small molecules are preferred over their inorganic and polymeric rivals due to their versatility, definite chemical structures with accurate molecular weights, straightforward synthesis, simple purification, good solubility, easy infiltration into nanostructured materials, and excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility. Planar and inverted are the two popular designs of PSCs and are most commonly incorporated with 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-pmethoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifuorene (spiro-OMeTAD) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrenesulfonate)[PEDOT:PSS] HTMs, respectively. However, these HTMs suffer from unfavorable properties such as limited long-term stability, a high production cost, and moderate hole conductivity without doping. As a result, considerable effort has been put forward for developing alternatives that meet the following criteria: compatible energy levels with the valence band and conduction band of perovskite, adequate hole mobility, excellent thermal, photochemical, oxygen- and moisture-stability, high processability, good film-forming ability, and low cost.

Small organic molecule HTMs are classified into three types based on their configurational arrangements: donor–donor (D–π–D), donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D), and donor–acceptor (D–A). While many D–π–D HTMs have been successfully designed and used, polar HTMs such as D–A–D are also gaining popularity due to properties such as charge separation generation in the ground state and potential self-doping via increased electron delocalization. Also, the optical and electrical properties of D–A–D configured HTMs can be easily modified by changing the electron-withdrawing cores or end-capping electron-donating groups. As a result, polar-type organic compounds are becoming increasingly popular as HTMs in PSCs. Various functionalities, such as azomethine, arenes, imide-functionalized, oxadiazole, and diketopyrrolopyrrole have been used successfully to create and modify D–A–D-configured HTMs for inverted PSCs. In addition, various efficient HTM designs incorporating pyridine, a heterocyclic aromatic ring with nitrogen, have surfaced recently. These heterocyclic ring-inserted HTMs have shown passivating effects and improved hole extraction and transport capabilities. Therefore, we designed a new heterocyclic HTM WWC106 with benzimidazole in the center and a D–A–D configuration for use in an inverted PSC (Fig. 1). WWC106 is composed of two 4-methoxy-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-phenylanilines (TPAs) and one 2-(2,2-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)vinyl)-5-methylthiophene donor unit, and one pyridine-coupled benzimidazole acceptor unit. The formed pyridyl benzimidazole structure in the center is expected to coordinate the lead ion vacancy and induce a passivating effect, thereby improving HTM's hole mobility. Furthermore, the NH- of the benzimidazole ring in WWC106 can coordinate iodine ions and improve the perovskite morphology and crystallinity.

The synthesis of the new HTM WWC106 was completed using a simple convergent method and the detailed schemes are dispatched in the ESI (Schemes S1 and S2). The performance metric of the WWC106 HTM is compared to those of the PEDOT:PSS, which is the most commonly used HTM in inverted PSCs. The practical application of a HTM is determined by its photophysical properties, which include thermal stability, optical properties, and energy bands. The thermal stability of the WWC106 HTM was measured using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and the results are shown in Fig. 2(a). At 5% weight loss, the decomposition temperature of HTM WWC106 was 431 °C, indicating that the synthesized HTM is thermally stable for PSC fabrication. Using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, the optical properties of WWC106 were evaluated by measuring the absorption and transmittance of its films and the absorption of films with a perovskite layer deposited on them. The absorption spectra of the WWC106 film showed a broad peak at 409 nm, whereas the PEDOT:PSS absorption spectra showed a peak at 416 nm (Fig. 2(b)). The optical transmittance of the HTM in an inverted PSC should be in the 450–850 nm range to allow the perovskite layer deposited on top to gather enough light. WWC106 and PEDOT:PSS have similar transmittance ranges between 480 and 900 nm, with optimal transmittance values for HTM WWC106 around 500 nm and 490 nm for PEDOT:PSS, respectively. The transmittance spectra show that WWC106 is ideal and slightly more transparent than PEDOT:PSS. As a result, the ITO/WWC106/perovskite film absorbs more light in the visible spectrum than perovskite deposited on standard PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 2(c)).

HTM helps transport positive charges and reduce recombination, which largely depends on the interlayer energy level alignments and the hole mobility of the HTM. To evaluate band alignments between WWC106 and the perovskite, the energy levels of WWC106 were measured using cyclic voltammetry, and the results are shown in Table S1 (ESI). The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of WWC106 are −5.34 eV and −2.78 eV, respectively. The obtained energy levels show that the WWC106 energy bands are well aligned with perovskite energy bands and are favorable for hole transporting and electron blocking (Fig. S1, ESI). To measure the hole mobility of WWC106, the space charge limited current (SCLC) technique and ITO/HTMs/Au device structures were used. The hole mobility of the HTM WWC106 is 3.46 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas the hole mobility of the PEDOT:PSS is 2.83 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 2(d)). So far, the photophysical properties results show that the WWC106 is posed to be a good HTM for inverted PSCs.
In inverted PSCs, the HTM layer is placed under the absorber layer; its properties, such as surface wettability and morphology, can affect the perovskite layer above it. The surface wettability of WWC106 was determined by measuring the contact angle of a water droplet on its surface. WWC106 had a contact angle of 58.28° (Fig. 3(a)), which is higher than that of PEDOT:PSS (14.04°; Fig. S2, ESI). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterizations revealed that the perovskite deposited on top of WWC106 (Fig. 3(a)) formed larger and denser grains than the film deposited on PEDOT:PSS (Fig. S2, ESI). In addition, X-ray diffraction on perovskite thin films was recorded, and the resulting graph is shown in Fig. 3(b). Fig. 3(b) shows that the dominant planes for WWC106 and PEDOT:PSS incorporated perovskite thin films are 110 and 220. Conversely, the peaks for WWC106 are sharper than those for PEDOT:PSS, indicating high-quality crystallinity in the above-forming perovskites (Table S2 and Fig. S3, ESI). These findings are also reflected in the cross-sectional SEM observations in Fig. S4, ESI. We also used photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) to investigate the charge transfer and carrier recombination processes at perovskite/HTM contacts (Fig. 3(c) and (d)). Fig. 3(c) depicts the PL spectra of perovskite thin films on glass and HTMs when excited with the same laser power. The perovskite thin film shows the highest PL intensity, followed by perovskite/PEDOT:PSS and perovskite/WWC106. The charge transfer process could explain the difference in PL intensities between perovskite and perovskite/HTM. The lower the PL intensity, the greater the charge transfer. According to PL studies, it is clear that perovskite/WWC106 has a higher charge transfer capability than perovskite/PEDOT:PSS. Furthermore, TRPL was measured to confirm the charge transfer, and the decay curve was used to calculate the average carrier lifespan. The average decay times of perovskite/PEDOT:PSS and perovskite/WWC106 thin films are 2.19 ns and 1.19 ns, respectively (Table S3, ESI). The thin film trap density, interfacial defects, and energy level mismatch influence the PL intensity and carrier lifetime. Based on SEM and XRD crystallinity analysis, the trap density in perovskite/WWC106 is modest.
After collecting the information on the perovskite layer deposited on these HTMs, we fabricated photovoltaic devices and studied their performance utilizing these new HTMs. We form p–i–n PSCs using a device architecture consisting of indium-doped tin oxide (ITO)/HTM/perovskite/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag (Fig. 4(a)). As the photoactive absorber layer, we used MAPb(I0.9Cl0.1)3 and PCBM as the electron transportation material (ETM). The HTMs and PCBM/BCP layers were spin-cast, and the Ag electrode was deposited thermally (experimental details, ESI). The charge carrier equilibrium between the perovskite and HTM layers is affected by the thickness of the HTM layer. Therefore, we spin-coated WWC106 at various concentrations onto the ITO substrate and determined the minimum quantity of HTM required to generate smooth and uniform films. The photophysical behaviors of WWC106 at different concentrations (0.5–2.5 mg mL−1) are presented in Table 1 and Fig. S5 and S6 in the ESI. The open-circuit voltages (VOC) of the solar cells (Table 1) with different concentrations of WWC106 are nearly identical (1.07–1.08 V); however, there is a noticeable difference in the short-circuit current densities (JSC) and the fill factors (FF), which ranged from (18.39–21.00 mA cm−2) and (73.31–78.42), respectively. The PCEs of the PSCs ranged from 15.46% to 17.37% based on various concentrations of WWC106, with a decreasing trend as the thickness of the deposited HTM increased. According to the findings, 1 mg mL−1 of WWC106 can form a smooth layer on the ITO substrate and provide sufficient reaction space for larger grain perovskites. The corresponding PSC device has a maximum efficiency of 17.37%, with the highest JSC (21.00 mA cm−2). The VOC and FF values are 1.07 V and 77.08, respectively. The excellent performance of WWC106 at low concentrations could contribute to developing cost-effective p–i–n PSCs with good efficiency. Optimized PSC cells were assembled, and their photovoltaic performance was measured. Fig. 4(b) depicts the obtained J–V curves of solar cells incorporating the WWC106 and PEDOT:PSS HTMs as the photovoltaic characteristics listed in Table 2. With forward scanning, the standard HTM PEDOT:PSS gives a PCE of 15.20% with 0.98 V of VOC, a JSC of 19.32 mA cm−2, and an FF of 80.05. The PCE is 14.9% when the device is scanned in reverse, with VOC, JSC, and FF of 0.98 V, 19.20 mA cm−2, and 79.24. Under identical conditions, the cell based on the new HTM WWC106 showed higher VOC, indicating a better energy level alignment with the perovskite valance band. The JSC of the WWC106-based cell is also higher, indicating fewer defects and a higher degree of crystallinity in the perovskite layer, which leads to less recombination. The resulting PSC device has a PCE of 17.75% with 1.09 V of VOC, a JSC of 20.76 mA cm−2, and an FF of 78.90 under forward scan. On the other hand, a reverse scan records a PCE of 17.24% with 1.08 V of VOC, a JSC of 21.37 mA cm−2, and an FF of 74.53. Forward and reverse scans of the WWC106-based device yield comparable photovoltaic characteristics, indicating a very low hysteresis. The reason for this could be fewer charge traps and a more balanced charge between the perovskite and WWC106. To test WWC106's ability to interact with perovskite, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed, and the obtained results are shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d). The Pb 4f (Fig. 4(c)) and I 3d peaks (Fig. 4(d)) of the perovskite film with WWC16 show a shift to lower binding energy, confirming the robust interactions between WWC106 and the perovskite. The results show that the WWC106 HTM can effectively passivate uncoordinated Pb2+ and iodide defects due to pyridine-coupled benzimidazole heterocyclic functionality. The efficiency histogram for WWC106-based devices demonstrates the efficiency reproducibility pattern (Fig. 4(e)). PCE greater than 16.5% is recorded by more than 65% of the 36 PSC devices, indicating good reproducibility. Furthermore, the EQE spectrum (Fig. 4(f)) of WWC106 PSC demonstrates good conversion efficiency across the entire wavelength range of 300–800 nm. Based on the EQE spectra, PEDOT:PSS and WWC106 have integrated current densities of 17.6 and 19.8 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in good agreement with experimental JSC values obtained from J–V curves. The steady-state output current at the maximum power point was measured to confirm the performance of the WWC106 under real-world working conditions. Fig. 4(g) displays that a JSC of 19.7 mA cm−2 for WWC106 PSCs at 0.83 V shows almost no drop up to 1000 s. This outcome indicates that the WWC106-based device will perform satisfactorily. The long-term stability of PSCs based on dopant-free PEDOT:PSS and WWC106 was also tested (Fig. 4(h)). The WWC106-based devices were the most stable, with more than 90% of their original PCE retained after 500 hours. In contrast, the PCE of the PEDOT:PSS device retains up to 70% of its initial value under the same conditions. These findings indicate that the WWC106 HTM has superior performance and operation stability in inverted PSCs.

To summarize, we synthesized and tested a new D–A–D configured small molecule with a unique metal chelating heterocyclic central acceptor that can be used as the HTM in high-efficiency mixed-halide lead perovskite solar cells. The benzimidazole–pyridine heterocyclic-based dopant-free polar HTM is used to adjust and evaluate the effects of energy level engineering in perovskite solar cells. The WWC106-based device has a high open-circuit voltage of 1.09 V and a champion power conversion efficiency of 17.75%. The superior performance of WWC106 is attributed to its superior hole mobility, good film-forming capabilities, and well-aligned energy levels with the absorber material, all of which help charge transfer in perovskite solar cells and result in fewer charge traps. In addition, the new WWC106 HTM can form excellent films at low concentrations, which is advantageous for producing cost-effective PSCs. The new design concept of the hetero-structured WWC106 HTM paves the way for a new class of efficient HTMs.
