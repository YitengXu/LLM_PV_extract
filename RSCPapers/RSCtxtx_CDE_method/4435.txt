Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) coated with a thin layer of 1-(2-acryloyloxy-ethyl)-3-methyl-benzoimidazol-1-ium iodide were successfully fabricated by physical adsorption. They were then incorporated into poly(1-(2-acryloyloxy-ethyl)-3-methyl-imidazol-1-ium iodide (poly(AMImI))-based electrolytes to create an all-solid state dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the resulting DSSC was significantly increased, higher than that using poly(AMImI)-grafted MWCNT incorporated in the poly(AMImI)-based electrolytes. With gradual increases in the 1-(2-acryloyloxy-ethyl)-3-methyl-benzoimidazol-1-ium iodide-physisorbed MWCNT content from 0 to 0.5 wt%, the PCE increased from 1.156 to 3.551% at full sun and the short-circuit current density (JSC) increased from 2.367 to 8.505 mA cm−2. According to the linear sweep voltammetry measurements, the presence of 1-(2-acryloyloxy-ethyl)-3-methyl-benzoimidazol-1-ium iodide-physisorbed MWCNT in the solid-state electrolytes significantly increased the limiting current and the diffusion coefficient of I3−. Notably, the relationship between the JSC and the increase of limiting current with the content of 1-(2-acryloyloxy-ethyl)-3-methyl-benzoimidazol-1-ium iodide-physisorbed MWCNT is linear.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have attracted great attention recently owing to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and cost effectiveness. To upgrade their efficiency and long term stability, there has been much effort made to modify the components of DSSCs, such as design of new dyes, electrolytes, photoanodes, and counter electrodes. Notably, although the DSSCs using liquid electrolyte had high PCE, evaporation and leakage of the solvent have caused a great concern. To overcome these drawbacks, liquid electrolytes have been replaced with ionic liquids owing to their zero volatility, superior electrochemical properties and high ionic conductivity. One of the most applicable ionic liquids for DSSCs is 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII) due to its low viscosity. However, leaking of the ionic liquid electrolyte is still an unsolved issue, which has resulted in the investigation of organic gelators, inorganic nanoparticles, and others for gelatinizing the ionic liquids. Notably, Stathatos et al. has employed polysilsesquioxane polymeric ionic liquids as redox electrolyte for solid-state DSSCs with PCEs up to 3.1%.

Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) possess excellent electrical and thermal properties. They have tremendous potential applications in nanocomposite and electrolytes. Researchers usually oxidize the sidewall of MWCNTs with nitric acid and/or sulfuric acid to increase their dispersion in polar solvents and polymer matrices. However, surface oxidation of MWCNTs is often detrimental to their superior electrical and thermal properties.
In our previous work, two ionic liquid monomers, 1-(2-acryloyloxy-ethyl)-3-methyl-imidazol-1-ium iodide (AMImI) and 1-(2-acryloyloxy-ethyl)-3-methyl-benzoimidazol-1-ium iodide (AMBImI), were successfully polymerized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Poly(AMImI)-grafted MWCNTs (denoted as MWCNT-poly(AMImI)) were also fabricated using the “grafting from” ATRP method but the AMBImI monomer tended to encapsulate the bromo-functionalized MWCNT (denoted as MWCNT-Br) probably through the π–π and cation–π interactions invalidating the initiation capability of MWCNT-Br. Therefore, in this study, we directly mixed the untreated MWCNT with AMBImI and found MWCNTs could physisorb a thin layer of AMBImI (denoted as MWCNT/AMBImI). Both MWCNT-poly(AMImI) and MWCNT/AMBImI were well dispersed in the poly(AMImI)-based solid state electrolyte for DSSC.
Because untreated MWCNT has higher electric conductivity than oxidised MWCNT, we expected that the incorporation of MWCNT/AMBImI with poly(AMImI)-based electrolytes in an all solid state DSSC would have better photovoltaic performance than MWCNT-poly(AMImI). Therefore, their photovoltaic performance will be compared in association with their electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and linear sweep voltammetry.

MWCNT (O.D. 10–30 nm, I.D. 2–10 nm, length 0.1–10 μm, >90% carbon basis) was purchased from Aldrich. 1,1,4,7,7-Pentamethyldielthylenetriamine (PMDETA, 99%) and guanidinium thiocyanate (GuNCS) were received from Aros. Copper(I) bromide (CuBr, 99.999%), tert-butanol (99.5%), titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP, 98%), and 1-methylbenzimidazole (NMB) were received from Sigma-Aldrich. Acetonitrile (ACN) was received from J.T. Baker. UR-N3 dye was obtained from UnirRegion Bio-Tech. Indium tin oxide glass (ITO, ∼7 Ω per square) and fluorine-doped tin oxide glass (FTO, ∼7 Ω per square) were obtained from Solaronix. AMImI and AMBImI ionic liquid monomers were synthesized according to the method published elsewhere.


CuBr (0.065 mmol), PMDETA (0.130 mmol) and AMImI ionic liquid monomer (6.5 mmol) were added into a 25 mL round-bottom flask which has been loaded with 10 mL DMF under dry Ar. After 20 min of mixing, ethyl 2-bromoisobutyrate (0.065 mmol) as the initiator was added into the flask. The reaction system was degassed by a freeze–pump–thaw process three times and reacted at 90 °C for 1 day. The reaction mixture was diluted with 10 mL DMF and the raw product was then precipitated with large amount of acetone. By repeating dissolution–precipitation steps three times, the products were filtered and dried under reduced pressure. The yield was 1 g (50%).


MWCNT–C(O)OC2H4OC(O)C3H6Br (denoted as MWCNT-Br) as an initiator for ATRP was prepared according to the literature. In general, MWCNT was oxidized by 65% HNO3 first and then reacted with thionyl chloride to obtain MWCNT–C(O)Cl. MWCNT–C(O)OC2H4OH was prepared by reaction of MWCNT–C(O)Cl with glycol. MWCNT-Br was then prepared by reaction of MWCNT–C(O)OC2H4OH with 2-bromo-2-methylpropionyl bromide.

To prepare MWCNT-poly(AMImI), CuBr (0.065 mmol), PMDETA (0.130 mmol) and AMImI (6.5 mmol) were added into a 25 mL round-bottom flask which had been loaded with 10 mL Ar-purged DMF. The solution was then added to MWCNT-Br (0.1 g) and placed in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min. The reaction system was degassed by a freeze–pump–thaw process three times and reacted at 90 °C for 1 day. The mixture was poured into large amount of acetone and filtered through a 0.22 μm PVDF membrane to remove the liquid filtrate. After repeatedly washing the solid retentate with acetone and drying under reduced pressure, the powder form of MWCNT-poly(AMImI) was obtained.

MWCNT and AMBImI in DMF were sonicated for 30 min and then stirred at room temperature for 1 day. The mixture was then poured into large volume of acetone and filtered through 0.22 μm PVDF membrane. After washing with acetone and drying under reduced pressure, the powder form of MWCNT/AMBImI hybrid was obtained.


TiO2 mesoporous film for photoelectrode was prepared by sol–gel process. In general, 72 mL TTIP was added to 430 mL of 0.1 M HNO3 under vigorous stirring for 30 min. The solution was then heated to 85–90 °C and kept stirring for 8 h for peptization. After filtering to remove the large particles, the solution was placed in the autoclave to react at 240 °C for 12 h. After cooling, it was concentrated to 13 wt% of TiO2. Poly(ethylene glycol) was then added to the solution in 30 wt% of TiO2 weight. It was then spread on an FTO glass substrate using an adhesive tape as a spacer to control the paste thickness of ∼120 μm. The photoanode was obtained by heating the TiO2 on the FTO glass in an oven at 450 °C for 30 min and repeating the coating and heating process two more times to complete the sintering process. The final thickness of TiO2 layer was ∼12 μm.

A TiO2 area of 0.25 cm2 in square was then selected as an active area and immersed into a solution containing 3 × 10−4 M N3 dye in acetonitrile/tert-butanol (1:1 in volume ratio) mixed solvent for 24 h. The counter electrode was fabricated by sputtering a thin Pt layer with a thickness of ∼100 nm on ITO substrate.
Poly(AMImI)-based electrolyte systems were prepared by dissolving 0.066 g NMB, 0.012 g GuNCS and 1 g poly(AMImI) in 3 mL acetonitrile, which was then added 0.038 g I2 and 0.5 mg MWCNT-poly(AMImI) or an allocated amount of MWCNT/AMBImI. The solutions were placed in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min and then the acetonitrile was removed under reduced pressure. The prepared polymer electrolytes were heated to a viscous state and evenly coated on a photoelectrode that had been enclosed by a center-cut spacer (polyimide thin film) with 60 μm thickness. The assembly of DSSCs was done by pressing the counter electrode against the electrolyte-filled dye-sensitized electrode with clip.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted using TA Instruments SDT-Q600 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2. Photovoltaic characterization of the DSSCs was carried out at 100 mW cm−2 by illuminating the cell with a 1000 W ozone-free xenon lamp equipped with a water-based IR filter and AM 1.5 filter (Sciencetech). Their photocurrent–voltage characterization plots and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded with a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 302N, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, the Netherlands). The limiting current of the solid-state electrolytes was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) using potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 302N, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, The Netherlands) with the steady scan rate of 1 mV s−1 at room temperature, where the electrolytes were sandwiched by two platinum-sputtered ITO glasses. The gap between two electrodes was set up by using a center-cut spacer with 60 μm thickness.


The physical adsorption of AMBImI onto MWCNT after mixing in DMF to form MWCNT/AMBImI was investigated by TGA and HRTEM. Fig. 1 shows the TGA result in comparison with the pristine MWCNT. At 550 °C, the weight loss of MWCNT/AMBImI is 3.6% more than that of the pristine MWCNT, which was contributed by the physisorbed AMBImI on MWCNT. A thin AMBImI amorphous layer on the MWCNT sidewall can be clearly observed by HRTEM, as shown in the inset. Aida et al. have reported that room-temperature ionic liquids can interact with single-walled carbon nanotubes through the so-called cation–π interaction. However, because AMImI was demonstrated to be incapable of physisorption onto MWCNT, we believed that the aromatic ring of AMBImI enhanced its physical interactions with MWCNT probably through π–π (ref. 34) and cation–π (ref. 35) interactions as schematically illustrated in Fig. 2(a).

To estimate the surface coverage of AMBImI molecules on MWCNT based on the TGA results, we assume that for a single MWCNT, the O.D. is ∼30 nm, the I.D. is ∼10 nm, and the length is ∼1 μm. Therefore, the volume of each MWCNT would be ∼6.3 × 105 nm3. Because the density of MWCNT is 1.4, there would be 1.13 × 1015 MWCNTs per gram. Therefore, the 3.6% weight loss measured by TGA corresponds to 5.4 × 104 AMBImI molecules physisorbed onto the surface of each MWCNT. Assuming that the AMBImI molecule physisorbed flat on MWCNT covers a surface area of 0.84 nm2, as estimated by its Chem3D drawing shown in Fig. 2(b), 5.4 × 104 AMBImI molecules would cover 49% surface area of MWCNT. Although AMBImI covers less than a monolayer on the MWCNT, it significantly contributes to the dispersion of MWCNT in ethanol as shown in Fig. 1b.

Poly(AMImI) and MWCNT-poly(AMImI) have been well characterized in our previous paper. Poly(AMImI) with the molecular weight of 3700 g mol−1 is a powder form at room temperature but shows rubbery behaviour after incorporation with electrolytes. All the ingredients such as NMB, GuNCS, I2, and poly(AMImI) were dissolved in acetonitrile first and then mixed with 0.05 wt% of MWCNT/AMBImI and MWCNT-poly(AMImI), respectively, based on the weight of poly(AMImI) matrix. After they were fully mixed, the acetonitrile was removed by vacuum. MWCNT/AMBImI and MWCNT-poly(AMImI) were dispersed well in the poly(AMImI) electrolytes. No macroscopic aggregation was observed. Fig. 3(a) shows the photocurrent versus voltage plots for the fabricated DSSC with poly(AMImI)-based electrolytes with and without MWCNT/AMBImI and MWCNT-poly(AMImI) under standard global AM 1.5 full sunlight. Their photovoltaic properties such as short-circuit current (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), PCE (η) and fill factor (FF) were summarized in Table 1.

The PCE of the DSSC with a solid-state electrolyte containing 0.05 wt% MWCNT/AMBImI was 2.598%, the highest among the three electrolyte systems. The sample containing 0.05 wt% MWCNT-poly(AMImI) was 1.681%, still higher than that with neat polymer electrolytes. The increase of PCE was owing to the higher JSC, as the VOC had barely changed. That implies that the presence of MWCNT/AMBImI and MWCNT-poly(AMImI) has increased the diffusion of I3− in the solid-state electrolytes contributing to the increase of JSC. To verify this presumption, we used the LSV technique to measure the anodic and cathodic steady-state polarization diffusion-limited current (JSS) with the results shown in Fig. 3b. The peaks appeared in the linear sweep voltammetric measurements because of non-fluidity of all-solid state electrolytes resulting in the accumulation of electrons in electrolyte. A similar phenomenon has been reported for gel-type electrolytes. Similar to JSC, the solid state electrolyte with 0.05 wt% MWCNT/AMBImI has the highest JSS and the electrolyte without any addition of MWCNT has the lowest JSS. Moreover, the diffusion coefficient (DI3−) of I3− in the solid-state electrolytes can be calculated by the following equation
DI3− = JSSl/2nFCI3−
(1)
where
l is the electrode distance, n is the electron transfer number per molecule, F is Faraday's constant, and CI3− is the molar concentration of triiodide ions. The results were also included in Table 1. DI3− of the MWCNT/AMBImI-incorporated electrolyte is about 50% more than that of MWCNT-poly(AMImI)-incorporated, and the latter is about 4 times that of the neat polymer electrolyte, which indicates that the presence of MWCNT facilitates the diffusion of I3−. These results also support the increase of photocurrent for the fabricated DSSC. The higher limiting current and greater DI3− for MWCNT/AMBImI-incorporated electrolyte compared to MWCNT-poly(AMImI)-incorporated was believed to be due to the fact that the surface of MWCNT for the latter has been partially damaged by oxidation and polymerization through ATRP.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was then used to compare the ionic transport processes among the three solid-state electrolytes in the DSSCs. The results are shown in Fig. 4, where the inset is the equivalent circuit to simulate the experimental data. There are three semicircles in the order of increasing frequency from 5 mHz to 65 kHz. Generally, Rs is associated with overall series resistance in the DSSC; R1 is the charge transfer resistance occurring at the Pt counter-electrode; R2 is associated with the resistance at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface; whereas R3 estimated from the largest semicircle is associated with the Warburg diffusion in the electrolytes. Notably, MWCNT/AMBImI-incorporated electrolyte has the smallest R3 (47.08 Ω), indicating that the electrolyte has a faster diffusion rate, which supports the results of DI3− (see Table 1). Therefore, we gradually increased the content of MWCNT/AMBImI in the poly(AMImI) electrolyte to investigate its concentration effect on the photovoltaic performance of DSSC.

The photocurrent versus voltage plots for the DSSCs using poly(AMImI) electrolytes incorporating various weight percentages of MWCNT/AMBImI were shown in Fig. 5a. As the content of MWCNT/AMBImI was increased from 0 to 0.5 wt%, the PCE gradually increased from 1.16 to 3.55%, along with the increase of JSC and VOC. The limiting currents of poly(AMImI) electrolytes incorporating MWCNT/AMBImI measured by LSV also increased (Fig. 5b). The current density (1.04 × 10−3 mA cm−2) and DI3− for the electrolyte containing 0.5 wt% MWCNT/AMBImI is the highest, about 13 times more than that without MWCNT/AMBImI. However, as the content of MWCNT/AMBIm was increased to 1 wt%, the PCE of DSSC decreased to 2.917% along with the decrease of JSC and VOC (Table 2). The limiting current also decreased to 8.0 × 10−4 mA cm−2.

The EIS results shown in Fig. 6 indicate that with the increase of MWCNT/AMBImI content in the electrolyte from 0 to 0.5 wt%, R3 (estimated from the largest semicircle) gradually reduced from 118.3 to 27.18 Ω. With further increases in the MWCNT/AMBImI content to 1 wt%, R3 increased to 34.11 Ω. The trend is similar to that of JSC. Apparently, the increase of electric conductivity for solid state electrolyte by incorporating MWCNT/AMBImI is responsible for the increase of JSC. This is highly possible because the bottleneck for the photovoltaic performance of DSSC with solid-state electrolyte is the slow diffusion of the I−/I3− redox couple. MWCNT provides a highway route for the transportation of charges. It is presumable that under the influence of electric field, the I−/I3− redox couple in the solid state electrolyte would perform a series of oxidation and reduction reactions. The generated charges would be easily taken over by the MWCNT present in the vicinity as schematically illustrated in Fig. 7. When the content of MWCNT/AMBImI was increased to 1 wt%, it may introduce the inhomogeneous dispersion of MWCNT/AMBImI in the solid state electrolyte, rendering the decrease of both JSC and VOC.

Fig. 8a shows the plots of JSC and limiting current versus the content of MWCNT/AMBImI in the polymer electrolytes. Drastic increases in the JSC and limiting current were found when 0.05 wt% of MWCNT/AMBImI was added. The trends for both JSC and limiting current with the MWCNT/AMBImI content are basically similar. By plotting the JSCversus limiting current, we found a linear relationship as shown in Fig. 8b. It supports the hypothesis that the photocurrent of the DSSC is dependent on the electric conductivity of solid state electrolyte and the well-dispersed MWCNT/AMBImI plays a major role to increase the electric conductivity.

Both MWCNT/AMBImI and MWCNT-poly(AMImI) can be well dispersed in the poly(AMImI) electrolyte, which significantly increased the PCE of the resulting solid-state DSSC. Because no surface oxidation of MWCNT for MWCNT/AMBImI has been applied, it is very effective at increasing the PCE. As the content of MWCNT/AMBImI was increased from 0 to 0.5 wt%, the PCE gradually increased from 1.16 to 3.55% along with an increase in the JSC and VOC. Notably, there is a linear relationship between the increase in JSC and limiting current, indicating that the well-dispersed MWCNT/AMBImI plays a major role in increasing the charge transportation of the poly(AMImI) electrolyte.
