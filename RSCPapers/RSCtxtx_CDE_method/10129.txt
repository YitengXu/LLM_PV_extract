Fine tuning the end groups of non-fused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) is one of the effective methods to reduce energy loss in organic solar cells (OSCs) and thus realize high power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this work, a series of NFREAs with fluorine substituted and chlorinated INCN end groups, FC8-0F, FC8-1F, FC8-2F and FC8-2Cl, were designed, synthesized and applied to OSCs. With the decrease of F atoms on the terminal groups, FC8-0F and FC8-1F exhibit an obvious blue-shifted absorption spectrum and a weaker intramolecular charge transfer effect than FC8-2F and FC8-2Cl. Thus, when blending the four NFREAs with the same polymer donor (PBDB-TF) to fabricate OSCs, FC8-0F- and FC8-1F-based devices show an unsatisfied PCE of 8.95% and 11.46% although they both present lower energy loss. In comparison, FC8-2Cl exhibits an enhanced intramolecular charge transfer effect and possesses an absorption range extended to about 980 nm with a narrower band-gap of 1.26 eV than FC8-2F (1.30 eV). Therefore, the FC8-2Cl-based OSC yields the highest PCE of 13.28% with a simultaneously enhanced open circuit voltage of 0.756 V, a short circuit current density of 24.03 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 73.05% due to its relatively lower energy loss, highest extinction coefficient, fibrillar bi-continuous morphology structure and appropriate miscibility in the blends. These results demonstrate that a simple and feasible molecular design method developed by end group engineering can be used to develop low-cost non-fused acceptors with low energy loss.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted extensive attention due to their distinct advantages such as light weight, flexibility, solution processability, and facile large-area printing capability. In recent years, with the development of novel photovoltaic materials and device processing technology, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have been constantly improved. Among the electron acceptors, A–D–A type (where D and A refer to the electron-donating and electron-withdrawing unit, respectively) non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have become important candidates to fabricate high performance OSCs due to their highly tunable absorption spectra, energy levels and good crystallinities. However, with large fused ring central cores as the electron-donating units, most A–D–A type NFAs suffer from complex synthesis procedures, overall low yields and thus high costs. To address the critical cost issues, many research studies have been conducted to design novel non-fused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs), intending to realize low-cost and highly efficient acceptors simultaneously.

In order to obtain comparable PCEs with their fused-ring counterparts, NFREAs should have suitable optical band-gaps (Egs), favorable aggregation behaviors and planar stable chemical conformations, which can be tuned using chemical modification methods. For example, Chen et al. reported a NFREA named PTB4Cl by replacing F with Cl on the terminal groups of PTB4F. PTB4Cl shows an obvious red-shifted absorption spectrum compared to PTB4F, with Eg reduced from 1.65 eV to 1.58 eV. Recently, Bo et al. designed two complete NFREAs, o-4TBC-2F and m-4TBC-2F, by introducing the hexyloxy chains onto different locations of the phenyl substituents. In comparison with m-4TBC-2F, o-4TBC-2F exhibited much more planar molecular geometry, lower Eg and higher crystallinity, and a high PCE of 10.26% was then achieved using a PBDB-T:o-4TBC-2F-based OSC. In addition, there are two main molecular design strategies to achieve NFREAs with stable chemical conformations, one is constructing intramolecular non-covalent interactions (O⋯S, F⋯S, N⋯S, H⋯F), and the other is introducing large steric hindrance into the conjugated main chains. The stability of the conjugated skeleton of the NFREAs such as BTIC-EH, Ph-IC, PTIC, A4T-16 and o-4TBC can all be enhanced by the above-mentioned strategies, leading to favorable PCEs. In spite of this, the NFREA molecules, in which the conjugated units were connected by C–C single bonds, are still not as rigid as their counterparts with fused heterocyclic rings. The vibrational and rotational intrinsic characteristics of the NFREAs may result in much higher energy loss (Eloss) in OSCs. However, there are few studies focusing on the regulation of energy loss of NFREAs. In the reported works, the Eloss of OSCs based on NFREAs ranges from 0.59 to 0.72 eV, which is significantly higher than that of the fused-ring electron acceptors. Therefore, it is of great significance to investigate the relationship between the chemical structures and the Eloss features of NFREAs.
In our previous work, we introduced a large steric hindrance group, 3,3′-bis(2,4,6-triisopropyl-phenyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (TT-Pi) to improve the conformation stability of NFREAs, and synthesized a series of materials such as A4T-16, A4T-26, GS-ISO and so on. We subsequently designed three low band-gap NFREAs: C8-2F, FC8-2F and MeC8-2F, with the electron-donating/withdrawing units being introduced on the N-octyl-N-phenyl-thiophene (OPT) substituents. The FC8-2F based device exhibited promising photovoltaic performance, along with a suitable Eg of 1.30 eV. However, the Eloss in this device is quite large, which adversely results in an unsatisfactory open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.742 V. Thus, it is necessary to further reduce the energy loss (Eloss) of FC8-2F, so as to enhance the VOC as well as the PCE of NFREA-based OSCs. Based on the strategies to modulate Eloss by reducing electron-withdrawing capability or introducing Cl atoms on the A-type end groups of acceptors, we modified the reported FC8-2F molecule and synthesized FC8-0F, FC8-1F and FC8-2Cl, respectively. Compared to the photoactive blend based on FC8-2F, the Eloss values of the OSCs based on FC8-0F and FC8-1F are indeed decreased. However, due to the weaker electron-withdrawing properties of their end groups, the corresponding absorption spectra of FC8-0F and FC8-1F are blue-shifted, which is not favorable to realize high short circuit current density (JSC). Besides, the exciton dissociation efficiencies of these devices are relatively low due to insufficient driving force, leading to further reduced JSCs. Therefore, when blending the three fluorine-substituted NFREAs with the same polymer donor, PBDB-TF, the FC8-2F-based OSC still shows the highest PCE of 12.34%. Encouragingly, the chlorine-substituted NFREA, FC8-2Cl, shows a significantly stronger intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect along with red-shifted absorption and lower Eloss in the device. Thus, the PBDB-TF:FC8-2Cl based OSC attained a promising PCE of 13.28%, proving that Cl substitution is an effective way to reduce Eloss in this NFREA system.
The molecular structures of the target NFREAs, FC8-0F, FC8-1F, FC8-2F and FC8-2Cl, are shown in Fig. 1a, their synthetic routes are provided in the ESI (Scheme S1), and the chemical structure of PBDB-TF is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI). As depicted, the four NFREAs were constructed with a typical acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure and they share the same non-fused D-core unit which can help obtaining low band-gap acceptors by introducing N-alkylaniline-substituents. The 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene) malononitrile (INCN)-derivatives with different numbers of fluorine atoms selected as the A-type end groups for FC8-0F, FC8-1F and FC8-2F, and FC8-2Cl were constructed using the chlorinated INCN group. All of the chemical structures of the four NFREAs were verified using 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy and they all have good solubility in the commonly used solvents used in the OSC fabrication process, such as chloroform, toluene, chlorobenzene and o-xylene.
To investigate the optimal conformations of FC8-0F, FC8-1F, FC8-2F and FC8-2Cl, quantum chemistry calculations were performed using Gaussian 09 with density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level (Fig. S2, ESI). As shown, all the four molecules exhibit a planar conjugated framework, which is conducive to π–π stacking and intermolecular charge transport. It can be found that the HOMOs of these molecules are mainly delocalized on the central cores, while the LUMO energy levels are localized along the backbones. The calculated HOMO/LUMO levels are −5.33/−3.43 eV for FC8-0F, −5.38/−3.49 eV for FC8-1F, −5.44/−3.58 eV for FC8-2F and −5.48/−3.66 eV for FC8-2Cl, respectively.
The absorption spectra of FC8-0F, FC8-1F, FC8-2F and FC8-2Cl in chloroform solution and as solid films are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI) and Fig. 1b. In the solution state, all of these four electron acceptors present an absorption wavelength range between 500 nm and 800–850 nm. With the increase of fluorine atoms on the end groups from FC8-0F to FC8-2F, their absorption peaks gradually red-shifted from 720 to 740 nm, and FC8-2Cl shows an absorption peak at 756 nm. In comparison with the absorption in solution, the four acceptors show significant redshifted absorption in thin films. As shown in Fig. 1b, the absorption onsets of the NFREAs are at 875 nm, 930 nm, 950 nm and 980 nm, corresponding to an Eg of 1.42 eV, 1.33 eV, 1.30 eV and 1.26 eV for FC8-0F, FC8-1F, FC8-2F and FC8-2Cl, respectively. Meanwhile, the three fluorine-substituted acceptors show similar absorption coefficients (a) of ∼6 × 104 cm−1, and FC8-2Cl exhibits a slightly higher a value of 8.11 × 104 cm−1. The strengthened electron-withdrawing effect of the end groups from FC8-0F to FC8-2F and to FC8-2Cl in this study led to their enhanced ICT effect, redshifted absorption and decreased Eg values. Besides, the absorption spectra of the four acceptors indicate that they all have a complementary spectrum with the donor polymer PBDB-TF in the visible and near-infrared region and have potential to attain high JSC in the corresponding OSCs. To investigate the effect of F or Cl substitution on the energy levels of the four NFREAs, we performed cyclic voltammetry (CV) to calculate their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest empty molecular orbital (LUMO). As shown in Fig. 1c, with the increase of the F atoms on the end groups, the HOMO/LUMO levels of FC8-0F, FC8-1F and FC8-2F are −5.43/−3.92 eV, −5.47/−3.98 eV and −5.54/−4.08 eV, respectively. FC8-2Cl shows a similar HOMO/LUMO energy level to FC8-2F, which is −5.53/−4.06 eV. The energy levels obtained from the CV measurements are consistent with the calculated results. In comparison with the energy level of the commonly used donor, PBDB-TF, we can reasonably speculate that the PBDB-TF:FC8-2F- and PBDB-TF:FC8-2Cl-based OSCs should have very similar VOC, and the PBDB-TF:FC8-0F-based one should have the highest VOCs but may exhibit unsatisfactory current due to the insufficient driving force for exciton dissociation. Besides, the FC8-0F- and FC8-1F-based OSCs may have lower JSCs when compared to the FC8-2F- and FC8-2Cl-based ones due to their blue-shifted absorption spectrum. Meanwhile, the electrostatic potential (ESP) distributions of the four acceptors are shown in Fig. 1d. It can be seen that the ESP values of FC8-0F, FC8-1F, FC8-2F and FC8-2Cl became higher in turn, indicating their gradually enhanced electron accepting capability and they may show a distinct charge transfer process when blending with the donor material. Basically, with the increasing degree of electron-withdrawing ability on the end groups of NFREAs, more efficient and sufficient charge dissociation can be realized in the corresponding blend films.
In order to explore the photovoltaic properties of FC8-0F, FC8-1F, FC8-2F and FC8-2Cl, a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-TF:NFREAs/PFN-Br/Al, using PBDB-TF as the donor was constructed and characterized in parallel. The optimal parameters for device fabrication, including the D:A ratio, additives and annealing temperature, were explored carefully (Tables S1–S5, ESI). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized cells are plotted in Fig. 2a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1.

As shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1, the FC8-0F-based OSC shows an inferior PCE of 8.95% with a high VOC of 0.90 V, a JSC of 16.31 mA cm−2 and an inadequate FF of 60.89%. Due to the gradually lower LUMO levels from FC8-0F to FC8-1F and FC8-2F, the FC8-1F- and FC8-2F-based OSCs show decreased VOC values of 0.810 V and 0.742 V, respectively. While owing to the pronounced red-shifted absorption of FC8-1F and FC8-2F than FC8-0F, higher JSCs of 20.52 and 22.90 mA cm−2 can be realized in the corresponding OSCs. Combined with the desirable FF values of 68.97% and 72.57%, significantly high performances of 11.46% and 12.34% can be achieved in PBDB-TF:FC8-1F- and PBDB-TF:FC8-2F-based OSCs, respectively. When utilizing the chlorine substituent NFREA, FC8-2Cl, as the acceptor, as depicted before, the FC8-2Cl-based OSC exhibits a similar VOC of 0.756 V to that of the FC8-2F-based one, and a PCE of 13.28%, with a JSC of 24.03 mA cm−2 and an FF of 73.05%, can be realized, which is the highest value among those of the studied NFREAs. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement was then utilized to verify the JSCs achieved from the J–V profiles for the above-mentioned blend films. As presented in Fig. 2b, the studied blend films all show a wide and broad EQE response range with the absorption edges falling in the near infrared region, which is consistent with the UV-vis absorption spectra of the thin films. The blends based on PBDB-TF:FC8-2Cl show an obviously higher EQE value than the FC8-2F-based device. According to the literature, the EQE values in a short wave range of 400–650 nm are mainly ascribed to the contribution of donor PBDB-TF, and the EQE values in the long range are mainly ascribed to the acceptors. A maximum EQE value of 70% is obtained for PBDB-TF:FC8-2Cl at 774 nm, higher than 63% of FC8-2F-based cells, 56% of FC8-1F-based cells, 48% of FC8-0F-based cells in the long wave direction, which means excitons are efficiently utilized in halogenated acceptor-based OSCs, especially for FC8-2Cl. The integrated calculated JSCs of PBDB-TF:FC8-0F-, PBDB-TF:FC8-1F-, PBDB-TF:FC8-2F- and PBDB-TF:FC8-2Cl-based OSCs are 15.51, 19.89, 22.11 and 22.94 mA cm−2, respectively, which agree well with the values from the J–V measurement with a mismatch within 5%.
To probe the effects of F/Cl atoms on the exciton dissociation process, the dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) was studied and shown in Fig. 2c. Jph is defined as the difference between JL − JD, where JL, JD represent the current density under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage when JL = JD and Va stands for the applied voltage. For OSCs, when Veff is over 2 V, Jph reaches saturation and OSCs achieve their saturated photocurrent (Jsat). The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) can be determined using the equation Pdiss = JSC/Jsat. The Pdiss values for FC8-0F-, FC8-1F-, FC8-2F- and FC8-2Cl-based cells were calculated to be 84.2%, 88.9%, 90.6% and 93.8%, respectively. These results suggest that more sufficient exciton dissociation can be realized with the increase of the fluorination degree, and they are also consistent with the previously mentioned ESP results. For the FC8-2Cl-based device, the Pdiss value is slightly higher than that of the fluorinated counterpart, which is mainly because of its more pronounced ICT effect.
Meanwhile, in order to investigate the charge extraction and charge recombination process in these OSCs, we measured the dependence of JSC and VOC on various illumination intensities (Plight). The relationship of JSC and the light intensity satisfied the formula of JSC ∝ Pαlight, where α implies the extent of biomolecular recombination. It suggests less biomolecular recombination in the corresponding cells when α was close to 1. As illustrated in Fig. 2d, the α values of FC8-0F-, FC8-1F-, FC8-2F- and FC8-2Cl-based OSCs were 0.98, 1.01, 0.99 and 1.00, respectively, meaning that under short-circuit current conditions, charges are effectively extracted prior to biomolecular recombination for all the four OSCs. The slope of VOC to Plight reflects the relative degree of trap-assisted recombination in the device, which follows the law of VOC ∝ nkT/qln(Plight), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature and q is the elementary charge. It indicates that the biomolecular recombination mechanism was dominant when the slope was close to kT/q, and the devices suffer a complete trap-assisted recombination when the slope was 2kT/q. As plotted in Fig. 2e, the fitted n values were 1.07, 1.05, 0.99, 1.00 for FC8-0F-, FC8-1F-, FC8-2F- and FC8-2Cl-based devices, respectively, implying weak trap-assisted recombination in all of the blends.
Photo-induced charge carrier extraction by linear increasing voltage (Photo-CELIV) measurement was conducted to study the carrier mobilities in the above four OSCs. The photo-CELIV transients of the four devices are depicted in Fig. 2f, and it can be found that the OSCs based on PBDB-TF:FC8-0F, PBDB-TF:FC8-1F and PBDB-TF:FC8-2F exhibited similar carrier mobilities, and the PBDB-TF:FC8-2Cl based one shows a slightly higher mobility of 4.16 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. It is worth noting that the FC8-0F-, FC8-1F-, FC8-2F- and FC8-2Cl-based devices yielded increasing charge-carrier densities in turn, which are highly consistent with the measured JSC values. We then measured the electron and hole mobility (μe and μh) values of the above mentioned films by utilizing the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S4a and b, ESI). The μeS of FC8-0F-, FC8-1F- and FC8-2F-based films are gradually enhanced, and are 3.27 × 10−6, 1.17 × 10−4 and 2.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. FC8-2Cl-based devices show obviously higher mobility with a μe value of 3.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. As for μhs of these NFREAs-based blends, they show a similar regular law with μh values of 5.38 × 10−4, 6.64 × 10−4, 1.88 × 10−3 and 2.42 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and the highest mobilities should be responsible for the enhanced JSC and FF in the FC8-2Cl-based OSCs.
The study on energy loss has significant importance in guiding molecular design and improving the performance of OSCs. In this work, the Egs of the four NFREAs were determined by the intersection of EQE and EL curves, thus as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI), the Eg values of FC8-0F-, FC8-1F-, FC8-2F- and FC8-2Cl-based devices were measured to be 1.48, 1.39, 1.35 and 1.34 eV, respectively. The external quantum efficiency of electroluminescence (EQEEL) was employed to evaluate the non-radiative energy loss (ΔEnon-rad) in the four studied blends. As demonstrated in Fig. S6 (ESI), the FC8-0F-based blend showed a relatively high EQEEL of 4 × 10−4, and according to the formula ΔEnon-rad = −kTln(EQEEL), a resultant ΔEnon-rad of 0.200 eV can be calculated. When F/Cl atoms were introduced onto the end groups, the other PBDB-TF:NFREA-based devices displayed slightly decreased EQEEL values, which were corresponding to ΔEnon-rads of 0.234, 0.271 and 0.257 eV for FC8-1F-, FC8-2F- and FC8-2Cl-based OSCs, respectively. Since FC8-2F and FC8-2Cl have very similar LUMO levels, we can infer that the lower VOC of PBDB-TF:FC8-2F-based OSC may originate from its higher voltage loss than that of PBDB-TF:FC8-2Cl-based one. Meanwhile, the highly sensitive EQE (s-EQE) and EL spectra are measured to determine the energy of the charge transfer state by fitting the corresponding curves, and Fig. 3a–d show that the ECT values of FC8-0F-, FC8-1F-, FC8-2F- and FC8-2Cl-based OSCs are estimated to be 1.46, 1.36, 1.32 and 1.30 eV. Then, the radiative recombination energy loss (ΔErad) values for the PBDB-TF:NFREA cells are calculated to be 0.359, 0.316, 0.307 and 0.287 eV. The detailed information of energy loss is presented in Table 2 and the results clearly showed that the energy loss of the NFREA-based device can be decreased by replacing F with Cl on the end groups.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement was conducted to observe the surface morphology of the four blend films. As displayed in Fig. S7a–d (ESI), the surface roughness (Rq) of FC8-0F-based blends was measured to be 3.26 nm, and the film exhibited obvious aggregation and a rougher surface than the other three blends. The blend films based on F/Cl- substituted acceptors (FC8-1F, FC8-2F and FC8-2Cl) showed apparently smooth surfaces and slightly lower Rq values, which are 1.38, 1.42 and 1.17 nm, respectively. In addition, favorable nanoscale phase separation and well-developed fibrillar-like net structures could be observed from all of the topography images (Fig. S7e–h, ESI), which are helpful for exciton dissociation and charge transport to achieve favorable JSC. Then, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed to illustrate the bulk morphology of the studied blend films. As shown in Fig. 4a–d, different from the observed AFM images, the FC8-1F-, FC8-2F- and FC8-2Cl-based blends exhibit more obvious aggregation and distinct phase separation than the FC8-0F-based counterpart. Appropriate miscibility between the donor and acceptor is very important to form a well-developed morphology such as a suitable domain size and high domain purity. To further explore the miscibility of PBDB-TF and the four NFREAs, contact angle measurement was conducted based on liquid drops of water and glycerol. The detailed results are displayed in Fig. S8 and Table S6 (ESI). The calculated surface free energy (γ) values of FC8-0F, FC8-1F, FC8-2F and FC8-2Cl are 22.52, 26.42, 29.95 and 29.51 mN m−1. According to the Flory–Huggins model equation, the obtained interaction parameters (χ) between the polymer donor and the NFREAs are 0.19, 0.69, 1.35, 1.26 for FC8-0F-, FC8-1F-, FC8-2F- and FC8-2Cl-based blends, respectively. The higher χ value between the donor and the acceptor suggests lower miscibility and better phase separation, which may explain the high FF achieved in the FC8-2F and FC8-2Cl-based cells.
In order to probe the molecular and orientation properties of the four NFREAs and the corresponding blend films, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurement was utilized. Fig. S9 (ESI) shows the 2D patterns of the pristine films and the corresponding 1D in plane (IP) and out of plane (OOP) profiles. As shown, FC8-0F neat films possess weak (010) diffraction peaks in the IP and OOP directions, which implies the coexistence of “face-on” and “edge-on” orientations. In comparison, all of the other three pristine films show an obvious (010) diffraction peak in the OOP direction and a (100) peak in the IP direction, showing a preferential face-on orientation. From the 1D profiles of the OOP direction, FC8-1F, FC8-2F and FC8-2Cl neat films have a similar (010) diffraction peak at 1.74 Å−1, corresponding to a π–π distance of ∼3.61 Å. After blending the four NFREAs with PBDB-TF, as depicted in Fig. 4, each of the resultant OSCs presented a strong (010) diffraction peak in the OOP direction at about 1.76 Å−1 and a pronounced (100) diffraction peak, thus leading to a favorable face-on orientation with an estimated smaller π–π stacking distance of 3.57 Å, which is often considered to be more helpful for the charge transport process in the blends. Moreover, the crystal coherence lengths (CCLs) in the OOP direction of the blend films were calculated by using the Scherrer equation, and are 2.39, 2.59, 2.73 and 2.81 nm for PBDB-TF:FC8-0F, PBDB-TF:FC8-1F, PBDB-TF:FC8-2F and PBDB-TF:FC8-2Cl, respectively. The gradually increasing CCLs indicate that the better molecular packing and orientation properties of the FC8-2Cl-based device may lead to its enhanced FF and better photovoltaic performances.

In summary, a series of non-fused ring electron acceptors, including FC8-0F, FC8-1F, FC8-2F and FC8-2Cl, whose A type end groups were H/F/Cl substituted INCN derivatives, were designed and synthesized to investigate their photovoltaic properties. All the four NFREAs exhibit a stable planar conformation and have great electron-accepting capability. As the electron-withdrawing effect was enhanced by increasing the F atoms or introducing Cl atoms into the end groups, the absorption onsets of the acceptors were gradually redshifted and the four NFREAs show a low band-gap feature with Eg values of 1.42 eV, 1.33 eV, 1.30 eV and 1.26 eV for FC8-0F, FC8-1F, FC8-2F and FC8-2Cl, respectively. The photovoltaic properties were studied by blending the four acceptors with the same polymer donor (PBDB-TF). Among these acceptor-based cells, FC8-2Cl-based cells yielded the highest extinction coefficients, a fibrillar bi-continuous morphology structure, and appropriate miscibility in the blends, thus a high PCE of 13.28% with a low energy loss was successfully obtained. Overall, this work demonstrates a simple and feasible molecular design method by end group engineering to develop low-cost non-fused acceptors with low energy loss.
