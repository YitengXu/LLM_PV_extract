The discovery of an easy and powerful way to further improve and stabilize the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) from the current levels would advance their commercialization. In this work, an unprecedented power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.6% with improved stability is demonstrated by using a high-quality n-type macromolecular additive P(NDI2OD-T2) via a simple route without additional processing steps, where the high-quality P(NDI2OD-T2) is isolated by a THF-soaking treatment. We attribute the improved performance to advantageous changes in the morphology of the photoactive materials induced by the macromolecular additive. In addition, using the ITO-free architecture on a flexible PET substrate, we obtain an impressive PCE of 5.66% in macromolecular additive-processed devices. Due to its great applicability and easy accessibility, the use of the macromolecular additive introduced in this study has great potential for broad applications with other OSC systems, which will accelerate the commercial viability of photovoltaic technology.

Over the past few decades, growing interest in the development of organic solar cells (OSCs) has brought about significant advances in both the device performance and operation stability. However, the performance and stability of current OSC technologies still require further progress to truly achieve the transition of existing solar technology from the laboratory to the marketplace. In this work, we introduce the first demonstration of the use of a well-known n-type polymer P(NDI2OD-T2) as the ‘macromolecular additive’ into the photoactive layer of OSCs, and report a remarkable enhancement in the device performance yielding record-high power conversion efficiency (PCE) in single-junction OSCs (PCE = 11.6%). Using the proposed method, we also show robust thermal stability in the additive-modified OSCs at elevated temperatures as well as long-term operation stability, compared to the non-additive control devices which degrade dramatically under the same experimental conditions. In addition, by using the ITO-free architecture on flexible PET substrates, we successfully demonstrated flexible solar cells processed with the macromolecular additive. The approach proposed in this work, which is simple and facile yet very effective, allows versatility with widespread applicability since the macromolecular additive is readily applicable to other bulk-heterojunction systems with great adaptability, thus facilitating the practical application of photovoltaic technologies.


Owing to their light weight, flexibility, and potential for high-throughput manufacturing, polymer:fullerene bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs)—comprising a conjugated polymer donor and a fullerene derivative acceptor as the photoactive layer—have attracted great attention as promising power generation technologies. Furthermore, additional key advantages of OSCs include less environmental impact during manufacturing processes and operations, and a short energy payback time (the operation time required to pay back the energy cost of module production compared with other existing photovoltaic technologies). In this field, rapid and significant progress has been realized in the past decade; at present, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of polymer:fullerene OSCs have reached the 10% milestone through a combination of active material design, device engineering, and morphology control. Despite the success of the polymer:fullerene OSCs in academic laboratories, severe PCE losses caused by the potential lack of morphological stability in the fullerene-intercalated polymer phase, commonly referred to as the metastable state, have hindered their deployment for practical applications.

An obvious solution to overcome this issue is to lock-in the kinetically trapped optimum morphology by the use of either thermal or photochemical cross-linking after the active layer has been formed. In order to freeze the polymer:fullerene BHJ morphology for an optimal nanoscale structure, not only have a variety of cross-linking functionalities been incorporated into the lateral side chains of the active materials, but also cross-linkable small molecules have been used as additives. Although the cross-linking concepts are extremely powerful in terms of morphological stabilization, most of the available approaches led to a drop in the initial PCEs, and have been predominantly studied in BHJ OSCs based on semi-crystalline polymers rather than amorphous-like polymers. However, many state-of-the-art donor polymers, such as poly[(4,8-bis-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-benzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[(3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2,6-diyl)] (PTB7) family polymers, are less crystalline/amorphous, and their BHJs which are embedded with fullerene derivatives seem to be more prone to over-coarsening upon heating since nanometer-sized fullerene domains are able to enlarge within the amorphous regions of the polymer matrix. Therefore, the OSC community is eagerly seeking a new simple and effective tool for further improving and stabilizing the OSCs based on this class of top-notch performance PTB7 polymers, in order to achieve the transition from the laboratory device operation into module testing for true commercialization and a widespread application of the OSCs in the actual commodity market.
To this end, we report here the first use of an n-type conjugated polymer poly[(N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl)-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)], P(NDI2OD-T2), as a ‘macromolecular additive’ to the OSCs based on the PTB7 family of polymers, which not only yields nearly record-high PCE single-junction OSCs (PCE = 11.6%), but also imparts thermal stability that is far more robust at the elevated temperatures and has a longer term stability compared to the non-additive control devices that degrade dramatically under the same experimental conditions. In addition, we present the satisfactory PCE of 5.66% in the optimal additive-processed OSCs on an ITO-free flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate.

The chemical structures and flat-band energy diagrams of the active materials employed in this study are shown in Fig. 1a and b. Inspired by the recent intriguing results of all-polymer BHJ OSCs based on NDI-containing polymers with a suitable energy level alignment and high electron mobilities, we selected the most well-known n-type polymer P(NDI2OD-T2) as the macromolecular additive in the PTB7:[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) BHJ devices. Considering the fact that the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of a polymer has a profound influence on film morphology and OSC performance, the P(NDI2OD-T2) polymer obtained after sequential Soxhlet extraction was further fractionated using a marginal solvent-soaking technique with tetrahydrofuran (THF) under temperature-controlled conditions, enabling us to isolate two different components (see the Experimental section for synthesis details). Together with that of the initial non-fractionated P(NDI2OD-T2), the Mw values of the fractionated samples were determined using high-temperature gel-permeation chromatography (GPC), referred to as I(initial)-P(NDI2OD-T2) (Mw = 196.6 kDa), H(high)-P(NDI2OD-T2) (Mw = 270.5 kDa), and L(low)-P(NDI2OD-T2) (Mw = 159.7 kDa), respectively. Note that in contrast to I-P(NDI2OD-T2) with multi-modal molecular weight distributions, unimodal molecular weight shapes are observed in both the fractionated samples, as shown in Fig. 1c.

Despite the energy levels being consistent for all the three samples (Fig. S1 and Table S1, ESI), the optical properties are somewhat dependent on their molecular weight profiles (Fig. 1d); the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) peaks are gradually intensified as a function of the increased Mw values. Furthermore, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GIWAXD) plots demonstrated that the P(NDI2OD-T2) film texture (crystal preferential orientation) is affected by the Mws (Fig. S2, ESI); the multi-diffraction (H00) patterns along the in-plane (qxy vector) and (010)-stacking peaks in the out-of plane (qz vector) became more defined as the Mws increase, though both are present for all the samples. This indicates that the higher Mws promote face-on packing with a higher degree of lamellar ordering. Therefore, despite the fact that all three P(NDI2OD-T2) samples have a sufficiently high degree of polymerization to be significantly beyond the polymer effective conjugation, we speculate that different quality levels of the macromolecular additive will play a critical role in determining the performance of the BHJ OSCs.
We first tested the performance of the control OSCs fabricated using the PTB7:PC71BM (1:1.7 wt%) blend following the previously reported optimized process (21.3 mg mL−1) in a mixed solvent of chlorobenzene (CB):1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (97:3 vol%). Detailed fabrication and testing conditions are provided in the Experimental section. Conventional-type BHJ OSCs were fabricated with the architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active materials/Al (Fig. S3, ESI).
Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics are shown in Fig. 2a and b and the key photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. In the optimized control device, a PCE of 8.02% (PCEavg = 7.42%) is obtained with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 16.5 ± 0.5 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.72 ± 0.02 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 61 ± 1%. Next, the optimized PTB7:PC71BM devices were processed with a specific concentration of each P(NDI2OD-T2) sample (0.4 wt% based on total weight of the active materials), as a test-bed system for identifying the above-proposed dependence of the performance on the quality of the macromolecular additive. The results indicate that modification of the standard active material component formulation with varying amounts of macromolecular additives leads to a significant change in the device performance compared to the control device. For example, the addition of L-(NDI2OD-T2) resulted in deterioration of the PCEs. However, the OSCs fabricated using either I-P(NDI2OD-T2) or H-P(NDI2OD-T2) show increased PCEs; in particular, a PCE as high as 9.77% is demonstrated by the active layer with the H-P(NDI2OD-T2) additive. For a more systematic study on the effect of the H-P(NDI2OD-T2) additive on device performance, we further evaluated the photovoltaic devices with different H-P(NDI2OD-T2) concentrations (0.8, 1.2, 1.6, and 2.0 wt%). Each concentration of the additive investigated in this study shows an improvement in device performance to a different extent (Fig. 2b and Table 1). In particular, the best device performance with a PCE of 10.1% (PCEavg = 9.97%), JSC = 19.2 ± 0.4 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.75 ± 0.01 V, FF = 65 ± 2% was obtained for 0.8 wt% H-P(NDI2OD-T2), which is by far the highest PCE reported to date for PTB7-based OSCs. The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) characteristics of the blends processed with various H-P(NDI2OD-T2) concentrations are provided (Fig. 2c), and clearly demonstrate the dependence of the EQE values on the additive concentrations is in good agreement with the data obtained from the J–V characteristics.

The charge transport property plays a critical role in the efficient functionality of the BHJ OSCs. Thus, the charge carrier mobilities were estimated from the hole-only and electron-only devices prepared from the blend films with H-P(NDI2OD-T2), by using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method as detailed in the Experimental section (Table 1 and Fig. S4, ESI). Both the hole and electron mobilities for all the macromolecular additive-processed films exhibit higher values than those of the control films without any additive. Notably, the film with 0.8 wt% P(NDI2OD-T2) leads to the most well-balanced charge transport, together with the highest level of mobility for both holes and electrons (μh = 1.75 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 2.43 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 0.8 wt% content and μh = 5.90 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 1.19 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the reference device, respectively). This is consistent with the observed improvement in JSC and FF values of the OSCs with 0.8 wt% P(NDI2OD-T2).
To better understand the origin of the beneficial macromolecular additive effects, the charge recombination properties of the devices containing H-P(NDI2OD-T2) were assessed using the light-intensity-dependent JSC and VOC characteristics. In this work, as shown in Fig. 2d, the fitted curve from the reference device without the additive is estimated to have a 1.24kT/q dependence on light intensity along with a 1.12–1.16kT/q dependence in the additive-treated devices. In previous studies,JSC was found to follow a power law dependence, JSC ∝ Iα, where I is the light intensity. The fitted slopes (α) are calculated to be 0.97, 0.99, 1.00, 1.00, 0.99, and 0.99 for the devices processed with 0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, and 2.0 wt% H-P(NDI2OD-T2), respectively (Fig. S5, ESI). These results demonstrate that the molecular recombination processes are less involved in the devices with the macromolecular additive relative to the non-additive devices.
The changes in surface morphologies of the PTB7:PC71BM blend film from varying concentrations of H-P(NDI2OD-T2) were also investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 3a. The non-additive film exhibits a uniform feature with a root-mean square (RMS) roughness of 5.3 ± 0.6 nm. The AFM images with low concentrations of H-P(NDI2OD-T2) (<0.8 wt%) show finer phase-separation nanoscale surface structures with lower RMS values of 4.5 ± 0.4 to 4.6 ± 0.6 nm, while the films with more than 1.2 wt% additives become rougher with RMS values in the range of 6.1 ± 0.7 to 8.8 ± 0.6 nm. Thus, a finer and smoother nanoscale structure in the films processed with low concentrations of H-P(NDI2OD-T2) is considered to be one of the major factors contributing to the improvement of the corresponding devices.
Next, a possible correlation between molecular packing structures in the blend films with H-P(NDI2OD-T2) and their OSC performances was investigated using GIWAXD measurements (Fig. 3b). In addition to a broad scattering at ∼1.32 Å−1 assigned to PC71BM, the diffraction patterns of the blend film without H-P(NDI2OD-T2) show a rather isotropic peak at qxy = ∼0.33 Å−1 and a partial arc of the (010) peak at qz ≈ 1.83 Å−1, which is in agreement with previous reports of face-on conformation in the PTB7 series of polymers. The diffraction patterns in the blend films incorporating various amounts of H-P(NDI2OD-T2) exhibit qualitatively similar trends to those observed from the initial films, indicating that there are minimal changes in the local PTB7 structure when processed with H-P(NDI2OD-T2). Thus, it is believed that other morphological parameters not discussed here, such as the relative degree of crystallinity of the polymers and the purity of the domains across the active layers, may contribute to the observed variations in PCEs. Further investigation of the intermixing of polymer and fullerene is underway.
In the following discussion, comparative studies of the blend systems (with or without the macromolecular additive) were performed to investigate the thermal stability of the completed device. Device configuration using 0.8 wt% H-P(NDI2OD-T2) leading to the best OSC performance was adopted as the model system for thermal stability analysis. The thermal test results were recorded at temperatures ranging from 30 to 120 °C for five 10-minute periods in the inert atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S6 (ESI), the control devices without H-P(NDI2OD-T2) are subject to a significant decrease in all key photovoltaic parameters with increasing temperatures, resulting in a sharp decrease (50%) in PCE compared with the initial value. In contrast, the JSC, VOC, and FF values of the devices containing 0.8 wt% H-P(NDI2OD-T2) remained >85%, >96%, and >86%, respectively, from their initial values, even after exposure to elevated temperatures up to 120 °C, retaining >80% of the PCE from the original value. In addition, the long-term stability of the OSCs was also examined at room temperature under inert conditions for 60 days (Fig. S7, ESI). The PCE of the non-additive control device dramatically drops from 7.40 to 4.17% after an extended time of 60 days, whereas the use of the H-P(NDI2OD-T2) additive stabilizes the devices maintaining the PCE value at a level of 7.82% over the same measurement period. At present, the origin of the enhanced stability of the BHJ OSCs remains uncertain. As shown in Fig. S8 and S9 of the ESI, the difference in the GIWAXD patterns with increasing temperatures in both non-additive and additive-processed devices was quite negligible. However, as the temperatures increased, the intensities of each diffraction peak in either the out-of-plane or in-plane directions decreased in the non-additive devices, while very little changes in the intensities were observed in the additive-processed devices. These results indicate that the addition of a macromolecular additive plays an important role in stabilizing the bulk-heterojunction morphology.
In the final part of this study, the use of the H-P(NDI2OD-T2) additive was further extended to another OSC system based on a 2D-conjugated polymer, poly(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-(3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2,6-diyl)) (PTB7-Th), a well-known PTB7 derivative (its structure is shown in Fig. 1a), to explore the versatility of the proposed macromolecular additive. The optimized PTB7-Th:PC71BM device configurations with 0.8 wt% H-P(NDI2OD-T2) achieves an unprecedented PCE of 11.6% (Fig. 5a and Table S2, ESI), which is, to the best of our knowledge, one of the highest efficiency values reported for single-junction OSCs. The distribution of PCEs from various device configurations investigated in this work is provided in Fig. S10 of the ESI. Furthermore, taking into account the exciting and fast-growing interest in the flexible OSC system, we also explored PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based devices constructed on the ITO-free flexible PET substrate (Fig. 5b, Fig. S11 and Table S3, ESI). The device processed with 0.8 wt% H-P(NDI2OD-T2) shows a moderate PCE of 5.66%, showing a significant increase compared to that of the non-additive reference devices (PCE = 3.18%).

In summary, the novelty of this work lies in it being the first demonstration that the use of an n-type macromolecular additive P(NDI2OD-T2) is an effective and simple strategy to simultaneously improve and stabilize the performance of OSCs based on PTB7 family polymers. The THF-soaking treatment enables the isolation of P(NDI2OD-T2) with different Mw values. The OSC performance shows a strong dependence on the Mws of the macromolecular additive. By applying the optimal amount of H-P(NDI2OD-T2) to the polymer:fullerene BHJ structure, a notable PCE of 11.6% is achieved, together with enhanced thermal stability. Such intriguing results are attributed not only to the collective hybridization of several factors (e.g., improved charge transport, reduced recombination probability, and finer active material blend structures), but also to the potential morphology stabilization upon adding H-P(NDI2OD-T2). In addition, we also demonstrate the high PCE of 5.66% in ITO-free flexible PET substrate-based OSCs employing H-P(NDI2OD-T2). Our approach allows versatility with widespread applicability, as the macromolecular additive is commercially available and readily applicable to any other BHJ OSCs, thereby advancing the practical application of photovoltaic technologies as the next-generation of renewable green energy sources.


Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Baytron AI 4083 and PH) was purchased from H. C. Starck (Germany). PTB7 and PTB7-Th were purchased from 1-Materials. All other commercial reagents, including solvents, used in this study were purchased from Aldrich Co., Alfa Aesar, and TCI Co. and used without further purification.


A mixture of Br2-NDI2OD (40.4 mg, 0.041 mmol), 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-biothiophene (20.17 mg, 0.041 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (0.75 mg, 0.82 μmol), and P(o-tolyl)3 (0.99 mg, 3.27 μmol) in anhydrous toluene (4 mL) was kept at 100 °C for 2 days under an argon atmosphere. The resulting material was precipitated in methanol (250 mL), filtered, and dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature. The crude copolymer was purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, hexane, and chloroform in order to remove low molecular weight fractions. The chloroform solution was concentrated under a reduced pressure prior to re-precipitation in methanol (100 mL). The purified polymers were collected by filtration, washed with methanol and dried in a vacuum oven, leading to a dark greenish blue solid (39 mg, 95% yield). The polymer purity was assessed using 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis (EA). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): ppm 8.82 (s, 2H), 7.34 (m, 4H), 4.12 (br, 2H), 2.04(br, 4H), 1.26–1.13 (br, 64H), 0.86–0.84 (br, 12H). Anal. calcd for C62H88N2O4S2: C, 75.26; H, 8.96; N, 2.83; S, 6.48. Found: C, 74.79; H, 9.06; N, 2.62; S, 6.43. These data agree well with previous reports.

A portion of the resulting I(initial)-P(NDI2OD-T2) polymer (20 mg) was further fractionated using a marginal solvent-soaking technique with a tetrahydrofuran solution (THF, 40 mL) at 50 °C for ∼1 h, yielding two fractions, H(high)-P(NDI2OD-T2) (the remaining THF-soaked component, 3 mg) and L(low)-P(NDI2OD-T2) (the THF-extracted component, 17 mg). Each isolated fraction was re-dissolved in chloroform and re-precipitated in methanol (100 mL). The three polymer samples were characterized using a high-temperature GPC at 120 °C using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as an eluent and polystyrene as a standard. GPC analysis: I-P(NDI2OD-T2) (Mw: 196.6 kDa, PDI: 1.7), H-P(NDI2OD-T2) (Mw: 270.5 kDa, PDI: 1.3), and L-P(NDI2OD-T2) (Mw: 159.7 kDa, PDI: 1.3).

The conventional device was adopted to assess the performance of PTB7:PC71BM- and PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based OSCs by varying the amount of the P(NDI2OD-T2) additive. The device architectures were glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive materials/Al and PET/graphene/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive materials/Al (for ITO-free anode), respectively. We fabricated OPV cells onto ITO and graphene as transparent electrodes fabricated under similar experimental conditions as employed in our previous work. First, ITO coated on glass and graphene coated on the PET substrate were cleaned using deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, then the substrates were dried in an oven. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on the substrates at 4000 rpm for 1 min and baked at 150 °C for 10 min for a glass/ITO based device and at 110 °C for 10 min for a PET/graphene based device. For the graphene electrode, solvent modified PEDOT:PSS (PEDOT:PSS mixed with IPA at a 3:1 v/v ratio) was applied to ensure the conformal coverage on the hydrophobic surface of graphene. The substrate was moved into the glove box under a nitrogen environment. PTB7, PTB7-Th, and PC71BM, were dissolved in chlorobenzene/1,8-diiodooctane solvent (97:3 vol%) at concentrations of 12, 12, and 40 mg mL−1, respectively. After preparing the blend solutions of PTB7:PC71BM (2:1 vol%) or PTB7-Th:PC71BM (2:1 vol%), the polymer blends were mixed with varying amounts of P(NDI2OD-T2) additives (0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, and 2.0 wt% based on the total weight of the active materials) and kept at 60 °C for 6 h, where the P(NDI2OD-T2) polymer was dissolved in chlorobenzene at a concentration of 12 mg mL−1. The blend solution was spin-coated at 900 rpm for 2 min onto PEDOT:PSS. Subsequently, the Al (100 nm) counter-electrode was thermally evaporated under a vacuum (∼10−6 Torr), which defines the device area of 13 mm2 and 4.2 mm2 for glass/ITO-based OSCs and PET/graphene-based OSCs, respectively. Device measurements were conducted in the glove box using a xenon arc lamp solar simulator. As for the device measurement, a home-made test jig was used to prevent any potential overestimation of the device performance (see Fig. S12, ESI, for details). J–V characteristics were measured under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) using a Keithley 2635A source measurement unit, and EQE measurement was performed under ambient conditions using a QE system (Model QEX7) from PV measurements Inc. (Boulder, Colorado). Light intensity dependent JSC and VOC were measured using neutral density filters. The vertical carrier mobility was evaluated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. Device structures were as follows: hole-only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive materials/Au) and electron-only (FTO/photoactive materials/Al, FTO: fluorine-doped tin oxide). Mobility values were extracted from the Mott–Gurney relation.


The optical properties of the composite films were analyzed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Agilent Carry 5000). An Agilent 5500 scanning probe microscope (SPM) running with a Nanoscope V controller was used to obtain AFM images of polymer thin films. AFM images were recorded in a high-resolution tapping mode under ambient conditions. The GIWAXD measurements were conducted using the PLS-II 9A U-SAXS beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory in Korea. X-rays coming from the in-vacuum undulator (IVU) were monochromated (wavelength λ = 1.10994 Å) using a double crystal monochromator and focused both horizontally and vertically (450 (H) × 60 (V) μm2 in FWHM@sample position) using K-B type mirrors. The GIWAXD sample stage was equipped with a 7-axis motorized stage for the fine alignment of the sample, and the incidence angle of the X-ray beam was set to 0.13° to 0.135° for neat polymer films and blended films. The GIWAXD patterns were recorded using a 2D CCD detector (Rayonix SX165) and X-ray irradiation time was 6–9 s, depending on the saturation level of the detector. Diffraction angles were calibrated using a sucrose standard (monoclinic, P21, a = 10.8631 Å, b = 8.7044 Å, c = 7.7624 Å, β = 102.938°) and the sample-to-detector distance was ∼231 mm.
