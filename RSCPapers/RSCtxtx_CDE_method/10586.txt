Passivating the grain boundary (GB) defects of polycrystalline perovskite films via fused-ring non-fullerene Lewis base deactivators is an effective approach to fabricate high-efficiency and high-stability perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We first introduced the sulfonyl group (OSO) to substitute the carbonyl group (CO) group of fused-ring non-fullerene Lewis base deactivators. The novel acceptor material (IDIS-Th) possessing the sulfonyl group exhibited stronger interactions with the under-coordinated Pb ions or Pb clusters in a perovskite film compared with the contrast (IDIC-Th) to lower the trap density. Consequently, the IDIS-Th-containing PSC device achieved a higher-efficiency of over 20%, with a heightened VOC of 1.116 V, JSC of 22.67 mA cm−2 and FF of 79.1%. Moreover, the deactivators filling GBs could inhibit ion migration and resist moisture ingress, resulting in better environmental and thermal stabilities of PSC devices. Our results provide an alternative approach for designing and synthesizing better passivators to improve the performance of PSCs.

Hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have obtained intense interest as the next-generation photovoltaic devices due to their low-cost, long carrier diffusion lengths, and a high optical absorption coefficient. Owing to the stupendous efforts of multiple research groups, the recorded power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction PSCs has rapidly increased from 3.8% to a certified 24.2% in the past decade. In general, the low-temperature solution-prepared perovskite films possess a large number of defects at grain boundaries (GBs) and the film surface. The main sources of trap states are under-coordinated Pb ions or Pb–I antisite defects, which increase the charge carrier recombination and interface resistance, and limit the improvement in the device performance. Recent research indicates that ion migration is faster through GBs, which could be correlated to the unique current hysteresis of PSCs. Also, GBs act as channels for moisture penetration, thus decomposing perovskite films, which are responsible for poor stability. Consequently, efficiently passivating the GB defects of polycrystalline perovskite films plays a crucial role in achieving high-efficiency and stable PSCs.

Fused-ring non-fullerene acceptor materials are a kind of π-conjugated Lewis base with n-type semiconductor properties, such as ITIC, IDIC, and IT-4F, which have proven their merits in passivating the trap states at GBs or surfaces of perovskite films. In general, non-fullerene acceptor materials possess Lewis base functional groups, such as carbonyl (CO) and cyano (CN), which can form complexes with under-coordinated Pb ions or Pb clusters in perovskite films. In addition, the n-type acceptor materials with a high charge mobility can bridge adjacent perovskite grains, which is beneficial to the charge separation at the MAPbI3–molecule junction and assists the electrons in transporting to the cathode electrodes. It is known that the sulfoxide group (SO) can readily coordinate with Pb2+; thus, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has been chosen to generate an adduct with Pb2+ to slow down the crystal growth for manufacturing high-quality perovskite films. The sulfonyl group (OSO) can chelate with Pb2+ to generate a stronger interaction compared with the carbonyl (CO) group. Accordingly, we envisioned whether the sulfonyl group (OSO) can supersede the carbonyl (CO) group of a non-fullerene Lewis base to enhance the ability of passivating Lewis traps while maintaining the high mobility of the material.
In this study, we designed and synthesized two novel fused-ring non-fullerene acceptor materials, namely, IDIS-Th and IDIC-Th, whose chemical structures are similar, as shown in Fig. 1a. IDIC-Th was found to possess the Lewis base carbonyl (CO) functional group, while IDIS-Th possessed the sulfonyl group (OSO). Subsequently, we in situ introduced the two molecules as passivants into a MAPbI3 film utilizing the anti-solvent deposition strategy. Just as we assumed, IDIS-Th could passivate the Lewis acid traps (under-coordinated Pb ions or Pb clusters) at the GBs of the MAPbI3 film more effectively as compared with IDIC-Th. Consequently, the IDIS-Th-passivated p–i–n perovskite device displayed a superior PCE of 20.01%, compared to 18.78% and 17.78% for IDIC-Th-passivated and the control devices, respectively. The environmental and thermal stabilities of molecule-passivated PSC devices without encapsulation also displayed an obvious improvement in contrast to the control devices. Our results suggest that introducing the sulfonyl group (OSO) into non-fullerene Lewis bases offers an effective alternative to enhance the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSC devices.


IDIC-Th and IDIS-Th were synthesized through the Knoevenagel condensation between ID-CHO and 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone or BTOD-CN, and the detailed synthetic procedure is shown in Scheme S1. The intermediate and final products were identified by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectra. The two small-molecule materials exhibited excellent solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform (CF) and chlorobenzene (CB). The normalized absorption spectra of IDIC-Th and IDIS-Th in the CB solution (10−6 M) are exhibited in Fig. 1b, and the corresponding normalized film absorption spectra are illustrated in Fig. S1a.IDIC-Th displays strong absorption from 500 to 770 nm with the maximum absorption peak at 699 nm and the corresponding range for IDIS-Th is from 500 to 900 nm with the maximum absorption peak at 744 nm. The maximum absorption peak of IDIS-Th exhibits an obvious red-shift of 85 nm compared with that of IDIC-Th, which indicates that the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the electron-rich moiety to the electron-withdrawing groups is enhanced in IDIS-Th. This fact suggests that the sulfonyl group (OSO) is a stronger electron-withdrawing group compared with the carbonyl (CO) group, which represents that the sulfonyl group would display stronger interactions with Pb ions than carbonyl (CO). Moreover, the two sulfur–oxygen double bonds can chelate Pb2+, generating stronger interactions. The energy levels of IDIC-Th and IDIS-Th are estimated by the cyclic voltammetric (CV) tests (Fig. S1b). As shown in Fig. 1c, replacing carbonyl with the sulfonyl group can effectively downshift the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of IDIS-Th, which indicates that the sulfonyl group is a stronger electron-withdrawing group. The result is consistent with the absorption data. The stronger interactions between IDIS-Th and under-coordinated Pb ions in perovskite films mean the greater possibility to passivate defects and form molecule–perovskite junctions, which is beneficial to suppress the charge recombination and promote charge separation and transport. In addition, the LUMO levels of IDIC-Th and IDIS-Th are close to the conduction band minimum (CBM) of MAPbI3 (−3.90 eV), and they could make the trap state much shallower, resulting in a more efficient electron transport between neighboring perovskite grains through the IDIC-Th or IDIS-Th bridges.

In order to verify interactions between the under-coordinated Pb ions and IDIC-Th or IDIS-Th, we recorded the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the IDIC-Th or IDIS-Th solution before and after the addition of PbI2. Commonly, metallic ions and organic ligands form coordination complexes, resulting in a change in the absorption intensities and peaks of organic ligands in solution. The absorption peaks of IDIC-Th and IDIS-Th in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution at the same molar concentration are 658 nm and 674 nm, respectively. As depicted in Fig. 2a and b, after the addition of an equal trace amount of PbI2, whose absorption is negligible from 450 nm to 900 nm, as shown in Fig. S2, the absorption peak of the IDIC-Th solution red-shifted to 666 nm with the absorption intensity increasing by 36%; at the same time, the corresponding peak of the IDIS-Th solution red-shifted to 680 nm with the absorption intensity raising by 49%. The results indicated that IDIC-Th and IDIS-Th could form interaction with Pb2+.
To further investigate the interactions between the non-fullerene Lewis bases and under-coordinated Pb ions in perovskite films, we acquired the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of pure MAPbI3, pure IDIC-Th or IDIS-Th and an MAPbI3–molecule as shown in Fig. 2c and d. For the pure IDIC-Th powder, the symmetric stretching vibrations of the CO bond (ν(CO)) is located at 1702 cm−1. When IDIC-Th is incorporated into the MAPbI3 film, ν(CO) slightly red-shifts from 2 cm−1 to 1700 cm−1. The red-shift of ν(CO) is indicative of the weak CO bond as a consequence of the coordination between IDIC-Th and the under-coordinated Pb ions or Pb clusters in the perovskite films. For the pure IDIS-Th powder, the symmetric stretching vibrations and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the SO bond (νs(SO) and νas(SO)) appear at 1161 and 1316 cm−1, respectively. To further confirm the wavenumbers of νs(SO) and νas(SO), the FTIR spectrum of the pure intermediate containing the sulfonyl group (OSO) is depicted in Fig. S3. After being introduced into the MAPbI3 film, the νs(SO) and νas(SO) of IDIS-Th shift to 1147 and 1311 cm−1, respectively. Compared with ν(CO) of IDIC-Th in the perovskite, the νs(SO) and νas(SO) of IDIS-Th shift more to a lower wavelength, which suggests stronger interactions or more coordination between IDIS-Th and the under-coordinated Pb ions or Pb clusters in the perovskite films. Such interactions help in efficiently lowering the Lewis acid trap states to further heighten the performance of PSC devices.
In order to investigate the influence of the molecules on the morphology of MAPbI3 films, the plan-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the different treatment MAPbI3 films are presented in Fig. S4a–c. The microstructure of the MAPbI3 films with different additives was similar to that of the control device, which indicates that the influence of the additive molecules on the morphology of MAPbI3 films is negligible. The energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. S5) has confirmed the existence of IDIS-Th in the MAPbI3 bulk film, and the result is consistent with similar studies. Therefore, the molecules possess the potential ability to modify the GBs of the MAPbI3 films. Moreover, the UV-vis spectra of the perovskite films with and without non-fullerene acceptors show that non-fullerene acceptors did not affect the absorption of the perovskite films (Fig. S6).
To confirm the defect passivation effect of IDIC-Th and IDIS-Th, the trap densities (ntrap) in MAPbI3 bulk films with different treatments were calculated using the following equation.
where
ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, ε is the relative dielectric constant of MAPbI3, VTFL is the onset voltage of the trap-filled limit region (the intersection of the green line and the orange line shown in Fig. 3a), which is 0.19, 0.40 and 0.68 V for IDIS-Th-treated, IDIC-Th-treated and pristine MAPbI3 films, respectively. e is the elemental charge, and L is the thickness of the MAPbI3 films. According to the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements, we have fabricated the electron-only devices by different treatments with the structure of ITO/ZnO/CPTA/MAPbI3/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM)/Bphen/Ag and tested their dark current–voltage (J–V) characteristics. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, the trap density is 1.50 × 1016 cm−3 for an unpassivated device, while the trap densities for the IDIC-Th- and IDIS-Th-passivated devices significantly decrease to 8.85 × 1015 cm−3 and 4.20 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. The trap state density of the IDIS-Th-passivated device is lower than that of IDIC-Th-passivated device, indicating that IDIS-Th exhibits stronger passivation capability. The reduction in the trap density caused by defect passivation at GBs can effectively suppress the charge recombination and improve open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) of PSCs.

To investigate the charge recombination before and after the two molecules remediate defects at GBs and surface in the perovskite solar cells, ideality factor (n), which is the dependence of the open voltage (VOC) with light intensity (ρ) of the PSCs, was evaluated by the following equation.
where
e is the elemental charge, k is Boltzmann constant, T is absolute temperature and ρ is light intensity. In Fig. 3b, the n of pristine PSC is 1.66, and after passivation, the n values decrease to 1.53 and 1.39 for IDIC-Th and IDIS-Th, respectively. A lower value of the ideality factor (n) indicates a smaller interface charge recombination in the MAPbI3 film. The introduction of IDIC-Th and IDIS-Th can significantly suppress charge recombination, which means better device performance is worth expecting.

The organic semiconductor materials accumulate at the GBs of MAPbI3 and bridge adjacent perovskite grains to promote the charge separation at the MAPbI3–molecule junction and assist electron transport to the cathode electrode, which results in photoluminescence quenching. In order to understand the fluorescence quenching information in different treatment perovskite films, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra for different treatment perovskite films on glass substrates are measured, as shown in Fig. 3c. After introducing IDIC-Th and IDIS-Th, the PL of passivated-MAPbI3 films is largely quenched compared with that of pristine film, which indicates that the presence of electron-accepting IDIC-Th and IDIS-Th can guarantee faster electron-transfer in complete devices. In order to further confirm the fast electron-transfer, as depicted in Fig. 3d, the time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay measurements were performed to obtain information on charge extraction at the perovskite/PC61BM interface. The stretched exponential decay lifetimes are received via fitting the data by a biexponential decay equation. The summary of fitting parameters for TRPL on the different treatment films are shown in Table S1. The τave value of unpassivated MAPbI3 films is 17.12 ns, while the corresponding τave values of IDIC-Th- and IDIS-Th-passivated MAPbI3 films decrease to 11.82 and 10.47 ns, respectively. The much lower PL intensity and shorter lifetime of passivated MAPbI3 films indicate more efficient charge separation and electron extraction toward the anode (Table 1).

To verify the influence of the two molecules on photovoltaic performance, IDIC-Th and IDIS-Th are introduced into perovskite films as depicted in Fig. 4b with the structure consisting of ITO/P3CT–N/MAPbI3–molecule/PC61BM/Bphen/Ag (Fig. 4a). First, we optimized the concentration of IDIC-Th (CIDIC-Th) and IDIS-Th (CIDIS-Th), and the data is summarized in Tables S2 and S3 in ESI.Fig. 4c depicts the J–V characteristic curves of the devices fabricated with optimal CIDIS-Th (0.05 mg mL−1) and CIDIC-Th (0.10 mg mL−1). For the PSC device without additive (control device), the PCE is 17.78%, with a VOC of 1.072 V, a JSC of 21.98 mA cm−2 and an FF of 75.40%. The PSC device fabricated with IDIC-Th passivation displays an improvement in the PCE to 18.78%, with a VOC of 1.086 V, a JSC of 22.43 mA cm−2 and an FF of 77.1%. A maximal PCE is obtained in the PSC device with IDIS-Th passivation, reaching up to 20.01% with a VOC of 1.116 V, a JSC of 22.67 mA cm−2 and an FF of 79.1%. The VOC, JSC and FF values of passivated devices enhanced significantly compared with those of control device. The photovoltaic data is consistent with our previous analysis. Moreover, the introduction of IDIC-Th and IDIS-Th can also help in reducing the hysteresis as depicted in Fig. S7, owing to the suppressed MA+ migration at GBs. The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are depicted in Fig. 4d, and the corresponding integrated current densities for the control device, IDIC-Th- and IDIS-Th-passivated devices from the EQE spectra are 21.04, 21.42, and 21.56 mA cm−2, respectively. They are highly consistent with the JSC values received from the J–V curves. A histogram of 20 cells examined from three batches displays an exceptional reproducibility with an average PCE of 19.29% for the IDIS-Th-passivated devices in Fig. 4e. Moreover, the IDIC-Th-passivated devices illustrate the same trend. The corresponding statistical VOC, JSC and FF values are shown in Fig. S8.
The PCE close to the maximum power point on the J–V curve at a fixed voltage is examined over time, and the result is depicted in Fig. S9. After 250 seconds of illumination under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2), the PCE of the control device displays a slight reduction in the first 25 s, and then remained unchanged without significant fluctuation. The phenomenon is attributed to the ion redistribution under an external electric field or the moisture invasion. However, with the introduction of IDIC-Th and IDIS-Th as passivants, the decay time became shorter and shorter. Particularly, the most stable state PCE of 19.68% is obtained based on the IDIS-Th-passivated device, which indicates that IDIS-Th can effectively passivate the defects at GBs to inhibit ion migration and moisture diffusion, thus leading to a better device stability of PSCs.
It is known that IDIC-Th and IDIS-Th possess the hydrophobic nature, which will help to block moisture entering the MAPbI3 film and diffusion along the GBs when they exist at the GBs and surface of the MAPbI3 film. Fig. 5a depicts the contact-angle test between perovskite films and water. After being passivated by IDIC-Th and IDIS-Th, the hydrophilicity of the MAPbI3 films changed. The contact-angle of pristine film is 46°, and for passivated films they significantly increase to 62° and 67°, respectively, which indicates that the molecules at the GBs and surface can inhibit the raid of moisture to MAPbI3 films. The environmental stability with differently treated PSC devices were further determined. These devices without encapsulation are deposed in an ambient environment with 30% relative humidity. The PCE value change trends of different treatment devices are presented in Fig. 5b. As expected, the environmental stability of the passivated devices illustrates significant improvement compared with that of the control device. The PCE value of the control device reduced dramatically to 50% of its initial value over 300 h; however, the PCEs of the passivated devices always remained over 80% of their initial values with IDIS-Th exhibiting the best performance. The result is consistent with our above analysis.
The thermal stability of different treatment devices without encapsulation were also measured at 85 °C in N2 atmosphere. The performance of devices at different periods has been presented in Fig. 5c. The efficiency of the control device decays more than half at 200 h, while the efficiencies of the passivated devices remain over 78% and 85% of their initial efficiencies for IDIC-Th and IDIS-Th, respectively. The performance of the passivated devices is far better than that of control device. The excellent performance of resisting heat stress is associated with the MAPbI3–molecule interactions, C desorption from the crystal.

We first introduced the sulfonyl group replacing the carbonyl group of a fused-ring non-fullerene Lewis base to design a novel fused-ring non-fullerene acceptor material (IDIS-Th). It could passivate the defects at the GBs of the MAPbI3 film to reduce charge recombination and interface resistance, and bridge adjacent perovskite grains to promote the charge separation and transport at the MAPbI3–molecule junction, which led to the improvement in the VOC, JSC and FF values of the passivated devices. Moreover, an adduct between the deactivator and under-coordinated Pb ions could effectively inhibit ion migration and moisture diffusion to enhance the stability of PSC devices. This promising approach provides a new design idea for perovskite deactivator to achieve high-efficiency, high-stability, and low-cost PSCs.
