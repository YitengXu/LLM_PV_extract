Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs), as a promising alternative to conventional silicon-based solar cells, have achieved rapid development in recent years. In the BHJ concept, the active layer of the PSC normally consists of a blended film of a conjugated polymer donor and an electron acceptor. To be a conjugated polymer with OPV function, the polymer should have sufficient solubility, a broad absorption spectrum, a high absorption coefficient, and well-matched energy levels with the electron acceptor. With this aim, numerous conjugated polymers have been developed to date. Among them, quinoxaline-based polymers have been shown to have a promising future, reaching a very outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 11%, which shows that they have significant potential in reaching the efficiency limit of commercial applications of polymer solar cells. In this review, we summarize the quinoxaline-based conjugated polymers for efficient polymer solar cells by classifying them in terms of different donors, alkyl and/or aromatic chains, and functional groups, and we also give an overview of their photovoltaic device performances to provide a better understanding of and guidelines for the structure–performance relationship in such quinoxaline-based polymers. We believe that further developments of quinoxaline-based conjugated polymers achieved through the synergy of molecular engineering strategies will increase the photovoltaic performance to levels closer to those required for commercial applications in the near future.

In the past few decades, organic semiconductors have attracted a great deal of attention in organic/polymeric light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors, photodetectors, chemo/biosensors and organic solar cells, with the significant advantages of low cost, light weight and flexibility, etc. Among them, organic solar cells including small molecule- and polymer-based solar cells have been studied most widely in both the academic and industrial communities because of their great potential in replacing the traditional silicon-based solar cells as a low-cost solar energy conversion device. The first organic solar cell was demonstrated by Tang et al. in 1986, in which a two-layer photovoltaic cell was fabricated from copper phthalocyanine and a perylene tetracarboxylic derivative with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1%. Following around ten years of silence, the Heeger and Friend group in 1995 introduced the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) concept for polymer solar cells by using blended systems of conjugated polymer (donor):fullerene (electron acceptor) and polymer (donor):polymer (electron acceptor), in which the interfaces between the donor and acceptor provide pathways for charge generation, separation and transportation. In such so-called BHJ-based polymer solar cells, the active layer normally consists of a narrow band-gap conjugated polymer as the donor and fullerene/non-fullerene derivatives as an electron acceptor. Since then, with the rapid development in this field, current state-of-the-art PCEs of up to 12% have been reached, which is mainly due to the rapid development of novel conjugated polymers with judicious device optimization.

Currently, the most important and successful polymer donor is based on the alternating donor–acceptor (D–A) type. The optical and electronic properties of D–A-type conjugated polymers can be easily tuned via controlling the intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and the acceptor. The sp2–sp2 bond connection in the polymer backbone between the donor and acceptor provides a pathway for resonance conversion in the form of D–A and D+–A−, leading to a narrowed band-gap and tuned energy levels of the D–A conjugated polymers. With this strategy and efforts from researchers, thousands of D–A polymers for polymer solar cells have been developed with the aim of pursing higher power conversion efficiencies. It is known that the PCE is determined by the three parameters of open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), with the equation PCE = (Voc × Jsc × FF)/Pin, where Pin is the input solar power. It is also known that these three parameters are determined in a complex manner by factors such as energy levels, film morphology and charge carrier transport properties, etc. Therefore, besides device optimization, the D–A polymer design should be carefully considered so as to improve these three parameters simultaneously. Design strategies for novel D–A polymers, such as main chain engineering, side chain engineering, and substitute optimization, have been applied in developing and optimizing either the donor (D) or acceptor (A). But the relationship between the polymer structure and the photovoltaic performance is still poorly understood, since a subtle change in the polymer structure can lead to tremendous improvement or deterioration in the photovoltaic performance.
Quinoxaline (or benzo[a]pyrazine, 1,4-diazanaphthalene, Scheme 1) and its derivatives, as an important class of heterocyclic molecules, have been widely used in industry to inhibit metal corrosion, in pharmacology against bacteria, malaria and cancer, etc., and also as emissive materials in organic light-emitting diodes. The two N atoms at the 1,4 positions make the quinoxaline unit an electron-deficient molecule. In the early years, quinoxaline-based organic semiconductors were mainly applied in electroluminescent devices. The first quinoxaline-based polymer semiconductor for polymer solar cells was reported by Inganäs et al. in 2004, but they achieved a PCE of only 0.3%. The next breakthrough for quinoxaline-based photovoltaic polymers came from the Inganäs group, in which a fluorene and quinoxaline alternating polymer was developed and the PCE achieved was found to be 3.7% at that time. Since then, quinoxaline as a promising building block has been widely applied for high performance photovoltaic cells. With efforts from both molecular design and device engineering, the quinoxaline-based polymers have achieved remarkable PCEs of as high as 11.34%, and will keep pace with the field of polymer solar cells. The impressive growth of quinoxaline-based photovoltaic polymers in the past ten years has led to the emergence of hundreds of literature reports. However, currently there is no review article focusing on the recent research progress regarding quinoxaline-based photovoltaic polymers; therefore, a comprehensive review that summarizes the critical achievements in the field of quinoxaline-based photovoltaic polymers to better understand the relationship between the polymer structure design and photovoltaic performance is highly needed.
In this review, we aim to summarize the quinoxaline-based polymers reported in recent years by focusing on the chemical structures and photovoltaic properties. The quinoxaline-based D–A conjugated polymers are classified based on the donor unit that is incorporated with the quinoxaline moiety.

The first synthesis of quinoxaline can be traced back to a century ago, when Hinsberg and Körner reported the first quinoxaline in 1884 from the condensation reaction of 1,2-diaminebenzene with glyoxal. Since then, the synthesis of quinoxaline and its derivatives has been investigated intensively because of their diverse applications, and even now, chemists are still endeavoring to invent new and improved routes for the synthesis of quinoxaline derivatives. Compared with the biological application of quinoxalines in the early years, quinoxalines were first introduced into the field of organic semiconductors as emissive chromophores by Anzenbacher. Considering the requirements of organic semiconductor molecules, most quinoxalines are formed by conjugated systems with other semiconductor molecules at the 2,3- and/or 5,8-positions. Scheme 1 shows the general synthetic route for the quinoxalines used as organic semiconductors. They are normally prepared from condensation reactions between aromatic o-diamine and α-dicarbonyl compounds, where the aromatic group in o-diamine could be benzene or another aromatic system, and R could be an alkyl chain or an aromatic unit. These functionalities provide the various combinations of quinoxaline derivatives for organic semiconductors.

By taking advantage of their strong electron-deficient character, quinoxalines have been widely used as the electron-deficient acceptor in D–A-type polymers for photovoltaic cells. The general synthetic route toward this kind of D–A polymer involves Pd-catalyzed Suzuki and Stille polymerization as shown in Scheme 1, which utilizes the chain growth reaction between a diboronic (or distannyl) donor and the dihalogen quinoxaline units.

The development of novel conjugated polymers has always been one of the important driving forces that has pushed the PCE of the BHJ cells to more than 12%. As mentioned above, the donor and acceptor units need to be selected carefully as so to reach the best optimization of the energy levels, band-gaps and charge carrier mobilities, etc. Over the past few years, numerous quinoxaline-based conjugated polymers have been developed to this end. Various combinations of donors and quinoxaline acceptors in the D–A-type conjugated polymers have led to significant changes in the photovoltaic performance. In this review, we will summarize the reported quinoxaline-based conjugated polymers for photovoltaic applications based on fluorene, carbazole, indacenodithiophene, benzodithiophene, thiophene and other comonomer units, and explore the molecule design strategies and understanding of the relationship between the chemical structure and the photovoltaic performance.


Fluorene and carbazole units are widely used in polymer light-emitting materials as a very favorable donor unit because of their excellent optical and electronic properties. In 2006, Shahid and co-workers report two alternating copolymers based on fluorene and quinoxaline units. The absorption edges of these polymers were ∼500 nm, corresponding to an optical band-gap of 2.37–2.56 eV. When they were applied in BHJ cells, a very poor PCE of ∼0.005% was achieved, which was mainly ascribed to the low charge-carrier mobility and exciton dissociation efficiency.

To solve this problem, Inganäs et al. synthesized the polymer P1 (Fig. 1), which possessed a thiophene unit as the π-bridge between fluorene and quinoxaline units. It was found that P1 had an absorption onset at about 640 nm, giving a band-gap of ∼1.94 eV, and the absorption band at ∼542 nm was attributed to the charge transfer (CT) transition between the fluorene and quinoxaline units. The LUMO and HOMO values of P1 were estimated to be −3.6 eV and −6.3 eV, respectively, based on the SWV method. The BHJ cells fabricated with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P1:PCBM/LiF/Al exhibited a promising PCE of 3.7% with a Voc of ∼1 V, a Jsc of ∼6.0 mA cm−2 and a FF of 63%. The improved photovoltaic performance was mainly due to the balanced electron and hole transport properties both in the pure polymer phase and in polymer/PC61BM bulk heterojunction films, which makes the quinoxaline-based conjugated polymers quite attractive for applications in photovoltaic cells.
In 2009, Kitazawa et al. synthesized a quinoxaline-based conjugated donor polymer P2 by eliminating the octyloxyl group of the quinoxaline unit from P1 (Fig. 1). P2 shows very similar optical and electrochemical properties to P1, indicating that these properties are almost independent of the substituent groups of P1 and P2. They then fabricated a BHJ active layer with P2/PC71BM instead of PC61BM with P1, in which PC71BM has increased optical absorption in the visible region compared to PC61BM, and will lead to improved light-harvesting in the BHJ active layer. Combined with a mixed solvent system, the P2-based device with an active area of 25 mm2 gave a Jsc of 9.72 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.99 V and a FF of 57.4%, resulting in a very promising PCE of 5.5%, which was one of the highest performances at that time. The high PCE was attributed to the better nanometer-scale phase separation in the active layer, besides the contribution from PC71BM. They further investigated the effect of substitution of the quinoxaline unit on the photovoltaic performance by synthesizing polymers P3 and P4 (Fig. 1), in which P3 has an electron-donating methoxyl (OCH3) group on the para position of the phenyl substituent and P4 possesses an electron-withdrawing fluorine (F) atom. Due to the substitution effect, the absorption onsets of P3 and P4 were shifted to 628 nm and 649 nm, respectively, compared to 636 nm in P2. As a result, the optical band-gaps and energy levels of P3 and P4 also showed slight changes compared with that of P2. Under the same conditions, the P3- and P4-based photovoltaic devices showed PCEs of 4.20% and 2.70%, with a similar Voc, and a lower Jsc and FF, respectively. The lower photovoltaic performances were mainly due to the lower hole mobilities and micrometer-scale phase separation (Table 1).

With the aim of improving the intermolecular packing of the polymer chains and increasing the charge carrier mobilities, Cao and Huang et al. introduced a thiophene pendant group onto the quinoxaline unit instead of the phenyl ring to synthesize polymer P5, and they further coplanarized the two thiophene rings to make P6 with an enlarged fused planar aromatic ring system (Fig. 1). By replacing phenyl with thiophene, the absorption onset of P5 was observed to be at 667 nm with an optical band-gap of 1.86 eV, showing a red-shifted absorption and a smaller band-gap compared to P1 and P2. In the case of P6, as expected, the absorption edge gave a large red-shift to 738 nm, corresponding to a smaller optical band-gap of 1.68 eV. The LUMO and HOMO energy levels of P5 and P6 were located at −3.40 eV and −5.26 eV, and −3.53 eV and −5.21 eV, respectively. It is well known that large planar aromatic rings normally have better charge carrier mobility. They measured the hole mobilities of P5 and P6 in hole-only devices, and found that P6 has an improved hole mobility of 5.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared to 1.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P5. However, the BHJ cell based on P6 with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P6:PC71BM/Ba/Al showed a PCE of only 2.1%, which is lower than the PCE of 4.4% for the P5-based BHJ cell under the same conditions. The lower photovoltaic performance was thought to be due to the poor solubility of P6, which will affect the morphology and charge separation efficiency.
As mentioned above, the PCE is mainly governed by Voc, Jsc and FF, and one of the typical methods to improve the PCE is to try and obtain a deeper red absorption to harvest more sunlight, so as to achieve a higher Jsc. With this method, however, the higher Jsc is normally accompanied by a decreased band-gap, and an increased HOMO, which will unfortunately induce a decrease in the Voc. To solve this dilemma, in 2011, Moon et al. replaced the thiophene π-bridge with selenophene to make polymers P7 and P8. Optical measurements show that P7 and P8 have absorption onsets at 661 nm and 675 nm, respectively, corresponding to band-gaps of 1.88 eV and 1.84 eV. The lower HOMO energy levels of P7 and P8 were found to be −5.43 eV and 5.38 eV, respectively, using Fc/Fc+ as the standard. The best PCEs for P7 and P8 were 2.9–3.3%, with a high Voc of ∼0.88 V, a Jsc of 7.9 mA cm−2 and a FF of ∼48%.
Similar to P1–P7 using fluorene as the donor unit, researchers have also investigated quinoxaline-based polymers with carbazole units as the donors in the D–A-type polymers. Carbazole is expected to have a better hole mobility and has been successfully applied in highly efficient polymer solar cells. For example, Zhou et al., Moon et al. and Wang et al. have systemically investigated the effect of different donors or side chains on the quinoxaline-based polymers P9–P11. These polymers possessed an absorption onset of ∼630–640 nm with an optical band-gap of 1.90–2.00 eV, and these values are very similar to those of the polymers with fluorene and quinoxaline units. Due to the strong electron donating property of carbazole, P9–P11 had a higher HOMO energy level of ∼5.30 eV, and as a result a lower Voc will be expected in BHJ cells. The photovoltaic measurements of P9–P11 blended with PCBM showed that the Voc was ∼0.80–0.92 V. The best PCE of 4% was observed from the P11/PC71BM device, which has a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 9.96 mA cm−2 and a FF of 49%.
As discussed above, coplanarizing the diphenyl or dithienyl substituents could improve the charge carrier mobility and decrease the band-gap for enhanced light harvesting. To this end, Huang et al. and Li et al. also synthesized the fused quinoxaline-based polymers P12–P15 with carbazole as the donor. The design strategy of P12 and P13 is the same as that of P5 and P6 (Fig. 1). As expected, P13 has a lower band-gap of 1.66 eV, corresponding to an absorption onset of 747 nm, whereas the band-gap of P12 was 1.90 eV. Slightly higher HOMO energy levels of −5.23 eV and −5.17 eV were observed for P12 and P13, respectively. When the photovoltaic properties were investigated under the same conditions, P12 showed a PCE of 3.5% with a Voc of 0.88 V, whereas P13 had a PCE of 3.0%, mainly because of its lower Voc of 0.75 V. In the case of P14 and P15, similar phenomena and results were reported compared with P12 and P13. The best PCEs for P14 and P15 were found to be 3.27% and 3.29% with Voc values of 0.86 V and 0.83 V, and Jsc values of 8.52 mA cm−2 and 7.96 mA cm−2, respectively.

Indacenodithiophene (IDT) has been considered as one of the best donor units in D–A conjugated polymers, and its polymers have exhibited very promising photovoltaic performance, which is mainly due to the large coplanarity of IDT and the reduced energetic disorder of the polymer. In 2011, Jen and Zhang et al. first reported two IDT-based polymers with 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline and phenanthrenequinoxaline (P16 and P17, Fig. 2). They found that the large coplanarity of the phenanthrenequinoxaline unit in P17 facilitated both intermolecular packing and charge transport behaviors compared to P16. Optical measurements showed that the absorption of P17 as a thin film was almost identical to that in solution, indicating promoted stronger chain stacking even in solution, whereas P16 showed a blue-shifted absorption in the film state compared to that in solution, which is not normal in most cases and was assigned to the large steric hindrance between the pendent phenyl rings on IDT and 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline (Fig. 3a). As expected, P17 possessed a lower band-gap of 1.67 eV, while the band-gap for P16 was 1.81 eV. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P16 and P17 were located at −5.33 eV and −3.52 eV, and −5.28 eV and −3.61 eV, respectively. The charge carrier mobilities of P16 and P17 were also measured, and it was found that P17 had a hole mobility of as high as 2.4 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas P16 had a hole mobility of 4.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The photovoltaic properties of P16 and P17 were investigated with the conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P16 or P17:PC71BM/Ca/Al without a solvent additive. The results showed that P17 had a better PCE of 6.24% with a Voc of 0.87 V, a Jsc of 11.2 mA cm−2 and a FF of 64%, while P16 exhibited a PCE of 5.69% with a similar Voc, and a lower Jsc and FF (Fig. 3b).

Jen and Ginger et al. then investigated the effect of selenium on the photovoltaic performance by replacing the sulfur atom of the IDT unit with a selenium atom to make P18 and P19. The bulk heterojunction polymer/fullerene devices of P18 and P19 exhibited a much lower performance than that from P16 and P17, and the PCEs of P18 and P19 were 4.89% and 3.93% under the same device conditions, respectively. The lower performances were mainly attributed to the lower Jsc, FF and Voc. It is well known that the Voc in a bulk heterojunction polymer/fullerene device is determined by the intrinsic properties of the polymer and the fullerene; therefore, they used device measurement and spectroscopic studies to characterize the open-circuit voltage losses in the P16–P19/PC71BM devices. Their results showed that the lower open-circuit voltages in the selenium-substituted P18- and P19-based devices are mainly due to the surprisingly large density of charge-transfer states (NCT) (Fig. 4), with values of 19 ± 9.8 × 1021 cm−2 and 62 ± 27 × 1021 cm−2 for P18 and P19, while the values are 5.8 ± 4.3 × 1021 cm−2 and 4.5 ± 1.8 × 1021 cm−2 for P16 and P17, respectively (Table 2).

Instead of the diphenyl or meso-phenanthraquinone-substituted quinoxalines, Jen and Zhang et al. further developed two novel dithienobenzene-substituted quinoxalines, aiming to improve the intermolecular stacking and increase the hole transporting properties. To this end, two polymers (P20 and P21) based on dithienobenzoquinoxaline/dithienobenzopyridopyrazine and indacenodithiophene were synthesized. P20 exhibited an absorption peak of 663 nm in the low-energy region; however, P21 showed a significant red-shift of the charge transfer peak with an absorption maximum at 721 nm as a result of the more electron-deficient pyrazine unit in P21 (Fig. 5a). As expected, the band-gap of P21 is reduced to 1.48 eV, whereas P20 has a band-gap of 1.61 eV. The hole mobilities of P20 and P21 from the top contact organic field-effect transistors were found to be 5.6 × 10−2 and 1.5 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The photovoltaic performances under the device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al showed a very promising PCE of 6.06% with a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 11.6 mA cm−2 and a FF of 63% for P20 (Fig. 5b), while P21 only gave a PCE of 3.21% with a Voc of 0.74 V, a Jsc of 10.1 mA cm−2 and a FF of 43%, which was mainly attributed to exciton nonradiative recombination at the interfaces of P21 and PC71BM. It needs to be highlighted that the promising device performance from P20/PC71BM was achieved without any pre- and/or post-treatments, such as thermal annealing, solvent/vapor annealing or the addition of solvent additives.
To improve the solubilities of these IDT/quinoxaline-based polymers, Yang et al. introduced dioctyl groups onto the quinoxaline unit, which was then copolymerized with the electron-rich indacenodithiophene to make P22, P23 and P24 (Fig. 2). P22 showed an absorption peak at 670 nm, whereas P23 exhibited a hypsochromic shift of ∼20 nm to 646 nm as a result of the electron-withdrawing fluorine substituent on the quinoxaline unit, and P24 gave a more pronounced bathochromic shift of ∼50 nm to 725 nm, which is very similar to that of P21. Similarly, polymers P22–P24 showed hole mobilities as high as 0.01–0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1. The best photovoltaic device was formed from P23 with the inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/PFN/P23:PC61BM/MoO3/Al, which achieved a PCE of 5.13% with a Voc of 0.97 V, a Jsc of 8.96 mA cm−2 and a FF of 59%, while under the same conditions the P22- and P24-based devices only gave PCEs of 3.75% and 3.93% with lower Jsc and FF values, respectively.
In order to further extend the linear π-conjugation of the IDT unit by taking advantage of the high degree of planarity, Wang et al. and Ameri et al. replaced the thiophene units of IDT with thieno[3,2-b]thiophenes to form an extended indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene arene, which was then copolymerized with 2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline to make P25. The absorption onset of P25 was slightly red-shifted to ∼703 nm with an optical band-gap of ∼1.76 eV as a result of the extended IDT unit. The photovoltaic performance of the P25-based solar cells was dependent on the molecular weight. Ameri et al. found that the PCE of P25 with an Mn of 20 kDa in the inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/P25:PC71BM/MoOx/Ag was 4.53% with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 9.19 mA cm−2 and a FF of 58%; when the Mn of P25 increased to 58 kDa, the best performing solar cell achieved a Jsc of 11.45 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.84 V and a FF of 62%, resulting in a greatly improved PCE of 6.01% (Fig. 6). These results showed that the device performance exhibits a clear trend with increasing Mn, not only in Jsc but also in FF. The detailed optoelectrical characterizations indicate that low molecular weight P25 suffers from a reduced probability of charge carrier generation, lower mobility and higher recombination, whereas high molecular weight polymers exhibit a higher carrier mobility and less non-radiative recombination.
In addition, Wang et al. also investigated the effect of side chain isomerization on the photovoltaic performance by synthesizing P26 with a meta-hexylphenyl side chain on the indacenodithienothiophene unit instead of a para-hexylphenyl side chain. P26 exhibits very similar optical and electrochemical properties to P25, indicating the minor effect of the side chains. But the device performance based on P26 exhibited a surprising enhancement, in which the PCEs of the P26-based cells reached up to 6.8% with an improved Jsc and FF in comparison with that of P25. They further introduced fluorine substituents onto the quinoxaline backbone of P25 and P26 to prepare P27 and P28. However, it is unfortunate that there were no improvements in the device performances observed from the P27- and P28-based devices under the same conditions.
Instead of a fluorine substituent on the polymer main chain, Chen et al. introduced fluorine onto the 2,3-diphenyl ring of quinoxaline for copolymerization with IDT to synthesize polymer P29, which exhibited a slightly blue-shifted absorption spectrum compared to its non-fluorinated analog P16. When blended with PC71BM, the solar cell based on P29 gave a PCE of only 2.6% with the as-cast film, which was further improved to 4.2–4.6% with thermal or solvent annealing.
Besides the above-mentioned IDT and quinoxaline alternating polymers, researchers have also introduced π-bridge groups, such as thiophene, between the IDT and quinoxaline units to form D-π–A-π polymers, as shown in Fig. 7. In 2012, Hou et al. synthesized polymer P30 by copolymerizing IDT with 5,8-dithienyl-2,3-di(3-octyloxylphenyl)quinoxaline. By incorporating the large coplanar IDT donor, P30 showed an absorption of ∼710 nm giving an optical band-gap of 1.74 eV, which is slightly narrower than that of P16 based on IDT and quinoxaline without the thiophene π-bridges. The conventional polymer solar cells were investigated by carefully tuning the weight ratios of P30/PC71BM from 2:1 to 1:20. It is found that the Voc of these solar cells decreased slightly from 0.90 V to ∼0.83 V with increasing PC71BM amount, which may be caused by the increased permittivity or the lowering of the effective LUMO energy level due to the formation of PC71BM clusters. The Jsc and FF, however, increased gradually from 3.99 to 12.34 mA cm−2 and 28.8% to 70.2% when the P30/PC71BM weight ratio decreased from 2:1 to 1:4 (Fig. 8). On further decreasing the P30 amount from 1:4 to 1:20, the Jsc of these solar cells started to decrease to 3.21 mA cm−2, and it is interesting that the FF exhibited no distinct changes over these ratios. The best PCE was found to be 7.51% with a Voc of 0.87 V, a Jsc of 12.34 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70.23% at a P30/PC71BM ratio of 1:4 (Fig. 8). The morphology studies indicated that there is a good interpenetrating network with a typical feature domain size of ∼20 nm at the ratio of 1:4. It also showed that the blend film at the ratio of 1:4 has more balanced electron and hole mobilities than the films at other ratios. As a result, the best photovoltaic performance was found at the P30/PC71BM ratio of 1:4.
P31 is a very similar polymer to P30 made by Wang et al., where the para-hexylphenyl side chains in P30 were replaced with meta-hexylphenyl side chains. The meta position substitution in the IDT side chain is designed to enhance the solubility, molecular weight and photovoltaic performance of the resulting polymer. P30 and P31 showed very similar optical properties because there is no change in the polymer backbone, but it is found that the meta-substituted P31 polymer chains lie slightly closer to each other than the P30 polymer chains. The optimized P31-based device showed a higher PCE of 7.8% with a Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 12.9 mA cm−2 and a FF of 69% at the P31/PC71BM ratio of 1:3.5. The further fluorination of P30 and P31 on the backbone of the quinoxaline unit did not give an improvement in the photovoltaic performance. Fluorinated P32 and P33 with para- and meta-hexylphenyl side chains, respectively, only exhibited unexpectedly lower PCEs of 5.7% and 6.6% with lower Jscs and FFs than P30 and P31. In another case, however, Zhu and Yang et al. observed an improved photovoltaic performance when the fluorine substituents were moved to the diphenyl rings of the quinoxaline unit. Under the same device fabrication conditions, the fluorinated P35 obtained a PCE of 5.78% with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 10.84 mA cm−2 and a FF of 61.7%, whereas the non-fluorinated P34 demonstrated a PCE of 5.11% with a lower Jsc and FF. These results indicate that the strategy of introducing fluorine substituents with the aim of enhancing the photovoltaic performance needs to take into consideration other molecular engineering methods simultaneously.
Besides the traditional Stille polymerization, green chemistry methodology using direct arylation polymerization (DAP) has also been applied to synthesize the quinoxaline-based polymers. Yang et al. started from β-unprotected IDT and brominated thiophene–quinoxaline–thiophene units to synthesize a new polymer, P36. The DAP-made P36 is expected to have a well-defined structure with low content of structural defects compared to the polymers synthesized via the conventional Stille method. P30 synthesized by both methods gave similar optical and electrochemical properties. The photovoltaic measurements showed that the DAP-made P36 exhibited a higher PCE of 5.1% with a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 10.75 mA cm−2, and a FF of 53.4%, compared to the PCE of 4.82% for the polymer produced using the conventional Stille method, which was mainly attributed to the good order and fewer defects in the DAP-made P36.

Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) has been widely used as an electron-rich unit in D–A-type conjugated polymers with good photovoltaic performance. In 2008, Hou and co-workers reported the first BDT and quinoxaline polymer, in which a very low PCE of 0.23% was achieved. In 2012, Hou et al. synthesized two other quinoxaline-based polymers, P37 and P38, with one-dimensional (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) BDT units as the donor. By changing from 1-D to 2-D, P38 exhibited better thermal stability and broader absorption compared to P37. The absorption edge of P37 was located at 714 nm, and that of P38 was red-shifted to 740 nm, corresponding to the band-gaps of 1.74 eV and 1.67 eV, respectively. It is interesting that both P37 and P38 had the same HOMO energy levels. The PSC device based on a P37:PC71BM blend at a weight ratio of 1:3 showed an optimal PCE of 3.06% with a Voc of 0.71 V, a Jsc of 7.00 mA cm−2 and a FF of 61.5%. For the P38-based PSC device, a maximum PCE of 5.0% was obtained with a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 10.13 mA cm−2 and a FF of 64.3%, which was 60% higher than that of the P37-based PSC device. The results indicated that the introduction of 2-D conjugated side chains would be a feasible approach to improve the photovoltaic performance of the quinoxaline-based polymers. Kang et al. also synthesized a 2-D BDT-quinoxaline polymer, P39, with four alkyl chains on the quinoxaline unit. It is unfortunate that the PSC device based on P39 only achieved a PCE of 3.97%, showing an inferior performance compared to its analogue P38. Moon et al. also applied the 2-D concept and synthesized a series of 1-D and 2-D polymers. Among them, P40 based on dihexylthienyl-substituted BDT and a blank quinoxaline possessed good solubility in common organic solvents at room temperature due to the two dihexylthienyl side chains. The large steric hindrance induced by the dihexyl substituent led to a blue-shift of the absorption of P40 compared to its analogues P38 and P39. As a result, the band-gap was increased to 1.81 eV. BHJ devices were fabricated using P40 and PC71BM, and the best PCE of 3.2% was obtained with a Voc of as high as 0.88 V (Fig. 9).

Zhu et al. applied another strategy by applying dioctyloxy side chains at the 6,7-positions of the quinoxaline unit and synthesized polymers P41–P43. Similarly, the 2-D P42 had a red-shifted absorption compared to that of 1-D P41. The optical band-gaps of P41 and P42 were found to be at 1.90 eV and 1.82 eV, respectively. It is surprising that introducing two octyloxy groups at the 6,7-positions of the quinoxaline unit and two methoxy groups at the para-positions of the phenyl in 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline could effectively increase the optical band-gap compared to its analogues P37 and P38. This indicates that alkyloxy groups appended in 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline do not always decrease the band-gap in the resulting polymer, although the alkyloxy group is considered as an electron-donating group. The reason for this was believed to be that the four alkyloxy groups in 2,3-diphenyl-quinoxaline decreased the intermolecular interaction and therefore widened the band-gap, which may provide another way to get a high Voc in PSCs. The PSC devices also showed this trend; the Voc of the P41 and P42 devices showed an outstanding value of as high as 0.91–1.0 V, and the best PCEs of 4.44% and 6.31% were obtained for the P41- and P42-based devices, respectively. They further synthesized P43 by trying to balancing the Voc and Jsc. P43 without the methoxyl side chains showed a lower band gap with the aim of improving the sunlight cover. As a result, the BHJ cells based on P43 achieved a maximum PCE of 6.9% with a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 11.28 mA cm−2 and a FF of 64.7%.
As indicated above, fluorination on polymers is an effective way to improve the performance of polymer solar cells by increasing either the Voc and/or enhancing the inter-/intra-molecular interaction. To this end, Peng and co-workers synthesized P44 and P45 by introducing a mono-fluoro quinoxaline acceptor with 1-D and 2-D BDT donors. Similar to P37 and P38, 2-D P45 showed a red-shifted absorption spectrum and a lower HOMO energy level compared to P44. The inverted devices with the configuration of ITO/ZnO/PFN/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Al showed that P45 had the optimal PCE of 5.00% with a Voc of 0.74 V, a Jsc of 10.91 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70%, whereas the P44-based PSC device under the same conditions gave an inferior PCE of 3.55% with a Voc of 0.66 V, a Jsc of 7.94 mA cm−2 and a FF of 67.9%. To further investigate the influence of fluorine atoms, Luscombe et al. designed and synthesized P46–P48 with different numbers of fluorine atoms on the quinoxaline moiety. They found that the absorption spectra of P46–P48 were almost the same with the absorption edge at 689 nm and a band-gap of ∼1.80 eV. The HOMO energy levels of P46–P48 were found to be at −4.98 eV, −5.07 eV and −5.08 eV, respectively. BHJ devices based on P46–P48 showed optimal PCEs of 2.9%, 3.1% and 3.7% with Vocs of 0.83 V, 0.87 V and 0.91 V, respectively. The improved device performance for P48 over P46 and P47 was mainly attributed to the higher Voc.
It is known that side chain engineering is important in polymer design. Gao and co-workers recently reported an effective approach to modify the optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties through introducing a 2,3-dioctylthienyl group instead of the conventional 2-ethylhexylthienyl group. They found that P50 with a 2,3-dioctylthienyl group exhibited a slightly blue-shifted absorption compared to P49 with 2-ethylhexylthienyl (Fig. 10a), which may be caused by steric hindrance. P50 therefore possessed a lower HOMO energy level of −5.37 eV compared with −5.29 eV for P49. BHJ devices were fabricated based on polymer:PC71BM blends with a device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/PFN/Al. Due to the lower HOMO energy level, the P50-based device showed a higher Voc of 0.88 V, resulting in the best PCE of 7.61% with a Jsc of 11.4 mA cm−2 and a FF of 75.9%, while the maximum PCE of the P49-based device was found to be 7.29% with a Voc of 0.78 V, a Jsc of 13.2 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70.8% (Fig. 10b). These results indicated that the architecture of the alkyl portion of the π-conjugated side group could greatly influence the photovoltaic properties of such polymers. Andersson and co-workers also reported two polymers, P51 and P52, which are very similar to P49 and P50, except that they contain a difluoro-substituted quinoxaline. They observed blue-shifted absorption in P52 compared to P51 in either solution or the film state. The absorption edges for P51 and P52 were at 730 nm and 700 nm, corresponding to the band-gaps of 1.70 eV and 1.77 eV, respectively. This shows that the difluoro-substitution further increased the polymer's band-gap. However, the best PCE for the P51:PC61BM-based device was 5.7% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 11.1 mA cm−2 and a FF of 61%, while the best PCE for the P52:PC61BM-based device was only 3.4% with a Voc of 0.96 V, a Jsc of 6.5 mA cm−2 and a FF of 54%. These results are different from those for P49 and P50. It was believed that P51 adopted a more planar conformation, which promoted more ordered and well organized domains in the blend films, thus leading to the improvement of Jsc and FF, and for P52 the two hexyl side chains on the thienyl groups can sterically hinder the adjacent quinoxaline unit inducing backbone twisting, which is thought to be unfavorable for a better interpenetrating network with fullerene derivatives.
Instead of these 2-D polymers, Chou et al. synthesized two 1-D polymers, P53 and P54, based on a difluoro quinoxaline moiety as the acceptor unit. The only difference between the two polymers is the different alkyl side chain on the 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline. P53 with a hexyloxy substituent showed absorption at 718 nm, which is a ∼33 nm red-shift compared to P54 with a 2-ethylhexyl substituent. Both polymers showed deep HOMO energy levels due to the introduction of the two fluorine atoms on the quinoxaline unit. Following careful device optimization, the BHJ devices based on high molecular weight P53/PC71BM with DCB/DIO as processing solvents showed the best PCE of as high as 8% with a Voc of 0.77 V, a Jsc of as high as 18.2 mA cm−2 and a FF of 58.1%. Instead, the P54/PC71BM-based devices achieved a PCE of 5.90% with a Voc of 0.78 V, a Jsc of 13.42 mA cm−2 and a FF of 56.4% for conventional devices, and a PCE of 6.36% with a Voc of 0.78 V, a Jsc of 12.72 mA cm−2 and a FF of 64.3% for inverted devices. The inverted device performances remained at 74% of the original PCE after exposure to air for over 1000 h without any encapsulation, showing a good long-term stability. The polymer P55, which was reported by Gedefaw and co-workers, has a similar structure to P53 and P54. Unfortunately, the best PCE was only 4.1% for the P55-based PSC devices.
Besides using alkylthienyl as the side chains for 2-D BDT and quinoxaline polymers, Wang et al. introduced 4-ethylhexyloxylphenyl as the side chain in BDT to synthesize polymer P56. P56 had a similar absorption peak at 584 nm to its 2-ethylhexylthienyl counterpart P57, but showing a slight blue-shift of the absorption edge in comparison with P57. The BHJ cells based on P56 only achieved a PCE of 3.96% with a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 8.66 mA cm−2 and a FF of 51.4%, whereas P57-based cells reached a best PCE of 6.08% with a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 12.34 mA cm−2 and a FF of 60.1%. The low Jsc for the P56 device was attributed to large scale phase separation in the P56/PC71BM blend film.
Zou et al. recently developed polymer P58 with a new tetrafluoridequinoxaline electron accepting block from a quinoxaline core, which is substituted with a fluorine atom onto its backbone and side chains. P58 possessed an absorption edge of 729 nm corresponding to a band-gap of 1.7 eV. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P58 were measured to be −5.36 eV and −3.56 eV, respectively (Fig. 11a). PSC devices based on P58 were fabricated with an architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P58:PC71BM/ETLs/Al, where the ETLs could be perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives (PDIN, PDINO) or zirconium acetylacetonate (ZrAcac). The devices without DIO as a solvent additive showed PCEs of 5.6–6.2% with a Voc of as high as ∼0.90 V, and the PCEs were significantly improved to 8.0–8.6% when 3 vol% DIO was added as a solvent additive. The best PCE of as high as 8.6% with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 14.5 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70% was achieved from the device with ZrAcas as the ETL layer (Fig. 11b).
Liang et al. also modified the BDT donor to synthesize polymer P59 by introducing a methoxyl group into the meta-position of the thiophene chain. The modification simplified the synthesis of P59 and improved its solubility in non-halogenated solvents. Importantly, the methoxyl group could also lower the HOMO energy level and enhance intermolecular interaction of P59. The HOMO energy level was found to be −5.22 eV. The conventional BHJ cells with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P59:PC71BM/PDINO/Al showed an optimal PCE of 8.01% with a Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 13.18 mA cm−2 and a FF of 69%. The higher Voc and FF from the P59 device were due to the lower HOMO energy level and enhanced interchain interactions. Gedefaw and co-workers reported the BDT-Qx-based P60, in which two alkyl-oxy-alkyl-substituted thiophenes were attached to the BDT unit. PSC devices fabricated from P60/PC71BM obtained a relatively low PCE of 3.8% since the long alkyl-oxy-alkyl-thiophene chains led to unfavorable morphology, thus resulting in a lower Jsc and FF. Andersson and co-workers applied another strategy by incorporating an alkyl-bithiophene-substituted BDT to synthesize P61 and P62. Both polymers exhibited similar optical properties, while the fluorinated P62 showed deeper HOMO and LUMO energy levels than P61. The BHJ devices based on P61 obtained PCEs of 3.2% and 3.7% with PC61BM and PC71BM as the electron acceptor, respectively. On the contrary, the P62:PC71BM devices showed a PCE of 4.7% while the P62:PC61BM-based devices achieved a PCE of 5.3%, which could be explained by a less favorable morphology of the P62:PC71BM blend, therefore leading to a decreased Jsc (Fig. 12).
Besides the carbon-based alkyl chains, triisopropylsilylethynyl was also introduced onto the BDT unit by Hwang et al. to prepare the BDT and quinoxaline polymer P63. With the triple bond connections, P63 possessed an absorption edge of 670 nm with a band-gap of 1.85 eV. The HOMO energy level of P63 was found to be −5.62 eV. The PSCs based on P63 exhibited better photovoltaic properties for the simultaneous enhancement of Voc, Jsc and FF compared to its non-fluorinated analogue. A maximum PCE of 6.08% was obtained with a high Voc of 0.91 V with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P63:PC71BM/PFN/Al (Table 3).

Instead of the introduction of thiophene as a π-spacer, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene was also used as the π-spacer between the BDT and quinoxaline units. Andersson and co-workers designed and synthesized P64 by using thieno[3,2-b]thiophene as the π-spacer. It is known that a conjugated π-spacer could affect the optical and electrical properties of the polymer by improving the π-electron density and mediating electronic interactions between the donor and acceptor. P64 exhibited a red-shifted absorption spectrum and a narrower optical band gap, as the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-spacer ensured a higher delocalization of the π-electrons over the polymer backbone and also favored intermolecular π–π stacking. The P64:PC61BM devices achieved a PCE of 5.60% without any processing additives. Zhu and co-workers also synthesized a series of BDT and quinoxaline polymers, P65–P67, with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, furan and bithiophene as the π-spacers. They found that P65 and P67 showed similar optical properties while P66 with a furan spacer exhibited a large blue-shift in absorption due to the weaker electron-donating properties of the furan spacer compared to the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene and bithiophene spacers. The band-gaps of P65 and P67 were ∼1.74 eV, whereas P66's band-gap was 1.87 eV. The BHJ cells under the same conditions obtained PCEs of 4.6%, 4.3% and 3.5% for P65, P66 and P67, respectively. It is noted that the Voc of the P66 device was as high as 0.91 V.
Besides the alternating D–A polymers, the D–π-A–π-A-type alternating polymer P68 with two quinoxaline moieties in the repeating unit was reported by Zhu and co-workers. The absorption spectrum of P68 exhibited a ∼60 nm red-shift compared to its D–A-type analogue. However, it is unfortunate that the PSC based on P68 only showed a PCE of 3.84%, which is mainly attributed to the low Voc because of its high-lying HOMO energy level.
Recently, Hou et al. systemically investigated the effect of fluorine substitution in either the BDT or quinoxaline units on the photovoltaic performance. To this end, a series of polymers, P69–P71, with different numbers of fluorine atoms were synthesized. They found that fluorination of the quinoxaline unit and the conjugated side groups of the BDT unit could have a synergistic effect on the molecular energy level modulation of the polymers. The absorption spectra of P69–P71 blue-shifted with an increasing number of fluorine atoms; the absorption edges were at 716–755 nm, corresponding to the band-gaps of 1.64–1.73 eV. Similarly, the HOMO energy levels of P69–P71 ranged from −5.05 eV to −5.35 eV, and also decreased with more fluorine atoms (Fig. 13a). Among these polymers, P71 with four fluorine atoms exhibited the deepest HOMO and LUMO levels. The PSC device based on P69, which has no fluorine substituent, showed a PCE of 5.63% with a Voc of 0.64 V, a Jsc of 12.56 mA cm−2, and a FF of 70.05%. With two fluorines on the BDT unit, the PCE of the P70-based device was improved to 7.39% with a Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 13.60 mA cm−2, and a FF of 67.68%. Further increasing the number of fluorine atoms on the polymer, P71 showed a promising PCE of as high as 8.55% with a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 13.58 mA cm−2, and a FF of 70.24%. The significant improvement in the photovoltaic performance was mainly attributed to the enhancement of Voc as they showed similar Jsc and FF values. Remarkably, the photovoltaic performance of the P71-based device could be further improved by using PFNBr as the n-type interfacial material, resulting in a much higher PCE of 9.04%. More recently, Hou and co-workers also used P69–P71 and a small molecular non-fullerene acceptor, ITIC, to fabricate fullerene-free BHJ cells. Through detailed studies, they found that the fluorinated P71/ITIC blend exhibited efficient ultrafast charge transfer along with low germinate and bimolecular recombination, therefore leading to a very small energy loss. With these benefits, the P71/ITIC device achieved a PCE of as high as 11.34% with a Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 17.87 mA cm−2, and a FF of 66.80% (Fig. 13b), which is the highest PCE for a quinoxaline-based device reported so far (Fig. 13 and Table 3).
As discussed above, the quinoxaline units are based on 2,3-diphenyl-substituted quinoxaline derivatives. Besides a phenyl unit, an alkylthienyl substituent has also been introduced. For example, Li et al. synthesized P72, which is a copolymer of BDT with a 2,3-dihexylthienylquinoxaline unit. The absorption onset of P72 was at 723 nm, giving a band-gap of 1.72 eV. The BHJ solar cells were optimized by using solvent additives, and the best PCE of 3.90% was obtained with CN/methanol treatment. Peng et al. also designed and synthesized a series of BDT and quinoxaline-based polymers with different side groups attached onto the 2- and 3-positions on the quinoxaline unit, among which P73 (dihexylthienyl) and P74 (dihexylthienylphenyl) demonstrated better photovoltaic performance. The PCEs of 4.39% and 3.58% were obtained for the P73- and P74-based BHJ solar cells, respectively, which is an increase of 17–43% compared to its alkoxylphenyl-substituted quinoxaline analogue. Gao and co-workers developed polymers P75 and P76 based on BDT and mono-fluorinated dioctylthienyl-quinoxaline. Similarly, the side chain modification from one 2-ethylhexyl chains to dihexyl chains on the thiophene groups of BDT led to a blue-shifted absorption and a deeper HOMO energy level for P76 compared to that of P75. The optimized photovoltaic devices under the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P76:PC71BM/PFN/Al achieved a PCE of 7.25% with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 11.3 mA cm−2 and a FF of 75.7%, whereas the P75-based device gave a PCE of 6.82% with a lower Voc of 0.72 V, a Jsc of 13.4 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70.8%. Wang et al. also copolymerized difluorodihexylthienylquinoxaline with 2-ethylhexyloxyphenyl or 2-ethylhexylthienyl BDT to make P77 and P78. Both polymers showed comparable optical and electrochemical properties compared to their difluorodiphenylquinoxaline counterparts P56 and P57, but P77 and P78 exhibited much better photovoltaic performance than P56 and P57. The best PCEs for the P77 and P78 devices are 6.54% and 7.68%, respectively, with a Voc of ∼0.85 V, a Jsc of 12.13–12.77 mA cm−1 and a FF of 63.5–69.9%. It is proved again that side chain modifications on either the donor or acceptor could be a feasible way to enhance the photovoltaic performance of such polymers. Chou et al. also reported P79, a very similar polymer to P78, where the only difference between the two polymers is the alkyl substituents on the quinoxaline unit. In this case, the P79-based solar cells afforded a relatively lower PCE of 6.1% attributed to their lower Voc and FF compared to the P78-based devices. Besides thienyl substitution on the 2,3-positions of quinoxaline, Hwang et al. synthesized P80 with a 2,3-dioctylthieno[3,2-b]thienyl quinoxaline acceptor. The absorption spectrum of P80 showed weak intramolecular charge transfer behavior. As a result, the P80-based BHJ solar cells only obtained a maximum PCE of 3.42% after careful device optimization (Fig. 14 and Table 4).

As discussed in the IDT section, phenanthrenequinoxaline has a large coplanarity that will be able to facilitate both intermolecular packing and charge transport behaviors in the resulting polymer. Researchers have also applied this concept to BDT-quinoxaline-type polymers. For example, Li et al. synthesized polymer P81, which contains alternating BDT and phenanthrenequinoxaline units; they also introduced thiophene spacers with the aim of reducing the steric hindrance (Fig. 15). P81 had a band gap of 1.77 eV with an absorption of 702 nm. The BHJ solar cell fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P81:PC71BM/PFN/Al showed a maximum PCE of 4.75% with a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 9.67 mA cm−2 and a FF of 64.6%. Yang et al. introduced the 2-D BDT unit copolymerized with phenanthrenequinoxaline to synthesize P82. It was found that the absorption edge of P82 was red-shifted to 778 nm with a band-gap of 1.59 eV, which will contribute to a higher Jsc in BHJ solar cells. The device based on P82/PC71BM achieved a PCE of 4.24% with a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 9.40 mA cm−2 and a FF of 54%. Another similar polymer, P83, was synthesized by Kang and co-workers. In this case, the BHJ solar cell based on P83/PC71BM demonstrated a higher PCE of 5.03%. Lin et al. also designed and synthesized two polymers, P84 and P85, which have different side chain modifications on either the phenanthrenequinoxaline or thiophene spacer. It is found that the absorption edge of P85 was further shifted to 805 nm, corresponding to a band-gap of as small as 1.54 eV, whereas P84's absorption edge was at 752 nm. On the other hand, the HOMO energy level of P85 was moved to −5.12 eV compared to −5.21 eV for P84. The PSC devices fabricated with P85 obtained a maximum PCE of 4.32% with a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 11.6 mA cm−2 and a FF of 49%, while the P84-based device achieved a PCE of 3.68% with a Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 9.21 mA cm−2 and a FF of 50%. Zhu and co-workers further extended the conjugation length of phenanthrenequinoxaline to design and synthesize the pyrene-fused quinoxaline-based polymers P86 and P87. Similarly, the 2-D-type P87 showed a red-shifted absorption with an edge of 782 nm, and the 1-D-type P86 had an absorption edge of 731 nm. The BHJ solar cells based on P87/PC71BM achieved a PCE of 4.86% with a Voc of 0.70 V, a Jsc of 11.10 mA cm−2 and a FF of 62.5%, whereas the P86/PC71BM-based PSC device exhibited a PCE of 4.25% with a Voc of 0.74 V, a Jsc of 9.79 mA cm−2 and a FF of 58.2%. Besides phenanthrenequinoxaline, dithienobenzoquinoxaline is another type of fused quinoxaline unit. Recently, Zhang et al. synthesized polymers P88 and P89 with a dithienobenzoquinoxaline unit as the acceptor. They found that the side chain position plays a significant role in the optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties. P88 with 2-hexyloctyl side chains showed a significantly red-shifted absorption with an edge of 890 nm corresponding a band-gap of 1.39 eV, while P89 with 2,3-dioctyl side chains exhibited an absorption edge of 740 nm with a band-gap of 1.62 eV. The HOMO energy levels of P88 and P89 were found to be −5.10 eV and −5.54 eV, respectively. The much lower HOMO level will contribute to a higher Voc in polymer solar cells. The BHJ solar cell based on P88 only showed a PCE of 0.80% due to the large phase separation. However, the photovoltaic performances of the P89/PC71BM devices were significantly enhanced. The PCE of the P89-based device was improved to 4.54% with a Voc of as high as 0.94 V, a Jsc of 9.33 mA cm−2 and a FF of 52%. These results indicate that properly selecting the side chains of conjugated polymers is highly important to achieve high performance PSCs. Acenaphthoquinoxaline, as a simple electron deficient building block, has also been applied in the design of D–A conjugated polymers for BHJ devices and their photovoltaic performances are relatively unsatisfactory compared to the above polymers. For example, Bo et al. reported the polymer P90 with benzodithiophene as the donor, which only gave a PCE of 4.72% with a Voc of 0.77 V, a Jsc of 10.75 mA cm−2, and a FF of 57%. Recently, Moon et al. also designed and synthesized the polymer P91 based on phenanthrenequinoxaline and benzo[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene, which is an isomer of BDT. The best PCE of 6.2% was achieved with a Voc of 0.859 V, a Jsc of 11.1 mA cm−2, and a FF of 65.3% for an inverted device with PFN as the interlayer (Table 5).

Compared to the above discussed donors, thiophene is also widely used as the donor in D–A polymers. The first thiophene and quinoxaline polymer (TQ) was reported by Yamamoto et al. in 2003. In 2010, Andersson and Wang et al. reported the synthesis of P92 in which octyloxyl side chains were applied in the quinoxaline unit to provide solubility. It was found that there is strong intramolecular charge transfer between thiophene and quinoxaline, and as a result, the absorption of P92 showed a strong peak at 612 nm in o-DCB solution and a slight red-shift in the film state (Fig. 17a). The absorption edge in the thin film was observed to be at 730 nm, corresponding to the optical band-gap of 1.70 eV. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels measured by square-wave voltammetry were at −5.7 eV and −3.3 eV, respectively. The photovoltaic cell of P92 with PC61BM gave a PCE of 4.9%. When P92 was blended with PC71BM at a ratio of 1:3, a maximum PCE of 6.0% with a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 10.5 mA cm−2 and a FF of 64% was achieved (Fig. 17b), which was the best result among quinoxaline-based polymers at that time. After that, the same group and others further optimized the photovoltaic device based on P92 by either inserting interfacial layers, i.e. ZnO, NiO, MoO3, polyelectrolytes, etc., or using different processing technologies. As result, the highest PCE based on P92 was recorded to be 7.08% with chloronaphthalene as a solvent additive. Recently, P92 was also applied in all-polymer solar cells by replacing PCBM with N2200, and PCEs of 3–5% were achieved. On the basis of P92, Yang et al. investigated the effect of fluorine on the photovoltaic properties by synthesizing its fluorinated analogues P93 and P94. Following fluoro substitution, they found that the optical band-gaps of P93 and P94 were slightly larger than that of P92, but the HOMO energy levels were decreased by 0.16–0.31 eV, which will contribute to a higher Voc in the resulting devices. The BHJ PSCs of P93 and P94 with PC71BM showed PCEs of 1.3–4.4% under various processing conditions. However, the Vocs of the P93- and P94-based BHJ solar cells were improved to 0.95 V and 1.00 V, respectively, benefiting from the lower HOMO energy levels. They further applied P93 and P94 in all-polymer cells with N2200 as the electron acceptor with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P93 or P94:N2200/PDINO/Al, and found that the photovoltaic performance could be significantly enhanced by optimizing the molecular weight and number of fluorine atoms in P93 and P94, which could strongly influence the charge transport properties and morphology of the blend films. As a result, the best all-polymer solar cell was found from P93 with a higher molecular weight of 63 kDa. The best PCE was 7.31% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 13.61 mA cm−2 and a FF of 63.9%. It is also noted that P93 was also reported by Huang et al., in which a PCE of 5.27% was obtained from a P93 device with a relatively lower Voc of 0.87 V (Fig. 16).

Andersson et al. synthesized P92, P94, P95 and P96 by synergistically combining fluorine substitution and thiophene–selenophene exchange. Upon incorporating a Se atom into the polymer backbone, P95 and P96 showed significantly red-shifted absorption spectra compared to their thiophene counterparts as a result of the more electron-deficient selenophene. The band-gaps of P95 and P96 were reduced to 1.65 eV from 1.75 eV, and 1.74 eV from 1.80 eV, respectively, in comparison with P92 and P94. In the BHJ solar cells, the maximum PCE of 4.2% was achieved for P96 with a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 7.94 mA cm−2 and a FF of 59%. It is interesting that, in 2015, Hwang et al. also reported very similar analogues of P92, P94, P95 and P96; the polymers P97–P100 have the same backbone as P92, P94, P95 and P96, respectively; the only difference is the substitution position of octyloxyl in the quinoxaline unit, where P97–P100 had para-position octyloxyl substituents, and P92, P94, P95 and P96 had meta-position substituents. The optical properties of P97–P100 were very similar to that of P92, P94, P95 and P96. The photovoltaic cells based on P97–P100, however, exhibited a best PCE of 5.14%, which is higher than that of the P92, P94, P95 and P96-based solar cells and mainly attributed to the different device structures and processing conditions (Table 6).

Woo et al. designed and synthesized polymers (P101 and P102) with different numbers of thiophene rings in the donor. They found that P101 and P102 showed similar optical properties, which means that the intramolecular charge transfer between thiophene and quinoxaline become weaker with longer thiophene units. PSC devices based on P101 showed a maximum PCE of 5.33% with an active layer thickness of ∼92 nm, while the P102-based device demonstrated an outstanding PCE of 7.73% with an active layer thickness of ∼115 nm. However, when the thickness of the active layer increased to ∼270 nm for the P102-based device, the PCE was found to be 8.00% (Fig. 18). The charge carrier transport measurements showed that the P102/PC71BM blends had better hole and electron transport properties; the hole and electron mobilities were measured to be 7.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The authors also fabricated all polymer solar cells based on P102:N2200 with an inverted configuration of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The highest PCE of 5.11% was obtained when using chloroform as the processing solvent and diphenyl ether as the solvent additive. Hwang et al. reported P103 with four thiophene rings in the repeating unit, and the photovoltaic device exhibited a PCE of 4.01% with a high Voc of 0.94 V.
To study the effect of isomeric structures on the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding polymers, Chochos and co-workers designed and synthesized P104 and P105, which have thieno[2,3-b]thiophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene as the donor unit, respectively. Because the two thienothiophene isomer led to a different resonance effect, P104 showed an almost identical absorption spectrum to P92, while P105 exhibited an ∼50 nm red-shift compared to P92. The space charge limited current measurements showed that both P104 and P105 films have comparable electron mobilities, but the hole mobility of P104 is ∼10 times higher than that of P105. The BHJ solar cells based on P104 had the best PCE of 5.0% with a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 9.6 mA cm−2 and a FF of 57.3%; the P105-based device, however, showed a slightly lower PCE of 4.7% with a Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 8.1 mA cm−2 and a FF of 56%. Wang et al. also used thieno[3,2-b]thiophene as the donor and synthesized P106. Compared to P105, P106 possessed blue-shifted absorption. The photovoltaic measurements showed that P106 had a PCE of 3.05% with a Voc of 0.66 V, a Jsc of 9.48 mA cm−2 and a FF of 48.6%. Another thieno[3,2-b]thiophene and quinoxaline polymer (P107) was reported by Gedefaw et al., and the optical properties of P107 were almost the same as those of P105. The photovoltaic properties were investigated using a conventional device configuration, and the active layer was deposited by blade-coating in air. The best PCE was found to be 3.8% with a lower Voc of 0.65 V, a Jsc of 9.2 mA cm−2, and a FF of 64%.
Besides the alkylphenyl-substituted quinoxaline, Wang et al. recently synthesized the polymers P108–P110 with hexylthienyl-substituted quinoxaline units. They also investigated the effect of fluorine on the optical and photovoltaic properties. With a fluorine atom, P109 and P110 showed blue-shifted absorption, decreased optical band-gaps and lower HOMO energy levels compared with P108. BHJ solar cells were fabricated with zirconium acetylacetonate (ZrAcac) as the electron interfacial layer and P110 exhibited the best PCE of 5.19% with a Voc of 0.77 V, a Jsc of 12.62 mA cm−2 and a FF of 53.1%, whereas P108 only had a PCE of 2.82% with a Voc of 0.60 V, a Jsc of 9.10 mA cm−2 and a FF of 51.79% under the same conditions (Fig. 16).

Since Reynolds et al. first synthesized two isoindigo-based small molecules for OPVs in 2010, isoindigo has been widely used as an electron-deficient building block for D–A conjugated polymers due to its strong electron-withdrawing character and outstanding absorption properties. Recently, Wang and co-workers designed and synthesized a series of D–A1–D–A2 type copolymers (P111–P115) based on quinoxaline, isoindigo and oligothiophenes. P111 exhibited broadened absorption compared to the D–A type analogues and enhanced photovoltaic performance was achieved with a PCE of 5.03% with a Voc of 0.81 V, a Jsc of 11.56 mA cm−2, and a FF of 54% for the P111-based device. After the introduction of F atoms, a further improved photovoltaic performance based on P112 was achieved with a PCE of as high as 6.32%. They also extended the length of the donor segments by introducing thiophene bridges to synthesize P113–P115. The results showed that the HOMO energy levels increased with longer donor segments; as a result, the BHJ solar cells based on P113–P115 possessed a lower Voc compared to those based on P111 and/or P112. P113 and P114 exhibited relatively poor photovoltaic performance with PCEs of 3.5% and 3.3%, respectively; however, the P115-based solar cells showed a promising PCE of 7.0% with a Voc of 0.67 V, a Jsc of 15.5 mA cm−2 and a FF of 67%, mainly due to the enhancement of both Jsc and FF.

Quinacridone-based D–A conjugated polymers often exhibit low photovoltaic performance due to their unsatisfactory absorptions. To overcome this problem, Moon et al. designed and synthesized a series of quinacridone- and quinoxaline-based polymers, among which P116 demonstrated better photovoltaic performance. A PSC was fabricated based on P116 with a device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN/Al and a maximum PCE of 4.0% with an unsatisfactory Jsc of 7.6 mA cm−2 was obtained. Maes et al. reported a series of copolymers based on N-acyl-dithieno [3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole and alkylthiophene-substituted quinoxaline (non-, mono- and di-fluorinated). P117, which is based on non-fluorinated quinoxaline, exhibited superior photovoltaic performance with a maximum PCE of 4.81%. In comparison, its monofluorinated and difluorinated quinoxaline-based analogues only gave lower photovoltaic performances due to the unfavorable morphology that led to a sharp decrease in Jsc. Besides N-bridged bithiophene units, Maes et al. also used cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene as the donor unit to synthesize the alternating polymers P118–P120. The polymers exhibited deep red absorptions, but possessed higher HOMO energy levels. The optimized PCEs for the P118, P119 and P120 devices were 3.24%, 4.87% and 5.26%, respectively. To study the influence of side chain density on the photovoltaic performance, two polymers (P121 and P122) were designed and synthesized, where P121 has a 50% side chain density, and P122 has a 75% side chain density. Since the side chain density has little effect on the optical and electrochemical properties, P121 and P122 had the same absorption spectra and energy levels. In BHJ solar cells under the same conditions, P121 with a 50% side chain density showed an inferior photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 5.11%. However, P122 with a 75% side chain density demonstrated a higher device performance with a maximum PCE of 5.63%, which was mainly due to the more favorable morphology. It is noted that P120 with a 100% side chain density had a PCE of 5.26%. These results indicate that side chain engineering also plays an important role in enhancing the photovoltaic performance. Demadrille and co-workers designed and synthesized three wide band gap polymers, P123–P125, based on dibenzosilole (also called silafluorene) and quinoxaline with thiophene or thiazole as a π spacer. The three polymers exhibited similar absorption spectra in thin films and the optical bad gaps were measured to be identical at ∼1.96 eV with a HOMO energy level of −5.32 eV, −5.47 eV, and −5.69 eV for P123, P124 and P125, respectively. Among them, P123 showed the best photovoltaic performance with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 9.72 mA cm−2 and a FF of 62%, resulting in a best PCE of 5.14%. Lower PCEs of 3.19% and 1.27% for P124 and P125 were achieved as a result of the higher monomolecular charge recombination rate and lower charge carrier mobility (Fig. 19 and Table 7).

It has been demonstrated that tremendous progress has been made in the past few years for quinoxaline-based conjugated polymers in polymer solar cells from almost every aspect. In this review, we have summarized the recent developments regarding quinoxaline-based conjugated polymers for application in polymer solar cells. These polymers are classified according to their fluorene, carbazole, indacenodithiophene, benzodithiophene, thiophene and other comonomer units. We summarize the structural effects of the various backbones, alkyl and/or aromatic chains, and functional groups on the photovoltaic performance in terms of the ideal designs of polymer structures and device architectures. We described in detail the modification of the chemical structure via either two-dimensional side chains or fluorine substituents, etc. to maximize the solar cell performance. Their photovoltaic device performances are summarized to better understand the relationship between structure and performance in such quinoxaline-based polymers. The current highest PCE for a quinoxaline-based conjugated polymer is more than 11%, which was achieved with the emerging non-fullerene electron acceptor. These promising results indicate that the quinoxaline unit and its derivatives are very useful building blocks in pursuing high-performance photovoltaic conjugated polymers. Further design and development of quinoxaline-based conjugated polymers will provide a bright future to reach the efficiency limit for commercial applications of polymer solar cells.

However, there are still some challenges remaining to further enhance the photovoltaic performance of polymer solar cells. For example, the energy losses of quinoxaline-based conjugated polymers still need to be optimized to improve the Voc, although some quinoxaline-based conjugated polymers can provide a Voc of up to 0.95 V. The understanding of and a way to reduce the geminate and bimolecular recombination in devices, which is very important to Jsc and FF, are seldom reported and still far behind the rapid improvement in performance; this actually calls for integrated work from chemists and device physicists to consider both molecular designs and process engineering. We believe that synergistic efforts from scientists will provide a brighter future for the quinoxaline-based conjugated polymers in the application of polymer solar cells.
