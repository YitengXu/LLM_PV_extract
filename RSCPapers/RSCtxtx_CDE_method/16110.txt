The morphology of the active layer, the formation of an interpenetrating network structure and the phase separation of donor–acceptor polymers play critical roles in determining the performance of organic solar cells, and are often difficult to control in a rational manner. Herein, an effective approach for tuning the morphology of the active layer by adding fluorinated polymers and the spin 1/2 radical galvinoxyl into the active layer is reported. Advanced scattering techniques, grazing-incidence small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering, are used to observe the morphological changes of the films. The apparent ordered structure is increased, and an improved film with a smaller domain size is obtained after the addition of the spin 1/2 radical. The highest power conversion efficiency of solar cells is improved by 79%. The efficiency increase is attributable to the better dispersion of the donor and acceptor units in the active layer, the improvement of the smoother morphology and the interpenetrating network structure after the addition of spin 1/2 radical galvinoxyl. Thus, research on tuning the film morphology of solar cell devices has far-reaching significance for the study of solar cell performance in the future.

Organic solar cells have advantages such as having a simple preparation process and low cost, being lightweight, having good flexibility and large area production, etc. and have become a primary focus in recent years. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells is affected by many factors, such as the band gap, the quantum efficiency, the light absorption coefficient and the morphology of the active layer; thus far, the PCE of solar cells has been low. Currently, there are several ways to improve the performance of organic solar cells, such as controlling the polymer orientation, tuning the polarizability of the donor polymer, utilizing the effect of a dipole moment on charge separation, employing additives, fabricating fullerene-free organic solar cells and achieving molecular orientation in organic solar cells. Impressive advances in organic solar cells lead to a much improved PCE exceeding 10%. However, organic solar cells are still not commercial.

The surface of the film, the internal and interface microstructure and other morphological structures are the basis of thin film devices, and have an important impact on the performance of solar cells. The morphological structure of a polymer blend is determined by the phase separation mechanism in the blend system, and the morphological structure is closely related to its performance. Guo introduced fluorinated polymers in manipulating the nanomorphology of organic bulk heterojunction solar cells to study the influence of morphology on performance. Pröller used in situ printed active layers following morphology development to study the phase-separated interpenetration network. The microstructure of polymer molecules is an important factor in determining the photovoltaic performance. The arrangement of molecules will not only affect the transmission of the carriers and the optical absorption material in the organic thin film but also influence the doping system for the microphase separation of the bulky materials, thus influencing the PCE of organic photovoltaic devices. Moreover, because polymer materials conjugated by doping or through light induction can generate solitons, polarons, bipolarons, exacitons, biexcitons, and nonlinear excitations and because conjugated polymers are semi-crystalline, the donor and acceptor polymer blend film's crystallinity, crystal region size and grain orientation are also important factors in the morphological structure. By adding a solvent or an additive to improve the structure and morphology of the donor–acceptor polymer, the conversion efficiency of solar cells can be altered. The addition of the spin 1/2 galvinoxyl radical into the active layer is a good way to improve the efficiency of organic solar cells. Zhang et al. presented a novel method to suppress polaron pair recombination at the donor–acceptor domain interfaces and thus improve the organic photovoltaic solar cell efficiency, by doping the device active layer with spin 1/2 radical galvinoxyl. In 2015, the optical, electrical and magnetic properties of organic solar cells based on low band gap copolymers and spin 1/2 radical additives were studied. However, the addition of the spin 1/2 galvinoxyl radical into the active layer to change the morphology of the active layer has rarely been studied. Because there is an unpaired electron in galvinoxyl, the electron spin can produce magnetic resonance, and thus will produce magnetic dipole resonance transitions. In addition, spin electrons in any direction can produce the same energy, and can be in an arbitrary orientation. So when galvinoxyl was dissolved in the active layer, the spin magnetic resonance of the unpaired electrons on the spin 1/2 radical has an effect on the electron cloud density of the polymer, which changed the energy level transition. In galvinoxyl, binding with the oxygen atom of the conjugated system can make the unpaired electrons of oxygen undergo delocalization throughout the whole molecule, and the steric effect of t-butyl can inhibit the coupling of free radicals by forcing the decomposition of other molecules. Therefore, we speculate that the donor and acceptor units could be dispersed more homogeneously in the active layer after the addition of the spin 1/2 radical, which might form a more closely interpenetrating network structure, and result in a more uniform morphology. Although this assumption seems reasonable, it has not been verified in organic photovaltic devices.
Hence, we designed and synthesized a series of donor–acceptor (D–A) type conjugated polymers because they can reduce the energy band gap; for charge transfer, having a matched electron acceptor level is advantageous. The electron donor units selected for the D–A type polymer fabrication include benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT), dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrroles (DTP) and dithienosilole (DTS), which are conducive to the formation of polymers with good solubility, low bandgap, high conductivity, and strong π–π stacking. Meanwhile, the electron acceptor unit employed is benzotriazole (BTZ), and BTZ containing polymers usually have high solubility, low band gaps, and high charge carrier mobilities. Thus, six D–A type conjugated polymers with low band gaps are prepared based on the random combination of the above donor units and the acceptor unit.
Here, we propose a method for improving the morphology of the active layer by adding the spin 1/2 radical galvinoxyl to the active layer and introducing fluorine atoms into the polymer. Compared with the original active layer of the blend film, the efficiency of the spin 1/2 radical-added solar cell is improved by 79%. Thus, after adding the spin 1/2 radical, phase separation is promoted. We use scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to provide more basic information regarding the change in the morphology of the active layer. Advanced scattering techniques, including grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), are used to evaluate the morphology of the inner membrane, the internal molecular spacing and the size and molecular orientation of the polymer crystals. This is an in-depth study on the role of the 1/2 galvinoxyl radical as an additive to the active layer of the PSCs based on the changes of the microscopic morphologies. Besides, we synthesized several D–A type polymers and studied the interactions between the polymers and the 1/2 galvinoxyl radical, which provided new insights into the role of the radical.

A series of polymers were synthesized (Fig. 1). The copolymers show good solubility in organic solvents and exhibit good thermal stability at decomposition onset temperatures (Td) (approximately 5% weight loss) (Fig. S1, ESI). The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and the polydispersity index were measured using a gel permeation chromatography (GPC) technique (Table S1, ESI). The electrochemical properties of the copolymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S2, ESI), which indicated that all of the polymers possess an excellent ability to transport electrons and holes. The nature of the excited states of these copolymers, and the optimal geometry of compounds were calculated using Material Studio 2016. The optimized molecular geometry of the models and their calculated HOMO and LUMO frontier energy levels are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI). The HOMO and LUMO values were calculated. The results are in good agreement with those obtained using the CV characteristics and UV-vis absorption spectra. These findings indicate that the copolymers, with good properties, have potentially useful applications in optoelectronic devices.


The blend films were fabricated by using the polymer and PC71BM, which were used to observe the effect of spin 1/2 radicals and fluorine atoms on the morphology of the active layer. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the blend films including Px:PC71BM and Px:PC71BM:spin 1/2 (doped with molecule radicals) are shown in Fig. 2, and those of the spin 1/2 radical are also shown in Fig. S4 (ESI). The UV-vis absorption spectra show the transition of electrons in different molecular orbitals of organic matter. In Fig. 2a, the absorption peaks of P1 and P2 are located at 590 and 580 nm, and P3 and P4 are located at 530 nm and 470 nm, due to intramolecular charge transfer, and the red shift of P1, P3 relative to P2, P4 is obvious from 450 nm to 650 nm. The primary absorption peaks of polymers P5 and P6 are located at 535 nm and 570 nm; the absorption peak of the spectrum in a broad range, and P5 shows a blue shift compared with P6 upon the introduction of electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms. In Fig. 2b, the width of the absorption peak of the polymer blend films is wider than that of the polymer itself since the absorption spectra of the blend films are a superposition of the PC71BM and the polymer spectra. The absorption peaks at 370 nm and 460 nm are attributed to PC71BM, which primarily absorbs light at lower wavelengths near the ultraviolet region via the π–π* transition. Among all of the polymers, only P1 and P2 blending films show an obvious absorption peak at 430 nm, which is due to the HOMO–LUMO transition via the addition of spin 1/2 radicals. In the spin 1/2 radical blend films, the large conjugated system bound to an oxygen atom can cause non-paired electrons in the oxygen to be delocalized throughout the whole molecule. Therefore, due to the structural differences between polymers, and the magnetic resonance exchange interaction between the spin 1/2 radical and the donor polymer, the thiophene branched chain on the electron-withdrawing group promotes the HOMO–LUMO transition of galvinoxyl to increase the absorption of the blend film at 430 nm. Hence, the additive and the chemical structure both have an impact on the absorption changes. For the four other blending polymers (P3, P4, P5, and P6), the spectra are very similar to each other, and no obvious absorption change occurs after the addition of the spin 1/2 radical. A broad absorption spectrum is obtained in the blend films with spin 1/2 radicals, which directly contributes to the improved efficiency of the solar cells. In all of the blend films, the π-conjugation length of the polymers decreased; with the addition of the spin 1/2 radical, the interchain delocalization increased and the degree of order increased slightly. Because a few differences were observed in the optical properties of the added spin 1/2 radical, both the film surface morphology and the inner morphology were further evaluated.


In an organic heterojunction solar cell system, the fullerenes cluster together due to the solvent and their solubility; therefore, the clusters cannot be completely dispersed in the mixed solution, which is observed from the light-colored clusters in the solar cell blend films using an optical microscope. In Fig. 3, blend films made of Px:PC71BM with and without spin 1/2 radicals and fluorine and fluorine-free polymers are presented. In Fig. 3a–f, the light-colored clusters are PC71BM clusters with no dispersion in the organic polymer solar cell blend films. The black dots in the picture are insoluble polymers. In Fig. 3g–l, we can clearly observe that the PC71BM clusters are dispersed after the addition of spin 1/2 radicals. Due to the mixed resonance of the unpaired electrons in the spin 1/2 radical, the spin flip acceptor electron disperses the fullerene acceptor more evenly in the blend film via an exchange mechanism. Thus, the spin 1/2 radicals enhance the cosolvency effect between the polymer and PC71BM, causing the fusion between polymer and PC71BM. This behavior can be observed more clearly in the SEM images. Fig. 4 shows that in the blend films, the PC71BM clusters disappear after the addition of spin 1/2 radicals, and PC71BM is dispersed more uniformly in the blend film, and the blending film is flatter. However, the resolution of the optical microscope is limited, and a greater difference cannot be observed; thus, we use AFM for further exploration of the blend film.

AFM was used to obtain information regarding the surface morphology and surface roughness at the nanometer scale. The AFM images showed that all of the polymer:PC71BM blend films have large clusters, which are large molecular PC71BM clusters combined in the polymer substrate. Obvious PC71BM agglomeration in the blend films without fluorinate atoms or spin 1/2 radicals can be observed in Fig. 5a–f, and denser PC71BM clusters with a smaller size distribution were embedded in the polymer. After the addition of spin 1/2 radicals into the blend polymer solution, all the blend films showed a very obvious change. In polymer P1, P5, and P6 blend films, the PC71BM clusters were uniformly dispersed, and the phase separation mechanism was improved in the polymer blend film. In the polymer P2 blend film, although the smaller PC71BM clusters even aggregate the PC71BM clusters are more uniformly dispersed as compared to without the spin 1/2 radical. Moreover, the order structure of the PC71BM was greatly improved. In polymers P3 and P4 the blend films show large bright regions, which are identified as large PC71BM rich domains embedded in the polymer matrix, although the PC71BM cluster is not clearly visible but the PC71BM rich domains are more and form contact surfaces with the polymer after the addition of the spin 1/2 radical. This phenomenon can be explained by the large conjugated system, which is bound to the oxygen atom in the spin 1/2 radical galvinoxyl, causing the unpaired electrons of the oxygen to undergo delocalization throughout the whole molecule; the steric effect of the ortho-position on the oxygen atom of t-butyl hinders the interactions among free radicals by enhancing the decomposition of other molecules. Thus, after the addition of spin 1/2 radicals, the donor and acceptor polymers are more uniformly dispersed in the blend film; the morphology of the active layer is more regular, and the arrangement is more uniform. In Fig. 5g–l, we can clearly see that the structure of the blend films added with spin 1/2 radicals is more ordered than that of the spin 1/2 radical free blend films and that the PC71BM clusters in the former blend films are more uniform because the unpaired electrons in the spin 1/2 radical promote phase solubility between the thiophene side chain in the electron-withdrawing molecules and the acceptor fullerene. Moreover, a 3D AFM spectrogram shows that the structure of PC71BM embedded in a polymer matrix is more uniform after the addition of spin 1/2 radicals (Fig. S5, ESI); thus, the blend film with the addition of spin 1/2 radicals can achieve a smaller domain size with more interfaces between the donors and acceptors. Optical microscopy and SEM were used to observe the PC71BM clusters, and the dispersion of these clusters was confirmed by high-resolution AFM. However, the inner film structure of the blend films was not thoroughly evaluated by AFM, and thus, further exploration is needed.

To study the inner film morphology, the advanced scattering technique GISAXS was applied due to its unique potential to evaluate the inner morphology of the active layer. Moreover, GISAXS can determine the domain size on the film surface, and its sensitivity ranges from nanometers to several hundred nanometers. The differences in each sample can easily be discriminated in the 2D scattering data shown in Fig. 6. With the introduction of fluorine atoms, the shoulder protrusions become more pronounced. For the films with the added spin 1/2 radicals, the scattering signal is enhanced, as shown in the red region in Fig. 6, indicating that the film surface was more homogeneous and that the ordering of PC71BM was improved, which is consistent with the morphology observed in the AFM images shown in Fig. 5g–l. To quantitatively analyze the 2D scattering pattern, a horizontal line cut was used on all samples and a Yoneda peak appeared.Fig. 7 shows the corresponding attenuation of the scattering vector as a function of qy. In general, due to the transmitted light and specular reflection, the light intensity is too high to cover useful scattering structure information. Thus, in the GISAXS test, we must add a light absorbing sheet in the middle of the detection, denoted by the black shade in the figures. For the thin film samples, a number of weak peaks appear at different qy positions, as shown in Fig. 7; this trend is indicative of different scales of the inner film structure.

Only a slight domain distance change is observed in the interpenetration network. The domain size primarily determines the efficiency of solar cells because the domain size has an effect on the charge mobility. The domain size is directly extracted from the position of the intensity q using Bragg's law D = 2π/q. The domain sizes of the Px:PC71BM blend films with and without the spin 1/2 radical are provided in Fig. 8. For the scattering intensity parameters, three domain sizes of approximately 250 nm, 20 nm and 8 nm are obtained. As the domain size decreases, the exciton diffusion length becomes closer to 10 nm. The efficiency of the separation of the exciton into free charges is higher. As shown in Fig. 8, all of the domain sizes changed significantly after the addition of spin 1/2 radicals. Moreover, the domain size of a polymer with fluorine atoms is smaller than that without fluorine atoms, which can be clearly seen in the figure. This result indicates that the changes in the morphology of the film after the addition of spin 1/2 radicals can not only be observed in AFM but also in GISAXS. R1 and R2 change significantly after the addition of spin 1/2 radicals. The domain size R3 is very close to the exciton diffusion length of the organic solar cell devices; although the changes in R3 are small, the changes are anticipated. In the blend films containing spin 1/2 radicals, the domain size R1 decreased from 220 nm to 150 nm. Compared to polymers P2 and P4, the polymers containing fluorine atoms (P1 and P3) have a smaller domain size. The domain size R2 also decreased, although its change was not particularly significant. The domain size R3 decreased upon the addition of pin 1/2 radicals from 8.63 nm to 7.92 nm, basically equal to the diffusion length of the exciton. As the domain size decreases, the interface of the blend film increases, and higher charge separation and higher conversion efficiency are therefore obtained via the good blend film morphology. In general, the 8 nm domain size is a major determinant of the power conversion efficiency in the blend films. Moreover, the intermixed morphology of the blend film led to an improvement in the microphase separation, as observed on the sample surface by AFM and in the GISAXS images for the spin 1/2 radical Px:PC71BM film.
The agglomeration and crystallization of fullerene molecules can be observed by optical microscopy, SEM and AFM, as well as by observing the polymer counterpart. To probe the absence or presence of crystalline structures in organic solar cell films, GIWAXS was used. Because the polymer has a long conjugated structure, the repeat unit forms crystals via π–π-stacking of the polymer backbone. These crystalline regions are separated by PC71BM in the blend film. Typical 2D scattering data from blend films of Px:PC71BM with and without spin 1/2 radicals are shown in Fig. 9a and b, respectively.
In Fig. 9c, several higher order Bragg peaks are shown, which can be used to determine the type and crystallization of the crystal. The figure also shows the vertical sector integral of the GIWAXS 2D (Fig. S6, ESI) pattern with and without spin 1/2 radicals. In the spectra, there is a clear PC71BM Bragg peak located at q ≈ 19 nm; higher order Bragg peaks are found for PC71BM, indicating a more available structure. The slight peak near 16 nm is the scattering signal of all polymers; it is related to the π–π stacking distance of the conjugated polymer backbones (0.397–0.400 nm), which is consistent with previous reports of copolymers. Moreover, the PC71BM molecules aggregate in PC71BM domains and are inserted into the boundary of the crystalline polymer domain and agraphitic polymer domains. In the 2D GIWAXS data, the Bragg peak at about 27 nm−1 may be the peak from polymers deposited parallel on the substrate, related to the anisotropic thiophene rings. As shown in Table 1, compared with the blend films without the spin 1/2 radicals, the blend film with spin 1/2 radicals exhibits a strong scattering intensity, which implies high crystallinity. Moreover, minor changes in the interlamellar spacing of the backbone are observed, which can well explain the slow cluster growth of the polymers and the constant lateral distance. Therefore, Gaussian functions fits were used to acquire the peak position and the FWHM, and the level of crystallinity and a long π–π stacking were obtained via the Scherrer equation. As shown in Table 1, an obvious increase in the crystal size is obtained for all samples with the added spin 1/2 radicals. The increased nanocrystal size observed for the added spin 1/2 radicals may contribute to enhancing the PCE of organic solar cells.

Thus, the crystal size of all blend films increased and that the π–π stacking showed a slight change upon the addition of spin 1/2 radicals, while the backbone spacing exhibited no significant change for the blend films with or without spin 1/2 radicals. Moreover, a good phase separation structure of the blend films with the spin 1/2 radicals was observed in the GISAXS spectra and the domain size could be decreased, which suggested that the exciton recombination rate might be decreased, and then the PCEs of the solar cells may be improved. So far, we can conclude that the addition of spin 1/2 radicals has a great influence on the morphology of organic solar cells.

The long photoluminescence (PL) lifetime of organic semiconductor materials is of great importance to ensure that the photo-excited excitons have enough time to diffuse to the interface of the donors and acceptors, where recombination can occur. Fig. 10 shows the time resolved emission decays of all polymers with and without spin 1/2 radicals. We were pleasantly surprised to find that all copolymers with the added spin 1/2 radical exhibited different degrees of photoluminescence lifetime decay. Analyzing the curve slope of the spectral data, an exponential decay kinetic fitting formula can be used to calculate the transient fluorescence lifetime.
where
S is the signal, G is the laser pulse autocorrelation function, a is the amplitude, and τ is a time constant. The exponential equations can perfectly fit this decay; the kinetic parameters are given in Table 2. Polymer P2 shows a longest PL lifetime of 2313 ps, almost 1.6 times longer than that of P6. Furthermore, with the addition of spin 1/2 radical, all polymers exhibit different decays, the PL lifetime decay ratio of the polymers P1–P6 is 29.2%, 62.2%, 4.6%, 27.8%, 17.2%, and 2.7%, respectively. The charge transfer rate kCT can be calculated by applying the relation kCT = 1/τblendfilm − 1/τpolymer; the charge transfer rates kCT are estimated to be 2.08, 7.24, 0.30, 2.73, 1.30 and 0.14 × 108 s−1 for P1+, P2+, P3+, P4+, P5+ and P6+, respectively. P2+ exhibits a much faster charge transfer rate, which is at least 50 times faster than P6+. These are derived from the spin magnetic resonance of the spin 1/2 radical. This allows the electron transfer from the excited singlet state to the triplet state, thus improving the efficiency of charge transfer and the decay of the PL lifetime. In general, P2+ shows the longest PL lifetime as well as a high charge transfer rate after the addition of spin 1/2 radicals, a reduced charge recombination and increased device efficiency.

Fig. 11 shows the device performance of Px:PC71BM organic solar cells with or without a spin 1/2 radical. The same device manufacturing process and the same test conditions were adapted for all samples. The solar cell devices without spin 1/2 radicals are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI). Each sample was fabricated with 20 devices, and part of the device performance is shown in Fig. S8 (ESI). The spin 1/2 radical clearly improves the device performance. This result is related to the reduced charge recombination and increased charge transportation caused by the increased interface between the donors and acceptors.


Table 3 lists the parameters of the solar cells. The PCE of the solar cell devices with spin 1/2 radicals increases by 11% from 2.7% to 3.0%, and the highest PCE increased by 79% from 2.4% to 4.3%. The short-circuit current Jsc of the solar cells with spin 1/2 radicals increased by varying degrees; the highest Jsc is 16.2 mA cm−2 with the spin 1/2 radicals. This value is associated with a high absorption coefficient and a small change in the domain size. The fill factor FF also exhibited different degrees of increase, which leads to an increased PCE. The open circuit voltage Voc primarily causes an improvement in PCE. The Voc is determined by the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor; thus, the lower HOMO and LUMO values of the spin 1/2 radical galvinoxyl lead to an increased open circuit voltage. Because the radical promotes the transfer of electrons on the side thiophene chains of P1 and P2 polymers, the Voc increases to a maximum. In general, with the added spin 1/2 radicals, the domain size decreases, π–π stacking changes and the interface increases, in close relation to the increased PCE. Thus, our conclusions provide sufficient evidence for the relationship between the efficiency and morphology of these devices, which is of great significance for a comprehensive understanding of the performance of solar cells.

We investigated the relationship between the morphology and the efficiency of blend films by using imaging techniques, such as optical microscopy, AFM, and GISAXS. Optical microscopy reveals the formation of a PC71BM cluster in the blend film, which is further verified by high-resolution AFM by comparison with spin 1/2 radical blend films. The spin 1/2 radicals improve the cosolvency between the donors and acceptors and promote phase separation between the polymer and PC71BM to form a better interpenetrating network. A smaller domain size for films containing spin 1/2 radicals is observed by AFM measurements and by inner film measurements via GISAXS. With the addition of a spin 1/2 radical, the domain size decreases and more interface is formed in the blend film; thus, the separation of excitons into free charges is promoted, and the short circuit current is enhanced. Therefore, doping with spin 1/2 radical galvinoxyl can improve the PCE of organic solar cells by reducing the recombination rate of the excitons.

In our work, the morphology of the blend films was changed by the added spin 1/2 radical galvinoxyl. The changes in the domain size and film morphology were observed in the samples. These changes increase the interface between the polymer and PC71BM; the domain size is closer to the diffusion length of the exciton and increases the efficiency of charge separation. Generally speaking, the power conversion efficiency has a strong relationship with the HOMO and LOMO levels of polymers. The spin 1/2 radical has lower HOMO and LOMO levels and has a synergistic effect on PCE but is not the primary determinant of the organic solar cell PCE. Instead, the main effect of the spin 1/2 radical occurs as it acts on the optical properties and the nanomorphology of the blend film to improve the PCE. As a consequence, this work provides a good example for tuning the morphology of the active layer and photovoltaics performance by adding a spin 1/2 radical.

Solar cell devices were produced with the following layers: ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag. The solar cells were fabricated on glass-ITO substrates purchased from Zhuhai Kaivo, with a size of 1.8 × 1.8 cm2. The ITO-coated substrates were subjected to ultrasonic cleaning for 15 minutes using acetone, detergent solution, and isopropanol, and then, they were dried using nitrogen. The ZnO films were annealed at 150 °C for 10 min, and Px:PC71BM (1:1 by weight) dissolved in CB solution (40 mg mL−1) with and without galvinoxyl was spin-coated with the following spin-coating parameters: 2 s of acceleration at 1200 rpm and 30 s at 800 rpm. After one hour, the active layer was annealed for 10 min at 150 °C. The MoO3 hole transport layer and the Ag electrode were subjected to thermal evaporation under vacuum conditions (4.0 × 10−6 mbar). The deposition rate of MoO3 began at 0.3 Å s−1 until the film thickness reached 7 nm. The deposition rate of Ag started at 1 Å s−1 and increased to 7 Å s−1 until the film thickness reached 100 nm. For each polymer, 20 devices were produced. The solar cells were directly subjected to current–voltage measurements under ambient air conditions.
