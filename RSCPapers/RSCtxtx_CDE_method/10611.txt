We report herein a new solution-processable small molecule acceptor, a selenophenyl bridged perylene diimide dimer, that gives 4.0% efficiency when employing PBDTTT-C-T as the polymer donor and a conventional cell structure.

Finding an efficient solution-processed small molecule acceptor is an important issue for the fabrication of high-performance non-fullerene solar cells (NF-SCs), in which an N-type organic acceptor (a small molecule or a polymer) is applied to replace fullerene, which is currently the dominant acceptor material in organic solar cells. Among the reported small molecule acceptors such as those based on 9,9′-bifluorenylidene, benzothiadiazole, naphthalene diimide, quinacridone, fluoranthene-fused imide, and decacyclene triimide, perylene diimide (PDI) based ones are highly efficient. PDIs are a typical kind of N-type organic semiconductors. They usually have a strong absorption band in the visible wavelength region (400–600 nm), a relatively high extinction coefficient (10−4 M−1 cm−1), a good electron mobility (up to 101 cm2 V−1 s−1) and a low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (typically, −4.0 eV). Additionally, PDIs are normally stable to light, heat, and chemicals. Recently, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3–4% has been reported for the PDI based small molecule acceptors as their aggregation tendency is reduced, for example, by the formation of the twisted dimeric or trimeric backbone, or by imidization using branched alkyl amine such as 1-ethylpropylamine or by incorporation of large conjugated π-systems, for example, in the bay region. With respect to the conventional cell configuration, an inverted cell structure takes advantage of the carrier-extraction favourable donor/acceptor (D/A) distribution in the top and buried surfaces of the active layer, which leads to a higher PCE value (4.34 vs. 3.28%). Very recently, a PCE of 5.9% has been achieved for a PDI dimer by using an inverted cell structure with a fullerene self-assembled monolayer (C60-SAM) on the ZnO electron selective layer.

In this communication, we present a new efficient PDI dimer based solution-processable small molecule acceptor, namely 1,1′-bis(2-methoxyethoxyl)-7,7′-(2,5-selenophenyl) bis-PDI (bis-PDI-Se-EG, Fig. 1A), in which a selenophenyl moiety is selected as the aromatic bridge since it has been reported that replacement of the thienyl with the selenophenyl unit may enhance charge transport and performance of all polymer solar cells.
This dimer was synthesized by the palladium-catalyzed Stille cross-coupling reaction between 1-(2-methoxyethoxyl)-7-brominated PDI and 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)selenophene in a yield of 85%. The final product was successfully characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, TOF-MS and elemental analysis (ESI).
The optimal conformation of this dimer was calculated using Gaussian 09 at the B3LYP/6-31G level of theory in the gas phase (Fig. S3, ESI). The dihedral angle between two PDI planes is 21.89° and that between the PDI and the selenophenyl plane is 55.98°. This dimer forms a highly twisted dimeric backbone.
The electrochemical properties of the dimer were analyzed by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode (Fig. S4, ESI). Energy levels of the LUMO and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) were determined to be −3.84 and −5.61 eV, respectively, from the onset of oxidation and reduction waves by using an offset of 4.40 eV for the Ag/AgCl electrode versus the vacuum level. Both the LUMO and HOMO levels are close to those of our previously reported thienyl bridged dimer, bis-PDI-T-EG.Fig. 2 depicts the energy diagrams of the PDI dimer and the selected polymer donors of P3HT and PBDTTT-C-T. The HOMO and LUMO energies of the PDI dimer match well with those of P3HT and PBDTTT-C-T, respectively.

Fig. 3 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the dimer, P3HT and PBDTTT-C-T. In a dilute solution (Fig. 3A), the dimer has an absorption peak at around 562 nm with a maximum extinction coefficient of εmax = 56800 M−1 cm−1. The absorption properties are also similar to those of bis-PDI-T-EG. In thin film (Fig. 3B), the dimer shows an absorption band extending from 440 to 700 nm, which closely overlaps with that of the pure P3HT film, while it is complementary to that of the pure PBDTTT-C-T film. In the absorption spectra of the 1:1 (w/w) blend films (Fig. 3C), the blend of a PBDTTT-C-T:PDI dimer has a much wider spectral coverage than that of a P3HT:PDI dimer (300–800 vs. 300–650 nm), benefiting for the solar energy utilization.
The photovoltaic properties of the PDI dimer were characterized by selecting commercial P3HT and the conjugated polymer of PBDTTT-C-T as the blend donor, respectively. The solution-processed bulk-heterojunction solar cell devices were fabricated with a conventional configuration of ITO glass/PEDOT:PSS/donor:acceptor/Ca/Al and were tested under an AM 1.5G simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2 (AAA grade). Here, PEDOT:PSS is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate). The cells were optimized by changing the host solvent, the donor:acceptor (D:A) weight ratio, the additive content, and the thermal annealing temperature and time, respectively. Tables S1 and S2 (ESI) collect the photovoltaic data optimized under these conditions. The best D:A weight ratio is 1:1 for both donors.

Fig. 4 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best cells obtained with P3HT and PBDTTT-C-T as the blend donor, respectively. Table 1 lists the relative photovoltaic data. With the blend donor from P3HT to PBDTTT-C-T, the short-circuit current–density (Jsc) of the best cell increases from 3.30 to 10.60 mA cm−2, enhancing by a factor of 3.2, and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) increases from 0.59 to 0.79 V. The enhancement of the Jsc is in line with the wider spectral coverage from the PBDTTT-C-T blend than from the P3HT one (Fig. 3C). Also, it may be contributed from the smaller energy offset between the LUMOs (HOMOs) of PBDTTT-C-T and a PDI dimer (Fig. 2). The increase of the Voc is due to the low-lying HOMO energy of PBDTTT-C-T with respect to that of P3HT. The fill factor (FF) is 67.21% and 47.93% and the PCE is 1.31% and 4.01% when using P3HT and PBDTTT-C-T as the donor, respectively. The relatively high FF is consistent with the values from the PC71BM based cells: P3HT gives an FF of ∼70%, while PBDTTT-C-T has an FF of ∼60% when using the normal cell structure.

When using PBDTTT-C-T as the blend donor, bis-PDI-Se-EG gives a slightly higher Voc (0.79 vs. 0.73 V) and a much higher Jsc (10.60 vs. 3.39 mA cm−2), an FF (47.93 vs. 31.1%), and, hence a PCE (4.01 vs. 0.77%) than bis-PDI-T-EG, both solar cell blends are free of use of the additive of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). The use of DIO leads to a deterioration of the performance of the former dimer (Table S2 and Fig. S5, ESI), whereas significantly improves all the four cell parameters of Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE for the latter one. When blended with P3HT and without the use of an additive, bis-PDI-Se-EG also yields a higher Jsc (3.30 vs. 1.63 mA cm−2), an FF (67.21 vs. 41.6%), and a PCE (1.31 vs. 0.39%) than bis-PDI-T-EG, while both dimers have a comparable Voc (0.59 vs. 0.58 V). Also, the performance is deteriorated for the selenophenyl bridged dimer, while it is improved for the thienyl bridged one after the use of an additive, for example, 1-chloronaphthalene. These comparisons indicate that a subtle difference in the structure of the aromatic bridge can lead to a large distinction in the cell performance.

Fig. 4B shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimal cells. The EQE responses cover a wavelength range from 350 to 700 nm for the P3HT based cell and from 350 to 800 nm for the PBDTTT-C-T based cell, and each is in accordance with the absorption spectrum of the corresponding 1:1 (w/w) blend film (Fig. 3C), indicating that both the polymer donor and the dimer acceptor contribute to the photon-to-electron conversion. The integrated current density from the EQE spectrum is 3.02 and 9.82 mA cm−2, respectively, which is in agreement with the Jsc value of the relative cell.
Both the electron and hole mobilities were measured using a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The electron-only and hole-only devices are ITO/TIPD/donor:acceptor/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:acceptor/Au, respectively. The extracted value of the electron and hole mobilities is 0.61/7.2 and 4.7/9.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the blend from P3HT and PBDTTT-C-T, respectively. For both solar cell blends, the electron mobility is lower than the hole one. The relatively lower electron mobility of the P3HT blend than that of the PBDTTT-C-T one is likely responsible for its lower Jsc value.

Fig. 5 displays the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the two solar cell blends. The white/black domains are 35/60 nm for the P3HT blend, a slightly larger than that of the bis-PDI-T-EG:P3HT blend. The size of the PBDTTT-C-T blend is 15/15 nm, which is close to that of the bis-PDI-T-EG:PBDTTT-C-T blend without the use of DIO as the additive, suggesting that the selenophenyl and the thienyl bridged dimer show similar compatability to the polymer. Apparently, the P3HT blend gives a much larger phase domain than the PBDTTT-C-T one. As a result, lower charge dissociation efficiency may be expected for the P3HT blend to contribute to its lower Jsc owing to the lower volume density of the donor–acceptor interfaces.
In summary, a new selenophenyl bridged PDI dimer based solution-processable small molecule acceptor is reported. When blended with the conjugated polymer donor of PBDTTT-C-T, a PCE of 4% was obtained. The high efficiency is related to the wide spectral coverage, matched levels of frontier molecular orbitals, improved carrier mobility and reduced phase size.
