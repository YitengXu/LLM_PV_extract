The band-energy structure, electron mobility and electronic trap states of the electron-transporting layer (ETL) are critical for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the state-of-the-art titanium oxide (TiO2) ETL prepared by means of high-temperature processing technology requires a long preparation time and a lot of energy consumption; and the low-temperature processed species always present unfavourable electrical properties. In this work, we demonstrate that photoactivated transition metal dichalcogenide quantum dots (TMDC QDs, MoS2 and MoSe2) boosted a low-temperature processed TiO2 (L-TiO2) ETL for all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs without a hole-transporting layer or precious metal electrode. Arising from the photogenerated electron injection from TMDC QDs to L-TiO2 under light irradiation, the electronic trap states and the electron mobility of ETL were effectively regulated, which in turn significantly enhanced the electron extraction from perovskite to the L-TiO2 ETL and reduced the carrier recombination. Finally, the optimal CsPbBr3 PSC achieves an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 10.02% with an ultrahigh open-circuit voltage of 1.615 V and excellent long-term stability, providing a new path to efficient photovoltaic devices.

Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been considered as new-generation photovoltaic devices due to their dramatic increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% to 25.2% in the past decade. However, their practical application is seriously impeded by their inherent lattice instability in a harsh atmosphere. Up to now, one promising solution to this impasse has been to fabricate all-inorganic CsPbX3 (X− = I−, Br− or Cl−) PSC candidates by completely replacing the organic species with inorganic Cs+, among which tri-brominated CsPbBr3 perovskite presents particular advantages in balancing efficiency and stability as a potential top sub-cell in tandem solar cells owing to its large optical bandgap of ∼2.3 eV. Unfortunately, the cell efficiency is relatively low compared to that of hybrid PSCs owing to the sluggish charge extraction efficiency and substantial charge recombination loss during the charge extraction process.

In a typical planar PSC, the perovskite layer is sandwiched between a hole-transporting layer (HTL) and an electron-transporting layer (ETL), and the performance is strongly dependent on both layers. Titanium oxide (TiO2) is the most preferred ETL material with suitable energy levels of the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) for PSC platforms, but there are still several issues in the way of highly-efficient platforms. For example, a high-temperature sintering process is generally required to obtain high-quality TiO2 films with ideal electron extraction and transfer properties, which undoubtedly requires a long preparation time and great energy consumption. Furthermore, the low electron mobility (<1 cm2 V−1 s−1) seriously hinders the extraction of photogenerated electrons from the perovskite absorber and charge transfer along the TiO2 percolating networks. To address this problem, enormous efforts have been made to develop low-temperature processed charge-selective layers (lower than 150 °C). However, the ubiquitous oxygen vacancies, grain boundaries and crystal defects inevitably induce substantial interfacial bandgap states, significantly reducing electrical conductivity and trapping photogenerated electrons for serious charge recombination at the interface of the ETL and perovskite. Considering that the CB of an all-inorganic CsPbBr3 is much higher than that of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, the larger energy difference between the CB positions of TiO2 and CsPbBr3 will further result in inefficient interfacial charge transfer dynamics and therefore a larger open-circuit voltage loss. Following this line of thought, fabricating a low-temperature processed TiO2 ETL with remarkable electron collection ability is urgent for all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs.
In previous reports, the incorporation of carbon-based materials (such as C60, graphene and carbon quantum dots) or the doping of metal ions (such as Li+, Nb+ or Mg2+) into TiO2 have been performed to regulate the conductivity and to modify the band structure of TiO2, demonstrating a great improvement in charge extraction and transfer. Inspired by these works, herein, transition metal dichalcogenide quantum dots (TMDC QDs) including MoS2 QDs and MoSe2 QDs are used as modifiers to enhance the electron mobility of low-temperature processed TiO2 ETLs (L-TiO2). Under light irradiation, TMDC QDs can absorb photons and realize electron jumps from VB to CB, and subsequently the electronic trap states in the L-TiO2 are filled and the electron mobility of TiO2 is markedly enhanced. After systematic optimization and characterization, the all-inorganic planar CsPbBr3 PSCs based on L-TiO2:TMDC QDs ETL demonstrate an outstanding improvement in PCE from 8.25% for a device without TMDC QDs to 10.02%, which is a cutting-edge value comparable to state-of-the-art CsPbBr3 PSCs based on other ETLs. To better understand the improvement in efficiency, the detailed photovoltaic parameters of the reported devices have been summarized in Table S1. By careful comparison, it can be seen that the efficiency of CsPbBr3 PSC is generally <10% for a device without additional interface modifications (such as ETL/perovskite or perovskite/HTL interfaces) or compositional engineering for perovskite films (such as doping elements into the lattice). Meanwhile, the device free of encapsulation shows excellent long-term stability in an air atmosphere (25 °C and 80% humidity) for ten days. Moreover, the optimal solar cell achieves an open-circuit voltage (Voc) as high as 1.615 V because of the enhanced charge transfer from CsPbBr3 to ETL and minimized carrier loss. Given the inexpensive fabrication process and effective improvement in PCE, this work may pave the way to obtaining ideal ETL for high-performance PSCs.

All materials were used as supplied without further purification.


100 mg of bulk MoS2/MoSe2 powders and 10 mL of NMP were added to a 15 mL bottle and agitated vigorously for 30 min, then kept under sonication for 4 h by an ultrasonic cleaner with a power of 300 W to exfoliate the MoS2/MoSe2 powders. After being allowed to stand for 1 h, the top 2/3 of the obtained dispersion was put into a flask and kept under vigorous stirring at 140 °C for 6 h. The resultant suspensions were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 5 min to separate the MoS2/MoSe2 QDs and nanosheets. The MoS2/MoSe2 QD supernatants were collected and dried to 1 mg mL−1 in a vacuum.


0.5 mL of TiCl4 (room temperature) was slowly added into 2 mL of low-temperature ethanol (4 to 5 °C) with vigorous stirring in an ice water bath to prevent overheating. Then 10 mL of benzyl alcohol was added at room temperature with vigorous stirring to obtain a yellow translucent solution. The solution was sealed and placed in an oven at 85 °C for 12 hours to obtain a milky white suspension. The product TiO2 nanocrystals were then isolated by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 5 min. The isolated solid was subsequently washed three times by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 5 min by adding anhydrous ethanol for the first and second centrifugation processes, and by adding anhydrous methanol for the final time. The TiO2 nanocrystals were dispersed into anhydrous chloroform and anhydrous methanol (1:1 volume ratio) to obtain a TiO2 nanocrystal colloidal solution (∼10 mg mL−1).


The FTO-coated glass was etched with Zn powder and HCl aqueous solution to obtain the desired pattern and then cleaned using detergent, deionized water and ethanol. Then the L-TiO2 layer was deposited onto the FTO substrate by spin-coating at 2000 rpm for 30 s and subsequently annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in air. The L-TiO2:TMDC QD layer was obtained by spin-coating TiO2:TMDC QD solution with the addition of 50 μL of MoS2/MoSe2 QDs in 1 mL of TiO2 solution. The perovskite film was fabricated by a multi-step spin-coating method in ambient air by controlling the humidity at around 30%. In detail, 1 M PbBr2 solution was spin-coated on the FTO/ETL substrate at 2000 rpm for 30 s at 100 °C and then dried at 100 °C for 30 min. After that, 0.07 M CsBr methanol solution was spin-coated onto PbBr2 film at 2000 rpm for 30 s, and heated at 250 °C for 5 min. By repeating this process several times, a high-quality CsPbBr3 film was obtained. Finally, a conductive carbon electrode was coated onto the perovskite film by a blade coating method.


The morphologies were obtained with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S4800) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were characterized with a multifunctional imaging electron spectrometer (Thermo ESCALAB 250XI). The Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra were characterized using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (Metash UV-8000A). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded by an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advance). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A) under AM 1.5 G simulated solar illumination (100 mW cm−2, calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell). The Voc decay curves were measured in open-circuit mode by illuminating the device under simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2 for several seconds, and then instantaneously switching off the light. The Mott–Schottky curves were performed at a frequency of 5 kHz with an amplitude of 5 mV under dark conditions at bias voltages from 0 to 1.65 V. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a fluorescence spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm. The time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay curves were recorded with a Horiba spectrometer excited by a 500 nm laser. The stability of the solar cells was obtained by testing the J–V curves daily for the same sample stored under 80% humidity and 25 °C without encapsulation.


The highly crystallized MoS2 and MoSe2 QDs with a diameter of ∼2 nm are prepared by a liquid exfoliation-solvothermal technology, and the high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images of corresponding QDs are shown in Fig. 1a and b. Obviously, the distances between defined lattice fringes are 0.23 nm and 0.21 nm for MoS2 and MoSe2 QDs, corresponding to the (103) and (104) planes of MoS2 and MoSe2 QDs, respectively. Furthermore, the TMDC QDs are structurally uniform and polycrystalline, according to the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns in Fig. 1a and b. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the MoS2 and MoSe2 QDs (Fig. 1c) show no obvious characteristic peaks due to the strong quantum confinement and edge effects, and the QDs display good dispersion in methanol with cyan photoluminescence under 365 nm wavelength illumination (see insets in Fig. 1c). The optical bandgaps of MoS2 and MoSe2 QDs are determined to be 2.80 eV and 2.67 eV (Fig. S1), respectively. Therefore, the optical transmission (Fig. S2) is nearly unchanged when QDs are incorporated into L-TiO2 film (the HRTEM images of the obtained L-TiO2 nanocrystals are shown in Fig. S3). It should be noted that the L-TiO2:TMDC QD ETL demonstrates significantly improved light transmission in comparison to the FTO substrate owing to the uniform, compact and smooth surface of the L-TiO2 nanocrystal layer, which can be cross-checked from the top-view and cross-sectional SEM images in Fig. 1d–f. Furthermore, the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mapping images (Fig. S4 and S5) demonstrate a homogeneous distribution of MoS2 and MoSe2 QDs throughout the ETL film, which is beneficial for the charge extraction from perovskite to ETL. To ascertain whether chemical interactions exist between TiO2 and TMDC QDs, XPS spectra of Ti 2p and O 1s in L-TiO2, L-TiO2:MoS2 and L-TiO2:MoSe2 films have been further characterized, as shown in Fig. 1g, demonstrating a slight shift to higher binding energies compared to that of pristine L-TiO2. This is mainly attributed to the interaction between the surface oxygen-group of TiO2 and S or Se element of the QDs, implying that the trap states can be effectively passivated by TMDC QDs and therefore there is an increased electron mobility of L-TiO2:TMDC QD films.

The influence of TMDC QDs on the conductivity of L-TiO2 film is investigated using an FTO/L-TiO2:TMDC QDs/C architecture. Fig. 2a shows the J–V curves of L-TiO2, L-TiO2:MoS2 and L-TiO2:MoSe2 films measured at a bias voltage of 0.5 V in the dark and under illumination (AM 1.5 G). It can be seen that the conductivities of L-TiO2:MoS2 and L-TiO2:MoSe2 are higher than that of pristine L-TiO2, which can be attributed to the chemical bonding between TMDC QDs and TiO2. When illuminated under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5 G), the conductivity of L-TiO2:TMDC QD films shows a great improvement, while the conductivity of the pristine L-TiO2 film shows only a slight improvement under the same conditions. The light-induced enhancement in the conductivity of L-TiO2:TMDC QD films should be related to the filling of light-induced carriers into the electronic traps in the L-TiO2 films. The energy band distribution between TiO2 and TMDC QDs is shown in Fig. 2b, where the higher CB edges of MoS2 and MoSe2 QDs enable the electron transfer from TMDC QDs to TiO2 (Fig. S6) under light illumination. Although the electron injection and recombination dynamics are affected by the electric field and carrier lifetime, the long lifetime carriers with high-energy level in TMDC QDs could allow a large number of electrons to be rapidly injected into TiO2 before recombination. The injected electrons from TMDC QDs to TiO2 will preferentially fill the electronic traps and then cause an accumulation of free electrons at the CB of TiO2 (Fig. 2b), which can lead to an improvement in conductivity and the upward shift of the CB of the ETL (which will be further discussed in the following section).
To better understand the potential mechanism behind the conductivity enhancement, the space charge limited current (SCLC) is measured to obtain the trap-state density and carrier mobility with the electron-only devices (FTO/L-TiO2 or L-TiO2:TMDC QDs/C). As shown in Fig. 2c–e, the linear J–V relation (blue line) indicates an ohmic response at low bias. Upon increasing the voltage continuously, the trap-free region (green line) will terminate in a steeply rising current by the square law. The trap-state density (nt) is determined from the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL):
where
ε is the relative dielectric constant of TiO2 (ε = 55),ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, e is the electron charge and L is the thickness of the ETL. The electron trap-state densities in the L-TiO2 with and without TMDC QDs are calculated and summarized in Table S2, showing that the electron trap-state densities of L-TiO2:MoS2 and L-TiO2:MoSe2 are reduced from 7.27 × 1017 and 6.81 × 1017 cm−3 to 3.04 × 1017 and 2.37 × 1017 cm−3 under illumination, respectively, while the value of pristine L-TiO2 shows a negligible decrease. When operating in the trap-free region, the current of the device obeys the Mott–Gurney law:
where
Vb is the applied voltage. The electron mobility in the L-TiO2 and L-TiO2:TMDC ETLs under different conditions can be attained by fitting the Mott–Gurney law, as shown in Fig. S7 and Table S2. The results show that the electron mobilities of L-TiO2:MoS2 and L-TiO2:MoSe2 have been improved from 5.35 × 10−4 and 6.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 7.30 × 10−4 and 8.86 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 under illumination, respectively, confirming the advantages of this novel composite as an ETL to extract and transfer photogenerated carriers from the perovskite layer.

HTL-free, all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs with the structure of FTO/ETL/CsPbBr3/C have been fabricated to evaluate the promotion effect of L-TiO2:TMDC QD ETLs on photovoltaic performance. The CsPbBr3 perovskite films grown on L-TiO2:MoS2 and L-TiO2:MoSe2 ETLs are more compact than that on an L-TiO2 layer, as shown in Fig. S8, which may be attributed to the smaller surface energy with increased interface wettability for the perovskite precursor. The XRD patterns of CsPbBr3 films on different ETL surfaces reveal that the intensity of the (111) peak at 26.57° shows an obvious enhancement after the addition of TMDC QDs into the L-TiO2 layer (Fig. S9), further confirming the improved crystal quality of perovskite films grown on the surface of L-TiO2:MoS2 and L-TiO2:MoSe2 ETLs. These compact boundaries undoubtedly reduce the charge trap density in the perovskite layer for enhanced photovoltaic performance. The cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 3a) of a typical all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSC device shows a multilayered structure with a uniform L-TiO2:TMDC QD layer (about 40 nm in thickness), a CsPbBr3 perovskite (about 500 nm in thickness) and carbon electrode. Fig. 3b presents the band alignment of an all-inorganic PSC with an L-TiO2:TMDC QD ETL. The VB and CB of the L-TiO2 layer are determined to be −7.62 eV and −4.06 eV from the UV-Vis spectra and cyclic voltammetry test (Fig. S10). After the addition of TMDC QDs, the CBs of the L-TiO2:TMDC QD ETL for MoS2 and MoSe2 are slightly up-shifted owing to the increased carrier density, which will in turn reduce the energy difference between the CB of the ETL and the perovskite layer and enhance the interfacial electron extraction efficiency.
The characteristic J–V curves of all-inorganic PSCs with and without TMDC QDs in an L-TiO2 ETL are shown in Fig. 3c, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters including PCE, Voc, short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) are summarized in Table 1. The pristine FTO/L-TiO2/CsPbBr3/C device presents a PCE of 8.25% with a Voc of 1.549 V and a Jsc of 6.63 mA cm−2, which shows a comparable performance to a CsPbBr3 PSC with mesoscopic TiO2. Through the addition of TMDC QDs in the L-TiO2 ETL, the PCE of PSC using L-TiO2:MoS2 ETL increases to 9.22%, and a champion PCE as high as 10.02% with an ultrahigh Voc of 1.615 V and a Jsc of 7.88 mA cm−2 has been achieved when employing L-TiO2:MoSe2 as an ETL, which shows a better performance than a state-of-the-art CsPbBr3 PSC using other ETLs without additional interface modifications or compositional engineering for the perovskite film, as summarized in Table S1. The significant increase in Jsc and Voc is mainly due to the dramatic increase in the electron mobility of L-TiO2:TMDC QD ETLs and the reduced energy difference at the ETL/perovskite interface, which is further confirmed by the statistical distribution of Jsc and Voc for various devices (Fig. S11). Additionally, the steady-state power outputs under a bias voltage at the maximum power point (Fig. 3d) have been recorded, further ensuring the reliability of the J–V measurement. The statistical distribution of PCE for 10 individual devices demonstrates a small deviation (Fig. 3e), suggesting high reproducibility using the method reported here. Moreover, the efficiency can be further improved to 10.16% by adding a compact TiO2 layer to reduce the charge recombination (Fig. S12). Finally, the stability is evaluated under ambient conditions (80% humidity at 25 °C), as shown in Fig. 3f, where the FTO/L-TiO2:MoSe2/CsPbBr3/C device free of encapsulation retains over 90% of the initial Voc, Jsc, PCE and FF values over 10 days of storage in air. The excellent long-term stability is mainly attributed to the high phase stability of all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite and the top carbon layer which provides natural resistance against humidity and moisture.

With the aim of highlighting the carrier transfer and recombination processes in a solar cell, the Voc decay measurement is performed to study the influence of TMDC QDs in TiO2 ETLs on charge-transfer kinetics. As shown in Fig. 4a, a much longer photovoltage decay time for MoS2 and MoSe2 QDs tailored solar cells has been obtained. By plotting the time as a function of voltage, as shown in Fig. 4b, the photogenerated electron lifetime (τn) can be calculated according to the following equation:
where
kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. The calculated electron lifetime is much higher under the same voltage conditions after the addition of TMDC QDs into L-TiO2 ETLs, indicating the suppressed recombination of photogenerated electrons in the devices. The reduced interfacial recombination can be attributed to conductivity improvement in L-TiO2, which can prevent charge accumulation at the perovskite/ETL interface. The dark J–V curves also show decreased leakage current density with TMDC QDs (Fig. 4c), which cross-checks a reduction in charge carrier recombination. The reduced recombination depending on the decrease in electron traps in ETLs is beneficial for improving Voc and Jsc outputs. Mott–Schottky curves measured in the dark by performing capacitance–voltage characterization are used to better understand the charge recombination. Fig. 4d shows the Mott–Schottky curves of various devices; the slopes (dashed lines in Fig. 4d) of PSCs with TMDC QDs are larger than those without TMDC QDs. Since the interfacial charge density is inversely proportional to the slope of the Mott–Schottky curves, a larger slope for a TMDC QD tailored device refers to a lower interfacial trap density. In other words, the charge recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface is reduced after the addition of TMDC QDs in L-TiO2 ETLs, which is consistent with the Voc decay analysis. In addition, the FTO/L-TiO2:MoSe2/CsPbBr3/C device has the highest built-in potential (Vbi) of 1.302 V, indicating the largest driving force for charge extraction and transportation.

PL and TRPL measurements were performed to investigate the electron extraction ability of different ETLs. As shown in Fig. 4e, the PL spectra of FTO/L-TiO2/CsPbBr3, FTO/L-TiO2:MoS2/CsPbBr3 and FTO/L-TiO2:MoSe2/CsPbBr3 show obvious peaks at around 535 nm for CsPbBr3 perovskite and the peak intensity is significantly reduced upon the introduction of the QDs into the ETL owing to the accelerated electron extraction and suppressed radiative recombination within the perovskite film. Fig. 4f shows the TRPL decay curves of various L-TiO2/CsPbBr3 films with and without TMDC QDs. The decay curves can be fitted using a biexponential function:
I = Ae−(t−t0)/τ1 + Be−(t−t0)/τ2
where
τ1 and τ2 refer to the faster component of trap-mediated nonradiative recombination and the slower component correlated to radiative recombination, respectively. The average decay time (τave) is calculated to evaluate the electron extraction ability according to τave = (a1τ12 + a2τ22)/(a1τ1 + a2τ2), in which a1 and a2 represent the amplitudes. The corresponding parameters of τ1, τ2, and τave are summarized in Table S3. By careful calculation, the τave of CsPbBr3 on L-TiO2 ETL is 3.158 ns, while the τave of CsPbBr3 on L-TiO2:TMDC QD ETL reduces to 1.935 ns for L-TiO2:MoS2 and to 0.199 ns for L-TiO2:MoSe2, cross-checking the enhanced electron extraction ability from perovskite to ETL owing to the enhanced mobility and a better energy level alignment of the L-TiO2:TMDC QD ETL. When assembled into solar cells, the interfacial electrons can be maximally swept out, realizing the enhanced photovoltaic performance.


In summary, we have demonstrated the photoactivated electron-boosting effects of TMDC QDs in an L-TiO2 ETL for high-performance all-inorganic planar CsPbBr3 PSCs free of HTLs under solar irradiation, achieving an enhanced efficiency as high as 10.02% with an ultrahigh Voc of 1.615 V. The photo-induced electrons from TMDC QDs can fill the electron trap at L-TiO2 and improve the electron density in its CB, which would improve the conductivity and decrease the electronic trap states in ETLs to enhance the electron extraction efficiency and reduce recombination in the planar CsPbBr3 solar cells. This work demonstrates a simple and effective way to improve the electronic properties of ETLs for efficient all-inorganic planar PSCs.
