A series of regioregular head-to-tail oligo(3-hexylthiophene)-functionalized dicyano-ethylene substituted quinacridone derivatives DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) were designed and synthesized. These linear π-conjugated donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) molecules with different length of the oligothiophene chain have been achieved in good yields via iterative iodination and Suzuki cross-coupling reactions followed by Knoevenagel condensations. Their photophysical and electrochemical properties, as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, were systematically investigated. The compounds of DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) with an intense absorption range from 350–750 nm, suitable LUMO levels at around −4.0 eV and considerable film formation properties, were suitable for application in organic solar cells (OSCs) as acceptors. The organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell based on the blend film of P3HT/DCN-T2-QA (1:1, w/w) (P3HT = poly(3-hexylthiophene)) showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.51% under the illumination of AM.1.5, 100 mW cm−2. Compared with P3HT/PCBM (PCBM = [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester), the blend film of P3HT/DCN-T2-QA displayed a stronger response to the solar spectrum in the long wavelength range from 665–750 nm.

The π-conjugated organic semiconductors have attracted tremendous interest due to the fact that they can be employed as active layers to fabricate high performance optoelectronic devices. Among various π-conjugated small and macro-molecular systems, the oligomers and polymers based on thiophene and its derivatives have attracted increasing attention as they are promising candidates for applications in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field-effect transistors, and especially organic solar cells (OSCs). By virtue of high electron-richness, well-defined structure and good solubility, oligothiophenes were employed as donors for the design and construction of optical and electronic materials. The development of π-conjugated donor–acceptor systems composed of oligothiophene (donor) and electro-deficient molecule (acceptor) has provided an efficient approach to generate high performance organic electronic materials. The properties (such as photophysical properties, aggregated structures, energy levels, mobility and so on) of the donor–acceptor systems functionalized by oligothiophene could be regulated by altering the length of the oligothiophene chain. Certain oligothiophene–acceptor functional molecules (such as the derivatives of perylene diimide, truxene, diketopyrrolopyrrole) have been previously reported. These compounds with intense absorption in the visible light wavelength region, good solubility and moderate carrier mobility, have been used to fabricate organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. However, most of oligothiophene-functionalized compounds were p-type semiconductors and employed as donors, only very few of them were n-type semiconductors and used as acceptors in OSCs.

Quinacridone (QA) and its derivatives have been widely used as organic pigments. They have also been used as active layers to fabricate photovoltaic cells and organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs). Some QA derivatives have been designed and synthesized by our group and their supramolecular assembly, photoluminescent, electroluminescent, and polymorphic properties have been closely studied. Recently, we have focused on developing novel non-fullerene-based electron acceptors by modifying QA derivatives for application in OSCs. DCN-QA (Chart 1) in which the oxygen atoms have been substituted by strongly electron-withdrawing dicyano-ethylene groups, possessed strong absorption and moderate electron mobility. The organic BHJ solar cells based on the blend film of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as donor and DCN-8CQA as acceptor have been fabricated and characterized.
In order to achieve stronger absorption, high solubility and nanoscale bicontinuous phase separation structures of the blend films, regioregular head-to-tail oligo(3-hexylthiophene)s were introduced to the DCN-QA core in the this study. The compounds DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) were synthesized by iterative iodination and Suzuki cross-coupling reactions followed by Knoevenagel condensations. Their photophysical and electrochemical properties, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were investigated. The absorption spectra of DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) were obviously increased in intensity and red shifted to a longer wavelength region upon increasing the number of hexylthiophene units, while the LUMO levels remained unchanged (at about −4.0 eV). The mixture of P3HT and DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) exhibited good film formation property and P3HT/DCN-T2-QA blend films exhibited typical phase separation characteristics, which were suitable to fabricate organic BHJ solar cells.

The step-by-step synthetic strategy was adopted to synthesis regioregular head-to-tail oligo(3-hexylthiophene)-functionalized compounds with high purity. Compounds DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) were synthesized with good yields by repeated iodination and Suzuki cross-coupling reactions followed by Knoevenagel condensations (Scheme 1). The compound 1 was synthesized based on the previously reported procedure, and then iodinated by KI/KIO3 in acetic acid to afford 2 with a yield of 81%. The diiodoquinacridone 2 reacted with thiophene boronic ester 3 through a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction to generate 4 with a yield of 82%. The homo-coupled product of thiophene boronic ester 3, 3,3′-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiophene, was easily removed. Through the application of alternating iodination and Suzuki cross-coupling reactions, the thiophene chains were gradually increased and compounds 6 and 8 were obtained in good yields. At last, compounds 4, 6 and 8 with different lengths of oligothiophene chains condensed with dicyanomethane under TiCl4 catalysis to afford the target products DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) with desired yields at around 70%.

Considering the advantage of iodide's solubility and higher activity, we have employed iodination rather than bromination to increase the thiophene unit by Suzuki cross-coupling reactions. All three iodides 2, 5 and 7 were easily purified by recrystallization. The effect of the reaction media (THF/Na2CO3, DME/NaHCO3, toluene/TBAB/K2CO3, TBAB = tetrabutyl ammonium bromide) on the Suzuki reactions has also been investigated. Due to the fact that compound 2 can only be dissolved in THF, THF/Na2CO3 reaction media was employed to synthesize 4 and offered an acceptable yield of 82%. Although alternative reaction media were available for the syntheses of compound 4, the yields were low. The toluene/TBAB/K2CO3 system was employed to synthesize compounds 6 and 8 with high yields above 90%. Since TBAB could form a rational microscale phase separation reaction environment, the toluene/TBAB/K2CO3 system enabled the reaction reagents and catalyst to completely mix and come into contact. In addition, the higher reaction temperature and more strongly basic conditions provided by toluene/K2CO3 promoted faster and complete Suzuki cross-coupling reactions. The iodination and Suzuki cross-coupling reactions offered ideal yields, moreover the initiators and the resulting iodo-compounds possessed obviously different solubilities. Therefore, the final products have been successfully synthesized with high regularity and good yields. The compounds DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) with abundant alkyl chain substituent groups displayed high solubility in common solvents, such as CHCl3, THF, toluene and o-dichlorobenzene, which were favorable for the solution fabrication process of OSCs.

Fig. 1 illustrates the 1H NMR spectra of the DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) samples (8 × 10−3 mol L−1 in CDCl3). The four peaks (a–d) in the low field were assigned to the protons on the DCN-QA core, and the peaks in the high field were attributed to the protons of thiophenes based on the analyses of chemical shifts, integrated areas and coupling constants. The 1H NMR spectra indicated that the compounds were pure head-to-tail regioregular isomers. Upon increasing the length of the hexylthiophene chain, the proton signals of the e and f moved to the lower field, suggesting that the π-conjugated system of the compounds extended gradually.

The UV-visible absorption spectra and the data of compounds DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) in dilute solutions and solid thin films are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. Fig. 2a presents the UV-visible absorption spectra of DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) in dilute dichloromethane solutions with concentrations of 5 × 10−5 mol L−1. All the compounds display intensive absorption bands in the range 350–700 nm, which are attributed to the π → π* transition of the conjugated backbones. Upon increasing the length of the oilgothiophene chain, the absorption intensity at around 375 nm rose gradually. The absorption spectra of DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) solutions show low energy bands at 651, 656 and 657 nm, respectively. Fig. 2b illustrates the UV-visible absorption spectra of DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) solid thin films. All of the three compounds exhibit a strong absorption from 350–750 nm. Compared with DCN-8CQA, DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) present red-shifted absorption features. In the long wavelength region, the absorption maxima of DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) solid thin films localized at 677, 689 and 694 nm, which were obviously red-shifted compared with their solution absorption spectra. The absorption edges of DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) films are approximately 744, 753 and 765 nm, corresponding to the optical band gaps (Egopt) of 1.67, 1.65 and 1.62 eV, respectively. The absorption properties of DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) suggest that upon increasing the number of thiophene units, the conjugated degree of DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) has been extended, which can contribute to enhancing the absorption of the blend films P3HT:DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) and extending their response to solar spectrum.

The electrochemical properties of DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The electrochemical data are summarized in Table 1. The compounds DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) and DCN-8CQA display quasi-reversible reduction peaks in the CV diagrams (Fig. 3), which are important for the compounds as acceptors. The reduction onset potentials Eonset,red of the compounds are located at around −1.13 V (vs. Fc/Fc+), which have been employed to estimate the LUMO energy levels (about −4.0 eV), according to the following equation: ELUMO = −(Eonset,red + 5.1) (eV). The LUMOs of DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) are lower than that of P3HT (LUMO = −3.2 eV). Therefore, the photo-induced charge transfer from P3HT (donor) to DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) (acceptor) should be likely, which is a critical step for the generation of photocurrent in OSCs. The oxidation processes of DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) are irreversible (Fig. S1, see Supporting Information) and the oxidation onset potentials Eonset,ox (0.69 V for DCN-8CQA), 0.48 V for DCN-T1-QA, 0.27 V for DCN-T2-QA and 0.19 V for DCN-T3-QA) obviously rose along with the increase of thiophenes. The HOMO levels were estimated based on the oxidation onset potentials.


To further understand the electronic structures of DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3), DFT calculations were carried out. The HOMO and LUMO plots of these compounds are shown in Fig. 4 and the energy levels are summarized in Table 1. For DCN-T1-QA, the HOMO is mainly donated by the π-orbitals of thiophene units and DCN-QA core, while for DCN-T2-QA and DCN-T3-QA, the HOMOs are dominated by the π-orbitals of conjugated oligothiophenes. The LUMOs of these compounds are all composed of the π*-orbitals of the DCN-QA core. The calculated HOMO levels obviously improve along with the increassing number of thiophenes, and the calculated LUMO levels change slightly, which are consistent with the electrochemical experiment results.


Solution processed BHJ solar cells were fabricated with P3HT and DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) as the electron donor and acceptor, respectively. The device structure was [ITO/PEDOT:PSS (20 nm)/P3HT:DCN-Tn-QA (110 nm)/LiF (0.5 nm)/Al (100 nm)], in which the active layers P3HT and DCN-Tn-QA were spin-coated from the mixture solution. For comparison, the device with the blend film of P3HT and PCBM (PCBM = [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) as the active layer was also fabricated. Based on the process optimization, the mixing solvent of o-dichlorobenzene/chloroform (1:1, v/v) and ratio of donor/acceptor (1:1, w/w) were employed to prepare the devices. The devices were annealed at 60 °C for 10 min (Table S1, Table S2 and Table S3 in Supporting Information). Fig. 5 shows the typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves for the devices under AM 1.5 G simulated solar illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 at ambient atmosphere conditions. The device performances, including short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are summarized in Table 2. The best performance of the device has been achieved using DCN-T2-QA (Jsc = 2.80 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.46 V, FF = 40% and PCE = 0.51%) as the acceptor. The BHJ solar cells with P3HT/DCN-T1-QA and P3HT/DCN-T3-QA as acceptor displayed lower PCE. For the three devices, the open circuit voltages (Voc) are almost the same owing to the similar LUMO levels of DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3). The performance of P3HT/DCN-T2-QA based device (Jsc = 1.52 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.54 V, FF = 29% and PCE = 0.24%) without annealing treatment was poorer compared with the devices annealed at 60 °C for 10 min. Therefore, the annealing process is important for the enhancement of device performance.

In order to investigate the morphology and the phase separation of the devices, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterizations of the P3HT/DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) blend films have been performed. The films were prepared according to the solar cell device fabrication process without the deposition of LiF and Al metal layers. As shown in Fig. 6a and b, the blend films are not smooth enough and the root-mean-squared (RMS) surface roughness values are 10.7 nm for P3HT/DCN-T1-QA, 9.58 nm for P3HT/DCN-T2-QA and 8.55 nm for P3HT/DCN-T3-QA, respectively, which decrease along with the increase of thiophenes. The topography images of P3HT/DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) suggested that the P3HT/DCN-T2-QA film exhibited larger scale phase separation than P3HT/DCN-T1-QA and P3HT/DCN-T3-QA films. To check the phase separation properties of the P3HT/DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) films, Young's modulus mode characterizations of the AFM, which can measure the local elasticity of microregions in the films, have been performed. The phases composed of small molecules DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) and polymer P3HT should display different Young's moduli. Therefore the Young's modulus mode characterizations can provide definite phase separation information. The Young's modulus AFM images (Fig. 6c) of P3HT/DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) films clearly show that the P3HT/DCN-T2-QA blend film exhibited a larger phase separation compared with P3HT/DCN-T1-QA and P3HT/DCN-T3-QA films. The average domain sizes are 26.2 nm for DCN-T1-QA, 34.3 nm for DCN-T2-QA and 21.0 nm for DCN-T3-QA, respectively. The relatively higher PCE of the P3HT/DCN-T2-QA based cell may be attributed to the remarkable phase separation property of P3HT/DCN-T2-QA film. The AFM studies indicate the aggregated structures of DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) are oligothiophene chain length dependent.
The compounds DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) were found to have the solubility of about 20 mg mL−1 for DCN-T1-QA, 100 mg mL−1 for DCN-T2-QA and 100 mg mL−1 for DCN-T3-QA in the mixed chloroform/dichlorobenzene (1:1, v/v) solution. Although pure DCN-T2-QA and DCN-T3-QA displayed similar solubility in the mixed chloroform/dichlorobenzene solvent, the P3HT/DCN-T2-QA mixture could be more easily and quickly dissolved in chloroform/dichlorobenzene compared with P3HT/DCN-T3-QA. The difference in solubility could result in the different aggregation states in solution and different self-assembly processes during the film formation process, leading to a variation of photovoltaic properties. We tentatively attribute the different phase separation properties of P3HT/DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) to their different solubilities. Recently, solubility-controlled structural ordering and phase separation of conjugated polymers has been reported. It has been documented that some polymer semiconductor films, which are prepared from different solvents, showed different phase separation and photovoltaic properties. However, the mechanism of the phenomena in this study remains poorly understood at this stage.
To further investigate the OPV performances of these acceptors with intense absorption, the EQE spectrum of DCN-T2-QA blend with P3HT was measured (Fig. 7a). The EQE is about 10% within the range 400–600 nm, which corresponds to the absorption of P3HT. The EQE between 650–750 nm corresponding to the absorption of DCN-T2-QA suggests that the absorption of the acceptor contributed to the photocurrent. The absorption spectrum of the blend films of P3HT/DCN-T2-QA is shown in Fig. 7b. Compared with P3HT, the blend films exhibited stronger absorption in the region 300–450 nm and at around 700 nm. Therefore, extending the device's response to the solar spectrum by introducing acceptor materials with good absorption properties should be able to extend the device absorption by a small amount into the red. For the P3HT/DCN-T2-QA based device, the response to the solar spectrum has been extended beyond 650 nm and the absorption spectrum of P3HT/DCN-T2-QA was red shifted by 100 nm compared with that of P3HT/PCBM. Although the PCE of P3HT/DCN-T2-QA was lower than that of the reference device based on P3HT/PCBM (PCE = 2.75%), the performance of the devices with DCN-T2-QA as acceptor may be improved by optimizing the solvent system and modifying the device fabrication process.

In conclusion, three regioregular head-to-tail oligo(3-hexylthiophene)-functionalized dicyano-ethylene substituted quinacridone derivatives DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) have been designed and synthesized by using a step-by-step procedure, iterative iodination and Suzuki cross-coupling reactions, followed by Knoevenagel condensations with good yields. The DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) molecules displayed good solution process and film formation properties. The AFM characterization revealed that the P3HT/DCN-T2-QA blend film had typical phase separation features. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the OSC with the P3HT/DCN-T2-QA blend film as the active layer reached 0.51% under the illumination of AM.1.5 (100 mW cm−2) and the device displayed a response to the solar spectrum beyond 650 nm. The results demonstrated that replacing traditional fullerenes with novel acceptors, which possess intense absorption properties in the near-infrared wavelength region, could extend the device absorption limit. Further studies on the device optimization and the modification of DCN-Tn-QA (n = 1–3) molecular structure are currently underway.



1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were measured on Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer and Varian Mercury 300 MHz spectrometer with tetramethylsilane or resided solvent peak as the internal standard. Mass spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu AXIMA-CFR MALDI-TOF or ITQ 1100 (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed on a Vario Micro (Elementar) spectrometer. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a UV-2550 UV-vis spectrophotometer (SHIMAZU). Cyclic voltammetries were performed on a BAS 100 W instrument with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. A three-electrode configuration was employed for the measurement: a platinum electrode as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. A 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF) in CH2Cl2 was used as the supporting electrolyte. The J–V and EQE characteristics of all devices were measured on a Sciencetech (Canada) SSO-5 K solar spectrum simulated and device measurement system. The simulated solar light was calibrated to match 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G level by a standard monocrystalline silicon solar cell. All devices were measured under ambient conditions. The I–V measurement software was programmed by National Instrument (NI) Labview 6.5 and QE was calculated directly by the software received from SCI-NCETECH. AFM (by Burker Dimension ICON) was carried out directly on the surface of the fabricated devices in the PeakForce QNM mode. The AFM images and RMS values were drawn and calculated by the software NanoScope Analysis.


All BHJ solar cells were fabricated on glass substrates pre-coated with indium tin oxide (ITO) modified by a PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVPAI 4083) layer. The ITO glass substrates were sequentially cleaned with toluene, acetone, detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol and subsequently dried under IR radiation. Then, the ITO glass substrates were spin-coated (4000 rpm, 60 s) with a PEDOT:PSS layer with thickness of about 20 nm and dried for 1 h at 120 °C in air. The solution for the active layer was prepared by dissolving P3HT (15 mg) and DCN-Tn-QA (15 mg) in the chloroform (0.75 mL)/o-dichlorobenzene (0.75 mL) mixed solvent and stirred overnight. The P3HT/DCN-Tn-QA solution was spin-cast at 1600 rpm on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. The optimized thickness of the active layer was 110 (± 5) nm for P3HT:DCN-Tn-QA blend film. The LiF (0.5 nm) and Al metal (100 nm) layers were subsequently deposited on the active layer under vacuum (5 × 10−4 Pa). Finally, the devices were removed into a nitrogen glove-box and annealed on a hotplate at 60 °C for 10 min. After annealing, the samples were put on the heat plate and cooled to room temperature before performance measurements were made. The active area of each device was 2.5 × 2 mm2. The reference device [ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/P3HT:PCBM (110 nm)/LiF (0.5 nm)/Al (100 nm)] was fabricated according to the process described for the fabrication of [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:DCN-Tn-QA/LiF/Al]. P3HT (30 mg) and PCBM (30 mg) were dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene (2 mL) and the solution was stirred overnight. The active layer was formed by spin-coating (700 rpm, 60 s) the P3HT:PCBM solution on the PEDOT:PSS layer.


Pd(PPh3)4 and TiCl4 were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and other starting materials were common commercial grade and used as received. Tetrahydrofuran (THF), toluene, pyridine and dichloromethane were dried with standard methods. P3HT (region-regularity: 98.5%; weight-average molecular weight Mw: about 50000 g mol−1) and PCBM were purchased from NiChem, Co. and used as received.


The ground state geometries were fully optimized by the DFT method with the Becke three-parameter hybrid exchange and the Lee–Yang–Parr correlation functional (B3LYP) and 6-31G* basis set using the Gaussian 03 software package.


The compound was synthesized according to the reported procedure.1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.78 (s, 2H), 8.58 (dd, J = 8.1 Hz, J = 1.8 Hz, 2H), 7.80–7.73 (m, 2H), 7.53 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 2H), 7.28 (t, J = 7.8 Hz, 2H), 4.52 (t, J = 8.1 Hz, 4H), 2.06–1.96 (m, 4H), 1.67–1.57 (m, 4H), 1.52–1.28 (m, 16H), 0.90 (t, J = 6.6 Hz, 6H).


Potassium iodide (1.2 equivalents) and potassium iodate (1.2 equivalents) were added to a solution of quinacridone derivative (1 equivalent) in acetic acid at 90 °C. The mixture was heated at 90 °C for several hours and the iodinated product precipitated. After cooling down to the room temperature, the iodinated product was filtrated out, and washed successively with acetic acid and aqueous solution of sodium bisulfate. Finally, the crude product was purified by recrystallization.


To a two-neck flask, iodide (2, 5 or 7) (1 equivalent), boronic ester 3 (1.2 equivalents), refreshed solvent and an aqueous solution of base was added. The mixture was degassed by a repeated procedure of freeze-pump-thaw and then Pd(PPh3)4 (0.05 equivalents) was added. The mixture was refluxed for several hours under nitrogen atmosphere, and then was poured into water (20 mL) and extracted three times with ethyl acetate (30 × 3 mL).
