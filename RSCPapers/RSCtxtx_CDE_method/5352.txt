Two kinds of push–pull structured (D–π–A) Zn(II)–porphyrin dyes with bulky fluorenyl substituted electron donor moieties were designed and synthesized for use as sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). A high solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 8.46% was achieved with a short circuit current (Jsc) of 15.39 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.74 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.74 for the 2,4-ZnP-CN-COOH dye with HC-A1, which is a multi-functional co-adsorbent previously developed by our group, under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G simulated light.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been widely regarded as next-generation photovoltaics for providing electricity at lower expense and with more versatility. Although an overall light-to-electricity energy conversion efficiency of above 11% has been established with ruthenium-based sensitizers, the limited resources and the environmental issues concerning ruthenium usage make it necessary to seek alternative dyes. Porphyrins are one of the most widely studied sensitizers for DSSCs because of their strongly absorbing Soret bands (400–450 nm) and moderately absorbing Q-bands (550–600 nm). Nevertheless, tetraphenylporphyrin-based sensitizers typically have admittedly moderate cell performance compared to ruthenium polypyridyl complexes. Imahori and co-workers have reported that this occurs mainly due to the insufficient light-harvesting ability of the typical porphyrins used in optimized cells, especially at around 500 nm and at wavelengths beyond 600 nm, so that broadening and red-shifting of Soret and Q-bands together with an enhancement of the Q-band relative to the Soret band in porphyrins are straightforward approaches for increasing their efficiency as sensitizers in DSSCs. As demonstrated for other sensitizers in DSSCs, the introduction of both an electron-donating substituent and an electron-withdrawing substituent including an anchoring group to a core with a π-system is also appealing for the modulation of the light-harvesting properties of sensitizers. In fact, the co-sensitization of a push–pull porphyrin sensitizer (YD2-o-C8) with an organic dye (Y123) using a cobalt-based electrolyte attained a power conversion efficiency of 12.3%. Our previously reported porphyrin sensitizer, 2Flu-ZnP-CN-COOH, also demonstrated that broad absorption bands and easy intra-molecular charge separation can be achieved by the effective D–π–A structure, introducing a cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group linked through a phenylene bridge to the porphyrin dye, which eventually improved the good cell performance of 7.22%. In this study, we report the further design of two Zn(II)–porphyrin sensitizers (2,4-ZnP-CN-COOH and HexO-ZnP-CN-COOH, Fig. 1) based on the structure of 2Flu-ZnP-CN-COOH but with a bulky alkoxy group in order to efficiently retard charge recombination. The detailed synthetic procedure and characterization are shown in the ESI.

The UV-visible absorption and steady-state fluorescence spectra of 2,4-ZnP-CN-COOH and HexO-ZnP-CN-COOH in THF solution (Fig. 2) and adsorbed onto the TiO2 film (3 μm, see ESI, Fig. S1) were measured. The peak positions and molar absorption coefficients (ε) of the Soret and Q-bands as well as the wavelengths for the emission maxima are listed in Table 1. The Soret and Q-bands of two porphyrin sensitizers became broader and were shifted toward longer wavelengths due to the directly connected chemical structure between the electron-rich N atom and the porphyrin unit, which is consistent with our previous report. The absorptions at 800 nm for the dyes adsorbed onto a TiO2 film are not consistent with the IPCE spectrum. These might be attributed to absorption of light by the dye cation due to the introduction of the diarylamino groups to the porphyrin. Usually, the Zn(II)–porphyrin derivatives exhibit two typical emission bands corresponding to Q(0–0) and Q(0–1), respectively. But in this case, such a “Mirror-image rule” is not observed from their emission. We assume that this may result from the overlap of two emission bands due to their broadness from the strongly possible CT character of the dye, resulting in a broad featureless emission. The zero–zero excitation energies (E0–0) were determined to be 1.90 eV for 2,4-ZnP-CN-COOH and 1.89 eV for HexO-ZnP-CN-COOH, respectively, through the intersection of the normalized absorption and emission spectra (Fig. 2). The oxidation potentials of porphyrins were measured by cyclic voltammetry (see Fig. S2, ESI) and are also summarized in Table 1. The injection potential (ES+/S*) was calculated by subtracting the excitation energy (E0–0) from the first oxidation potential (ES+/S) of the sensitizer. The derived ES+/S* values of both porphyrin dyes (−1.05 V vs. NHE for 2,4-ZnP-CN-COOH and −1.07 V vs. NHE for HexO-ZnP-CN-COOH) are all more negative than the conduction band edge (−0.50 V vs. NHE) of TiO2, indicating that the driving force is appropriate for electron injection from the excited state of the dye into the conduction band (CB) of TiO2. As the HOMO levels are more positive than the oxidation potential for the I−/I3− redox couple (+0.40 V vs. NHE), the energy levels of both porphyrin dyes (0.85 V vs. NHE for 2,4-ZnP-CN-COOH and 0.82 V vs. NHE for HexO-ZnP-CN-COOH) are all thermodynamically favorable for effective regeneration of the dye in a DSSC system. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra and the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs incorporated with porphyrins are shown in Fig. 3 and 4, respectively. The relevant parameters are also listed in Table 1. The detailed cell fabrication procedure is presented in the ESI. The photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs fabricated with HexO-ZnP-CN-COOH containing an alkoxy substituted donor moiety was measured with a short circuit current (Jsc) of 10.36 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.60 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.73 and an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 4.53%, which is slightly higher than that of 2Flu-ZnP-CN-COOH containing no alkoxy group on the donor moiety (Jsc = 9.673 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.58 V, FF = 0.71, η = 3.95%). Furthermore, the overall conversion efficiency of the DSSCs fabricated with 2,4-ZnP-CN-COOH containing bulky alkoxy-substituted donor moieties was enhanced up to 4.88% with Jsc of 10.92 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.63 V, FF = 0.71. The bulky alkoxy groups in the electron donating group can prevent the approach of the electrolyte to the TiO2 surface; this decreases the I3− concentration in the vicinity of TiO2, resulting in improved Voc of the DSSC. On the other hand, devices based on the porphyrin–HC-A system showed a different phenomenon. The Voc of HexO-ZnP-CN-COOH (0.69 V) was still slightly higher than that of 2Flu-ZnP-CN-COOH (0.67 V), but Jsc was lower. This might be the result of the reduced molar extinction coefficient by introducing an alkoxy group directly to the fluorene donor moiety (see Table 1). Likewise, the same trend was observed from the device based on the 2,4-ZnP-CN-COOH–HC-A1 system. The molar extinction coefficient of 2,4-ZnP-CN-COOH improved by extending the aromatic unit to the fluorene donor moiety and a high solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 8.46% was achieved with a rapidly enhanced Jsc of 15.39 mA cm−2 as well as Voc of 0.74 V, which resulted from the efficiently retarded charge recombination. This result is consistent with our previous reports that both Jsc and Voc could be dramatically enhanced by the co-adsorption of the multi-functional co-adsorbent HC-A1 with the porphyrin dye, due to the efficient retardation of charge recombination arising from the prevention of π–π stacking and light harvesting in shorter wavelength regions. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the IPCE spectrum of the 2,4-ZnP-CN-COOH-based cell with co-adsorbent HC-A1 showed an onset as long as 750 nm and steeply reached a plateau value greater than 70% from around 520 nm until 410 nm, demonstrating efficient light harvesting in the visible region. In particular, the dramatically increased IPCE value of the DSSCs based on the porphyrin dye–HC-A1 system compared to that with dye alone can be explained by the prevention of dye aggregation. Thus, the IPCE values of the DSSCs fabricated with HC-A1 as the co-absorbent compared to each dye alone increased over the entire spectral range. The higher IPCE values obtained for DSSC devices with the co-absorbent indicate an increased electron lifetime within the cell, due to the decreased interaction between the electrolyte and the TiO2 as well as the increased molar extinction coefficient of the 2,4-ZnP-CN-COOH dye.

We carried out density-functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the structures and charge transfer properties by employing the PBEPBE/6-31G(d) calculation in the Gaussian 09 program (Fig. 5). Structure optimization was performed with GGA-PBE using VASP. The frontier molecular orbitals of 2,4-ZnP-CN-COOH and HexO-ZnP-CN-COOH showed a very similar distribution. The LUMO molecular orbitals of both porphyrins were mainly distributed over the cyano-acrylic acid substituted phenyl moiety and HOMO molecular orbitals were distributed over the donor moiety, which is responsible for the charge transfer. These conditions indicate that the LUMO levels of all porphyrins should be capable of injecting electrons into the CB of the TiO2 photoanode.
To further clarify the effect of the chemical structure of porphyrin dyes on the J–V characteristics, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured under dark conditions (Fig. S5 and S6, Tables S1 and S2, ESI). The transmission line equivalent circuit was used to fit the experimental data of all of the samples. Rs is the series resistance accounting for the transport resistance of the TCO and the electrolyte. Cμ, Rt and Rct are the chemical capacitance, electron transport resistance through the TiO2 film and the charge recombination resistance at the dye–TiO2–electrolyte interface, respectively. The larger semicircle at intermediate frequency regions represents the interfacial charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the dye–TiO2–electrolyte interface. The fitted Rct values of 2,4-ZnP-CN-COOH-based devices (144.6 Ω for 2,4-ZnP-CN-COOH–HC-A1) were much higher than those of HexO-ZnP-CN-COOH-based devices (68.1 Ω for HexO-ZnP-CN-COOH–HC-A1) which was consistent with the sequence of open circuit voltage values in the devices. In particular, the dramatically increased Voc value of the DSSCs based on 2,4-ZnP-CN-COOH–HC-A1 compared to that of HexO-ZnP-CN-COOH–HC-A1 can be explained by the fact that a smaller Rct value means that electron recombination from the CB to the electrolyte occurs more easily, thus resulting in lower both Jsc and Voc. We assume that the introduction of a bulky alkoxy group-substituted fluorene-derived electron donor moiety to the porphyrin dye and co-adsorption of HC-A1 may have a synergistic effect, resulting in a greater passivation of the TiO2 surface, which is associated with efficiently retarded charge recombination as well as effective breakup of dye aggregation.
In summary, two kinds of push–pull structured (D–π–A) Zn(II)–porphyrin sensitizers containing bulky alkoxy group-substituted fluorene-derived electron donor moieties for efficient retardation of charge recombination were newly designed and synthesized. The LUMO energy levels of both porphyrins were all more negative than the conduction band edge of TiO2, indicating that the driving force is appropriate for electron injection from the excited state of the dye into the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 and the HOMO levels are all thermodynamically favorable for effective regeneration of the dye in a DSSC system. The results of the calculations also clearly demonstrate that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of two porphyrins showed a very similar distribution, indicating that the LUMO levels of all porphyrins should be capable of injecting electrons into the CB of the TiO2 photoanode. The J–V characteristics and IPCE response were further enhanced by the introduction of a bulky alkoxy group to the donor moiety of porphyrin dyes and co-adsorption of HC-A1, making these sensitizers promising candidates for highly efficient DSSCs. EIS measurements also showed that charge recombination at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface can be efficiently suppressed by the introduction of a bulky alkoxy group as well as co-adsorption of HC-A1, thus resulting in higher Voc. Also, further optimization with a cobalt complex-based electrolyte to obtain maximized solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency is being conducted.
