In this paper, one conjugated polymer, with asymmetric side chains of alkoxy-substituted difluorobenzene and alkoxy-substituted monochlorobenzene based on quinoxaline (Qx) as the electron acceptor unit, and alkylthiothiophene benzodithiophene (BDTTS) as the electron donor unit, namely PBDTTS-2FClQx, was synthesized and employed as an electron donor polymer with a compatible dual-acceptor strategy to fabricate ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). As a consequence, the optimized ternary OSC (PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6:PC71BM = 1:0.9:0.1) exhibited a significantly enhanced PCE of 13.59% with simultaneously increased fundamental parameters, showing about 9.5% improvement compared to the control binary PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6 (12.41%). Moreover, the optimal ternary device showed much better stability. The excellent results demonstrate that this Qx type copolymer bearing asymmetric side-chains could be a promising donor material for constructing efficient and stable OSCs.

As an emerging clean energy technology, organic solar cells (OSCs) have received extensive attention in recent years owing to their advantages such as translucency, flexibility and compatibility with large-scale fabrication. Up to now, with the development in ingenious molecular design of active layer materials, device engineering and small molecular acceptors (SMAs), significant progress in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has achieved 19% in single-junction OSCs and 20% in tandem OSCs. However, compared to non-fullerene small molecular electron acceptor based OSCs, the high efficiency copolymer based donor materials for OSCs still lag far behind. Therefore, developing simple and efficient copolymer donor materials is crucial for the commercial application of OSCs.

Among all the promising skeletons of electron acceptor units in copolymers, donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers with quinoxaline (Qx) as the acceptor (A) unit are regarded as among the promising and high-performance frameworks to construct various medium and low bandgap copolymers. This is due to their unique properties, such as low-cost, strong quinoid form, weak electron-deficient characteristics and multiple substitution positions, allowing the grafting of different side chains to finely tune the physicochemical properties of the Qx-based D–A copolymer applied in the OSCs. So far in the literature, by combining the side-chain engineering strategy for Qx groups, various studies have focused on the design and synthesis of symmetric Qx-based copolymers, and this kind of Qx-type copolymer can obtain a PCE up to 9% in fullerene-based OSCs and over 17% in nonfullerene related OSCs. As one of the halogens, the chlorine atom shows great potential in reducing the HOMO energy level and regulating the morphology. However, due to the large radius of the chlorine atom, in the main chain it will cause steric hindrance and affect the molecular planarity. By introducing fluorine atoms into the side chain, the molecular energy levels can be adjusted slightly and accurately, and the molecular planarity can be guaranteed to the greatest extent. An asymmetric molecular structure can increase the molecular dipole moment and dielectric constant, reduce the exciton binding energy, enhance exciton dissociation, promote phase separation, and form a good mutual transmission network structure, which is conducive to improving the device Jsc. More recently, in employing a symmetric chloride atom side-chain engineered Qx-based copolymer PBDTTS-2ClQx, an impressive PCE of 16.1% was obtained by our group. However, so far, only a few studies have been conducted on Qx-based D–A copolymers with asymmetric side chains, and these achieved a PCE of 9.0% in fullerene OSCs and a higher PCE of 14.0% in non-fullerene OSCs. Clearly, this kind of asymmetric side chain engineered Qx-based D–A copolymer demonstrate great potential application. Compared with copolymers with symmetric structures, copolymers with asymmetric structures are expected to more accurately control steric hindrance and conjugation lengths, contributing to the formation of better bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphologies. That is to say, an asymmetric molecular construction not only retains the advantages of symmetric materials, but also exhibits stronger intermolecular binding energies and larger molecular dipole moments, which are beneficial to improve the fill factor (FF) in photovoltaic devices. Therefore, combining the strategies of a halobenzene side chain and an asymmetric structure, we designed a copolymer with an asymmetric halobenzene side chain, hoping to further improve the fill factor of the material and obtain better device efficiency (Fig. 1).
In this work, a novel narrow bandgap Qx type copolymer, comprising an electron-donating alkylthiothiophene benzodithiophene (BDTTS) as a donor monomer and a Qx monomer with asymmetric side-chains as the acceptor unit, namely PDTTS-2FClQx, was designed and synthesized along with a commercial narrow bandgap non-fullerene small molecular acceptor Y6 and typical fullerene acceptor PC71BM, used in the active layer to fabricate binary and ternary OSCs, as also displayed in Fig. 2b. The OSCs used the device configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/copolymer:acceptors/PDIN (5 nm)/Ag (100 nm) (Fig. 2a). Without any additional processing, the optimized ternary device based on PBDTTS-2FQx:Y6:PC71BM (1:0.9:0.1) delivered a significantly enhanced PCE of 13.59% with simultaneously improved fundamental parameters, while the PBDTTS-2FQx:Y6 (1:1)-based ternary OSCs exhibited a PCE of 12.41%. The results demonstrate that this narrow bandgap Qx with asymmetric side-chains is a promising electron accepting unit in constructing efficient copolymers for OSCs.

The synthetic route of the monomers and the target copolymer PBDTTS-2FClQx are summarized in Scheme S1 and all the detailed synthetic methods are described in the Experimental section in the ESI. All the intermediate monomers and copolymer PBDTTS-2FClQx were characterized through 1H NMR, 13C NMR, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-fight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and elemental analysis, as shown in Fig. S1–S12, (see ESI). The obtained copolymer PBDTTS-2FClQx had good solubility and was easily dissolved in common organic solvents, such as CHCl3, PhMe, CB, etc. The molecular weight of the PBDTTS-2FClQx was determined by high temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and mass-average molecular weight (Mw) of the PBDTTS-2FClQx were 157.3 kDa and 358.6 kDa, respectively, with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.28. Furthermore, as displayed in Fig. S13a, a decomposition temperature (Td) of 324.0 °C for PBDTTS-TClQx was achieved at 5% weight loss, which is suitable for device applications in OSCs. The related data is summarized in Table 1. In addition, as shown in Fig. S13b, neither endothermic nor exothermic reactions were observed from 40 to 275 °C in the differential scan calorimetry (DSC) curve, implying that the copolymer shows amorphous characteristics.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of PBDTTS-2FClQx in dilute chloroform (CF) solution (10−5 M) and as a neat film, along with those of the applied acceptor Y6 and PC71BM films are shown in Fig. 2c, and the corresponding optical data are listed in Table 1. From the spectra curves, it can be observed that the PBDTTS-2FClQx exhibits intense absorption in the range of 300–800 nm, similar in both states. Compared with its absorption in solution, the absorption spectrum in a thin film shows a red-shift of 6 nm, which may be assigned to stronger stacking in the film state. Meanwhile, the absorption in the short-wavelength regions of 300–400 nm and 400–500 nm is possibly due to the π–π* and n–π* transitions, respectively, and another low-lying absorption band from 500 to 750 nm could be due to the strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction between the BDTTS donor unit and Qx acceptor unit. The molar absorption coefficient of PBDTTS-2FClQx is 1.75 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 641 nm. The optical band gap (Eoptg) of the PBDTTS-2FClQx was estimated to be 1.66 eV from the absorption edge (λonset = 747 nm) of the absorption spectrum in the state of the film, and the relevant data are shown in Table 1. As also shown in Fig. 2c, the PC71BM has a strong absorption at 300–550 nm, which can make up for the absorption of PBDTTS-2FClQx and Y6 in the ultraviolet region, thereby broadening the absorption and utilization ability of the organic active layer for solar energy, which is beneficial for ternary solar cells to obtain a higher Jsc. Meanwhile, the aggregation of the PBDTTS-2FClQx was corroborated in depth via temperature-dependent absorptions (from 30 °C to 80 °C) in the chlorobenzene (CB) solution (Fig. S14a). With an increase in the solution temperature, all the absorption curves of the ICT peaks exhibited a blue shift and their IA0–1/IA0–0 ratios initially decreased, demonstrating that the PBDTTS-2FClQx presents various molecular stacking behaviors with minor modifications. The UV-Vis spectra of PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6 binary hybrid films at different PC71BM contents (0%, 10%, 100%) were also tested. As shown in Fig. 2d, when the content of PC71BM was 10%, the absorption peak of the PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6:PC71BM (1:0.9:0.1, w:w) blend film at 300–500 nm was stronger than that of the binary component. Moreover, compared with the binary absorption, the ternary absorption is red-shifted by about 10 nm, which is beneficial to the improvement of the Jsc of the corresponding device.


The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PBDTTS-2FClQx can be examined using cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. S14b, the onset potential for oxidation (Eox) is determined to be 1.31 eV, and according to the empirical formulae EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.16) eV and ELUMO = EHOMO + Eoptg eV, the HOMO/LUMO levels of PBDTTS-2FClQx are determined to be −5.47/−3.81 eV, respectively, and the detailed data are shown in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2e, the HOMO/LUMO energy level difference between PBDTTS-2FClQx and Y6 is large enough to achieve sufficient driving force to push the efficient dissociation of excitons. Meanwhile, the optimized molecular geometries, frontier orbitals and electron distribution of PBDTTS-2FClQx were estimated using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G*(d,p) level. To simplify the assessment, long alkyl chains were replaced with methyl groups. As shown in Fig. 15S, the PBDTTS-2FClQx has a highly planar main chain structure, which is favorable for intramolecular charge transport and intermolecular π–π stacking. The intramolecular dihedral angles of the PBDTTS-2FClQx are 10.4°, 20.3°, 15.6° and 5.1°, respectively, and the smaller dihedral angles confirm its good planarity. The estimated HOMO and LUMO levels of PBDTTS-2FClQx are −2.78 and −4.99 eV, respectively (Table 1), which is consistent with the results obtained from CV measurements for the symmetric side chain Qx copolymers (PBDTTS-2FQx and PBDTTS-2ClQx) we previously reported.


Considering the photoelectric properties of PBDTTS-2FClQx, ternary OSCs were fabricated with a traditional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6:PC71BM (110 nm)/PDIN (5 nm)/Ag (100 nm), as shown in Fig. 2a. In this study, the weight ratio of PBDTTS-2FClQx to acceptor (Y6:PC71BM) was maintained constant at 1.0:(1 − x):x (wt/wt) in all active layers, and the content of PC71BM in the acceptors was varied (0 wt%, 5 wt%, 10 wt%, 20 wt%, 30 wt%). For binary OSCs, the optimized conditions for fabricating cells use a chloroform (CF) solution (total concentration of 16.0 mg mL−1). Meanwhile, for the ternary OSCs with PC71BM as a solid additive, an optimized device performance was achieved with a ratio of 1.0:0.9:0.1 (PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6:PC71BM). The optimal results are summarized in Table 2. The optimal current–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 are displayed in Fig. 3a and b, respectively, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The binary OSCs based on PBDTTS-2FClQx:PC71BM based binary cells exhibited a PCE of 4.37% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.951 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 10.61 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 43.33%, which is similar to the data reported in the literature. The PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6 binary device exhibited a relative high PCE of 12.41% with a lower Voc of 0.851 V, but a much higher Jsc of 22.54 mA cm−2 and a FF of 64.68%. While the composition of the active layer was PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6:PC71BM (1.0:0.9:0.1), the optimal OSCs showed an improved PCE of 13.59% (Voc of 0.855 V, Jsc of 23.09 mA cm−2 and FF of 68.86%). Clearly, compared with both binary devices, the ternary device exhibited an enhanced Jsc and FF, which is not only because of the broadened adsorption but also the simultaneous purer pristine phases and more balanced charge transport mobility. In addition, as shown in Table S1 and Fig. S16a, when the content of PC71BM was gradually increased, the Voc parameters of the device also increased gradually. Meanwhile, the Jsc parameters of ternary photovoltaic cells increased from 22.54 mA cm−2 to 23.09 mA cm−2 at 10 wt% PC71BM content. However, when the PC71BM content increases, the Jsc parameter starts to decrease again. Meanwhile, the related FF values exhibited similar trends to Jsc. The acceptor Y6 used in this work is different from that in our previously reported work. The corresponding current density voltage (J–V) characteristics achieved are shown in Fig. S20. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the corresponding devices are shown in Fig. 3b. In comparison with the PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6 (1:1) binary device, the EQE spectral response of the PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6:PC71BM (1.0:0.9:0.1) ternary device showed a definite increase in the range of 430–480 nm, which is almost consistent with the UV absorption spectrum of the ternary hybrid film (Fig. 2d), and is consistent with the measured Jsc parameters of the device. In addition, the maximum EQE value of the ternary film is 83.2%, which is higher than that of the binary film (80.4%). The integrated currents calculated from the EQE spectra are 22.46 mA cm−2 and 21.97 mA cm−2 for the PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6:PC71BM (1.0:0.9:0.1) and PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6 (1:1) based devices, respectively, which are close to the 23.09 mA cm−2 and 22.54 mA cm−2 obtained from the corresponding J–V curves. The error value is within 5%.

We have tested the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the PBDTTS-2FQx:Y6 and PBDTTS-2ClQx:Y6 devices, which are symmetric halogen side chain Qx based copolymers. PBDTTS-2FQx:Y6 based PSCs show a low EQE response, generally less than 70%. PBDTTS-2ClQx:Y6-based PSCs have a wide electronic response at 300–900 nm. In the range of 430 nm to 840 nm, the response exceeds 70% and reaches a maximum value of 76.6% at 620 nm. The EQE curve is shown in Fig. S20.
To compare the device data, we replaced the symmetrical halogen side chain of the Qx copolymer with the asymmetrical halogen side chain. We found that the maximum EQE response was greatly improved, indicating that the devices with the asymmetrical halogen side chain Qx copolymer PBDTTS-2FClQx (EQEmax = 83.2%) can more effectively capture photons and collect charges than those with the symmetrical halogen side chain Qx copolymers PBDTTS-FQx and PBDTTS-2ClQx (EQEmax = 76.6%). In addition, due to the energy level regulation of fluorine and chlorine, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels are raised, thus increasing the short circuit current (Voc) and the fill factor (FF). This shows that the asymmetric molecular structure can increase the molecular dipole moment and dielectric constant, reduce the exciton binding energy, enhance exciton dissociation, promote phase separation, form a good mutual transmission network structure, and help to improve the FF of the devices.

To obtain a better understanding of the working mechanism of the OSCs, photoluminescence (PL) tests of the pure PBDTTS-2FClQx film, pure Y6 film, PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6 film and PC71BM with 10 wt% content in PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6 blend film were performed. As shown in Fig. S16b, when PBDTTS-2FClQx was excited at 630 nm, there was almost complete quenching in both the blend films; the PL intensity of PBDTTS-2FClQx was almost quenched in the PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6 1.0:1.0 and PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6:PC71BM (1.0:0.9:0.1) blend films. Moreover, when Y6 was excited at 820 nm, similar quenching phenomena were also observed. Compared with the PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6 1.0:1.0 blend film, much more quenching happened in the PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6:PC71BM blend film (Fig. 3c). Clearly, the higher quenching phenomenon leads to a better energy transfer process in the ternary active layer with 10 wt% PC71BM content, which is responsible for the higher Jsc and EQE values in the corresponding devices.


To further study the carrier transport properties in binary and ternary devices, the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on effective voltage (Veff) was determined, as shown in Fig. 3d. Jph is determined as Jph = JL − JD, in which JL and JD are the current densities measured under illumination and in dark conditions, respectively. Meanwhile, Veff is defined as V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage bias. When Veff is at a relatively high value (Veff ≥ 2.0 V in this case), assuming that the electrode at this time can extract all free charge carriers generated by photogenerated excitons, the saturation value (Jsat) is defined as the current density when Veff ≥ 2.0 V on average. Furthermore, the exciton dissociation efficiency (Pdiss) can be estimated by Pdiss = Jph/Jsat. After calculation, the Jsat values of the PBDTTS-2FClQx:PC71BM, PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6 and optimized PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6:PC71BM based devices are 12.13 mA cm−2, 22.97 mA cm−2 and 23.25 mA cm−2, respectively. The corresponding Pdiss values for the charge collection efficiency are 87.4%, 98.1% and 99.3%, respectively. Clearly, the optimized ternary PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6:PC71BM (1.0:0.9:0.1) based OSCs exhibit a higher Pdiss value, which further indicates that the third component PC71BM in the blend can facilitate the exciton dissociation and charge extraction process, thus resulting in higher Jsc values.

As shown in Fig. S19, under the optimal Jsc condition, the exciton dissociation efficiency (Pdiss) of the symmetrical halogen side chain Qx copolymer PBDTTS-2FQx and PBDTTS-2ClQx devices are 96.3% and 97.0%, respectively. These results show that the devices based on the asymmetric halogen side chain PBDTTS-2FClQx exhibit better exciton dissociation and charge collection characteristics.
To further explore the mechanism of charge recombination inside the device, an in-depth study on the relationship between Jsc and the light intensity (Plight) can be carried out using the formula Jsc ∞ (Plight)S, where S is the exponential factor referring to the extent of bimolecular recombination. When Jsc exhibits a linear dependence on Plight with S equal to 1, the bimolecular recombination should be completely suppressed in the device. As plotted in Fig. 3e, the fitted S values for the PBDTTS-2FClQx:PC71BM based binary, PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6 based binary and optimized ternary (PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6:PC71BM = 1.0:0.9:0.1) devices are 98.2%, 98.7% and 99.3%, respectively. Clearly, the obtained S value of the optimized ternary device is much closer to 1, implying that bimolecular recombination is reduced by including a small amount of PC71BM. The relationship between Voc and Plight could be defined by the formula Voc ∞ n(KT/q)ln(Plight), which is used to determine whether trap-assisted recombination or bimolecular recombination is the dominant recombination mechanism. Vocversus Plight plots of the related devices are shown in Fig. 3f. The decrease of Voc with ln(Plight) with a slope of KT/q implies that bimolecular recombination is dominant, whereas trap-assisted recombination dominates when the slope is 2KT/q (where K, T and q represent the Boltzmann constant, Kelvin temperature and elementary charge, respectively). As seen from Fig. 3f, compared with the binary components based on PBDTTS-2FClQx:PC71BM (1.295KT/q) and PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6 (1.089KT/q), the optimal ternary device based on PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6:PC71BM (1.0:0.9:0.1) exhibits a smaller value of 1.055KT/q. The obtained results demonstrate that trap density and trap-assisted recombination could be inhibited in the optimized ternary device, which is advantageous for enhancing its Jsc and the FF value.

To explore the charge transport performances of the different devices, the space charge limited current (SCLC) method was employed to measure the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) in the constructed hole-only and electron-only devices. The corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. S17 and the related values are summarized in Table 2. The hole/electron mobilities (μh/μe) of the PBDTTS-2FClQx:PC71BM and PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6 were 9.35 × 10−5/5.30 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.06 × 10−4/1.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, with μe/μh values of 0.56 and 0.85, respectively. For the optical PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6:PC71BM, μh and μe were higher at 2.22 × 10−4 and 2.07 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, with a more balanced μh/μe value of 0.93, demonstrating that the introduction of the third component PC71BM can effectively enhance the charge transport efficiency and reduce the recombination. The high and balanced mobility of the ternary device is matched well with the high Jsc and FF in the above mentioned results.

As shown in Fig. S21, for the Qx based copolymers with symmetrical halogen side chains, the hole/electron mobilities (μh/μe) of the PBDTTS-2FQx:Y6 and PBDTTS-2ClQx:Y6 were 8.31 × 10−5/3.37 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.58 × 10−4/1.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, with μe/μh values of 4.05 and 0.50. Clearly, devices based on PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6 have more balanced electron/hole mobility, which is conducive to improving the FF and PCE of the devices.

To further understand the effect of different PC71BM components on the blend film surface morphology, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was carried out to probe the morphology of the active layer.Fig. 4(a–c), (d–f) and (g–i) shown the AFM height maps, phase maps and 3D stereo maps of the different active layers, respectively. As we can see clearly in the AFM height images in Fig. 4a–c, root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of 1.44, 1.35 and 1.22 nm are observed in the PBDTTS-2FClQx:PC71BM, PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6 and optical PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6:PC71BM blend films, respectively. Meanwhile, compared with both binary blend films, a more ordered morphology and better miscibility is observed in the ternary blend film of PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6:PC71BM, which is more beneficial to promote exciton dissociation and charge transport, and thereby improves the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding device.

We also used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to analyze the morphology of the active layer. Fig. 5(a–c) show TEM diagrams of the PBDTTS-2FClQx:PC71BM, PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6 and PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6:PC71BM blend membranes, respectively. In ternary blend films, we observed a more suitable phase separation of the donor and acceptor, which promoted exciton dissociation and charge transport, leading to higher Jsc and FF.
We then used GI-XRD and in-plane X-ray diffraction (IP-XRD) measurements to study polymer stacking modes in the spin-coated pristine and blend films. As shown in Fig. 5d, the GI-XRD patterns exhibit (100) and (010) diffractions at 2θ = 7.71° and 23.72° for the pristine PBDTTS-2FClQx film. Both the PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6 and PBDTTS-2FClQx:PC71BM in the blend films exhibit strong p–p stacking in the out-of-plane direction, with (010) diffractions at 2θ = 22.82° and 2θ = 22.16°, and corresponding π–π stacking distances of 3.89 Å and 4.00 Å, respectively. However, the PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6:PC71BM GI-XRD patterns exhibit (010) diffractions at 2θ = 23.05°, indicating the minimum π–π stacking distance (3.85 Å), which leads to good charge transport in the active layers. This is consistent with the high electron/hole mobilities of the PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6:PC71BM active layer.
The morphology of the active layer is connected with the miscibility of the donors and acceptors, which can be further explored by estimating the surface free energy of the active layers employed in this system by contact angle measurements. Generally, similar surface energies of the donor and acceptor can result in good morphology of the active layers. As shown in Fig. 6 and Table S2, the contact angles of PBDTTS-2FClQx, Y6 and PC71BM are calculated to be 90.5°, 84.3° and 91.8° for deionized water (H2O), and 48.0°, 41.0° and 23.2° for diiodomethane (CH2I2) on the corresponding thin films. The estimated surface energies of PBDTTS-2FClQx, Y6 and PC71BM are 36.21 mN m−1, 39.25 mN m−1 and 45.36 mN m−1, respectively. The value obtained by subtracting the surface energy values of each two materials is the difference value for PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6, PBDTTS-2FClQx:PC71BM, and Y6:PC71BM were 3.04, 9.15 and 6.11, respectively. Clearly, a much smaller value of the surface energy was observed for PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6, implying that Y6 and PBDTTS-2FClQx are highly compatible.

The stability of the OSCs is an important issue for practical applications. The storage stability of the binary and ternary devices without encapsulation under a nitrogen atmosphere were tested, as shown in Fig. S18. After storage in a nitrogen filled glove box for 50 days, the PCEs of the PBDTTS-2FClQx:PC71BM and PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6 based binary devices were reduced by nearly 80% and 30%, respectively, while the PCE of the optimized ternary device only decayed by 15%, and still maintained 85% of its original value. These results demonstrated that the ternary device exhibits a much better storage stability.


In summary, a novel narrow bandgap Qx type copolymer comprising asymmetric halogen atom side-chains, PBDTTS-2FClQx, was synthesized and employed in OSCs. PBDTTS-2FClQx exhibited good solubility in common organic solvents, a broad absorption from 300 to 770 nm, and a low-lying HOMO energy level of −5.47 eV. The binary blend OSCs achieved PCEs of only 4.37% and 12.41%, respectively, while the optimized ternary OSCs (PBDTTS-2FClQx:Y6:PC71BM = 1:0.9:0.1) exhibited a significantly improved PCE of 13.59%, as a result of simultaneously improved Voc, Jsc and FF parameters. This enhancement can be ascribed to the synergistic optimized photon harvesting, improved charge and energy channels, increased exciton dissociation and charge collection, and higher and more balanced charge mobility in the optimal ternary device. Furthermore, the dual-acceptors fixed the morphology of the ternary blend film, thus improving the storage stability of the ternary OSCs. Overall, this simple Qx type copolymer with an asymmetric framework should be a potential candidate for efficient and stable organic photovoltaic materials.
