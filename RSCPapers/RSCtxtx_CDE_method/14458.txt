A new 4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bisoxazole (NBO)-based polymer, namely poly{4,8-bis(2-ethylhexoxy)-benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b′]difunan-2,6-diyl-alt-(4, 4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bisoxazole)} (PBDFNBO), was synthesized by a Stille coupling polymerization reaction. The copolymer was found to be soluble in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and chlorobenzene with excellent film forming properties. The thermal, optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties of PBDFNBO were investigated in detail. Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) results indicate that the copolymer possesses good thermal stability. The PBDFNBO film exhibits a narrow absorption band around 300–598 nm (with an optical bandgap of 2.07 eV). The maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on PBDFNBO/PC71BM (1:2, w/w) reaches 5.0% with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 9.9 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.93 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.53 under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination.

Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) are a promising photovoltaic technology for clean and renewable energy sources due to their superior properties such as mechanical flexibility, light weight, visible transparency, and large-area manufacturing compatibility. π-Conjugated polymers have been widely used in organic electronics due to their advantages in solution processability as well as their good electrical properties in spite of the low crystallinity compared with π-conjugated molecular systems. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are composed of a photoactive blend layer of a conjugated polymer donor and a soluble fullerene derivative acceptor sandwiched between an indium-tin oxide (ITO) positive electrode and a low work function metal negative electrode.

Up to now, polymer electron donors have been widely used in solar cells. Among them, the dithiazole(DTz)-based polymer exhibited relatively high-efficiency photovoltaic performance. For example, the DTz-based polymer reported by Li's group achieved a power conversion efficiency of more than 5%. But compared with other high-efficiency electron acceptors, DTz still has more space for improvement. Because oxygen atoms have a smaller atomic radius and stronger electron-withdrawing ability than sulfur atoms, this paper adopts the strategy of replacing sulfur atoms with oxygen atoms, synthesizes a dioxazole (NBO) electron acceptor unit, and applies it for the first time in the field of polymer solar cells. Compared with the thiazole ring, the oxazole ring has a stronger electron-withdrawing ability and structural planarity, and polymerizes with other electron donors to obtain a wider absorption spectrum and higher carrier mobility, thereby improving power conversion efficiency.
In this work, we synthesized a new NBO electron acceptor unit, using Stille coupling reaction polymerization to obtain PBDFNBO, and the synthesis route is simple and low cost. It was applied to the field of polymer solar cells, and achieved a power conversion efficiency of 5.0% without any post-treatment. Although the absorption spectrum of PBDFNBO is not wide and the PCE is relatively low, we believe that by changing the electron acceptor (such as ITIC) and further optimization of the device process, the photovoltaic performance will be significantly improved.

Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(Pd(PPh3)4), 1-bromoundecan-2-one, Cupric chloride and n-butyllithium were obtained from Alfa Asia Chemical Co, and they were used without further purification. Toluene was dried over sodium and freshly distilled prior to use. Other reagents and solvents were purchased commercially as analytical-grade quality and used without further purification. 1-(Formyloxy)-undecanone (1), 4-nonyloxazole (2), and 4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bisoxazole (NBO) were synthesized according to the reported literature.



1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker AV-400 spectrometer, with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal reference, and chemical shifts were recorded in ppm. The molecular weight and polydispersity of PBDFNBO were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis with polystyrene as standard (Waters 515 HPLC pump, a Waters 2414 differential refractometer, and three Waters Styragel columns (HT2, HT3, and HT4)) using tetrahydrofuran (HPLC grade) as the eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 at 35 °C. Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a Shimadzu DTG-60 thermogravimetric analyzer with a heating rate of 10 K min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a SHIMADZU UV-2450 spectrophotometer. For the solid state measurements, polymer solution in chloroform was drop-cast on quartz plates. The optical bandgap was calculated from the onset of the absorption band. The cyclic voltammograms were recorded with a computer controlled CHE-660E electrochemical workstation using polymer film on a platinum disk as the working electrode, platinum wire as the counter electrode and Ag/Ag+ (0.1 M) as the reference electrode in an anhydrous and argon-saturated solution of 0.1 M of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile. Electrochemical onsets were determined at the position where the current starts to differ from the baseline.


The solar cells were fabricated in the configuration of the traditional sandwich structure with an indium tin oxide (ITO) glass positive electrode and a metal negative electrode. Patterned ITO glass with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω □−1 was purchased from CSG HOLDING Co. LTD. (China). The ITO glass was cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol, and then treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Ultraviolet Ozone Cleaner, Jelight Company, USA) for 20 min. Then PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)) (Baytron P 4083, Germany) was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter and spin coated at 3000 rpm for 60 s on the ITO electrode. Subsequently, the PEDOT:PSS film was baked at 120 °C for 30 min in the air to give a thin film with a thickness of 30 nm. A blend of PBDFNBO and PC71BM was dissolved in ortho-dichlorobenzene, and spin-cast at 2000 rpm for 60 s onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. The substrates were then dried at 120 °C for 15 min. The thickness of the photoactive layer is in the range of 100–120 nm measured by an Ambios Technology XP-2 profilometer. A bilayer cathode consisting of calcium (∼20 nm) capped with aluminium (∼60 nm) was thermally evaporated under a shadow mask at a base pressure of ca. 10−5 Pa. The device active area of the PSCs is 4 mm2. Device characterization was carried out under AM 1.5G irradiation with the intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Oriel 67005, 500 W) calibrated by a standard silicon cell. J–V curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter.


The synthetic route of PBDFNBO is shown in Scheme 1. The detailed synthetic process is as follows.


NBO (1.55 g, 4.0 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of glacial acetic acid (25 mL) and chloroform (25 mL) under nitrogen in the dark, and then N-bromosuccinimide (1.78 g, 10.0 mmol) was added in portions, and the mixture was stirred at 60 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solution was poured into cold water. The resulting mixture was extracted with dichloromethane. The extract was washed with plenty of brine and water, successively, and dried over magnesium sulfate. The resulting solid was purified by column chromatography using dichloromethane:petroleum ether =1:10 as the eluent, and a yellow solid was obtained (0.55 g, 25%).


1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): 2.59 (4H, t), 1.72 (4H, m), 1.44–1.13 (24H, m), 0.89 (6H, t).
GC-Ms: m/z =546.


2Br-NBO (109.2 mg, 0.2 mmol), compound 3 (154.4 mg, 0.2 mmol) and 15 mL of dry toluene were put into a two-necked flask. The solution was flushed with N2 for 10 min, then Pd(PPh3)4 (12 mg) was added into the flask. The solution was flushed with N2 again for 20 min. The oil bath was heated to 110 °C carefully, and the reactant was stirred for 48 h at this temperature under a N2 atmosphere. Then the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the polymer was precipitated by the addition of 200 mL of methanol and filtered through a Soxhlet thimble, which was then subjected to Soxhlet extractions with methanol, hexanes and chloroform. The polymer was recovered as a solid from the chloroform fraction by rotary evaporation. Finally, the red-dark solid was obtained (101.6 mg, yield: 61%).


1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): 7.41 (2H, s), 4.06 (4H, m), 2.62 (4H, t), 1.76–1.24 (46H, m), 0.87 (18H, t).

The synthesis of the monomers and the corresponding polymer is outlined in Scheme 1. Compound 1, compound 2, and NBO were prepared according to the literature. 1-Bromoundecan-2-one was used as an original material for the preparation of compound 1; 1 was in turn converted to 2 using NH4OAc, and NBO was obtained via Ullmann reaction. PBDFNBO was synthesized with 5,5′-dibromo-4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bisoxazole (2Br-NBO) and compound 3 using Stille type cross-coupling polymerization. The synthesized polymer was purified by continuous extraction with methanol, hexane, and chloroform using Soxhlet apparatus, and the chloroform part was recovered. The chemical structure of PBDFNBO was verified by 1H NMR and elemental analysis. The gel permeation chromatography result (using polystyrene standards and chloroform as the eluent) showed that the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) value was 32.9 KDa with polydispersity of around 1.9. The obtained copolymer from the chloroform part was readily soluble in common organic solvents such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene and chloroform. It possesses excellent film-forming ability. Table 1 lists the polymerization results including molecular weight, PDI, yield, and thermal data of the polymer.

Thermal stability of the polymer is important for device fabrication. Fig. 1(a) displays the TGA thermogram of PBDFNBO. The TGA analysis reveals that, under the protection of an inert atmosphere, the onset points of the weight loss (5%) of PBDFNBO are ca. 422 °C. The differential scanning calorimetry (DCS) curve shows that the glass transition temperature (Tg) of PBDFNBO is about 100 °C. Good thermal stability of the resulting copolymer prevents the deformation of the copolymer morphology and the degradation of the polymeric active layer under applied electric fields.


The photo-physical characteristic of the polymer PBDFNBO was investigated by ultraviolet and visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra and photoluminescence (PL) spectra in a solid film spinning-coated on a quartz substrate. Fig. 2 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectrum and PL spectrum of the polymer film. PBDFNBO shows an absorption peak at ca. 464 nm. The peak of 464 nm could be ascribed to the π–π* transition absorption of the conjugated backbone. The absorption edge of the PBDFNBO film is at ca. 598 nm, corresponding to an optical band-gap (Eoptg) of 2.07 eV. Compared with dithiazole-based polymers, PBDFNBO has similar optical band-gap. PBDFNBO is a typical wide band gap polymer, which can make up for the shortcomings of insufficient absorption of the narrow band gap organic small molecule non-fullerene acceptor in the 300–600 nm range. Therefore, PBDFNBO has certain potential in the field of non-fullerene polymer solar cells. The PL spectrum of thin solid films of PBDFNBO and PBDFNBO:PC71BM is shown in Fig. 2, and the emission peak at 588 nm, and the appearance of PL of PBDFNBO could indicate a longer lifetime of the excited state and more possibility for the photo-induced charge transfer from PBDFNBO to PC71BM before the photo-excitations decay via intra-chain relaxation. As PBDFNBO:PC71BM film, the electrons in the single excited state of PBDFNBO can not only emit fluorescence, but also transfer the charge to the excited state of the acceptor PC71BM, which causes the fluorescence emission of PBDFNBO to be quenched. Based on PBDFNBO:PC71BM film, the fluorescence quenching rate is 60%. Based on the above analysis, it is shown that the PBDFNBO:PC71BM films have higher charge transfer and exciton dissociation efficiency.


In addition to the absorption properties, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the polymers are key parameters that affect the overall performance of the photovoltaic device through the efficiency of charge separation and the open-circuit voltage (Voc). The electrochemical behavior of PBDFNBO was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The resulting cyclic voltammogram is given in Fig. 3. It can be seen that PBDFNBO exhibits irreversible p-doping/dedoping processes over a positive potential range. The onset oxidation potential is 0.37 V for PBDFNBO. From the onset oxidation potential of PBDFNBO, we calculated the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer PBDFNBO according to the equations: HOMO = −e(Eoxon + 4.7) (eV); ELUMO = Eoptg + EHOMO. The HOMO and LUMO levels of PBDFNBO were estimated to be −5.07 and −3.0 eV, respectively (Fig. 4). The related CV data (Eoxon, HOMO and LUMO energy levels) are summarized in Table 2.

The current–voltage characteristics of the solar cells, under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G white light illumination, based on the three weight ratio blends of PBDFNBO/PC71BM (1:1, 1:2 and 1:3, w/w) are shown in Fig. 5. Table 3 lists the photovoltaic data obtained from the J–V curves for the devices. The bulk heterojunction PSCs were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDFNBO:PC71BM/Ca/Al, PBDFNBO was used as the electron donor and PC71BM was used as the electron acceptor. It was clearly indicated that the weight ratio of 1:2 had the best photovoltaic property, and the corresponding open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device are 0.93 V, 9.9 mA cm−2, 0.53 and 5.0%, respectively. The accuracy of the photovoltaic measurements can be confirmed by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices. Fig. 6 shows the typical EQE plots of the PSC devices fabricated under the same conditions as those for the J–V measurements. The higher values of EQE are consistent with the higher Jsc measured in the solar cells. The EQE results indicate that the photovoltaic results are reliable. The EQE values above 40% from 350 nm to 600 nm of PBDFNBO:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) led to higher Jsc up to ca. 10.1 mA cm−2. Compared with dithiazole-based polymer P1, the PCE of PBDFNBO increased by more than 2 times. The possible reason is that the oxygen atom has stronger electronegativity and smaller atomic radius than the sulfur atom, resulting in the oxazole ring having a stronger electron-withdrawing ability and structural planarity, and polymerizing with other electron donors to obtain higher carrier mobility, thereby improving short circuit current. The same conclusion can be obtained from the EQE value. The EQE value of PBDFNBO between 350 and 600 nm is around 60%, and the EQE value of P1 between 350 and 600 nm is around 40%. Obviously, PBDFNBO obtains more electrons, and led to a higher photocurrent.

In summary, a new polymer containing BDF and NBO as a conjugated bridge has been synthesized for potential application in PSCs. As demonstrated, PBDFNBO exhibits good solubility in the common solvents. The preliminary investigation on the photovoltaic device based on PBDFNBO:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) bulk heterojunction gives a PCE of 5.0%. Detailed investigations on the PBDFNBO properties and further synthesis of new NBO-based polymers are currently in progress and will be reported in due course.
