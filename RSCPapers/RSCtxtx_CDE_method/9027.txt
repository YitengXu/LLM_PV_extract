Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite absorbers in combination with electron and hole transporting selective contacts result in power conversion efficiencies of over 23% under AM 1.5 sun conditions. The advantage of perovskite solar cells is their simple fabrication through solution-processing methods either in n-i-p or p-i-n configurations. Using TiO2 or SnO2 as an electron transporting layer, a compositionally engineered perovskite as an absorber layer, and Spiro-OMeTAD as a HTM, several groups have reported over 20% efficiency. Though perovskite solar cells reached comparable efficiency to that of crystalline silicon ones, their stability remains a bottleneck for commercialization partly due to the use of doped Spiro-OMeTAD. Several organic and inorganic hole transporting materials have been explored to increase the stability and power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells. IIn this review, we analyse the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells incorporating phthalocyanine and porphyrin macrocycles as hole- and electron transporting materials. The π–π stacking orientation of these macrocycles on the perovskite surface is important in facilitating a vertical charge transport, resulting in high power conversion efficiency.

Tomás Torres

Tomás Torres is Head of the Institute for Advanced Research in Chemical Sciences (IAdChem) and Full Professor of Organic Chemistry at the Autónoma University of Madrid (UAM) and Associated Senior Scientist at the IMDEA Nanoscience. In addition to various aspects of synthetic and supramolecular chemistry, his current research interests include the preparation and study of optical properties of organic functional materials. His group that currently consists of thirty researchers is exploring several areas of basic research and applications of phthalocyanines, porphyrins and carbon nanostructures (fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, graphene), including organic, hybrid and perovskite-based solar cells, and photodynamic therapy, with a focus on nanotechnology.

Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are a new paradigm in renewable energy because their unparalleled efficiency has increased from 3.8% to 23.7% in less than 10 years. The high efficiency of perovskite solar cells is due to their excellent optoelectronic properties, which were optimized by various cations and anions with different ratios. Another advantage of perovskite solar cells is their simple fabrication through solution-processing methods, either in n-i-p or p-i-n configurations. The n-i-p configuration consists of compact TiO2 and mesoporous TiO2 layers to transport electrons from the perovskite absorber to the contact. The perovskite absorbing layer consisting of methyl ammonium lead(II) iodide (MAPbI3) is intrinsically unstable at elevated temperature due to methylammonium cation release. Therefore, compositionally engineered cations and anions are deposited using either one-step or two-step methods. The compositionally engineered [FA0.8MA0.15Cs0.05PbI(3−x)Brx] three-dimensional (3D) perovskite shows excellent absorption properties, low exciton binding energy and high charge carrier mobility (with MA = methylammonium and FA = formamidinium). Using mixed cations, mixed anions and a solvent engineering method, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 3D perovskite solar cells have reached over 23%. The performance of perovskite solar cells depends on the formation of over-layer thickness that is controlled by inverse solubility, and the solvent engineering technique. Finally, a hole transporting layer (HTL) followed by a gold contact is deposited to complete the cell. The perovskite solar cells using 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) as the hole-transporting material (HTM) are less stable compared to the poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,5,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) polymer based HTM due to doping and additives.

The performance of 3D perovskite solar cells decreases under heat and light soaking conditions due to ion migration and segregation. The other detrimental drawback of 3D perovskites is their poor moisture stability, due to the ionic nature of the materials, and their low formation energies, which make them vulnerable for water-induced hydrolysis. Though there are several approaches to stabilize the 3D perovskite, the most common one is cation tuning. The bigger cations beyond the Goldsmith tolerance limit produce low dimensional perovskites, which are very stable but have larger bandgaps and higher exciton binding energies than 3D perovskites. Nevertheless, the exceptional stability under heat and light soaking conditions of low-dimensional perovskites makes them an essential family of materials, and the prospects to integrate these exciting novel materials to protect the highly efficient 3D perovskites and, therefore, to increase their stability are enormous. Using hot casting techniques, a two-dimensional (2D) perovskite incorporated in the bulk of 3D perovskite yielded 12.5% PCE, and increased stability over 2250 hours. Also, the composition of the perovskite absorber has been optimized using a 2D perovskite, and stable performance over 12000 h without the HTM is reported. In these cells a triple layer architecture having ZrO2 as an insulating layer and conducting carbon is used both as a HTL and contact. The triple layer carbon-based PSC data demonstrate that the organic HTM in these cells is still the bottleneck for commercial applications.
Also, the TiO2 electron transporting layer (ETL) influences the stability of PSCs due to its unfavourable properties including singlet oxygen generation caused by UV light, high temperature sintering process and UV instability. Among the various device architectures, the n-i-p planar structure has attracted a lot of attention because of the low temperatures needed for the processing of the ETLs. Recently, various ETLs have been explored, and SnO2 emerged as an ideal material for perovskite solar cells, because of its higher electron mobility, low-temperature processing, and UV-stability. Using passivated SnO2 as an ETL, a compositionally engineered perovskite as an absorbing layer, and Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM, several groups have reported PCEs over 20%. A bilayer configuration involving a compact layer of TiO2 and low temperature deposited SnO2 displays better energy level alignment with the perovskite, resulting in a PCE over 22% with an open circuit voltage (VOC) close to 1.14 V, a short circuit current (JSC) of 24.78 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.78, and a negligible J–V hysteresis in the device.
To date, Spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA are the hole transporting materials of choice and routinely employed in PSCs under normal configuration (n-i-p) in order to maintain the highest efficiency. However, their challenging synthesis and prohibitively high price hinder the progress towards low-cost PSC manufacturing, and may contribute to more than 30% of the overall module price. The reason resides in the complicated multi-step synthetic procedure of Spiro-OMeTAD, together with the high-purity, sublimation-grade that is required to obtain high-performance devices. In inverted-type PSCs (p-i-n), the conventional HTL is usually the conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS but it suffers from several drawbacks. The first two concern stability issues owing to its hygroscopic and acidic nature, which may accelerate degradation of the perovskite layer and corrode the FTO glass substrate, respectively. The third one is its limited capability for blocking the backflow of electrons from the perovskite layer, thus restricting the efficiency of inverted-PSCs.
Also, the use of dopants to increase mobility is problematic, and can induce instability of the device. Furthermore, the hygroscopic nature of the additive salts such as bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) makes the HTL highly hydrophilic, showing a tendency towards chemical degradation, negatively influencing the stability of the entire device. Moreover, the additive tert-butylpyridine (TBP) has been revealed to interact with the perovskite and may dissolve it, inducing the corrosion phenomenon, and even may cause a chemical reaction with the HTM.
Another interesting class of HTMs is based on macrocycle molecules such as phthalocyanines (Pcs) and porphyrins (Pors), which are thermally and photochemically stable. The optical and electronic properties of these macrocycles can be easily adjusted by modifying the peripheral and non-peripheral substituents and the metal center. As a consequence of their preeminent role in nature, porphyrins and their analogues are customary chromophores to be employed as components of photovoltaic and artificial photosynthetic devices. For instance, ZnPors and ZnPcs have been largely used as photosensitizers for DSSCs, and particularly, push–pull ZnPors decorated with opposite donor and acceptor/anchoring groups have shown record high conversion efficiencies of up to 13%.
In the past few years, several groups have also investigated and proved that Pcs and Pors can be successfully incorporated as the HTM in perovskite solar cells, as will be highlighted in this review.

Phthalocyanines (Pcs) are blue pigments with strong absorption features in the red/NIR region. In this regard, a key question arises: Would the light-harvesting properties of Pcs negatively affect the efficiency of PSCs? In principle, the HTM layer should be preferably colourless to avoid light absorption losses of the perovskite layer. Although their strong absorption may entail a drawback for PSC applications, the number of advantages such as versatility, robustness (thermal, chemical and solar irradiation) and low-cost of production, to name a few, make up for the absorption issue. Another advantage of Pcs is their strong tendency to aggregate through π–π stacking interactions, an inherent property that has been largely exploited for self-organization at the supramolecular level. In solid thin film device technology, the degree of aggregation of Pc molecules is known to affect drastically the crystallinity and morphology of the Pc-films, which are critical for conductivity of the active layer (and hence overall efficiency). In particular, several α- and β- substituted Pcs functionalized with terminal alkyl chains have shown the ability to form highly condensed and ordered phases in liquid crystalline films by spontaneous molecular alignment into columnar stacks, which enhances drastically the charge transport and renders them excellent organic semiconductor materials for application in thin film devices, such as organic field effect transistors (OFETs) and solar cells. Ambipolar behaviour and conductivity values as high as 1.4 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been obtained with these Pc-films. In this context, it is not surprising that Pcs show great potential to be incorporated as a hole selective layer (so far, almost exclusively as a p-type HTL) in the architecture of perovskite solar cells (meso or planar), both in normal (n-i-p) and in inverted (p–n–i) configurations. Another major purpose of introducing Pcs into these devices is to protect efficiently the perovskite layer from moisture degradation, and thus to improve long-term stability.

The Pc hole-transporting material can be included in different ways, either as a single-layer (neat/pristine, doped or composite) or integrated in a multi-junction HTL, the latter including bi-, buffer- or hybrid interfacial buffer (infiltrated HTM) layers. Another less known use of Pcs in the field of PSCs is that of chemical dopant of other HTMs or the perovskite material itself, which has been reported more recently. The synthetic versatility of these macrocycles, from both the Pc scaffold (α- and β-positions) and the metal centre, offers many possibilities to engineer new functional Pc-materials for such application:
• Tailoring the Pc macrocycle with hydrophobic groups (e.g. alkyl chains) aims to enhance the overall stability of the PSCs by protecting the perovskite layer from moisture.
• Introduction of solubilizing groups facilitates solution-processed fabrication of the Pc-selective layer (usually by spin-coating), thus reducing the cost of fabrication in comparison, for instance, with thermal vacuum deposition methods (vide infra).
• Introduction of substituents of different size (small or bulky) may change the degree of aggregation of the Pc, and thus help to control the morphology and crystallinity of the Pc-films.
• Introduction of more elaborate groups (e.g. heteroaryl or conjugated systems) modulates their optoelectronic and electrochemical properties (in addition to aggregation behaviour).
• A Pc can be metal-free (H2Pc or free-base) or metallated (MPc) with many different kinds of metal ions that can be accommodated in the central cavity of the macrocycle (Zn, Cu, Mg, Fe, Ni, Ru, Pd, Co, Pb, Ti, V, Ge), which strongly affects its intrinsic properties (topological, optical, electrochemical and energetics), as well as its aggregation behaviour.
Regarding the molecular design, a large variety of Pcs have been explored for PSC applications, which can be divided into four main classes of compounds:
• Unsubstituted Pcs (Fig. 1 and Table 1).

Unsubstituted metal-Pcs (CuPc, NiPc, PbPc, ZnPc, TiOPc and V(O)Pc; Fig. 1 and Table 1) are distinguished by (i) simplicity of synthesis and low cost of production (most of them are commercially available), (ii) insolubility or poor solubility in most common solvents, (iii) high degree of aggregation, and (iv) their ability to be sublimated. These properties have pros and cons for practical utilisation in PSCs.
In solution-processed techniques, this implies that these Pcs can be used at very low concentrations, therefore making them suitable only as dopants, but turning out to be unrealistic for the fabrication of a Pc-(HTM) single layer; for the latter case, thermal vacuum deposition (VD) is the method of choice since most of these Pcs can be sublimated. However, VD is a more complex and highly energy-consuming (hence expensive) process of fabrication, thus counter-balancing the low-cost facet of the Pc material. In turn, it presents the advantages of guaranteed high purity of the films and a precise control of the parameters of fabrication (rate of deposition, layer thickness, etc.), which hence confers high reproducibility to this method. Moreover, since no organic or toxic solvent is involved at this stage, part of the cost and environmental impact are reduced. The most important benefit is that they do not require dopants due to aggregation, which is advantageous in terms of cost and stability.
Further changes in the molecular design came with the introduction of methyl or ethyl chains in β-tetrakis-substituted Pcs (Cu-1a and Cu-2; Fig. 2 and Table 2) or β-octakis analogues (2H-1b, Zn-1b, Cu-1b and Pd-1b; Fig. 3 and Table 3). These short alkyl chains still allow use of a vacuum deposition method for the fabrication of the HTM layer, and induce important changes in the properties of the Pc-films (morphological in particular). β-tetrakis substituted Pcs with longer alkyl chains (n-propyl, n-butyl, tert-butyl) no longer allow VD but solution-processed techniques instead. A myriad of other functional groups have been reported for β-tetrakis substituted Pcs (sulfonyl, ammonium, aryl, heteroaryl; Fig. 2 and Table 2) as well as their β-octakis fully substituted versions (Fig. 3 and Table 3). To a lesser extent, the non-peripheral substitution pattern has also been envisaged for Pc-based HTMs, and as well, α-octakis (Fig. 4 and Table 4) and α-tetrakis (Fig. 5 and Table 5) substituted versions have been explored. Finally, a fourth class of Pc-HTMs having a non-symmetrical substitution pattern (AAAB-type; Fig. 6 and Table 6) has also been tested more recently in PSCs, though very few examples were reported.

CuPc, a low cost, robust and commercially available organic material, has been widely used as a vacuum processed HTM (Table 1), and several works have reported on efficient and highly stable PSCs using this material, under different configurations (meso, P and IP). In meso configuration, Yang et al. reported a PSC device using dopant-free CuPc as HTM (under nanorod-like form) and a low-temperature processed carbon cathode, achieving an excellent maximum efficiency of 16.1%, comparable with that obtained for the control device made with the conventional (doped-) Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM and Au as the back electrode. Stability tests of the Pc-based devices conducted under one sun illumination, in an ambient atmosphere, at room temperature and without encapsulation, showed excellent stability over 600 h (Fig. 7). Later, Zhao and co-workers could improve this PCE value to 16.6% for a device within the same configuration (dopant-free CuPc and carbon counter electrode), in combination with a modified protocol for the preparation of high-quality perovskite film, a combined solvent and vapour treatment. Turning to planar configurations, Ke et al. reported a fully vacuum-processed PSC using a CuPc-HTM (dopant-free) giving rise to 15.4% efficiency, though an expensive Au contact electrode and C60 HTL were used in this study. In a more recent work, Liu et al. could achieve the same efficiencies (15.4%) and excellent stability (over 1200 h; Fig. 8) using cheaper materials: a low-temperature printable carbon electrode and a planar-heterojunction TiO2/SnO2 bilayer as the ETL. CuPc has also been implemented successfully as the HTM in inverted (planar) PSCs. Two independent groups, those of Liao and Wu, have reported at the same time very similar structured inverted MAPbI3-based PSC devices using fullerene-BCP bilayers as the ETL (PCBM and C60, respectively). Two different approaches have been considered to optimize the stability and performances of these devices.

The former group used a triple-mixed cation modified perovskite (Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14) instead of MAPBI3, to achieve an improved 15.4% efficiency with respect to the CuPc/MAPBI3-based device (14.5%). The latter group inserted a thin layer of vanadium oxide (VOx) between the ITO substrate and the CuPc (herein referred as a “buffer layer”) to obtain a bi-hole layer, boosting the PCE of the modified device to 16.85% and with good moisture stability (only 10% efficiency loss after 350 hours in ambient air; Fig. 9).
The insertion of the VOx layer was found to be two-fold beneficial: (1) better charge extraction, and hence higher efficiency, was achieved owing to the alignment of the interfacial energy level with the CuPc, and (2) better stability of the device, owing to the synergic effect of the bi-HTM: the VOx inorganic material is stable and has good resistance toward corrosion, and the hydrophobic CuPc is excellent to protect the perovskite from moisture decomposition. It should also be mentioned that the fabrication of the whole device involved low-temperature processes only, thus being beneficial for large-scale production, which, moreover, allowed for the fabrication of flexible PSC devices (on PET/ITO substrates) achieving an excellent PCE of 14.4%. ZnPc, instead of CuPc, has also been envisaged, though to a lesser extent, in similarly structured PSC devices including meso (3.5%), planar (16.8%, 17.8%), and inverted planar (11.6%) configurations. Among them, Song, Dai, and co-workers reported on two successive works involving an innovative planar architecture, in which ZnPc is sandwiched between the perovskite and Spiro-OMeTAD layers of typical PSCs, acting as a buffer (or bi-layer) HTM that facilitates the hole transport between the two components and increases moisture-resistance. In the first work, a modified Nb-doped TiOx was used as an ETL, seeking to reduce electron recombination and photocurrent loss. Overall, the device incorporating the ZnPc extra layer showed improved PCE (16.8%) with respect to the control device without it (15.1%), and with high stability in ambient conditions, retaining 91% of the initial PCE after 2400 h (100 days) without encapsulation (Fig. 10a). In their second work, a long-lasting photoluminescent SAED layer was introduced between the perovskite and compact TiO2 layers (SAED = SrAl2O4 doped with Eu2+ and Dy3+). The SAED material has broad and strong absorption in the UV region, and exhibits emission in the green light region, in which the photoactive perovskite layer absorbs. The advantage is therefore two-fold: the SAED material absorbs the high-energy UV-photons inhibiting UV degradation of the device, and converts them into green photons that the perovskite can absorb, improving the photovoltaic response. Moreover, it was found that the thermal activation energy of the trap states decreased from 109 to 63 meV in the presence of this layer, which is indicative of a contribution in the reduction of the recombination process. Given its influence on the light-induced trap states, the SAED layer was proposed to be also involved in the increased rate of self-healing. As a result, the device including this material showed an improved PCE of 17.8% with respect to the one without it (16.7%), and with long-term stability (2600 h in an ambient atmosphere; Fig. 11). Apart from CuPc and ZnPc, other unsubstituted metal Pcs have also been envisaged as VD HTMs, namely PbPc, Ti(O)Pc, V(O)Pc, and NiPc, but gave low to modest results in comparison.
A step further came with the functionalization of the Pc macrocycle with short methyl or ethyl chains at the peripheral β-positions, including β-tetrakis (Cu-1a, Cu-2;Table 2) and β-octakis substitution patterns (2H-1b, Zn-1b, Cu-1b and Pd-1b;Table 3), which were also successfully implemented in PSCs as vacuum-processed HTMs.
On this line, Xu et al. reported an interesting comparative study between two β-tetraalkyl substituted Pcs (Cu-1a, R = Me and Cu-2, R = Et) and the unsubstituted CuPc as VD-HTMs in planar PSCs, which achieved maximum PCEs of 11.9%, 11.7% and 9.1%, respectively. The hole mobility values determined from the OFET-films increased in the order CuPc < Cu-2 (Et) < Cu-1a (Me) (μFET = 1.8, 3.8, and 6.1 [×10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1], respectively). On the other hand, space-charge limited current (SCLC) mobility measurements also gave the highest value for Cu-1a (μSCLCT = 19.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) but in turn that of Cu-2 (3.75 × 10−4) was found to be lower than that of CuPc (7.45 × 10−4). XRD and AFM experiments conducted on the thin films evidenced more tightly packed and ordered structures for the alkyl-substituted Pc-films. Thus, it was concluded that the presence of the alkyl substituents favours π–π stack arrangement of these macrocycles during the VD process, which was accounted for their higher hole mobility values and, accordingly, superior PCEs. The difference between Cu-1a and Cu-2 was ascribed to shorter π–π stacking distances for the former owing to the smaller size of methyl than ethyl substituents.
Along the same lines, some important insights were further provided by Xu, Fang et al. with a fully substituted analogue, the β-octamethyl copper Pc (Cu-1b). In planar PSCs, a 25% improvement in the PCE was obtained with the VD-HTM Cu-1b (15.73%) with respect to the unsubstituted one, CuPc (12.55%). As well, they found that the Cu-1b film displayed a more condensed structure and higher hole mobility than pristine CuPc by two orders of magnitude (μ = 4.79 × 10−2 and 7.25 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively), accounting for its superior efficiency. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) experiments were performed on thin film samples deposited on the FTO surface, with and without the perovskite layer. In the absence of the perovskite layer, both Pcs adopt an edge-to-face (i.e. perpendicular) orientation to the surface. However, when the perovskite is present, Cu-1b adopts a face-to-face (parallel) orientation, whereas the normal orientation of unsubstituted CuPc remains unchanged (edge-to-face). Therefore, it was unravelled that the reason behind the higher hole mobility of Cu-1b resided in the planar orientation of the π–π stacks on the perovskite surface, facilitating a vertical charge transport. Again, the PSCs made with hydrophobic HTM Cu-1b showed excellent resistance to moisture, as well as long-term stability, retaining 95% of the initial efficiencies after 2000 h in an ambient atmosphere (Fig. 12; with “CuMe2Pc” = Cu-1b).
The same collaborators further reported a palladium-Pc analogue (Pd-1b) with improved efficiency in planar PSCs with respect to Cu-1b, previously reported. In that case too, Pd-1b presented a face-to-face orientation (evidenced by GIXRD experiments). Palladium, with a heavier atom effect than copper, strengthens the spin–orbit coupling, thus enhancing the singlet-to-triplet excitons. In principle, this property should not be beneficial for photovoltaic applications since long-lived triplet carriers tend to have low mobility. Nonetheless, the Pd-1b device did not show any significant decrease in terms of conductivity, and in fact only a slightly lower value was obtained with respect to Cu-1b (3.42 × 10−2 and 4.79 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively). On the other hand, much longer carrier lifetimes for Pd-1b than Cu-1b layer (7.7 ns vs. 3.4 ns) were deduced from transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy experiments, which go together with longer diffusion length of excitons (26 nm vs. 20 nm), and hence lower charge recombination rates. Consequently, Pd-1b/PSC displayed improved PCE (16.28%) with respect to Cu-1b (15.58%), and with better moisture stability (stressed from 40% to 100% of relative humidity conditions). Under an ambient atmosphere, the Pd-1b device maintained 96% of its initial performance after 600 h (Fig. 13).
The same collaborators further reported two other octamethyl-substituted analogues as HTMs of planar PSCs, namely zinc (Zn-1b) and metal-free (2H-1b) Pcs, to shed light on the effect of the metal centre. Obviously, metal-free Pcs being pure organic materials circumvent issues encountered with the use of most of the metals (contamination, rarity and extra cost), thus holding a main advantage over their metal-Pc analogues for commercial applications. Free-base Pcs present several differences in terms of optical and electrochemical properties with respect to their metallic analogues, thus affecting their HOMO–LUMO band gap, in particular. Accordingly, 2H-1b presents a smaller band gap and less favourable alignment than Zn-1b of its energetic levels with respect to the perovskite and Au electrode. Nonetheless, the 2H-1b film displays higher hole-mobility (2.72 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) than Zn-1b (1.80 × 10−2), accounting for their differences in PCEs (15.59% vs. 14.88%). In these cases too, GIXRD experiments evidenced a face-to-face (parallel) orientation for both HTMs, responsible for their excellent conductivity. In terms of stability the 2H-1b device exhibited superior performances too, with a 2.2% decrease in the PCE after 10 days under a relative humidity of 70% (at 25 °C, and without encapsulation), compared with Zn-1a (6.4% decrease; Fig. 14 with “HMe2Pc” = 2H-1b and “ZnMe2Pc”= Zn-1b).

β-Tetrakis substituted MPcs with longer/bulkier alkyl chains (n-propyl, n-butyl, tert-butyl) have been used as solution-processed (SP) HTMs. A first remarkable example came with the β-tetrapropyl Cu-Pc (Cu-3) reported by Xu et al., used as a dopant-free HTM in planar (SnO2)-PSCs. Interestingly, GIXRD experiments also evidenced a face-to-face orientation for this SP-Pc, similar to various VD-CuPcs discussed in the previous section (substituted with shorter Me or Et chains). Excellent stability (Fig. 15) and high PCEs with an average value of 17.0 ± 0.5% (max. 17.8%) were achieved with this solution-processed and dopant-free HTM.

The longer butyl version Cu-4 (β-tetra-n-butyl-CuPc) was reported by various groups in meso-type PSCs, with efficiencies ranging from 7.3 to 15.9%. Lianos and co-workers obtained a modest PCE for the devices made solely with this Pc-HTL (7.3%), but could be significantly increased by incorporating either Al2O3 (9.7%) or graphene oxide (14.4%) buffer layers between the perovskite- and Pc-layers. The authors suggested that the presence of defects (voids) in the non-uniform and aggregated structure of the Pc-films could constitute a possible explanation for the low performances obtained with the neat HTM. The buffer layer (GO or Al2O3) should fill these voids, thus repairing the defective sites of the film. It must be remarked that additives (TBP and Li-TFSI) were incorporated in the Pc precursor solution for the fabrication of the HTL. In a later work, the same collaborators improved further the efficiency and stability (Fig. 16) of their GO(buffered)/Cu-4 PSC devices by using a modified and in situ prepared mesoporous layer (ETL contact), consisting of mesoporous TiO2 particles doped with reduced graphene oxide (RGO; 0.2 wt%), increasing significantly the efficiency up to 15.9%. This improvement was ascribed to two main factors owing to the presence of RGO in the mesoporous layer: (1) it confers higher porosity of the TiO2, thus providing a better penetration of the perovskite in it; and (2) it reduces charge recombination. The bulkier β-tetra(tert-butyl) version (Cu-5 and Zn-5) has also been largely investigated, which stands out for reduced aggregation (and hence improved solubility) with respect to Cu-4 (with linear n-butyl chains). On this line, an interesting comparative study between β-tetra(n-butyl) (Cu-4) and β-tetra(tert-butyl) (Cu-5) CuPcs was reported by the same collaborators, to shed light on the importance of π–π stacking aggregation of Pc toward molecular ordering and efficiency. Cu-4 displayed stronger aggregation than Cu-5 as supported by UV-vis spectra in solution. GIXRD analysis evidenced, as expected, higher crystallinity for Cu-4 than Cu-5 films, together with a more compact structure. Drastic differences in carrier mobility values were found for the Pc-based OFET films, that of Cu-4 being almost 40 times higher than that of Cu-5 (5.0 × 10−5 and 1.3 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1), which was explained in terms of a better packing and stronger π–π interaction of the former. Consequently, the device made with HTM Cu-4 achieved larger JSC, which mostly accounts for its superior PCE (8.5% vs. 6.5%). Seo, Seak, and co-workers have successively used Cu-5 as the HTM in meso-type PSC devices with improved efficiencies of up to 15.2% and 18.8%, using a double mixed cation (FA/MA) perovskite. In the later work, stability tests were also performed on the Cu-5/PSC devices, which maintained 97% of their initial efficiencies for more than 1000 h at 85 °C and under 25–30% of relative humidity (Fig. 17; with “CuPc” = Cu-5).
At the same time, the groups of Duong and Catchpole improved further this PCE up to 20.1%, using a modified quadruple-cation (Cs/Rb/FA/MA) mixed perovskite, together with a thermal post-treatment during the fabrication of the HTM. Interestingly, and in agreement with the observations and conclusions reported by Lianos and co-workers for the analogue Cu-4 discussed previously (vide infra), many cracks were observed on the Pc-film surface, exposing the perovskite to a direct contact with the Au electrode. These defects make shunts and thus increase recombination processes at the interfaces. Fortunately, the authors discovered that these defects could be greatly reduced by a subsequent thermal post-treatment at 85 °C (optimized temperature) after deposition of the Au layer on top of it. It was proposed that the Au particles rearrange and migrate from the cracks to form much bigger particles, passivating the defects and, to a lesser extent, also act as the dopant of the HTM. It is important to remark that, in these three last works, Li-TFSI and TBP additives were also incorporated in the Pc precursor solution for the fabrication of the HTL.
In a different context, longer n-pentyl and alkoxy chains (linear n-BuO or branched 2,4-dimethyl-3-pentoxy) have been used in α-substituted Pcs Cu-18, 2H-20, and Ni-21, and although scarcely considered, very good efficiencies could be obtained with this class of Pc-HTMs in meso-type PSCs (Fig. 4, 5 and Tables 4 and 5). Importantly, these Pcs are known to present a more distorted macrocycle with respect to their β-analogues, which strongly impacts on their intrinsic properties (topological, optical, electrochemical and energetics), and importantly, also on their aggregation behaviour. Dao et al. reported on an α-octa(n-pentyl) substituted Pc (2H-20; Fig. 5 and Table 5), as a metal- and dopant-free HTM in meso-type PSCs, and in agreement with the findings of Seo, Seak, previously discussed (see above), the authors also found that thermal annealing of the Pc-films was beneficial in terms of stability and performances of the devices. By thermal-annealing under optimal conditions (130 °C, 10 min) the performances of the PSCs were greatly improved (average PCE of 10.0%, max. 12.2%) with respect to the devices without this post-treatment (average PCEs of 6.1%), which they ascribed to better charge carrier mobility. It has to be remarked that a thin layer of MoOx was deposited on top of the HTL and before Au deposition for the fabrication of the devices, and though not commented by the authors in the article, this buffer MoOx layer might play an important role in reducing recombination (see hereafter). Similarly, Sun and co-workers reported an integrated HTL based on an α-octa(n-butyloxy) substituted Pc (Ni-21) and vanadium oxide for meso-type PSCs. When the HTL was fabricated with Ni-21 solely (from 30 mg ml−1 solution) and without a dopant, a relatively poor efficiency of 10.6% was obtained. SEM images revealed, once again, incomplete coverage of the perovskite layer by the Pc film. When the concentration was increased to 50 mg ml−1, thicker films were obtained that fully covered the perovskite, but the performances still remained low (especially the fill factor). For these thick films, the use of dopants (Li-TFSI and TPB) was necessary to improve their conductivity, and indeed, excellent efficiencies with average values of 17% were obtained under these conditions (max. 17.9%). Another strategy was to introduce a buffer layer (V2O5) on top of the Pc-layer, covering the defects encountered during the fabrication of the thin-films, hence reducing recombination losses. No perovskite crystals and only the compact V2O5 sheet could be detected by SEM, confirming the success of this strategy. It also presents the advantage that the use of dopant is unnecessary, since the thin film itself shows high conductivity. In this way, the PSC devices made with the dopant-free V2O5/Ni-21 modified layer achieved improved PCEs with average values of 17.6% (max. 18.3%) and excellent stability over 30 days (Fig. 18).

More elaborated substituents than simple alkyl or alkoxy chains have also been sought for Pc materials. Back in 2015, the groups of Torres and Nazeeeruddin reported one of the first examples of a substituted and solution-processed Pc-based HTM in PSCs, with the Zn(II)octa(2,6-diphenylphenoxy) Pc Zn-16 (coded as TT80). The authors demonstrated earlier in a different context that this substitution pattern fully suppresses aggregation of the Pc, whereas it was not the case for a tert-butyl substitution. This breakthrough was successfully implemented by these authors in the dyes TT40 and TT58 for DSSC applications, giving rise to one of the most efficient Pc-sensitizers to date. For HTM Pcs, however, the opposite aggregation–efficiency relationship was observed in PSCs, with the non-aggregated Zn-16 (doped) giving rise to a PCE of 6.7%, whereas the (more aggregated) tert-butyl-substituted analogue Zn-5 (doped), reported some years later by the same authors, achieved much higher efficiencies of successively 13.3% (max. 14.48%) and 13.7% (max. 14.0%) (dopants Li-TFSI and TBP were used in the three works). Though different perovskite materials were used in these three studies, the abysmal differences in efficiency between the two HTMs cannot be explained by this factor but, instead, in terms of conductivity and morphology of the Pc-films which, as discussed before, emphasizes the critical importance of π–π stacking for such application. Similar results were obtained by Sastre-Santos and co-workers for the β-octakis substituted Pcs Zn-17 and Cu-17 tethered with bulky alkylphenoxy groups, achieving PCEs of 7.25% and 8.25%, respectively, within the same device configuration and using, as well, Li-TFSI and TBP dopants. Zhang and co-workers reported two coumarin-based metal Pcs, Fe-7 and Ni-7, which despite the remarkable hole mobility of the corresponding films (3.65 × 10−6 and 4.78 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively) achieved modest PCEs of 9.40% and 10.23% in PSCs.

In a broader context, triarylamine-based small molecules or polymers stand out as high-performing HTMs for photovoltaic applications, including PSCs, such as the well-known poly(triarylamine) (PTAA). On this line, the groups of Giribabu and Lianos reported the Pc Zn-8, substituted with four peripheral triphenylamine (TPA) groups, but again low PCEs in the range of 5.6% to 9.0% were obtained for the devices made with this HTM, and Li-TFSI and TBP dopants were necessary as well. An additional Al2O3 buffer layer on top of the HTM layer could improve the PCE to a better but still quite modest value of 13.65%, which suggests not only issues from conductivity of the Pc-films themselves but also defects and/or non-homogeneity of the Pc-film, as discussed previously. One more successful example involved an α-type Pc-HTM Cu-19, functionalized with 4-(bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)amino)phenoxy substituents. Cu-19 was tested in a double-cation (FA/MA) mixed PSC, but it achieved low PCEs as well, with a maximum value of 10.5%, the main reason being the relatively low conductivity of this HTM (5 × 10−7 S cm−1). To improve the conductivity and performances, the authors focused their attention on tetrafluorotetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) as the p-dopant. This choice was first motivated by the good alignment of the LUMO level of F4TCNQ (−5.24 eV) with the HOMO of Cu-19 (−5.22 eV), which is favourable for an efficient electron transfer from the Pc to F4TCNQ, with the aim to increase the conductivity of the HTM (so-called p-doping). Another advantage of F4TCNQ is to avoid common dopants such as Li-TFSI, which, given its high hygroscopic nature, may accelerate the degradation of cells involving solid state HTMs, as proposed by studies related to other photovoltaic technologies. p-Doping of Cu-19 with 6% (w/w) of F4TCNQ increased almost 18 times the conductivity of the films (from 5 × 10−7 to 8.9 × 10−6 S cm−1). Accordingly, the optimized device using the doped-HTM achieved a considerably improved PCE of 15.0%, which is a relatively high value considering that a low-cost carbon counter electrode was used in this study. The PSC devices showed good stability under ambient conditions for 720 h (Fig. 19). The groups of Pozzi and Nazerrudin reported on Pcs substituted with secondary amine donor groups, including diphenylamine (Zn-9) and carbazole (Zn-10 and Zn-11), which stand out for the direct N-bonding to the Pc macrocycle. As one could expect, these strong π-donor groups directly connected to the macrocycle produced drastic changes in their optical and electrochemical properties (thus HOMO–LUMO levels) with respect to non-conjugated alkyl/aryl or alkoxy/phenoxy-type Pcs discussed before (vide supra). In particular, these new ZnPcs have lower LUMO energy, smaller bandgap, and redshifted Q-band absorption compared to other ZnPcs. The diphenylamino-substituted Pc Zn-9 showed a higher HOMO level (−4.96 eV) than its carbazole analogue Zn-10 (−5.39 eV). The introduction of methoxy donor groups in Zn-11 limited the stabilizing effect produced by the carbazole unit on the HOMO level, thus having an intermediate value of −5.18 eV. Overall, the three Pcs showed enough energy difference between their HOMO levels and the valence band edge of the perovskite (MAPbI3; −5.48 eV) to ensure extraction of the holes from the perovskite layer. The LUMO energy increased in the order Zn-10 (−3.57 eV) < Zn-11 (−3.39 eV) < Zn-9 (−3.24 eV), which confers greater over-potential for blocking the backflow of electrons from the perovskite to the Pc, and hence recombination can be expected to be reduced in the same order. These data are consistent with the poor photocurrent observed for the Zn-10/PSC (JSC = 10.7 mA cm−2) in comparison with the two other devices (JSC = 16.7 and 17.4 mA cm−2 for Zn-9 and Zn-11, respectively). Accordingly, the device made with Zn-10 achieved a PCE of 6.65% only, while those of Zn-9 and Zn-11 achieved comparable efficiencies of 11.75% and 11.44% respectively, which at that time were the highest values ever reported for solution-processed Pcs in conventional PSCs. The relative and modest efficiencies achieved with these Pc-HTMs in PSCs can be well-explained by energetic factors, which are misalignments of their HOMO–LUMO levels with the energy band edges of the perovskite material. The group of Nazeeruddin also reported on the use of alkyl-thiophene and -bisthiophene moieties to produce low band gap Pc-materials. Their first attempt came with the tetra-β-hexylthiophene-substituted Pc (Zn-12) in MAPbI3-based PSCs. Initially, they found efficiencies as poor as 4.2% for this HTM, which were ascribed to the low quality of the films (large defects and shunts), hence resulting in high recombination rates. To solve this critical issue, the authors developed an innovative strategy that consists in infiltrating the Pc film with insulating Al2O3 mesoporous particles to form a hybrid interfacial buffer layer. Charge recombination was greatly reduced upon incorporation of the Al2O3 interlayer, resulting in an impressive improvement in the PCE of up to 12.3%.
In a later work, this Pc together with the other two, Zn-5 and Zn-13 having a tert-butyl or hexylbisthiophene substitution, respectively, was explored in PSCs using a modified double-cation, double-halide, mixed perovskite [(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15], distinguished by a sharper optical bandgap than MAPbI3, which is optimal for solar cell applications. The three Pc-HTMs reached comparable JSC (20.2–20.3 mA cm−2) and VOC (1.03–1.10 V) values, but with remarkable differences in their FF. Indeed, Zn-12 achieved record FF values of up to 0.803, while those of Zn-5 (0.663) and Zn-13 (0.694) were low in comparison. Accordingly, Zn-12 yielded a record PCE of up to 17.5%, while more modest values were obtained for Zn-5 (up to 14.5%) and Zn-13 (up to 15.5%). The difference in PCEs of the three HTMs was related to morphology considerations and the degree of stacking of the Pcs, which was corroborated by conductivity measurements of the films. Zn-5 and Zn-13 displayed the lowest values of 6.0 × 10−7 and 5.0 × 10−7 S cm−1, respectively. In turn, Zn-12 films showed impressive values higher by two orders of magnitude (8.0 × 10−5 S cm−1) with respect to the other Pcs, and comparable to that of the conventional Spiro-OMeTAD HTM (4.0 × 10−5 S cm−1). This trend, once again, clearly supports that an optimal packing through π–π stacking of Zn-12 has a crucial importance in the conductivity of the Pc-films.

The copper Pc Cu-6 reported by Sun and collaborators is distinguished by the introduction of four triisopropylsilylethynyl (TIPS) groups at the periphery of the Pc, affording good solubility and greater hydrophobicity, which aims to allow solution-processing and greater stability of the final devices, with respect to the commonly used, vacuum-processed unsubstituted CuPc HTM. PSCs fabricated with HTM Cu-6 achieved a PCE of up to 14%, a decent value taking into account that the HTM was solution-processed and dopant-free, and a more stable, low-cost carbon counter electrode was used in this study, which together aim to reduce the fabrication costs and enhance long-term stability of the device. It is worth remarking that Cu-6 films with no dopant showed a good conductivity value of 5 × 10−6 S cm−1. The Cu-6/PSC devices showed good stability over 30 days under a humidity of 35%, without encapsulation and stored in the dark (Fig. 20), retaining 90% of the initial PCE (from 14% to 12.5%). A last example concerns a cationic β-tetrasulfonated acid tetra sodium salt Pc reported by two independent groups but with different metal centres (Cu-14 or Ni-14), in planar-PSCs, under normal and/or inverted configurations. Solely and dopant-free, these cationic Pc-HTMs gave relatively poor-to-modest PCEs, which was ascribed mostly to low conductivity and hole mobility of the Pc films, as well as non-uniformity when formed over the ITO glass substrate for inverted PSCs. Dopant or doping approaches were developed to engineer new composite HTLs based on these Pcs, with the aim to improve the efficiency and stability of the PSC devices.

The work reported by Wang et al. relied on p-doping of Cu-14 Pc-films with tetrafluorotetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ), taking advantage of the good solubility of the Pc (in water and polar solvents) and the strong electron affinity of F4-TCNQ. Remarkably, these films were processed from water solutions (eco-friendly and non-toxic) in a simple manner (mixing of the two components) and at low temperature (reduced cost), thus constituting several advantages for commercialisation purposes. The composite film of Cu-14 with an optimized content of F4-TCNQ dopant (2.5 wt%) showed improved conductivity and hole mobility (9.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) by almost two orders of magnitude with respect to that of pristine Cu-14 (2.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Moreover, the pH of the solution of Cu-14 doped with 2.5 wt% of F4-TCNQ is almost neutral (pH = 7.4), in contrast to the acidic character of the standard PEDOT:PSS HTM, which is beneficial for long-term stability of inverted-PSC devices since it limits the corrosion of the electrode. In the inverted configuration, the PSCs fabricated with the same optimized composite doped-film (Cu-14 + F4-TCNQ-2.5 wt%) showed excellent PCEs of up to 16.14%, which are higher by far than those obtained with the control devices made with pristine Cu-14 (8.7%) or standard PEDOT:PSS (13.22%) HTMs. The modified device retained 88% of the initial value after 350 h of storing in air at room temperature (Fig. 21; with “TS-CuPc” = Cu-14).
The composite material was also employed as an interfacial layer (referred to as the hole modifying layer) in PSCs within a normal architecture (n-i-p), in which the doped-Pc layer was intercalated between that of Spiro-OMeTAD and an Ag counter electrode to form a bi-hole transporting layer. The judiciously aligned energy levels of the three components (perovskite, Cu-14:F4-TCNQ and Spiro-OMeTAD) allowed one to reduce effectively charge recombination while maintaining a good charge transport within the HTL and without prejudicing hole extraction. Reduced recombination in the modified device was supported by photoluminescence (PL) experiments, and the main resulting benefit in the PSCs was, as well as in inverted configuration, an improvement in the FF (0.74), with respect to the devices made with Spiro-OMeTAD solely (0.70) or Spiro-OMeTAD/undoped-Cu-14 bi-layer (0.70) as HTLs. Accordingly, the Spiro/[Cu-14:F4-TCNQ] HTL-bilayered device achieved an excellent maximum PCE of 20.16%, significantly higher than those made with Spiro-OMeTAD (16.23%) or Spiro/undoped-Cu-14 (16.69%), and presented also reduction in the hysteresis behaviour.

As an extension of the work discussed above, the same authors reported a later study focused on compositional doping of PEDOT:PSS films with Cu-14 (25 to 60 wt%) to engineer more efficient and stable HTLs for inverted planar PSCs. When Cu-14 was used alone as the HTL, poor efficiencies of up to 6.28% were obtained, which was assigned to the poor quality of the Pc films formed over the ITO glass substrate (non-uniformity and large defects). Bilayer configurations, either Pc/PEDOT:PSS or PEDOT:PSS/Pc, gave higher PCEs of 10.78% and 13.17%, respectively, but still lower than the 13.29% value of the control device made with PEDOT:PSS solely. At last, improved performances were obtained when using Pc-doped PEDOT:PSS films, with the best values (PCE of 17.29%) obtained for 50 wt% content of Cu-14. The Pc-doped films presented a better uniformity with lower roughness, which is beneficial for the growth of perovskite crystals. This was supported by SEM images, which revealed better crystal quality, fewer defects, and higher coverage of the perovskite when the Pc-doped film was used as the under-layer. In addition, these films displayed superior conductivity with respect to the non-doped PEDOT:PSS, which also explained the improved efficiency. Regarding stability issues, the acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS (pH = 2.1 in H2O) was only slightly neutralized by the incorporation of the basic Pc (pH = 10.0), since a pH value of 3.3 was obtained for the composite aqueous solution (50 wt% of Pc). Thus, the corrosiveness toward the electrodes was reduced to a lesser extent than in the composite HTL reported in their former work. Nonetheless, more modest but still improved stability was obtained for these cells. Under identical storage conditions and at room temperature, the PCE decreased to half of its initial value after 240 h for the Pc-doped PEDOT:PSS device and after 80 h for the control one with PEDOT:PSS only (Fig. 22).

An analogous work using Ni-14 as the dopant (2.5–15%) for PEDOT:PSS films was reported soon after by the group of Xu, with improved PCE in inverted PSCs of up to 18.90%. The same trends in efficiencies were observed between the single-component and composite HTLs, Ni-14 (9.29%), PEDOT:PSS (16.47%), bi-layered PEDOT:PSS/Pc (13.53%) or Pc/PEDOT:PSS (15.52%), and blended Pc-doped PEDOT:PSS (18.90%). Remarkably, the optimized content of Pc-dopant was much less in this case (10 wt% of Pc) with respect to that reported earlier by Wang et al. with Cu-14 (50 wt%), and the higher content of dopant resulted in lower performances (PCE = 16.62% for 15 wt% doping of Pc). Similar conclusions were drawn regarding the effect of the composite HTL, namely, a more effective hole transport, improved morphology of the films, and better stability. In addition, the authors observed enhanced photon absorption in the entire visible range for the Pc-doped PEDOT:PSS films, with respect to that of Ni-14 alone and PEDOT:PSS alone, which, according to the authors, was also a major contribution to such improvement. Three other works have reported on the use of metal Pcs as dopants for HTMs in normal meso-PSCs: β-tetra(n-butyl) (Zn-4) and β-tetra(tert-butyl) (Cu-571 or Ge-562) Pcs. The study reported by Seo et al. involved Pc-doping (Cu-5) of a molecularly modified Spiro-OMeTAD (po-Spiro) HTM, in which four over eight para-methoxy substituents initially present in the conventional and commercially available p,p-spiro-OMeTAD were changed to the ortho position. po-Spiro HTM doped with an optimized content of Pc (3.8 wt%) and incorporating additives (LiTFSI and TBP) gave the highest performances in PSCs with an average PCE of 18.2% (max. 20.0%), while the individual components within the same additive composition gave 15.2% for Zn-5 and 17.5% for po-Spiro. The main contribution came from the FF, with average values of 74.7%, 66.35% and 71.85%, respectively. The authors concluded that a low concentration of Pc-dopant confers to po-Spiro a more effective capability to block the back flow of electrons from the perovskite layer (i.e. reduced recombination), leading to improved FF with respect to the non-doped one. Similarly, Lianos and collaborators found that doping the standard Spiro-OMeTAD HTM with 10 wt% of n-butyl substituted CuPc (Cu-4) increased considerably the efficiency of the PSC up to 15.4% with respect to individual HTMs Cu-4 (8.2%) and Spiro-OMeTAD (10.4%), incorporating LiTFSI and TBP additives in the three cases. In agreement with the work of Seo et al. discussed above, the same conclusions were drawn regarding the better blocking capability and hence reduced recombination and improved FF within the Cu-4-doped Spiro material. From FE-SEM images, they observed an improvement in the quality of the Spiro-OMeTAD film when doped with the Pc. The authors suggested that Cu-4 may also act as a structural modifier that reduces the size and number of defects, which could constitute an additional explanation for such improvement. Suzuki et al. also obtained improved efficiencies, though much more modest (from 4.23% to 4.47%), when doping Spiro-OMeATD films with 12.5 wt% of a tert-butyl substituted Germanium Pc (Ge-5). However, in contrast to the two previous examples discussed above, they did not obtain improvement in the FF, which was even slightly lower than that of the non-doped HTM (0.46 vs. 0.51), but obtained improvement in the JSC (from 10.45 to 15.81 mA cm−2). They proposed that the Ge-5 dopant promotes carrier generation and diffusion in the Spiro HTL, and helps to reduce recombination owing to a better matching of the energy level of the doped-HTM and the perovskite.

To a lesser extent, but successfully implemented in PSCs, Pcs have also been considered as dopants or additives for compositional and/or interfacial engineering of the perovskite, targeting more efficient and stable devices. The infiltration or insertion of these large organic molecules into the perovskite structure can modify its optoelectronic properties and morphology (crystallinity and/or surface coverage), which aims to improve the quality of the film by means of better light-harvesting properties, higher conductivity, lower degree of defects (hence reducing the trap-assisted recombination process) or increased interfacial contact with the HTM (hence better charge extraction at the perovskite/HTM interface can be expected). To this end, different approaches have been reported, all of them involving solution-processed techniques: (1) direct incorporation into the perovskite precursor solution during the first-step of fabrication of the layer, or (2) during the second one, via the mixed-anti solvent technique; (3) by post-treatment (sequential). Concerning the first approach, two independent works were reported by the groups of Behjat, with CuPc in meso-type PSCs, and Peng, with Cu-5 (Cu-β-Pc(tertbutyl)4) in a planar configuration. In the first example, an optimal dopant-content of 0.05 wt% Pc in the perovskite material produced significant improvements in performances, with the PCE increasing from 6.4% for the non-doped device to 8.4% for the doped one (with Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL). The main contribution to this enhancement came from an increase in the JSC, which was attributed to better light-harvesting properties and improvement in the quality of the doped-film, specifically, higher degree of crystallinity of the perovskite structure. Analogously, the second example reports on the doping of the perovskite material with Cu-5 (0.048 wt%) for PSC/Spiro devices in planar configurations, and an improvement in the PCE from 15.3% (without Pc doping) to 17.3% (Pc-doped) was also obtained. Similarly, this improvement was explained by the higher quality and crystallinity of the perovskite film with less defective sites, and also higher surface coverage. In a different approach, the groups of Wei and Huang doped the perovskite material (triple-mixed cations) with NiPc using a mixed anti-solvent technique, to obtain improved quality of the film with higher crystallinity. Concretely, after spin-coating the perovskite precursor solution (first step), a solution of NiPc dissolved in the anti-solvent (0.5 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene) was added to the spin-coated substrate in a second step. In this way, the Pc molecules are introduced before completion of the perovskite crystals, and thus can infiltrate into the surface, aiming at increasing the interfacial contact between perovskite and hole-transporting layers. In a planar configuration and using Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM, the PCE increased from 17.24% for the non-doped PSC device to 19.18% for the doped one. In the last approach, Cao and co-workers constructed a two-dimensional (2D) modified perovskite 2D-[(ZnPc)0.5MAn−1PbnI3n+1] by direct post-treatment of 3D-MAPbI3 films with a cationic tetra-ammonium ZnPc material (Zn-15). X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments demonstrated that the Pc molecules were successfully incorporated into the perovskite structure, suturing and thus passivating the grain-boundary (GBs) defect sites initially present in the 3D-lattice of the perovskite. Time-resolved photoluminescence studies indicated a faster decay time for the modified film (57 ns) than the initial one (44 ns), indicating that the passivation of GBs reduced effectively trap-assisted recombination. Consequently, the PSC devices fabricated with the modified 2D Pc-perovskite exhibited fair improvements in all photovoltaic performances (VOC, JSC and F.F.) with a maximum PCE value of 20.3%, higher than the 19.01% value obtained for the best non-modified one. More impacting is the considerably higher stability of the modified device (Fig. 23), losing only 10% of its original efficiency after 1000 h when stored at 85 °C and a humidity of ca. 45% (Fig. 23c). In an astonishing comparison, the control device without post-treatment lost over 90% of its original efficiency after only 250 h under the same stressed conditions. As well remarkably, when films of pure and modified perovskite were transferred to a high moisture environment, the colour decayed from dark black to yellow (typically indicative of degradation of the perovskite). However, when these films were transferred subsequently to an environment of N2 at 85 °C, only the modified film recovered progressively its initial colour, suggesting a self-repairing capability conferred by the ZnPcs that efficiently suture the GBs of the perovskite.


Inducing asymmetry in the Pc scaffold is known to perturb drastically the density and distribution of the 18 π-delocalized electrons over the macrocycle, which has an impact on the photophysical and electrochemical properties and also the way the Pcs self-aggregate and their strength. Given the importance of π–π stacking on the morphology and electronic properties of thin film devices discussed above, this kind of Pc could be interesting to be explored as new materials for HTMs. In the field of PSCs, only very few works have considered the use of unsymmetrically substituted Pcs (Fig. 6 and Table 6). The first example was reported by Guo and Zhang with the Pc CoPcNO2-OPh decorated with three phenoxy and one nitro group at the peripheral β-positions. This Pc displays enough solubility in organic solvents and suitable energy levels to be used as the solution-processed HTM in PSCs. The dopant-free Pc-based device showed a PCE of 8.24%, fairly close to that obtained with standard doped-Spiro-OMeTAD (10.24%). The same collaborators reported recently three analogues functionalized with three modified (4-methylformate)phenoxy or (4-butyl formate) phenoxy peripheral groups and different metal centres (Cu and Zn), namely CuPcNO2-OMFPh, CuPcNO2-OBFPh and ZnPcNO2-OBFPh.

The three Pcs were tested as dopant-free HTMs in double cation (FA/MA) dual-halide (I/Br) mixed PSCs, and achieved improved PCEs of 12.52%, 13.66% and 15.74%, respectively, while the control device made with doped-Spiro-OMeTAD gave 18.42% under these conditions. The ZnPcNO2-OBFPh-device displayed not only the highest PCE over the three Pcs, but also the least hysteresis behaviour and longest stability, retaining 72.3% of its initial PCE value after 500 h of full sunlight exposure at 60 °C. In a recent example, Torres and Nazeeruddin introduced a carboxyl group at one β-position of a tert-butyl substituted Pc (TT1) to induce asymmetry with respect to the symmetrical one with four tert-butyl groups (Zn-5). The introduction of the carboxyl group, in addition to inducing asymmetry of the Pc, may favour chemical interaction with the perovskite, but no clear evidence could attest whether such interaction exists or not. The two additive-containing Pc-HTMs were tested in double-cation mixed PSCs, and did not show significant differences in terms of efficiency, achieving close and fairly high PCEs of up to 13.7% for TT1 and 14.0% for Zn-5 (TT0 in ref. 78).
In a last atypical example, Wang et al. reported on the use of two different Pcs integrated in the PSC by dye-sensitization of the mesoporous TiO2 layer (ETL), acting as both an interface modifier layer and co-sensitizer. It is worth remarking that these are the only known examples involving Pcs at the ETL junction of a PSC device. The free-base Pc-Cou and zinc ZnPc-Cou Pcs both display suitable HOMO–LUMO energy levels to match those of the perovskite (MAPbI3) and CB of TiO2, which render thermodynamically feasible electron injection from the excited-Pc dyes into the TiO2-CB on the one hand, and from the perovskite to the Pc-LUMO on the other hand. The devices were fabricated in a conventional meso-PSC configuration with MAPbI3 as perovskite absorber and Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM. The modified Pc-sensitized PSCs showed PCEs of up to 13.55% and 13.96% for Pc-Cou and ZnPc-Cou, respectively, which are markedly higher in comparison with the control device incorporating solely mesoporous TiO2 as the ETL (10.55%). In particular, higher JSC values were obtained for the co-sensitized devices, which were assigned to the extra contribution coming from the Pc dyes. This was reflected in their IPCE spectra that showed a greater response in the 400–800 nm region, matching the Pc-absorption features. The higher fill factors were ascribed to lower series resistances, presumably explained by a more favourable morphology of the perovskite layer grown over the Pc-modified layer (fewer grain boundaries). At last, slightly higher VOC values were obtained and explained by smaller charge recombination resistance as determined from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), contributing also, but to a lesser extent, to the improved PCEs.

Although Pors have played different roles in PSCs, for instance, as additives to enhance the crystallinity of the perovskite layer, as an ETL, or as a modifying layer for interfacial engineering, their potential as HTMs is undeniable if one considers their low oxidation potential and their high hole transporting capabilities, as previously demonstrated in pure organic solar cells. As in the case of Pcs, the light-harvesting properties of Pors used as the HTM could negatively affect the efficiency of PSCs. However, the number of advantages over Spiro-derivatives and most organic compounds makes them, indeed, candidates of choice. One of the most remarkable features is their high versatility toward structural modification, which opens a path for tuning the photophysical, electrochemical, and charge-transport properties, thus making feasible a sequential improvement of the efficiencies of the PSCs by rational modification of the Por chemical structure. Moreover, Pors offer other valuable features, such as their excellent thermal stability. These advantages have been envisioned by several authors, who have investigated and proved that, as it happens with Pcs, Pors can be successfully incorporated as HTM in PSCs.

Chen, Yeh and co-workers opened a new paradigm of hole-transporters based on Pors with their first report on this topic in 2016. For that purpose, they prepared ZnPors coded as Y2 and Y2A2 (Fig. 25, left and Table 7), consisting of a meso-5,15-bis(ethynylaniline)porphyrin core, with the nitrogen atom bearing butyl (Y2) or dodecyl chains (Y2A2), and two facing alkoxyphenyl groups in the other two opposite meso positions. The aim of the design is to achieve electronic communication between the Por core and the donor amine groups, and solubility, which is imparted by the lateral alkyl chains. The length of the alkyl chains was shown to have an impact on the film morphology. In fact, Y2 as thin-film showed both Soret and Q bands red-shifted and significantly broadened with regard to the thin film of Y2A2, indicating stronger intermolecular interaction and, therefore, different surface morphology. On the other hand, these materials present similar HOMO levels at −5.25 and −5.10 eV for Y2 and Y2A2, respectively, comparable with the value of Spiro-OMeTAD at −5.22 eV. PSCs were prepared by spin-coating Y2 and Y2A2 solutions (layer thickness of ca. 70 nm) over the perovskite/mesoporous TiO2 layer (ca. 550 nm). The authors observed that the whole photoluminescence of the perovskite was quenched very efficiently in the presence of either Y2 or Y2A2 HTM, which indicated effective hole-extraction by the Por molecules. The VOC of devices using Y2 and Y2A2 was determined as 0.99 and 1.01 V, respectively, only slightly smaller than the VOC of devices incorporating Spiro-OMeTAD (1.06 V). In addition, the Y2 device showed a JSC of 22.82 mA cm−2 and a FF of 73.34%, almost identical to that of Spiro-OMeTAD (JSC = 22.79 mA cm−2; FF = 74.39%), leading to a PCE of 16.60%, slightly lower than the PCE of Spiro-OMeTAD-based devices (18.03%). Stability tests over 14 days indicate that Y2-PSCs present better moisture resistance stability than Spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 24).

After this relevant result, the authors prepared two dimeric porphyrin conjugates (WT3 and YR3; Fig. 25, right) related to Y2. The design of these molecules with an extended π-conjugation was aimed at increasing the intermolecular interaction in the film and, thus, at achieving enhanced hole mobility. Importantly, these molecules maintained appropriate HOMO levels (−5.14 for WT3 and −5.11 eV for Y3) that ensured minimum energy losses towards charge extraction. With the use of a triple-cation perovskite, the fabricated PSCs using WT3 and YR3 showed PCEs of 19.44% and 17.84%, respectively. In particular, Por WT3 performs better than Spiro-OMeTAD (18.62%), or than the previously reported HTM Y2 (17.92%) in this type of triple-cation perovskite devices. The WT3-based device showed excellent moisture, light-soaking and thermal stability, superior to that of Spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 26). More specifically, it retained more than 90% of the initial PCE after 800 h under a relative humidity of ≈40%, whereas that of Spiro-OMeTAD already dropped to 80% after 300 h only under the same conditions. Soon after the first report on Por-based HTMs, the groups of Wong and Zhu described the use of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis{4-[N,N-di(4-methoxylphenyl)-aminophenyl]}porphyrin in the form of Zn(II) and Cu(II) complexes (Zn-22 and Cu-22, Fig. 27) as HTLs in PSCs. These symmetrical meso-aryl substituted Pors are structurally simpler than Y2 and Y2A2, and can be prepared straightforwardly from low-cost starting materials. An additional advantage is that the bulky and twisted structure of the methoxy-substituted TPA group (as demonstrated by DFT calculations) provides high solubility in common organic solvents. Although these compounds exhibit strong absorption between 400 and 450 nm, the absorption spectra of TiO2/perovskite films with and without Zn-22 and Cu-22 layers showed no significant difference for the absorption in the 400–800 nm region, due to the saturated absorption by the perovskite film in this range. The HOMOs of both Zn-22 (−5.29 eV) and Cu-22 (−5.37 eV) lie above that of perovskite, with the Cu(II) derivative having a deeper HOMO energy level, which in principle is beneficial for achieving a higher VOC, but proved unfavourable for hole injection from the perovskite by photoluminescence studies when compared to Zn-22-based HTM layers. Eventually, the Zn-22 PSC provided a PCE of 17.78%, with a JSC of 22.68 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.099 V, and a FF of 71.3%, whereas Cu-22 PSCs showed a slightly lower PCE of 15.36%, with the corresponding values of 21.60 mA cm−2, 1.072 V, and 66.3%.
Remarkably, Cu-22 showed a lower VOC than Zn-22 in PSCs, in spite of the slightly deeper HOMO level of the former. This was rationalized by the better solubility of Zn-22 in chlorobenzene, the solvent used for spin-coating the HTM layer, giving rise to a smoother and larger surface coverage than that obtained from Cu-22 solutions. Importantly, the devices built with Zn-22 and Cu-22 rendered similar reproducibility of the PCE as the reference devices constructed with Spiro-OMeTAD (PCE of 18.59%), but much larger stability under ambient conditions (Fig. 28; with “ZnP” = Zn-22). Jung and co-workers realized some structural engineering over the previously described symmetrical meso-tetraarylamine substituted Pors. These authors synthesized a series of Pors coded as PZn-TPA-O (Zn-22 in ref. 121), PZn-TPA, PZn-DPPA-O, and PZn-DPPA (Fig. 27) (DPPA = diphenyl-2-pyridylamine) to investigate the effects of fine-tuning the structure and, therefore, the electronic properties of the Pors on the device performance. The introduction of an electron-deficient pyridine ring in PZn-DPPA-O and PZn-DPPA derivatives realized effective down-shifting of the HOMO energy level, providing a better match to the MAPbI3 perovskite active layer, with regard to pure triphenylamine Pors PZn-TPA-O and PZn-TPA. On the other hand, the addition of an electron-donating methoxy group in PZn-TPA-O and PZn-DPPA-O raised the HOMO energy levels with regard to PZn-TPA and PZn-DPPA derivatives. Thus, PZn-DPPA showed a HOMO level of −5.36 eV, which is suitable for effective hole extraction and VOC enhancement in PSC devices. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of all Pors (−3.23 to −3.26 eV) were sufficiently high compared to those of the perovskite layers (−3.90 eV), confirming the efficient blocking of unwanted electron transfer from MAPbI3 to HTMs. In this case, the VOC and the PCEs nearly followed the trend of the HOMO levels, with the PZn-DPPA-based devices showing the highest PCE of 14.11%. The superior JSC value of the PZn-DPPA device originated from the improved charge extraction throughout the visible range, as indicated by EQE measurements and transient photovoltage (TPV) spectroscopy. Also, the two DPPA-containing Pors showed greater hole mobility than the TPA-based HTMs, which was attributed to enhanced molecular stacking. PZn-DPPA devices, with and without additives, showed superior stability over 25 days under ambient conditions than those made with Spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 29). Remarkably, although the undoped PZn-DPPA device delivered initially a slightly lower PCE than the doped one, its stability was much higher, thus retaining the highest PCE after 25 days (92% of its initial value). Further adjustment of the HOMO level of tetra(triphenylamine)-substituted ZnPors was performed by the same authors by introduction of fluorine atoms at 2- or 3-relative positions of the phenyl ring linked to the Por core (PZn-2FTPA and PZn-3FTPA, Fig. 27 and Table 7) (FTPA = fluorinated triphenylamine). The fluorinated ZnPor-HTMs (PZn-2FTPA and PZn-3FTPA) exhibited a deeper HOMO, enhanced face-on stacking and superior hole transport properties compared to the non-fluorinated derivative PZn-TPA. In this work, a device structure was built similarly to the previous work, with the main difference coming from the passivation of the ZnO ETL using 1,2-ethanedithiol. In this case, optimized devices reached PCEs of 16.37% for the reference PZn-TPA, notably higher than the 11.96% value previously reported, and 18.85% and 17.71% for PZn-2FTPA and PZn-3FTPA, respectively. The doped-PZn-2FTPA device retained 90% of its initial PCE after 40 days (relative humidity 32 ± 3% without encapsulation), which is improved with respect to the Spiro-OMeTAD one (Fig. 30).
Without doping of the HTMs, the stability was enhanced and was quite similar for both devices, and although absolute PCE values were significantly lower than for the doped-ones, that of the Por-device was markedly superior to that of Spiro-OMeTAD within this configuration.
Other authors have performed modifications of the basic meso-tetrakis(triphenylamine) substitution in the search of an optimal tuning of the parameters determining the PCE of the device. For instance, Palomares and co-workers have introduced bulky 4-aminophenyl-N,N-bis(2′,4′-dimethoxy[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)units at the meso positions of free base and Zn Por derivatives. These substituents are bulkier and slightly less donating groups than TPA, providing improved solubility and deeper HOMO levels to the ZnPor core (−5.35 and −5.37 eV for the free-base and the Zn complex, respectively). Although mobility measurements have been performed over archetypal ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Por devices, the preparation of PSCs with these materials is still to come. On the other hand, replacement of the TPA moieties by pyridyl-containing phenylacylhydrazone units in the Por core (ZnPy) has led to highly efficient (PCE up to 17.8%) PSC devices without p-doping of the HTM layer, showing also much better stability than related Spiro-OMeTAD devices (Fig. 31). The explanation for such features arises from the presence of the pyridine-terminated groups that behave as Lewis bases together with the O and N atoms from acylhydrazone units. These moieties afford efficient electronic passivation of under-coordinated Pb atoms within the perovskite, as demonstrated by FTIR, and consequently, decreased interfacial charge recombination, as proved by EIS measurements on PSC devices. The TPA-substitution and the ABAB pattern were merged in the Pors used as the HTM in PSCs reported by Tang and co-workers. The authors described an original architecture that relies on the use of a natural sunscreen-like molecule (i.e., sinapoyl malate, SM) as interfacial additive to improve both the UV stability of the perovskite and the interfacial contact between TiO2 and the perovskite layer, and a combination of Co(II) and Co(III) Pors (Co(II)-23 and Co(III)-23, Fig. 32 and Table 7) as the HTL.
The rationale behind this design is based on the fact that Co(II)/Co(III) is one of the best combinations in oxidation and reduction processes, successfully used as a redox couple in DSSCs. The Co-Por molecules were endowed with two facing trialkoxy-substituted phenyl rings to afford solubility, and two opposite methoxy-substituted TPAs that provide efficient hole transport. For the architecture FTO/cTiO2/mTiO2-SM/Csx(MA0.17FA0.83)(1−x)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3/HTM/Au (with FA and MA standing for formamidinium and methylammonium cations, respectively) a record efficiency of 20.5% was obtained for a non-doped HTM layer prepared with a mixture of Co(II)Por and Co(III)Por in an optimized 4:6 molar ratio. Outstandingly, this value is superior to the 19.6% obtained when using a doped Spiro-OMeTAD film as the HTL. More importantly, implementation of the Co(II)-23/Co(III)-23 HTL resolved the thermal degradation of PSCs by avoiding ion diffusion of I− and MA+ ions from the perovskite. As shown in Fig. 33, the PSC device combining TiO2-SM as the ETL and Co(II)-23/Co(III)-23 as the HTL delivers excellent stabilized power output of PCE, with negligible loss over 175 h in comparison with the state-of-the-art device made with Spiro-OMeTAD. Other ABAB Pors have been prepared and studied as HTMs, but a remarkable example is that reported by the groups of Peng and Jen, who described a hybrid solar cell comprising a NIR-absorbing bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer on top of the perovskite, as a way to extend the photoresponse beyond 800 nm and, therefore, enhance the efficiency of perovskite-based solar cells. Hybrid solar cells of this kind incorporate a suitable BHJ mixture working as the HTL that has broad light absorption, and suitable energy levels and mobility to simultaneously enhance JSC, VOC, and FF with regard to commonly reported PSCs. In this particular case, the BHJ was composed of a NIR-absorbing (band edge at 901 nm) ABAB ZnPor (DPPEZnP-THE) and PCBM, which had been previously used as an active layer in BHJ devices. The modified version DPPEZnP-TSEH (Fig. 32) has alkyl-sulfide thienyl (instead of alkyl-thienyl) electron-donating groups to adjust the HOMO of the Por (i.e., −5.2 eV) to match the valence band of the perovskite. The S atoms on the side-chains can also help to passivate the trap states of the perovskite crystals. The optimized organic solar cell (OSC) based exclusively on the BHJ of DPPEZnP-TSEH and PCBM exhibited a moderate PCE of 7.82% with JSC, VOC, and FF up to 17.35 mA cm−2, 0.79 V, and 0.57, respectively. On the other hand, a reference PSC device with Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL exhibits a PCE of 17.56%, with a VOC of 1.07 V, a JSC of 21.37 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.77. Outstandingly, optimized OSC/perovskite hybrid solar cells show a very high PCE of 19.02%, with a JSC of 23.32 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.78, and a VOC of 1.03 V. Transient absorption experiments demonstrated that the BHJ layer contributed to the photocurrent generation not just around the band-edge, but in the entire absorption range of the layer.
All the above mentioned examples refer to changes in the meso-substitution of tetraarylPors, which affect the energy levels, absorption properties and intermolecular interactions of the Por core. However, the versatility of Pors and derivatives does not include only variations of the substituents and metal centers, but also structural modifications of the cyclic tetrapyrrolic ring. Therefore, other tetrapyrrole-based molecules related to porphyrins, such as chlorins (Chl) and bacteriochlorins (BChl), have also been studied as potential HTMs for PSCs. BChls, Chls and Pors possess different degrees of π-conjugation on the ring, which leads to differences in their photophysical properties, and thus different hole-extraction abilities. In a recent study, PSCs with a typical mesoporous structure built with three different Zn(II)chlorophyll derivatives having BChl, Chl, and Por macrocycles showed PCEs of 8.26%, 11.88%, and 0.68%, respectively. This result was rationalized by the most efficient hole extraction capabilities of the BChl ring, as indicated by steady-state photoluminescence, whereas the low PCE (0.68%) of the ZnPor-based PSC was partially ascribed to a small energy gap between its HOMO and the valence band of the perovskite. On the other hand, expanded core-modified porphyrins have also been proposed as materials of choice as HTMs for high-performance PSCs.

Phthalocyanines (Pcs) and porphyrins (Pors) stand out for their low cost of production, high stability and high conductivity in thin films, which render them excellent alternatives as economic and efficient hole-transporting materials (HTMs) to be implemented in perovskite solar cells for potential large-scale applications. Over the last four years, excellent efficiencies and, likewise important, high-stability have been obtained for PSCs using Pc- and Por-based HTMs, from both vacuum-deposited and solution-processed methods.

The largest stability and better hole mobility values of Pc-based films versus the naturally occurring Por molecules account for the largest number of publications that handle different types of Pc molecules as HTMs. The Pc derivatives used in most of the works are structurally simple compounds, i.e. non-functionalized metalloPcs or symmetrically substituted ones, and in general, device engineering has much to do with the PCE improvements found in the devices, rather than a tuning of the electronic properties of the chromophores through structural modifications. Yet, several works have demonstrated the crucial importance of π–π stacking and aggregated structure of the Pc HTM films toward high conductivities, which enhance drastically the efficiency of the PSC devices. Indeed, highly ordered columnar stacks with a horizontal alignment (face-to-face) over the perovskite layer can magnify considerably the conductivity of Pc-films to afford optimal hole extraction at the interface, which can be achieved by a suitable substitution of the macrocycle. In this regard, some structural engineering in Pcs is still fundamental for reaching competitive materials that can be an alternative to the benchmark Spiro-OMeTAD in terms of PCE. Importantly, we have to remark here that, in general, Pc-HTMs provide the PSC devices with better moisture resistance, and light-soaking and thermal stability than Spiro-OMeTAD-devices.
As mentioned above, much less contributions reporting the use of Pors and other related tetrapyrrole-derivatives as HTMs can be found in the literature. Opposite to Pcs, much more complex Por structures have been incorporated as the HTL in PSCs, and these studies are more focused on the impact that changes in the Por structure can have on the hole extraction/transporting properties of the HTM. For instance, the effects that (i) the length of the alkyl chains, (ii) the extension of the aromatic structure through conjugation or dimer-formation, and/or (iii) the asymmetric functionalization of the aromatic core have on aspects such as film morphology and HOMO/LUMO levels have been addressed with much detail. The best PCE values obtained with Por dyes (i.e. 20.5%) arise from a combination of Co(II)Por/Co(III)Por molecules endowed with meso alkoxy-substituted phenyl rings to afford solubility, and two opposite TPAs that enhance hole extraction, which is indicative of the importance of fine-structural modifications in achieving good performances with these compounds.
Although some improvement is still necessary, several issues associated to the use of Spiro-OMeTAD as HTM in PSCs, such as low thermal/moisture stability and high-cost of production, have been sorted out using Por, and especially, Pc derivatives. As a general conclusion, it has been indeed demonstrated that both Pcs and Pors are candidates of choice as HTMs for the construction of high-performance perovskite solar cells.
