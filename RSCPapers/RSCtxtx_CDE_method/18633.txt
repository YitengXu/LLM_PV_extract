Ru(4,4′-dicarboxyl-2,2′-bipyridine)[4,4′-bis(styrylaminocarbonyl)-2,2′-bipyridine](NCS)2, denoted as RuAS dye, was synthesized and well characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, heteronuclear single quantum coherence, UV-vis and ESI-MS spectra. Its capability of chelating triiodide anions with the 4,4′-bis(styrylaminocarbonyl)-2,2′-bipyridine ligand, which was revealed by ATR-FTIR and 1H-NMR spectroscopies, reduced the charge recombination for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by keeping the triiodide ions away from contact with the mesoporous TiO2 layer. Therefore, the open-circuit photovoltage of the DSSC barely changed with the triiodide concentration in the electrolyte. Moreover, the electron-withdrawing ability of the amide groups in the ligand increased the molar extinction coefficient of the dye, leading to the increase of photocurrent for DSSCs. The enhanced photovoltaic performance was further examined by incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency spectra, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and open-circuit potential decay transient measurements.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted vast attention due to their easy fabrication and high power conversion efficiency (PCE), feasible for commercial applications. To pursue better photovoltaic performance, the photo-electrodes, dyes, electrolytes and counter electrodes in DSSCs have been investigated extensively over the past decades. For example, ruthenium dye with a bipyridyl ligand tethering triethylene oxide methyl ether functional groups capable of coordinating the lithium cation (Li+) in the electrolyte has been reported. It significantly enhanced the photocurrent of DSSCs by increasing the dye regeneration rate. Furthermore, to improve the long term stability, we have designed a cross-linkable dye, Ru(2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-bicarboxylic acid)(4,4′-bis((4-vinyl-benzyloxy) methyl)-2,2′-bipyridine)(NCS)2 (denoted as Ru-S) with the chemical structure shown below.
Ru-S dye is also capable of coordinating Li+ with its ether groups. As Ru-S was cross-linked with triethyleneglycodimethacrylate, not only did the long term stability improve, but the PCE also increased to over 8%.
On the other hand, the charge recombination rate at the interface between the TiO2 mesoporous layer and triiodide anions (I3−) in the electrolyte responsible for the decrease of open circuit photovoltage (Voc) of DSSCs may be reduced if I3− can be kept away from contact with the TiO2 layer. Therefore, in this work we designed a novel I3−-chelating and cross-linkable ruthenium complex dye, Ru(4,4′-dicarboxyl-2,2′-bipyridine)[4,4′-bis(styryl-aminocarbonyl)-2,2′-bipyridine](NCS)2, denoted as RuAS with the chemical structure shown in Fig. 1. Two amide groups in the bipyridyl ligand of RuAS dye are able to chelate I3−, as revealed by ATR-FTIR and 1H-NMR spectroscopies. Therefore, our discussion in this contribution will be focused on the synthesis, characterization and I3− chelating properties of RuAS in association with the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.

All chemicals were obtained from Alfa Lancaster, Acros and Aldrich. The solvents were dried over sodium or CaH2 and distilled before use. RuAS dye was synthesized by the typical one-pot synthetic method developed for heteroleptic polypyridyl ruthenium complexes. The synthesis procedure is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 and described in detail below.


4,4′-Bis(styrylaminocarbonyl)-2,2′-bipyridine (bsacbpy) prepared for the ligand of RuAS dye was synthesized from 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine (dcbpy), the preparation of which has been given elsewhere. A suspension of dcbpy (1 mmol) in 5 mL of thionyl chloride (SOCl2) was refluxed in argon overnight. The excess SOCl2 was removed under vacuum and 4,4′-bis(chlorocarbonyl)-2,2′-bipyridine (bclbpy) in white solid form was obtained. A solution of 4-aminostyrene (2.2 mmol) and triethylamine (2.5 mmol) in 10 mL of dry THF was then added dropwise into the flask containing dclbpy. After stirring for 2 h, the solution was poured into ice-water to produce a light-yellow precipitate, which was then filtered and washed with water, dichloromethane and diethyl ether. After drying under vacuum, a white solid product was afforded in 60% yield. 1H-NMR (500 MHz, d6-DMSO): δ 5.24 (d, 1H), 5.82 (d, 1H), 6.76 (m, 1H), 7.52 (d, 2H), 7.78 (d, 2H), 8.00 (m, 1H), 8.92 (s, 1H), 8.97 (d, 1H), 10.76 (s, 1H).


To a solution of [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 (0.5 mmol) in 50 mL of dry DMF was added bsacbpy (1.0 mmol) with stirring. After reaction at 80 °C under argon for 4 h at dark, dcbpy (1.0 mmol) was added. After refluxing at 160 °C for another 4 h, excess NH4NCS was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction proceeded at 130 °C for 5 h and then the solvent was removed using a rotary-evaporator under vacuum. Water was added to the resulting mixture to remove excess NH4NCS. The water-insoluble product was collected on a sintered glass crucible by suction filtration and washed with water, followed by diethyl ether and dried in air. The crude product was dissolved in methanol containing tetrabutylammonium hydroxide and then passed through a Sephadex LH-20 column using methanol as the eluent. The main band was collected and concentrated. A few drops of 0.01 M HNO3 aqueous solution were added to precipitate the product. 1H-NMR (500 MHz, d6-DMSO): δ 5.23 (dd, 2H), 5.80 (dd, 2H), 6.72 (m, 2H), 7.47–7.86 (m, 12H), 8.36 (d, 1H), 8.43 (d, 1H), 8.99 (s, 1H), 9.13 (s, 1H), 9.16 (s, 1H), 9.30 (s, 1H), 9.44 (d, 1H), 9.45 (d, 1H), 10.71 (s, 1H), 10.93 (s, 1H). 13C-NMR (500 MHz, d6-DMSO): δ 113.26, 113.34, 120.26, 120.53, 121.23, 121.48, 121.94, 122.25, 124.18, 124.94, 125.22, 125.98, 126.46, 126.55, 133.19, 133.32, 133.77, 134.39, 135.96, 136.01, 137.96, 138.09, 141.05, 141.61, 151.47, 152.17, 152.74, 156.63, 157.31, 157.92, 158.62, 162.64, 162.83, 165.14, 165.63 (see ESI, Fig. S1).

Dye-sensitized solar cells were fabricated using fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, 15 Ω per square) and indium-doped tin oxide (ITO, 7 Ω per square) glasses as substrate for the photo-electrode and counter-electrode, respectively. The counter-electrode was fabricated by depositing a thin Pt layer with sputtering. For preparation of the photo-electrode, a mesoporous film of anatase TiO2 coated on the FTO glass substrate was fabricated by a sol–gel process, according to the literature.

An active area of 0.16 cm2 TiO2 was selected from the sintered electrode, immersed in a mixed solution of acetonitrile (ACN) and tert-butanol (1:1 by volume) containing 0.3 mM of RuAS dye for 24 h, rinsed with acetone and dried. The liquid electrolytes containing 0.6 M propylmethylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate (GuNCS) and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and various concentrations of iodine (I2) in methoxyproprionitrile (MPN) were prepared.


1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance-500 MHz spectrometer by utilizing deuterated dimethyl sulphoxide (d6-DMSO) as solvent. ATR Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a ThermoNicolet NEXUS470 FTIR spectrometer using dye-adsorbed TiO2 films and a blank TiO2 film for background correction. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-550 UV-vis spectrometer. The electrospray ionization mass (ESI-MS) spectra were recorded on an LCQ Advantage and MS spectrometer. Elemental analysis was conducted by a HERAEUS VarioEL EA, NCH elemental analysis instrument. Photovoltaic characterization of the DSSCs was carried out by illuminating the cell with a 1000 W ozone-free xenon lamp equipped with a water-based IR filter and AM 1.5 filter (Sciencetech). Photocurrent–voltage characterization plots were recorded with a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 302N, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, the Netherlands). The monochromator was scanned through the UV-vis region to generate the IPCE plot as defined by IPCE = 1240(Jsc/ωλ), where Jsc is the short-circuit photocurrent (mA cm−2), ω is the incident irradiative flux (W cm−2), and λ is the wavelength. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained on the above-mentioned potentiostat/galvanostat equipped with an FRA2 module under constant light illumination of 100 mW cm−2 and in the dark. The frequency range employed was from 65 kHz to 0.07 Hz. The applied bias voltage was set at the open circuit voltage of the DSSCs under illumination and at −0.7 V in the dark. The ac amplitude for both was set at 10 mV. The measurements for open-circuit potential decay transients of the DSSC were carried out using the same potentiostat/galvanostat and a green light-emitting diode (LXHL-NM98, Luxeon, 530 nm) as light source, whose power from LEDs applied on the DSSC was 20 mW cm−2.


RuAS dye synthesized according to the route illustrated in Fig. 1 was characterized by 1H, 13C and HSQC NMR, UV-vis, FTIR and ESI-MS spectra. Its 1H NMR spectrum shown in Fig. 2(a) reveals that the pyridyl ring protons in the bipyridine ligand which tethers two styrylaminocarbonyl side chains have two different resonance peaks electronically in different environments, indicating that the ligands are coordinated to the ruthenium center in cis-heteroleptic complex form. Interestingly, the RuAS dimer was frequently formed by intermolecular interaction between dicarboxylic anions from one dye and amide hydrogen groups from another dye, as indicated in Fig. 2(b), if the content of carboxylic salts was not controlled properly during purification of RuAS. Trace amount of dimers are still observable in Fig. 2(a) for purified RuAS. The 13C NMR spectrum of RuAS shows two resonance peaks at 133.29 and 133.32 ppm assigned to the carbons of the N-coordinated NCS ligands besides the pyridine peaks (see ESI, Fig. S1). All of the NMR peaks have been assigned and confirmed by HSQC NMR spectrum (see ESI, Fig. S2).

UV-vis absorption spectra of RuAS dissolved in the co-solvent of ACN and tert-butanol (volume ratio of 1:1) at a concentration range of 1–100 μM are shown in Fig. 3. The high energy absorption peaks at 254 and 308 nm are attributed to the π–π* transitions for bsacbpy and dcbpy ligands, whereas the low energy peaks at 393 and 541 nm are attributed to the metal-to-ligand charge transfer transitions (MLCT), whose molar extinction coefficients (ε) are 14250 and 11883 M−1 cm−1 estimated from Beer's law, A = εlc, where A is the absorption intensity, l is the path length and c is the concentration. Compared with Ru(4,4′-dicarboxyl-2,2′-bipyridine)(4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine)(NCS)2 (denoted as Ru2A) dye, RuAS has higher ε due to the electron-withdrawing amide groups containing in the bsacbpy ligand (see ESI, Fig. S3).
ATR-FTIR spectra of RuAS adsorbed on the mesoporous TiO2 film after background correction for mesoporous TiO2 film were shown in Fig. 4(a). The absorption band at 2106 cm−1 was attributed to the stretching of the NCS ligand, those at 3300 and 1670 cm−1 were attributed to v(N–H) and v(CO) of the amide group, and those at 1599 and 1385 cm−1 were attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching bands of carboxylate groups. According to Deacon and Phillips, the frequency difference, Δv = vasym.(COO−) − vsym.(COO−), can be used to determine the binding mode of the dye on the mesoporous TiO2 surface. The Δv value of 214 cm−1 for RuAS suggests the dye has anchored onto the mesoporous TiO2 surface using a bidentate chelating mode.

ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was used to investigate the chelating I3− capability of RuAS which has been chemisorbed on the mesoporous TiO2 film. First, a few drops of 0.2 M LiI mixed with 0.2 M I2 in methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) were added onto the film and fully dried. The change of IR spectrum was monitored as shown in Fig. 4(a). The broad peaks at 3300 cm−1v(N–H) and 1657 cm−1v(CO) corresponding to amide groups clearly shifted and increased in strength, indicating the chelating interactions of amide hydrogen groups with triiodide anions (NH⋯I3−). Notably, barely any change was observed when I2 was not added to produce LiI3 (see Fig. 4(b)). As the film was rinsed with acetone to remove LiI3 and dried, the affected peaks were restored to their original positions, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Apparently, the chelating process is reversible. Chelating evidence for I3− rather than I− by bsacbpy ligand can also be found from the 1H NMR spectra of bsacbpy mixed with LiI3 and LiI, respectively, in d6-DMSO (see ESI, Fig. S4). Because the size of the I3− anion is large enough, it is chelated by both amide hydrogen groups of RuAS dye, the chelating structure of which was simulated by ChemBio3D software (see ESI, Fig. S5).


The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristic plots of the DSSCs with RuAS and liquid electrolyte containing 0.6 M PMII, 0.10 M LiI, 0.1 M GuNCS, 0.5 M TBP, and various concentrations of I2 in MPN under AM 1.5 full sunlight (100 mW cm−2 illumination) were shown in Fig. 5(a) with their photovoltaic properties listed in Table 1. I2, being added to the liquid electrolyte, will react with I− to form I3−, as shown in the following equation:

Because the equilibrium constant is rather high in organic solvent and the total I− source (LiI plus PMII) is 0.7 M, I2 nearly transformed into I3−. As the concentration of I2 in the liquid electrolyte increased from nil to 0.03 M, the short circuit current density (Jsc) of the DSSC increased by 45% and then decreased as the concentration further increased to 0.2 M. Because the total concentration of I− was 0.7 M, as 0.03 M I2 was added to consume I−, it would not noticeably affect the dye regeneration rate. However, at high concentration of I2 (over 0.1 M), the concentration of I− would be reduced and delay the dye regeneration rate. On the other hand, I3− is responsible for the reduction reaction in the counter electrode of the DSSC, as shown in the following equation:
I−3 + 2e− → 3I−
(2)
If I2 was not added to the electrolyte, the source of I3− would only come from the dye regeneration in the photoelectrode by performing the reverse reaction of eqn (2). Because only a small amount of I3− was obtained from dye regeneration, the photocurrent was significantly reduced, as shown in Fig. 5(a). In addition, the charge recombination rate at the mesoporous TiO2–electrolyte interface was also reduced, leading to the highest Voc. Although the addition of a small amount of I2 to the electrolyte substantially decreased Voc, further increase of I2 concentration from 0.01 to 0.2 M. barely changed Voc, as shown in Fig. 5(a) and Table 1. It has been reported that Voc of the DSSC with N3 dye and liquid electrolyte almost linearly decreased as the concentration of I3− was increased from 0.01 to 0.05 M in logarithmic scale. Besides, the Voc of DSSCs with Ru2A which contains the 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine ligand gradually decreased from 0.703 to 0.639 V as the concentration of I2 was increased from 0.01 to 0.2 M (see ESI, Fig. S6 and Table S1).
Because RuAS dye is capable of chelating I3−, few I3− anions could make contact with the TiO2 mesoporous layer. Therefore, even increasing the I2 concentration to 0.2 M did not noticeably affect Voc. To investigate the electron-withdrawing effect of amide groups in the bsacbpy ligand of the RuAS dye on the photocurrent, we have compared the IPCE spectrum of RuAS dye in DSSCs with Ru2A dye. Both IPCE spectra shown in Fig. 5(b) are similar except that the DSSC with RuAS has a higher IPCE in the visible light region from 500 to 800 nm wavelength. The higher IPCE for RuAS dye is obviously attributed to its higher molar extinction coefficient related to the electron-withdrawing amide groups (see ESI, Fig. S3). All IPCE spectra of DSSCs with RuAS compared to Ru2A with various concentrations of I2 are also provided in the ESI (see Fig. S7). After all, compared to Ru2A dye, RuAS dye not only has a higher Jsc, but Voc is also enhanced since the amide groups are capable of chelating I3−.

The EIS technique is often used to characterize the kinetics of DSSCs by analysing the variation in impedance associated with the different interfaces of cells. In this work, by varying I2 concentrations in the liquid electrolyte, the Nyquist plots were measured at the Voc of the DSSCs under 1.5 AM full sunlight. By choosing an appropriate equivalent circuit model, shown in Fig. 6(a), the Nyquist plots of the DSSCs were fitted with Z-view software (see Fig. 6(b)) and the results are also listed in Table 1. Its main three semicircles, from low to high impedance, are related to the Pt–electrolyte interface with the resistance R1, the dye-sensitized TiO2 film–electrolyte interface with the resistance R2 and electrolyte diffusion with the resistance R3. In the DSSCs with the I2 containing electrolyte, the R2 values are similar. However, R3 reduced substantially with increasing concentration of I2. Notably, the increase of fill factor from 0.55 ± 0.01 to 0.65 ± 0.01 by increasing the concentration of I2 from 0.05 to 0.1 M might be related to the faster charge transportation or smaller R3 in the electrolyte (see Table 1).

In the Bode phase plot, the second characteristic peak at the frequency (f), associated with the electron transfer rate at the TiO2 and electrolyte interface, had shifted to higher frequency as 0.01 M I2 was added to the liquid electrolyte. The electron lifetime (τr) calculated by the following equation,
τr = 1/2πf
(3)
, due to charge recombination was reduced from 20.75 to 12.32 ms. Further increase of I
2 concentration from 0.01 to 0.05 M barely changed the charge recombination rate. It is noteworthy that the concentration of I− was much higher than that of I3− in this concentration range. However, as the I2 concentration was increased to 0.1 M, τr decreased to 7.31 ms along with the decrease of Jsc. This implied that the competition between the charge recombination and dye regeneration rates had taken place simultaneously at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interfaces. Because the number of injected charges in the TiO2 layer was decreased by reducing the charge regeneration rate, the total number of recombined charges in the interface might not be affected as τr decreased, which explains why Voc was not affected as the I2 concentration was increased to 0.1 M.

In dark conditions, we also measured the impedance spectra of the DSSC with RuAS dye using the Nyquist plots and Bode plots, as shown in Fig. 7, and the data obtained by the equivalent circuit model and eqn (3) are listed in Table 2. R′2 in the dark is more than ten times larger than R2 under illumination for all the DSSCs and decreased with the content of I2 in the electrolyte, unless the concentration of I2 is higher than 0.1 M. Obviously, under high impedance the charge in the TiO2 layer was able to perform the charge recombination, even if I3− was located far from TiO2. The electron lifetime, τ′r, due to charge recombination in the dark is also ten times longer than τr under illumination for all the DSSCs and decreased with the content of I2 in the electrolyte. Higher concentration of I3− in the vicinity of the TiO2 layer indeed increased the charge recombination of the DSSC if time for recombination was long enough.

The measurement of open-circuit potential decay transients developed by Duffy and Hagfeldt et al. was used to investigate the electron transport in the DSSCs. The DSSC was illuminated for 5 seconds at 20 mW cm−2 under open-circuit conditions, and then the voltage (Vd) was left to decay for a certain period of time (td) in the dark. The measured Vdversus td plots for the DSSCs with RuAS and liquid electrolyte containing various I2 concentrations in the liquid electrolyte are shown in Fig. 8.

The onset of Vd (i.e., Vd,o) appeared at 0.75 V for the DSSC without I2 in the liquid electrolyte. As 0.01 M I2 was added to the liquid electrolyte, Vd,o decreased to 0.72 V. With further increase of I2 concentration to 0.2 M, Vd,o only decreased to 0.7 V. The change of Vd,o with increasing content of I2 in the liquid electrolyte is similar to that of Voc for the DSSCs illuminated at full sunlight, as shown in Table 1. However, as the content of I2 in the liquid electrolyte increased, Vd decayed faster after 0.1 s in the dark (see Fig. 8). This indicated that although I3− was chelated by RuAS, more free I3− anions in the vicinity of the TiO2 layer would have higher chance of charge recombination, resulting in a higher descending rate of Vd after 0.1 s.

RuAS dye is capable of chelating I3− anions, which was confirmed by ART-FTIR and 1H-NMR spectroscopies. With increasing I2 concentration in the liquid electrolyte, Voc of the DSSC barely changed owing to the fact that the I3− anions in the liquid electrolyte were chelated by RuAS dye and free I3− anions located far from the mesoporous TiO2 layer play a lesser role in the charge recombination reaction.
