Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention due to their high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and low fabrication cost. The composition of the precursor solution determines the compositions of perovskite films. Excess precursor(s) may be used in the solution for the fabrication of perovskite films. However, it is still unclear how an excess precursor like PbI2 affects the structure and properties of the perovskite layer and the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. In this work, we investigated the effect of excess PbI2 that has a large bandgap on the electronic structure and properties of perovskite films and the photophysics and photovoltaic performance of PSCs. The presence of slightly excess PbI2 can affect the crystal structure and thus shift the Fermi level of perovskites. It can increase the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and thus the PCE of PSCs. However, the presence of a large amount of excess PbI2 is detrimental to the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. It can shorten the carrier lifetime, increase the resistance of the perovskite films, and decrease the fill factor (FF) and PCE of PSCs.

Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention because of their low fabrication cost, high light absorption coefficient, high charge carrier mobility, long charge diffusion length, tunable band gap and high power conversion efficiency. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) is usually 15–20% for PSCs fabricated by the two-step sequential deposition or one-step deposition with solvent engineering. There are mainly two types of PSCs in terms of the device architecture, one with a mesoporous oxide layer and the other with a planar structure. Significant progress has been made in planar PSCs with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as the hole transport material and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the electron transport material. The fabrication of these planar PSCs can avoid the high temperature annealing process which is required for the mesoporous metal oxide layer. To obtain highly efficient planar PSCs, a homogenous perovskite thin film must be obtained to lower the leakage current. Several methods have been reported to deposit perovskite films, such as vapor phase deposition, sequential deposition, one-step solution coating, and solvent engineering. The experimental conditions during the deposition saliently affect the quality of perovskite films and the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.

Perovskite thin films have a polycrystalline structure and grain boundaries. Recently, two groups suggested that the grain boundaries (GBs) could be beneficial to the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. In addition, Yang's group reported that PbI2 formed at the GBs can alter the energy band bending of GBs from downward to upward and thus reduce the carrier recombination near GBs. They also suggested that PbI2 could effectively improve the photovoltaic performance by passivating the grains. However, the excess PbI2 in the perovskite thin films of those studies was produced by the decomposition of perovskites. It is thus difficult to control the amount of the excess PbI2. Recently, Seok's group reported that incorporating a certain amount of PbI2 into perovskite could improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs because it could inhibit ion migration. In addition, it can reduce the hysteresis between the reverse and forward current–voltage scans. Nazeeruddin and co-workers observed improvements in both the photovoltaic efficiency and the stability when PbI2 and MAI at a non-stoichiometric ratio were used in the precursor solution. They found that PbI2 could increase the crystallinity of the perovskite layer and facilitate electron transfer from the perovskite layer to TiO2. Emara et al. studied the ionization energy of the perovskite films prepared from solutions of various PbI2-to-MAI ratios. They observed that the ionization energy could vary from 5.67 to 6.4 eV. It was ascribed to the incorporation of an excess precursor into the perovskite films. The excess precursor is present as interstitials in the perovskite material rather than a separate phase. PbI2 nanostructures were also exploited to improve the formation of perovskite films and photovoltaic performance of PSCs.
The perovskite layer of PSCs is usually prepared by solution processing. Its composition is thus determined by the PbI2-to-MAI ratio in the precursor solution. A stoichiometric (1:1) or non-stoichiometric (3:1) PbI2-to-MAI ratio is used for the preparation of the perovskite layer. The PbI2-to-MAI ratio can substantially affect the perovskite film quality and device performance. In addition, the excess precursor may be intentionally induced in the fabrication processes. For example, a PbI2 film is immersed into a MAI solution for the sequential deposition of a perovskite film. It usually takes a long time for the PbI2 layer to convert into perovskite, and some unreacted PbI2 may be present in the final perovskite film. But the effects of the excess PbI2 on the structure and properties of the perovskite films and the photovoltaic performance of PSCs are not clear.
In this study, the molar ratio of PbI2 to MAI in the precursor solution is tuned from 1.4:1.2 to 1.4:1.5 to investigate the effect of excess PbI2 or MAI on the structure and properties of the perovskite films and photovoltaic performance of PSCs. At a high PbI2-to-MAI ratio, the excess PbI2 can decrease the light absorption of the perovskite films. It could affect the energy band structure of perovskites and the charge carrier transport at the GB and perovskite surface as well. As a result, it can increase the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and thus the PCE of the PSCs. In contrast, at a low PbI2-to-MAI ratio, the excess MAI can increase the series resistance that lowers the PCE of PSCs.

MAPbI3 is formed as a result of the chemical reaction of PbI2 with MAI. The reaction is reversible, that is, MAPbI3 can decompose into PbI2 and MAI. When MAPbI3 is formed from a solution with a PbI2-to-MAI ratio of 1:1, PbI2 undergoes three stages: (1) the presence of PbI2 before the reaction with MAI, (2) the complete conversion of PbI2 into perovskite, and (3) the generation of excess PbI2 as a result of the decomposition of MAPbI3. Since PbI2 is a semiconductor with a large band gap, the incorporation of PbI2 into the crystal structure of MAPbI3 may affect the energy levels of MAPbI3 which is also a semiconductor with a low band gap.

In order to investigate the roles of PbI2 in the perovskite films, precursor solutions with various ratios (1.4:1.2, 1.4:1.3, 1.4:1.4, and 1.4:1.5) of PbI2 to MAI were used to fabricate the perovskite layer of planar PSCs. The current density (J)–voltage (V) curves of PSCs are presented in Fig. 1, and the photovoltaic performances are summarized in Table 1. The PbI2 amount affects the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. The Voc value of the PSC prepared with the PbI2-to-MAI ratio of 1.4:1.3 is around 1.02 V, which is higher than that (0.97 V) with the PbI2-to-MAI ratio of 1.4:1.4. But increasing the PbI2-to-MAI ratio to 1.4:1.2 does not further increase the Voc. However, the Voc value decreases to 0.95 V when the PbI2-to-MAI ratio is lowered to 1.4:1.5. The smaller Voc value indicates a larger potential loss of the PSCs. The Voc/Eg ratio can be used for the potential loss. The Voc/Eg ratios are 0.64, 0.64, 0.61, and 0.60 for the devices with the PbI2-to-MAI ratios of 1.4:1.2, 1.4:1.3, 1.4:1.4, and 1.4:1.5, respectively. The Voc/Eg value is lower for the device with lower PbI2-to-MAI ratios, which indicates a larger potential loss. The Voc is affected by the compositions of the perovskite films. Presumably, the PbI2-to-MAI ratio can affect the energy levels of the perovskite film because excess PbI2 can induce n-doping of perovskite and deficient PbI2 can lead to p-doping of perovskite. Apart from Voc, the PbI2 amount in the perovskite layer also affects other photovoltaic parameters. The short-circuit current (Jsc) of the device with a PbI2-to-MAI ratio of 1.4:1.4 is 20.3 mA cm−2, which is higher than that of the devices with other PbI2-to-MAI ratios. The PCE as a function of the PbI2-to-MAI ratio is shown in Fig. 1b. It can be seen that a higher PbI2-to-MAI ratio gives rise to a larger distribution in the PCE. This is similar to that reported in the literature. The PSCs with lower PbI2-to-MAI ratios exhibit better reproducibility in PCE.

It is important to understand the effect of the excess PbI2 or MAI on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. When there is excess PbI2 or MAI in the perovskite films, the light absorption by PbI2 or MAI is negligible in comparison with perovskite. But they can affect the quality of the perovskite layer by inducing defects, which can inhibit the charge transport. Therefore, to carefully control the PbI2-to-MAI ratio in the precursor solution is important to obtain high-performance devices. These results also suggest that the presence of excess MAI can lower Voc and Jsc although it could accelerate the perovskite formation. We found that the optimal PbI2-to-MAI ratio is 1.4:1.35. The J–V curve of an optimal device with a champion efficiency of 16.2% is presented in Fig. 1c.
The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) curves of PSCs are shown in Fig. S1. The PbI2-to-MAI ratios could affect the photon-to-electricity conversion efficiency between 400 and 740 nm. The calculated Jsc values in terms of the IPCEs are 16.1, 18.9, 19.7, and 18.5 mA cm−2 for the devices with PbI2-to-MAI ratios of 1.4:1.2, 1.4:1.3, 1.4:1.4, and 1.4:1.5, respectively. They are generally consistent with the Jsc values of the PSCs obtained from the J–V characteristics.
The reproducibility of the devices with the PbI2-to-MAI ratios of 1.4:1.3 and 1.4:1.35 was also checked (Fig. 1d). The devices with the PbI2-to-MAI ratio of 1.4:1.35 have a narrow PCE distribution ranging from 13.8% to 16.2%. This PCE distribution is narrower than that with the 1.4:1.3 ratio.
The hysteresis in the J–V curves of the PSCs was also studied at different scan directions and scan rates (Fig. 2 and S2). The J–V curves were recorded along the forward and reverse directions with a scan step of 10 mV and different delay times for the devices under AM1.5G illumination. The forward and reverse J–V curves of the PSC with the PbI2-to-MAI ratio of 1.4:1.35 coincide well. However, when the PbI2-to-MAI ratio is increased to 1.4:1.2, there is obvious hysteresis along the two scan directions. The hysteresis is probably caused by the charge carrier trapping/de-trapping. The excess PbI2 may act as the trapping sites in the perovskite layer.
In addition, one important point need to be mentioned is that the excess PbI2 could retard the perovskite conversion as evidenced by the transparent colour of the perovskite thin film after spin coating, which is different from the light brown colour of the control perovskite films with excess MAI. This finding can be used to understand the immediate colour change after a PbI2 film is dipped into a MAI solution in the sequential deposition method because of the presence of excess MAI in the solution. However, we observed that excess MAI is detrimental to the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. The photovoltaic performances of planar PSCs fabricated by sequential deposition are presented in Fig. S3 and Table S1. The PCEs are quite low. The highest PCE is only 5.6%. One possible reason for the low PCEs is the presence of excess MAI in the perovskite layer of the PSCs.
For the sequential deposition or two-step spin coating deposition of perovskite films, PbI2 and MAI in orthogonal solvents were spun/dipped onto the substrates sequentially, followed by thermal annealing. During the perovskite formation, the total process could be divided into three stages: (1) the presence of excess PbI2 arising from the incomplete conversion of precursors into perovskite, (2) the complete conversion of PbI2 into the perovskite, and (3) the presence of excess MAI due to the remaining solution in the perovskite films. In terms of the different effects of PbI2 and MAI on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, different performances can be expected for the perovskite films formed at different stages. At the first stage, there is excess PbI2. The excess PbI2 can give rise to high Voc, and low Jsc and FF for the PSCs. In contrast, MAI becomes excess in the third stage. The excess MAI can increase the series resistance and thus can lead to the decrease in both Jsc and Voc of PSCs.
The Voc of PSCs is determined by the energy levels of perovskites, particularly the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the electron donor (perovskite) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the electron acceptor (PCBM).Fig. 3 schematically presents the energy diagram of the materials in PSCs. The LUMO level of CH3NH3PbI3 is higher than that of PCBM while its HOMO lies below the Fermi level of PEDOT:PSS. The contacts between the perovskite layer and the two charge collection layers are thus ohmic. If the HOMO level of CH3NH3PbI3 can be lowered down, it can increase the Voc of PSCs. The energy levels of perovskite and PbI2 thin films were examined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. 4). The UPS spectra indicate that the Fermi level of MAPbI3 prepared from the precursor solution with a PbI2-to-MAI ratio of 1.4:1.2 or 1.4:1.3 is lower by 0.02–0.06 eV than that from the precursor solution with a PbI2-to-MAI ratio of 1.4:1.4. This result is consistent with that reported by Emara et al. They found that the ionization energy of perovskites can be varied by changing the stoichiometry. The valence band maximum (VBM) of the MAPbI3 film prepared from the solution with the PbI2-to-MAI ratio of 1.4:1.4 is around 5.7 eV according to its UPS spectrum. As its bandgap is about 1.6 eV, the conduction band minimum (CBM) of MAPbI3 is around 4.1 eV. For PbI2, the CBM and VBM are 3.4 and 5.8 eV, respectively, as determined from the UV-vis and UPS spectra (Fig. S4). Hence, the presence of excess PbI2 that has a large band gap in perovskite materials can shift the Fermi level and the valence band down, leading to the increase in Voc.
The UV-vis absorption spectra were measured to probe the excess PbI2 effect on the light absorption of perovskites. All the perovskite films have strong absorption over the entire UV-visible range (Fig. 5a). The light absorption of the perovskite film with excess PbI2 is lower than that of the other samples. The decrease in light absorption leads to low current densities of the PSCs. Although the absorption onset seems to be the same for all the perovskite films with different PbI2-to-MAI ratios, a careful investigation indicates that the absorption of the perovskite film prepared from the solution with a PbI2-to-MAI ratio of 1.4:1.2 slightly shifts to blue. This blueshift suggests a slightly larger band gap. This is probably caused by the decrease in the crystal size and/or by the I vacancies or Pb vacancies.
The XRD patterns were measured to investigate the PbI2 effect on the crystallinity of the perovskite thin films. As shown in Fig. 5b and S5, similar diffraction patterns were observed for the perovskite films prepared from the precursor solutions of different PbI2-to-MAI ratios. The strong diffraction peaks at around 14.2°, 28.5°, and 31.9° are assigned to (110), (220), and (310) crystal planes of the tetragonal perovskite phase, respectively. Their intensities indicate a highly crystalline nature with the (110) plane as the preferential orientation. The diffraction intensity first increases with increasing MAI content from 1.2 M to 1.4 M due to the increased perovskite content, and then decreases because the excess MAI induces a disordered structure, which is probably caused by the ion migration of MA+. The relative intensity of the PbI2 peak at around 12.8° gradually decreases with increasing MAI content, which indicates that more PbI2 is converted to perovskite in the saturated MAI atmosphere. This is also consistent with the results reported in the literature that the PbI2 patterns disappear when excess MAI is used.
The effect of the precursors on the crystalline structure of perovskites is further confirmed by the SEM images of the perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 6 and S6, some species appear on the surface or grain boundaries of the perovskite films. Those species show a relatively high contrast in comparison with the underlying perovskite grains, because they are less conductive. They correspond to excess PbI2 as revealed by XRD. The dark grains that prevail in the thin films are perovskite, and they correspond to the most intensive peaks in XRD. No obvious excess PbI2 species could be observed for 1.4:1.4 and 1.4:1.5 ratio-based perovskite thin films.
Scanning Kelvin Probe Microscopy (SKPM) is employed to further examine the surface and grain boundaries of the perovskite films. The SKPM technique can provide information about the average surface potential of the perovskite films and determine the surface potential difference between the boundary and center of grains. Moreover, band bending at the grain boundaries can be determined with the help of this technique. Spatial maps of topography and surface potential for perovskite thin films in the dark and under light are shown in Fig. S7. There is a drift between the two surface potentials due to thermal oscillation. The average surface potential is −56 mV for the perovskite film in the dark, and it decreases to −305 mV for the film under a light illumination of 250 W m−2. This difference indicates that the work function (ϕ) of the perovskite film increases upon the light illumination as ϕsample = ϕtip − e × VCPD with VCPD as the contact potential difference. This becomes more obvious for the line profiles (Fig. S7). The surface potential difference between the grain boundary and grain center of the perovskite films was also compared. The surface potential at the grain boundaries (in the dark) is lower than that of the center by ∼30–40 mV, that is, the work function of the grain boundary is higher than the grain center. This indicates the presence of a small potential barrier for electron transport among grains due to the upward bending of the conduction band.
To further understand the effect of excess PbI2 on the photoconversion processes of perovskite thin films, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL measurements were carried out to study these thin films. The steady-state PL is performed for perovskite films on quartz (Fig. 7a). The perovskite thin film with a PbI2-to-MAI ratio of 1:1 exhibits a PL emission much stronger than that with excess PbI2 or MAI.
The PL lifetime of perovskite films on glass was measured. Perovskite thin films are known to have two-carrier recombination. The excitation by high power can result in fast PL decay. The time-resolved PL measurements were performed under a low power density (10.0 µJ cm−2). The PL decay curves together with the bi-exponentially fitting are shown in Fig. 7b. The fitted parameters are summarized in Table S2.τ1 and τ2 are the lifetimes of fast decay and slow decay, respectively. The τ2 values are 10.21, 13.83, 24.04 and 5.54 ns for the perovskite thin films prepared from the solutions with the PbI2-to-MAI ratios of 1.4:1.2, 1.4:1.3, 1.4:1.4 and 1.4:1.5, respectively. The steady state and time-resolved PL studies indicate that the 1.4:1.4 ratio-based thin films have high PL and slow PL decay rates. These can be attributed to the low defect density in the perovskite film. The presence of excess PbI2 changes the optical properties. Compared to the 1.4:1.4 ratio-based films, the 1.4:1.2 ratio-based perovskite film exhibits a shorter PL lifetime, which arises from faster carrier recombination. This is consistent with the device performance. These results suggest that the device performance can be further enhanced by carefully optimizing the precursor compositions.

We have studied the effects of excess PbI2 on the properties of perovskite thin films and the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Slightly excess PbI2 can enhance the Voc value of the PSCs from 0.95 V to 1.03 V, which is ascribed to the PbI2-induced change in the electronic structure of the perovskite films. The PCE of the devices could reach up to 16.2% by using an optimal PbI2-to-MAI ratio of 1.4:1.35. This study suggests that intentionally introducing a small amount of excess PbI2 can be helpful for the improvement of the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. This work provides a simple and effective approach for the optimization of PSCs.


Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates (15 ohm □−1) were supplied by the NSG group. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP Al 4083) was purchased from Heraeus Holding GmbH. MAI was obtained from Dyesol Ltd. [6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was bought from Nano-C Inc. Other materials, including lead(II) iodide (PbI2 beads, 99.999% purity), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous, ≥99.9% purity), γ-butyrolactone (GBL, ≥99% purity), LiF (≥99% purity), chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.8% purity) and toluene (anhydrous, 99.5% purity), were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. All materials were used without further purification.


ITO glass substrates were cleaned sequentially by sonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 20 min each. After drying under a N2 stream, these substrates were further cleaned with UV-ozone for 15 min. A PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP 4083 filtered through a 0.45 µm filter) layer with a thickness of ∼30 nm was spin-coated onto ITO substrates at 6000 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 140 °C for 15 min in air. The substrates were then transferred into a N2-filled glovebox for the deposition of the perovskite layer. The perovskite layer was formed by spin coating solutions consisting of 1.4 M PbI2 and 1.2–1.5 M MAI in a co-solvent of DMSO:GBL (3:7 vol. ratio) at 1000 rpm for 20 s. Toluene was dripped after 20 s at 5000 rpm. Then, the substrates were annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. The thickness of the perovskite thin films is around 260 nm as determined by a surface step profiler. The electron-transporting layer was then deposited by spin coating 20 mg mL−1 of PCBM in chlorobenzene at 2000 rpm for 1 min. LiF (0.5 nm) and Al (100 nm) were thermally deposited in a high vacuum (<1 × 10−6 Torr) through a shadow mask. Each device had an area of 0.11 cm2. The complete solar cells were encapsulated with epoxy and cover glass slides and then tested in air. All J–V curves of PSCs were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source/meter unit. The photocurrent was measured for the devices exposed to AM1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2) that was accurately calibrated with a standard Si photodiode detector. The incident photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained with a setup consisting of a xenon lamp (Oriel, 300 W) as the light source, a Cornerstone 260 Oriel 74125 monochromator, and a lock-in amplifier (SR830, Stanford Research Corp). It was calibrated with a Si-based diode (J115711-1-Si detector).


X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired using a Bruker D8 Advance XRD instrument. Absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained with a Zeiss Supra-40 SEM. The film thickness was determined by using a surface profilometer (KLA Tencor, Alpha-Step IQ). Photoluminescence spectra were obtained by using a LS 55 fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer). The wavelength of the excited light was 410 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra were collected with a diode laser (NanoLED) as the excitation source. The repetition rate was 10 MHz. The wavelength was 438 nm, and the pulse duration was ∼260 ps. The scattering of excitation light was eliminated by using a two 600 nm long pass filter. Photoluminescence spectra were acquired using an avalanche photon diode (Micro photon device, PicoQuant) attached to a time-correlated single photon counting card (TCSPC PicoHarp 300, PicoQuant). Scanning Kelvin Probe Microscopy (SKPM) was carried out with a commercial SPM system (MFP-3D, Asylum Research 13.09.91, USA) to determine the contact potential difference (CPD), i.e., the work function difference between the probe and the sample in air. The low contact potential difference (CPD) indicates a closer work function between the probe and sample. In the SKPM measurement, commercial platinum-coated conductive probes (AC240TM-R3, Olympus, Japan) were used. The SKPM mode, which combines a two pass technique, can measure the topography and surface potential of the same area. The scanning area and line scan rate were 5 µm × 5 µm and 1 Hz, respectively. Between the two passes a lift height of 40 nm was used. The drive amplitude, i.e., an AC voltage of 3 V, was applied to the conductive cantilever. Scanning Kelvin Probe Microscopy (SKPM) characterization was performed on the perovskite films under dark (<1 W m−2) and light conditions (300 W m−2) in order to study the effect of illumination on the contact potential difference.
