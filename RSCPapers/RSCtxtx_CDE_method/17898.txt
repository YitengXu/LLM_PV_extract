A wide-bandgap copolymer donor PPN4T-2F based on a phenanthridin-6(5H)-one unit was developed. PPN4T-2F has a large optical bandgap of 2.15 eV and a deep highest occupied molecular orbital level of −5.43 eV. Solar cells based on PPN4T-2F and a nonfullerene acceptor, IT-4F, afforded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.54%. PPN4T-2F is comparable to the efficient ultra-wide-bandgap copolymer donors.

Donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymer donors are key materials for bulk-heterojunction solar cells. They have important functions like harvesting photons, transporting holes and constructing an interpenetrating network in the active layer. During past decades, research efforts have been focused on medium- and low-bandgap copolymers (optical bandgap (Eoptg) < 1.8 eV) due to their good light-harvesting capability and high performance in fullerene-based solar cells. With the emergence of efficient acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) nonfullerene acceptors in recent years, wide-bandgap (WBG) D–A copolymers (Eoptg > 1.8 eV) have attracted great attention. WBG copolymers and low-bandgap nonfullerene acceptors show complementary light-absorption, and their blend films can harvest most of the sunlight and generate high photocurrent. Meanwhile, WBG copolymers have deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels, favoring high open-circuit voltage (Voc). WBG copolymer solar cells have delivered >16% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). WBG copolymers, especially those with ultra-wide bandgaps (i.e. Eoptg > 2.07 eV, absorption onset <600 nm), have received great interest in ternary solar cells and tandem solar cells. However, high-performance ultra-WBG copolymer donors are quite limited. Developing efficient ultra-WBG copolymers is necessary. Phenanthridin-6(5H)-one (PN) is a readily available aromatic lactam building block. The PN unit is very suitable for constructing ultra-WBG copolymer donors. First, PN contains two highly aromatic benzene rings, which facilitate bandgap widening. Second, its strong electron-accepting capability lowers the HOMO levels, enhancing Voc. Third, its good planarity facilitates π–π stacking, improving the hole mobility of the copolymers. In this work, we report the synthesis of a PN-based ultra-WBG copolymer donor, PPN4T-2F (Fig. 1). PPN4T-2F exhibits a large Eoptg of 2.15 eV and a deep HOMO of −5.43 eV. Solar cells based on PPN4T-2F and a nonfullerene acceptor, IT-4F, gave an 8.54% PCE.

The synthetic route for PPN4T-2F is shown in Scheme S1 (ESI). PPN4T-2F shows good solubility in common solvents such as chloroform, toluene and chlorobenzene. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) for PPN4T-2F are 65.6 kDa and 2.16, respectively. The absorption spectra for PPN4T-2F in chloroform and as a film are shown in Fig. 2. In solution, PPN4T-2F shows an absorption band at 400–570 nm, with a peak at 490 nm. For the film, this peak shifts to 497 nm, and a shoulder at 531 nm appears, suggesting the enhanced aggregation in the solid state. The absorption onset for the PPN4T-2F film is 578 nm, corresponding to an Eoptg of 2.15 eV. The IT-4F film shows absorption at 500–820 nm, which is complementary with that of PPN4T-2F. The energy levels for PPN4T-2F were estimated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S6, ESI).PPN4T-2F shows a deep HOMO level of −5.43 eV and a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of −2.42 eV. The deep HOMO level of PPN4T-2F favors the production of a high Voc in solar cells. The acceptor IT-4F has a HOMO at −5.65 eV and a LUMO at −4.04 eV. We investigated the PL quenching between PPN4T-2F and IT-4F (Fig. S7, ESI). In the blend film, IT-4F quenched over 99% PL of PPN4T-2F, and PPN4T-2F quenched 96% PL of IT-4F, suggesting that the photoinduced electron transfer and hole transfer between the donor and acceptor are quite efficient.
Inverted solar cells with a structure of ITO/ZnO/PPN4T-2F:IT-4F/MoO3/Ag were made to evaluate the performance of PPN4T-2F.J–V curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively, and the performance data are listed in Table 1. The D/A ratio, active layer thickness and additive content were optimized for the solar cells (Tables S1–S5, ESI). In this work, the additives improved device performance. Solar cells without additive gave a PCE of 6.66%, with a Voc of 0.87 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 13.35 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 57.1%. The additive 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) improved FF significantly. With 1 vol% CN, FF increased to 65.9% while Voc and Jsc kept almost the same (Table S3, ESI). Another additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) enhanced Jsc effectively. With 0.6 vol% DIO, Jsc increased to 16.07 mA cm−2 while Voc decreased to 0.82 V and FF slightly increased to 59.6% (Table S4, ESI). We thus thought about using a binary additive (CN:DIO) to improve device performance. By adding 1 vol% CN and 0.6 vol% DIO into the blend, we improved both FF and Jsc. The best cells gave an 8.54% PCE, with a 0.82 V Voc, a 16.27 mA cm−2Jsc and a 64.2% FF (Table S5, ESI). The higher Jsc originates from the enhanced EQE (Fig. 3b). The solar cells with the binary additive gave higher EQE at 400–850 nm than those without additive. The maximum EQE (EQEmax) for solar cells without and with CN:DIO additive are 62% and 71%, respectively, suggesting that charge generation is more efficient in the latter. Exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss) were evaluated (Fig. S8, ESI). Pdiss for solar cells without and with additive are 92.3% and 95.3%, respectively, consistent with EQEmax. We studied bimolecular recombination by plotting Jsc against light intensity (Plight) (Fig. S9, ESI). The data were fitted to a power law: Jsc ∝ Pαlight. The values for solar cells without and with additive are 0.984 and 0.989, respectively, suggesting less charge recombination in the latter. Higher Jsc and FF and suppressed charge recombination suggest that the binary additive improved charge generation and charge transport in the active layer. We measured hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of PPN4T-2F:IT-4F blend films by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S10, S11 and Table S6, ESI). After adding CN:DIO additive, μh increased from 9.06 × 10−5 to 3.83 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe increased from 2.86 × 10−5 to 1.58 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and μh/μe decreased from 3.17 to 2.42. The charge carrier transport is relatively more balanced in the cells with the binary additive, leading to higher Jsc and FF. The morphology for the active layer without and with the CN:DIO additive was studied by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 4). After adding additive, the surface of the blend film became coarser. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness increased from 1.23 nm to 3.03 nm. The diameter for the nanofibers increased from ∼15 nm to ∼23 nm. The CN:DIO additive might promote the phase separation between PPN4T-2F and IT-4F, leading to an optimal morphology for charge generation and transport.Fig. 5 and Table S7 (ESI) summarize the photovoltaic performance of those reported ultra-WBG copolymer donors (Eoptg > 2.07 eV). PPN4T-2F is one of the few ultra-WBG copolymer donors delivering >8% PCEs in organic solar cells.

In summary, a copolymer donor PPN4T-2F based on a phenanthridin-6(5H)-one (PN) unit was developed. Owing to high aromaticity and strong electron-accepting capability of the PN unit, PPN4T-2F exhibits a large Eoptg of 2.15 eV and a deep HOMO level of −5.43 eV. PPN4T-2F:IT-4F solar cells gave a 8.54% PCE, demonstrating that PPN4T-2F is an efficient ultra-WBG donor. This polymer donor will find interesting applications in ternary solar cells and tandem solar cells.
