Two ruthenium complex dye sensitizers, Ru(NCS)2 LL′, in which L refers to 4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bipyridine and L′ stands for 4,4′-di(m-X-benzoic acid)-2,2′-bipyridine (X = H (RC-73), F (RC-76)), were designed and synthesized to investigate the influence of introducing phenyl-based bipyridine anchoring ligands and the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells based on them. With the modification of conventional 4,4′-dicarboxylic-2,2′-bipyridyl anchoring ligands with phenyl-based bipyridine units, both RC dyes show superior photophysical and electrochemical properties, resulting in excellent device performance. Remarkably, with the enhancement of the electron-withdrawing ability of X, RC-76 has more satisfactory properties in absorption intensity, redox potential, electron transport and dye regeneration, which can be confirmed by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetric measurement, density functional theory calculations and transient absorption spectroscopy. The devices based on RC-76 achieve a short-circuit current density of 17.52 mA cm−2 and a power conversion efficiency of 9.23%. The kinetics study and electrical impedance spectroscopy explain the causes of the inferior open-circuit voltage of RC dyes compared to that of standard Z907 dye. RC dyes, represented by RC-76, exhibit good long-term stability and the corresponding solar cells retain over 90% of the initial power conversion efficiency after 1000 h.

After nearly 30 years of deeper research and development, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are moving to commercial applications and industrial production due to their low-cost manufacturing process and high power conversion efficiency. In DSSCs, dye sensitizers are considered to be the crucial components that dominate the light absorption and charge separation. Particularly, ruthenium complex sensitizers have attracted researchers’ attention due to their outstanding photoelectrical properties and devices based on ruthenium sensitizers achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼11% under AM 1.5G illumination. Ligand modification is an effective strategy to develop ruthenium sensitizers with superior photoelectric performance and excellent stability, which mainly focuses on improving short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and outdoor environment durability.

Wang et al. reported the Z907 dye with 4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bipyridine to achieve a superior high temperature stability and satisfactory Voc combined with a quasi-solid-state polymer gel electrolyte in 2003. Based on the current molecular modification strategies, Z907 as an excellent dye sensitizer has great potential for development, especially in improving the spectral response range and electron transport efficiency. To achieve the above purposes, the characteristic ancillary ligand 4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bipyridine of Z907 should be retained and the molecular modifications focusing on the anchoring groups carried out from the following two aspects: (i) extending the π-conjugation of the anchoring ligand by introducing aromatic groups to further expand the spectrum and increase the molar extinction coefficient in the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) bands; (ii) introducing electron-withdrawing moieties to the anchoring ligands. The highest occupied molecular (HOMO)/the lowest unoccupied molecular (LUMO) energy levels can be adjusted by electron-rich groups to promote the processes of electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band and dye regeneration, which can decrease charge recombination, improving the charge transfer efficiency. Previously, we have reported a series of ligand-based ruthenium dyes in which electron acceptor-modified dyes play an active role in adjusting HOMO/LUMO energy levels and enhancing the photocurrent of devices.
With the purpose of verifying and achieving the above assumptions, ruthenium complex sensitizers RC-73 and RC-76 (Scheme 1) were designed and synthesized with two phenyl-based bipyridine anchoring ligands, in which the phenyl units are attached to the carboxylic acid groups as the π-linker to increase the molar extinction coefficient and obtain a red-shift of the MLCT absorption band. To further explore the influence of the strength of the electron-withdrawing on the anchoring groups, fluorine as an electron-acceptor was applied to modify the preceding anchoring ligand. Both dyes contain 4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bipyridine acting as an ancillary ligand for superior high temperature stability and satisfactory Voc. The relevant photophysical and electrochemical properties of RC dyes were carefully studied and characterized. Additionally, the photovoltaic performance of the fabricated solar cells based on RC dye sensitizers was investigated and compared with the Z907 dye sensitizer.

Two phenyl-based bipyridine anchoring ligands, Ligand-1 and Ligand-2, were obtained using the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction. On the basis of obtaining ligands, RC dye sensitizers were prepared using classical one-pot reactions. The detailed synthetic routes and procedure for the phenyl-based bipyridine anchoring ligands and RC dye sensitizers are shown in the ESI. After separation and purification, the reaction products were characterized using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, elemental analysis and MALDI-TOF MS.


The UV-vis absorption spectra of three ruthenium sensitizers, RC-73, RC-76 and Z907, in DMF solution are presented in Fig. 1a. As shown, the three ruthenium sensitizers show two absorption bands in the range of 320–800 nm. The absorption bands located in the range of 320–420 nm, 340–450 nm and 340–450 nm for Z907, RC-73 and RC-76 are ascribed to the π–π* transition of the anchoring bipyridine ligands and a higher-energy metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition. Compared with Z907, the absorption bands of the RC dyes showed a redshift of about 20 nm in this range, which was mainly due to the enhanced π–π* transition from introducing phenyl to the anchoring ligands. The characteristic absorption bands in the range of 470–600 nm of the three ruthenium sensitizers were caused by lower-energy MLCT transitions, which were related to the absorption performance of the sensitizers. The characteristic absorption MLCT bands of the RC dyes showed a bathochromic shift of about 20 nm compared to that of Z907, which could be attributed to the introduction of phenyl-based bipyridine anchoring ligands resulting in an enhancement of π-conjugation and a shift of HOMO energy levels. For the RC dyes, there were some slight differences in the absorption spectra. The absorption of RC-76 exhibited slight redshifts, which were mainly affected by the electron distribution due to the electron-acceptor fluorine on the anchoring ligands.

The maximum molar extinction coefficients (ε) of the corresponding MLCT absorption bands are listed in Table 1. For RC-73 and RC-76, the corresponding maximum molar extinction coefficients of the MLCT bands were 1.35 × 104 and 1.49 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively. The values for both RC dyes were higher than that of Z907 (1.20 × 104 M−1 cm−1). Obviously, the RC dyes exhibited higher extinction coefficients over the region, which could mainly be attributed to the enhanced π-conjugation effect of the anchoring ligands by the m-X-phenyl (X = H (RC-73), F (RC-76)) substituents. Moreover, the intensity and the bathochromic shift of the absorption bands increased with the electron-withdrawing ability of X. These results demonstrate that the introduction of the phenyl-based anchoring group plays a positive role in the improvement of the absorption performance of the RC dyes. The fluorescence emission spectra of the RC and Z907 dyes in DMF are shown in Fig. 1a on the right coordinate. By the excitation of the low-energy MLCT transitions, the peak wavelengths of emission were 705 and 710 nm for RC-73 and RC-76, respectively. Fig. 1b shows the absorption spectra of the three dyes anchored on 3.5 μm-thick TiO2 thin films. RC-73 and RC-76 involving phenyl-based bipyridine anchoring ligands show enhanced absorption of visible light, which could be attributed to the enlarged absorption cross-section. The three ruthenium sensitizers presented similar spectral shift trends when adsorbed on TiO2 films. The slight blue shift of the MLCT absorption bands was caused by the interaction between the anchoring groups and the oxide surface. Furthermore, to evaluate the amount of RC dyes loaded on the TiO2 films, the dye-sensitized TiO2 films were desorbed using methanol solution containing TBAOH and the details are listed in Table 3.

To investigate the effect of phenyl-based anchoring ligands on the electrochemical properties of dye sensitizers, the cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements were performed with 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte. The relevant CV curves of the RC and Z907 dyes are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI) and the oxido-reduction potentials are listed in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the ground-oxidation potential (E0S+/S, vs. NHE) of Z907 (0.75 V) was more positive than those of RC-73 (0.65 V) and RC-76 (0.68 V), which might be ascribed to the carboxylic groups directly bound to the bipyridine leading to a stronger electron-withdrawing ability. Besides, the introduction of phenyl improved the electron density of the anchoring ligands, resulting in a slight negative shift in E0S+/S. Among the RC dyes, RC-76 exhibited a positive shift in E0S+/S of 30 mV compared with RC-73. These results indicate that the introduction of m-fluorobenzene groups enhance the electron-withdrawing ability of the dye molecule and result in a negative shift of the HOMO energy level.
In an efficient ruthenium complex sensitizer, the HOMO energy level should be higher than that of the I−/I3− redox couple (0.4 V vs. NHE) to provide a driving force for the process of dye regeneration, while the LUMO energy level should be more negative than the conduction band of the TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE) to maintain the high-efficiency process of electron injection. Compared with the referential Z907, both RC dyes showed desirable HOMO/LUMO energy levels and the schematic energy levels are shown in Fig. 2. For the band gap (E0–0, vs. NHE) between the HOMO and LUMO levels, the values for RC-73 (2.04 V) and RC-76 (2.00 V) were smaller than that of Z907 (2.11 V), which was attributed to the introduction of phenyl-based anchoring ligands weakening the electron-withdrawing ability of the anchoring ligands. Furthermore, this result could be associated with the bathochromic shift of the lowest energy MLCT band in the UV-vis spectrum. Particularly, in contrast with RC-73, RC-76 exhibited less band gap reduction, indicating that the introduced electron acceptor fluorine enhances the electron-withdrawing characteristics, which could adjust the HOMO/LUMO energy levels to a suitable range. Accordingly, RC-76 demonstrated more suitable HOMO/LUMO energy levels, resulting in a better electrochemical performance, which was related to electron injection and dye regeneration.

To further explore the electronic structures and distribution of the RC dyes, density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the B3LYP/DGDZVP level of theory were employed using the Gaussian 16 (Rev_A.03) package. The HOMO−1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO+1 orbitals of the RC and Z907 dye sensitizers are shown in Fig. 3. Compared with Z907, the variation of the electronic distribution for the RC dyes could be attributed to the introduction of phenyl-based anchoring ligands. The HOMO and HOMO−1 of the three dyes predominately distributed over the NCS ligands and the ruthenium center indicating that the RC dyes show a similar electronic structure to Z907 for the HOMO levels. In addition, the LUMOs of the three dye sensitizers were mainly delocalized over the ruthenium center and anchoring ligands. Generally, the electron on the HOMO levels delocalized over the ruthenium center and the NCS ligands could be excited to the LUMO levels through intramolecular charge transfer. However, the LUMO+1 of the RC dyes was mostly populated on the dipyridyl groups in the ancillary ligands while that of Z907 was intensively distributed over the anchoring ligands. Notably, the ruthenium sensitizers modified by phenyl-based anchoring ligands showed some different electronic distributions, clearly demonstrating that the HOMO/LUMO levels could be regularly tuned by introducing electron-rich groups such as phenyl to anchoring ligands.

Fig. S3 (ESI) shows the theoretical UV-vis spectra of the RC dyes and the major excitation features of RC dyes are listed in Table 2. The main electronic transitions were around 520 nm for lower-energy transitions and 450 nm for higher-energy transitions in the visible region. The lower-energy transition for RC-73 was attributed to a HOMO/LUMO+1 transition, while for RC-76 it was mainly caused by a HOMO−2/LUMO transition. The maximum oscillating strengths were located at 521.53 (RC-73) and 529.51 nm (RC-76), which basically correspond to the low-energy MLCT absorption bands. Besides, the lowest-lying singlet excited states of the RC-73 and RC-76 dyes were located at 599.88 and 616.67 nm, respectively, and were attributed to HOMO/LUMO transitions. The calculated results were in good agreement with the photophysical properties of RC dyes discussed in the previous section. The oscillating strength of the electronic singlet–singlet transitions indicated that the low-energy MLCT transition occupies the dominant position in the visible region.

To further research the kinetics of interfacial charge separation and the dye regeneration process, transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) was applied to investigate electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2 and the regeneration of excited-state dye molecules with the I−/I3− redox couple.Fig. 4 shows the transient absorbance decay profiles and the relevant electron decay lifetimes were obtained by fitting the curves with the single-exponential decay process. As shown in Fig. 4a the transient absorption decay times, τrec, of the RC-73, RC-76 and Z907 dyes were obtained by adsorbing them on TiO2 films and soaking them in acetonitrile solution. Photoelectrons produced by dye excitation transferred to the conduction band of TiO2. The electrons gathered in the TiO2 conduction band travelled back and produced dark current, which was combined with the dye cations. In the absence of electrolytes, the decay time, τrec, was closely related to the process of charge recombination because the returned electrons could only be combined with the dye cations. For RC-73, RC-76, and Z907, the decay times, τrec, were 15.8, 14.5 and 14.2 μs, respectively. When the acetonitrile solution was replaced by an I−/I3− redox electrolyte, the dye cations showed a faster decay trend on account of the interception by the returned electrons and redox species in the electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 4b, the decay times, τreg, for dye regeneration were 1.78, 1.53, and 1.28 μs for RC-73, RC-76, and Z907, respectively. The regeneration lifetimes are related to the energy difference between the HOMO level and the I−/I3− redox in the electrolyte, which provides the driving force of the process for dye regeneration. Compared with Z907, the RC dyes showed a longer decay lifetime, τreg, for the lower HOMO levels. The branching ratio of τrec and τreg for these dye sensitizers was related to the proportion of dye cations regenerated by the electron-donor, I−, in the electrolyte. The higher ratio indicated that more dye cations were regenerated by redox substances. According to the results obtained, the branching ratio (τrec/τreg) was 8.8, 9.5 and 11.1 for RC-73, RC-76 and Z907, respectively. RC-73 showed the minimum ratio, which could be attributed to the negative HOMO levels, which might result in an inefficient process of dye regeneration. In comparison with RC-73, the enhanced branching ratio of RC-76 indicated that the introduction of electron-acceptor fluorine results in a positive HOMO level, which is conducive to dye regeneration.


Both RC dyes and the referential Z907 dye were applied in devices to evaluate their photoelectric conversion performance. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) measurements were performed with acetonitrile-based electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 5a, the IPCE curves of the solar cells based on RC dyes covered from 300 to 800 nm, showing broad spectral light harvesting. Due to the modification of the anchoring ligands, the three ruthenium sensitizers presented some variations in their IPCE spectra. The IPCE values of the RC dyes were always higher than that of Z907 in the range of 300–540 nm, which was mainly due to their superior absorption intensity in this range. A variation tendency might be observed as the IPCE increases with increasing electron-withdrawing ability of the anchoring ligands, which influences the driving force of electron injection and dye regeneration. This result was well corroborated by the conclusions drawn from the electrochemical properties (see Table 1). For the RC dyes, RC-76 generally shows a higher IPCE value than RC-73 in the whole visible range, which could be attributed to the anchoring ligands with fluorine resulting in a more efficient electronic transmission. All the devices maintained more than 80% quantum efficiency in the range of 350–650 nm indicating the high efficiency of the sensitization.

The photovoltaic parameters of these devices including Jsc, Voc, fill factor (FF) and PCE are listed in Table 3 and the corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. 5b. Device A, based on the RC-73 dye, exhibited a Jsc of 15.86 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.704 V, a FF of 0.723 and a resulting PCE of 8.05%. Device B, based on RC-76, showed a Jsc of 16.32 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.710 V and a FF of 0.711, yielding a PCE of 8.24%. The superiority of the RC-76 dye mainly manifested as higher molar extinction coefficients, more suitable HOMO/LUMO energy levels and a stronger driving force for dye regeneration, which could be confirmed through UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, electrochemical measurements and TAS. For the Z907-based device, C, a Jsc of 16.47 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.743 V and a FF of 0.711 were achieved, leading to a PCE of 8.88%. Compared with RC dyes, Z907 demonstrated a higher PCE mainly due to its obvious advantage in Voc. In the case of identical electrolytes and TiO2 photoelectrodes, interfacial properties were the main factors affecting the Voc. The larger dimensions of phenyl-based anchoring ligands aggravate charge recombination and dye-aggregation at the dye–TiO2/electrolyte interface. A typical co-adsorbent, DPA (decanephosphonic acid), was applied to modify the interface of the TiO2 electrode and detailed results are listed in Table 3. The devices D, E and F, based on DPA, showed a significant improvement in photoelectric performance. In the presence of the co-adsorbent, DPA, the RC-76 sensitized device E demonstrated a Jsc of 17.52 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.734 V and a FF of 0.718, yielding a PCE of 9.23%. Meanwhile, the performance of devices D and F was improved and achieved a PCE of 8.73% and 9.12%, respectively. Obviously, the devices with DPA exhibited higher Jsc and Voc, which indicates that the interface modification of the TiO2 electrode can improve the performance of the device. This promotion was mainly attributable to the presence of DPA in the dye solution forming a protective layer during the sensitization on the surface to counteract the dark current and charge recombination.

To probe the interfacial charge recombination behavior and the contributing factors of inferior Voc for the RC dyes, electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out. All devices were measured with a bias of −0.7 V under dark conditions. Nyquist plots of the devices are shown in Fig. 6 and fitting results are listed in Table 4. Theoretically, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the devices was determined by the potential difference between the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 and the I−/I3− redox couple. Meanwhile, Voc was also influenced by the interfacial charge recombination. Unlike the relatively stable potential of the I−/I3− redox couple in the electrolyte, the TiO2 quasi-Fermi level was mainly influenced by the variation in the conduction band edge and the electron density, which could be reflected by the chemical capacitance (Cμ) in the EIS. As illustrated in Table 4, there were no evident differences in the trends for these devices indicating that the inferior Voc of the RC-based DSSCs was not relevant to the undulation of the TiO2 conduction band edge. The charge-transfer resistances (Rct) at the dye–TiO2/electrolyte interface were obtained with a −0.7 V bias voltage under dark conditions. The values of Rct were 26.75, 28.06 and 37.07 Ω for RC-73, RC-76 and Z907, respectively. The lower Rct represented the more significant interface charge recombination, leading to lower Voc. Clearly, the Rct followed the order Z907 > RC-73 > RC-76, which was in line with the descending order of the Voc values. According to the formula τn = Rct × Cμ1, the electron lifetimes (τn) of corresponding devices were obtained, which were relative to the backward electron transfer from the TiO2 conduction band into the electrolyte. For RC-73, RC-76 and Z907, the values of τn were 26.70, 28.85 and 37.66 ms, respectively. For the RC dyes, due to the extension of the anchoring groups, the electron transport channel became longer and the electron injection time was prolonged, which increases the probability that the electrons were trapped by the I3− in the electrolyte. The higher τn manifested a lower recombination occurring at the dye–TiO2/electrolyte interface, leading to a better Voc. It can be proved that after surface modification by DPA, the devices based on the RC dyes still exhibited more significant interfacial charge recombination, which was the main factor affecting the Voc of the devices.

A long-term stability test was an effective method to assess the dye sensitizers for their practical and promotional value. DSSCs based on RC-76 exhibited the highest PCE and were studied in a light soaking test at 60 °C for 1000 h by employing a low-volatility electrolyte (see the Experimental section in the ESI). The initial photovoltaic parameters of the devices sensitized with RC-76 were 0.741 V (Voc), 17.52 mA cm−2 (Jsc), 0.734 (FF) and 9.23% (PCE) under AM 1.5G full-sunlight intensity. During the test period, there were some slight changes in the relevant parameters and detailed parameters are shown in Fig. 7. The Jsc continued to grow slowly in the 400 hours after the start of the test, which could be attributed to the penetration of the electrolyte into cavities, leading to an efficient process of dye regeneration at the TiO2 interface. In the following period, the falling Voc and Jsc caused a slight but sustained attenuation of the PCE. Fortunately, the device still retained 90% of its initial PCE at the end of the test demonstrating that the RC-76 dye has good long-term stability.


In summary, this work focuses on the design, characterization and application of two ruthenium complex sensitizers, RC-73 and RC-76, which are equipped with phenyl-based bipyridine anchoring ligands. Based on the good performance of the ancillary ligands, modification of the anchoring ligands was carried out in order to seek breakthroughs in the absorption and electronic transmission of the ruthenium sensitizers. The phenyl units were introduced to the anchoring ligands to enhance the absorption performance and broaden the spectral response range, which could be attributed to the π-conjugation extending. Meanwhile, RC-76, due to the addition of electron-withdrawing fluorine substituents on the anchoring ligand, demonstrates longer electron lifetimes, enhanced light absorption and a satisfactorily positive HOMO energy level for regeneration compared to RC-73. DFT calculations and TAS measurements indicated that the electron injection and dye regeneration processes of both RC dyes can be carried out efficiently. DSSCs based on RC dyes exhibit superior photovoltaic performance, especially in terms of photocurrent, where RC-76 achieves a Jsc of 17.52 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 9.23% under standard illumination. Compared with the Z907 dye, the inferior Voc of the RC dyes can be ascribed to the significant charge recombination in the dye–TiO2/electrolyte interface, which can be confirmed by EIS measurements. Moreover, the RC-based devices show a good stability, maintaining 90% of the initial PCE value with a low-volatility electrolyte for 1000 h. We believe that the present observations provide a strategy for the molecular design of efficient ruthenium complex sensitizers for DSSCs.
