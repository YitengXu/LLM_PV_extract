This review article discusses the current designs and synthetic procedures for organic small molecules as hole-transporting materials (HTMs) with a focus on their structure–property correlation, conductivity, and photovoltaic performance, as well as their high hole mobility and stability. In comparison to non-planar spiro-like compounds, various π-conjugated aromatic and planar molecules have been studied as being important for the generation of new HTMs. Since heteroatoms, such as oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen and silica, have been shown to have an impact on the search for more stable and cost-effective HTMs and perovskite solar cells (PSCs), developing a new molecular architecture with efficient π–π stacking to increase charge mobility or integrating dopant molecular structure into HTM would be a viable approach for generating dopant-free HTMs. A deeper understanding of perovskite/HTM can also provide insight into the design of novel molecular architectures capable of achieving effective and stable systems.

Solar cells seem to be the most powerful platform, owing to the fact that they use free radiation and are the most self-sustaining of all renewable energy technologies. Since the introduction of perovskites in 2009, all from basic expertise and structural elements to computer architecture and stability, they have advanced significantly. Since they can be synthesized from inexpensive solvent-processing materials and exhibit unit quality comparable to that of commercially available technologies, perovskites are particularly well suited for photovoltaic applications. Numerous techniques have been developed to enhance the PSC power conversion efficiency (PCE). The advantage of PSCs is their ease of operation in n–i–p or p–i–n configurations using solution processors (Fig. 1). By reviewing structural alterations and analyzing their influence on solar efficiency, the goal is to develop universal methodologies for producing low-cost and effective HTMs, opening the way for future scale deployment of PSCs. Up-to-date insights on recently-discovered organic molecular HTMs, both doped and doping-free, are detailed in this article. These methods are essential to enabling potential scalable applications of PSCs. Molecular weight, simple purification, and reproducibility are possible advantages of small organic molecules. Although organic molecules offer many benefits, such as clear molecular weight, simple purification, and strong reproducibility, they also have some disadvantages.

This article provides a recent advance in design, synthesis, and characterization of new small molecules as HTMs, their effect on the photovoltaic efficiency, and the underlying chemistry including doped and dopant-free compounds employed in PSCs and then outlines the requirements needed for commercial viability. This study covers the highest performing organic small molecule HTMs, both doped and dopant-free, as determined by the HTM database, which now comprises over 400 publications on organic molecular hole transporting materials. A comprehensive representation of molecular design and organic synthesis of novel small molecule HTMs, as well as their influence on photovoltaic performance, has been provided in this study, with particular emphasis on the chemistry involved. When looking at the structure of novel HTMs, the most fundamental designs make use of various central scaffolds, which are mostly adorned with arylamine derivatives, to achieve their structural stability. Further advancements in system stability by the use of novel materials are on the horizon, as research moves closer to satisfying industry requirements. The authors note that the large number of HTMs prepared stems from the design and engineering of a diverse array of new and chemically transformed existing molecules, with organic synthesis playing a critical role. All organic HTMs in this study are categorised into four primary categories based on their functional groups and donor–acceptor moites, such as spiro-OMeTAD, spiro core derivatives, D–A–D based molecules, and dopant free HTMs. As a result, in this review, various types of small organic HTMs, have been highlighted in order to summarise and conclude the relationship between the molecular structure and device performance with the goal of providing some guidance for the further development of PSCs. To progress toward dopant-free HTMs, modelling molecular architecture with improved π–π stacking to increase charge mobility or incorporating dopant chemical structures into HTM would be a viable route. Future progress in the marketing and environmental protection of sustainable green energy options has been enhanced in order to address this challenge.

Since 2009, researchers have focused their attention on organic–inorganic metal halide PSCs due to their minimal production cost and high PCE. The Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, had recorded a recent PCE of 25% and this closes the PCE gap between PSC and market-dominant crystalline silicon-based photovoltaic technology. PSCs have received great user interest for their increased PCE owing to their high photophysical properties. The ideal perovskite crystal structure is ABX3, in which A represents a monovalent organic cation (such as CH3NH3+ (MA+) and HC(NH2)2+ (FA+)), B means a divalent inorganic cation (usually Pb2+ or Sn2+), and X is a monovalent halogen anion (Cl−, Br−, or I−) (Fig. 2A and B). One of the most promising choices in the next decade for accommodating increasing energy needs will be to transform solar power into electricity, without affecting the climate change scenario. (1) A thin film and organic hybrid architecture have reduced energy-producing problems such as high energy costs and high energy costs. (2) The second step involves the cost incurred for photovoltaic solar energy elements like solar cells and modules, inverters, frames, land and installation. This process becomes effective and efficient if it is highly stable and has good efficiency. Device performance is increased with the experiments implementing the semiconductor organic–inorganic perovskite absorbers.

Perovskite has proved to be the best photovoltaic candidate due to its (1) easy large-scale manufacturing using a simple spin-coating or spray printing process. (2) Perovskite's energy levels and energy gap are easily controlled by minor modifications in the components of the perovskite materials. (3) The perovskite absorption region covers the maximum range of visible wavelengths, which matches the solar spectrum and high molar extinction coefficient. (4) Perovskite's binding energy is weak and it benefits the exciton dissociation at room temperature without external electric field assistance. (5) Charge separation is achieved due to the perovskite carrier's long diffusion length. (6) In perovskite, both excited electrons and holes transfer spontaneously. Direct band-gap, high absorption coefficient and increased charge carrier mobility, large PCE, the low-cost precursor for the photoactive layer, and cheap fabrication process and minimal loss during charge recombination are the factors that lead to the increased performance.

Normally, PSC has a perovskite photoactive layer (PAL), an electron transporting layer (ETL), hole transporting layer (HTL), and a counter electrode. In general, perovskite devices can be classified according to their configuration into the conventional/regular (n–i–p) structure and inverted planar structure (p–i–n). In the conventional structure, the first is the deposition of compact or mesoporous metal oxide (ETL, n-type) and upon that an active perovskite layer exists and the third layer is a p-type HTL layer (p-type). In the case of the planar inverted (p–i–n) structure, there is a HTL, (p-type) deposited and next is the perovskite active layer followed by the ETL, (n-type). In the case of planar PSC, PAL is sandwiched between ETL and HTL, where HTL performs the role of extraction and transportation of holes from photoactive layers to conductive electrodes. The two types of solar cells are meso-structured and planar hetero-junction solar cells depending on the architecture of the system. Those two are again subdivided into two types depending upon the position of p-type and n-type selective contact materials. The fabrication of planar hetero-junction PSCs is easier and can be used in both conventional (n–i–p) and inverted (p–i–n) structures.


The practical relevance of the solar cell is validated using high efficiency, which is one of the central criteria. The prime effort of PSCs research is to fabricate highly efficient devices. Short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) define the solar cell PCE and these parameters are determined by the perovskite film quality, perovskite composition, interfacial contact, and the architecture of the device. As seen in Fig. 3A–C, there are three most common device architectures of PSCs mentioned in the literature. The most important and active layer is the perovskite layer and it is sandwiched between electron and hole transporting layers. PSCs have been closely examined in the last few years and the operating principles of PSCs have been extensively investigated, and they are very similar across diverse architectures. On the irradiation of the perovskite layer using light, excitons (hole–electron pairs) are generated.


Fig. 3D shows the simplified operating mechanism and key charge transfer processes of a typical PSC. The light illuminated from the transparent conductive substrate is absorbed by the perovskite. Electrons and holes are generated and transported by the ETL and HTL respectively. Generated photogeneration of electron–hole pairs has resulted as the perovskite light-harvesting layer is excited by the incident photons from the transparent electrode. Before the migration to the anode, electrons are separated (1) from the holes and injected (2) into the conduction band (CB) of the electron transporting material. Whereas, the holes generated in the perovskite are transferred (3) to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the HTM, before transporting the hole into the cathode and this generation is effective with the high diffusion lengths of charge carriers. Compared to the perovskite layer, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the ETL should be lower, and the HOMO of the HTL should be higher, since the reverse values affect the performance by hindering electron/hole extraction. The energy level information of some commonly used materials in PSCs is listed in Fig. 3B.

HTL studies mainly focus on the improvement of either stability or efficiency or both. Efficiency is externally associated with the hole mobility of the HTM and with the physical link between the HTL and the perovskite layer. The efficiency and stability of the PSCs mainly depend on HTM. The HTM should have good solubility, high polarity and protic solvents that might dissolve the perovskite layer. HTMs prefer to have high thermal, photochemical stability and hydrophobicity to avoid degradation and increase the long-term stability of perovskites. HTM should be cost-effective with simple synthetic schemes for large-scale fabrication. Various researchers were carried out on HTMs to understand the relativity of HTM and PSC performance. Based on the organic and inorganic nature, HTM is categorized into three types. Normally, organic HTM used in PSCs is categorized as: polydispersed polymers and monodispersed small molecules.

Despite the inorganic HTMs viz., CuI, CuSCN, and NiO, having good properties such as high hole mobility and lower cost, they also have the limitation of the partial dissolving ability of the perovskite in the solvent used for deposition, which reduces the stability of the device. Most of the inorganic HTMs have high internal hole mobility and hence no dopant is needed to increase the stability of the device, but in terms of efficiency, it is proven that organic HTMs are better compared to inorganic HTMs. The limitations of the polymeric material used in HTM are complexity in purification, minimized solubility, tricky characterization with an undefined molecular weight, and a minimum infiltration into the nanostructured material and these constraints have led the researchers to fabricate the small molecular HTMs. HTM made of organic small molecules has the merit of being built with a flexible structure, a proper chemical structure with an exact molecular weight (MW), and batch-to-batch reproducing ability. As this review focuses on the application of organic small molecules HTM in PSCs, this review is different from the previous reviews.

Optimization of the HTM facilitates the hole extraction and its transportation from the perovskite to the electrode. Simple techniques and optimal transferring of the charge from the photons released cancel the perovskite light-harvesting layer by the transparent electrodes and it leads to the photo-generation of electron–hole pairs. The need to develop a low-cost, efficient, and stable HTMs remains a challenge to be addressed. HTM is claimed to be efficient because it aligns the energy of its HOMO with the valence band (VB) of the perovskite photodetector. The HTMs also have high solubility and excellent properties in film formation. Tasks of the HTM include: (i) good extraction of photo-generated holes that improves the transportation to the counter electrode and acts as a powerful barrier for blocking the electron transfer to the anode; (ii) prevention of direct contact of the perovskite and the metal electrode to improve the device stability (typically Au, Ag and Al) and protecting from the diffusion of the electrode into the perovskite layer; (iii) suppression of the charge recombination loss at the interfaces between the perovskite and HTM layer through complete uniform perovskite layer coverage and (iv) impacting the Voc with the dopants in the HTM and minimized energy disorder of the HTM layer (related to the chemical structure of the HTM), and with distinct HTM values for mobility/conductivity.


In recent years, a wide range of different molecular structures, from simple organic molecules to more complex structures, have been described in the literature. A key component in PSCs, HTMs ensure efficient hole extraction at the perovskite/HTM interface as well as the avoidance of undesired charge recombination processes, resulting in enhanced device performance. Organic semiconducting materials offer several benefits, such as versatility of synthesis, which provides great scope for tuning optoelectronic properties, lowering the production cost, compatibility with several substrates (transparent glass, flexible plastic, paper and clothes), light weight and low-temperature fabrication and large scale processing. Generally, a successful HTM applied to PSCs should exhibit some crucial properties such as (i) being simple to synthesize and purify (i.e., easy to mass-produce), (ii) displaying high hydrophobicity and stability, (iii) possessing suitable energy levels for the LUMO and HOMO (to improve the Voc and PCE), and (iv) providing good conductivity and hole-transfer rates (to improve the FF). The most important role of an effective HTM is to facilitate the hole transfer process from the perovskite layer, by presenting suitable energy levels aligned with the valence band energy edge of the perovskite, and then transport the positive charges to be collected at the anode. Specifically, small molecules exhibit various advantages like easy synthesis and purification processes compared to polymer materials, but this replacement of spiro-OMeTAD with these small molecule HTMs is very rare.


Researchers looking to develop new HTM candidates are keenly interested in better understanding the relationship between HTM and PSC performance. Recent studies have shown that doping HTLs with beneficial materials improves device stability and passivates trap state. High hole conductivity should be one of the new HTMs' design parameters. Spiro-OMeTAD is currently the most widely used HTM in PSCs, but its high cost and low hole conductivity make large-scale production impractical. The conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD has been improved by a variety of methods, including doping. Undoped spiro-OMeTAD has a hole conductivity of 105 S cm−1.

HTL research focuses on improving either efficiency or stability, or both, as the primary goal. There is a direct correlation between the HTL's hole mobility and the physical contact with the perovskite layer, which determines efficiency. Due to the intrinsically low hole mobility of organic HTMs, various conjugated moieties and structures have been used to overcome this limitation. When it comes to organic charge transport, chemical oxidation is the most common method of doping (specifically for p-type doping). Chemical dopants are the most frequently employed dopants for solution-based PSC fabrication, as seen in Fig. 4. (1) Generate highly stable radical cations quantitatively and reproducibly at a reasonable rate in order to improve charge-transport efficiency (2) give off desirable properties, such as inertness, in the event that byproducts are inevitable (i.e., increased hydrophobicity or thermal stability, reduced phase segregation). (3) The PSC (i.e., adequate energetic alignment of HTL with PAL for hole extraction) is highly efficient and stable, (4) but sustaining minimal prices (i.e. not constrained to inert conditions, a small number of syntheses, and the ability to control the redox properties of the HTL) in order to encourage widespread accessibility to researchers.
To enhance the electrical properties of organic small molecules HTMs (spiro-MeOTAD and other organic HTMs), chemical additives such as 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium salt (LiTFSI), benzoyl peroxide, 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), and tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III) bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (FK209) are frequently used (Fig. 4). To name a few of the advantages that doping appears to have, charge transport, recombination suppression, and trap formation inhibition are all possible outcomes. Doping, on the other hand, has gained widespread acceptance as a method for improving the optoelectronic properties of PSCs.
The number of charge carriers in the organic semiconductor can be increased to improve conductivity. In order for a doping process to work, a dopant's electron affinity must be compatible with the energy levels of an organic semiconductor. A growing number of doping materials and techniques have been developed to date in order to modify energy levels, increase conductivity, reduce traps, and improve the film morphology of doped layers. Doped HTLs have made significant progress in recent years in adjusting energy levels, improving charge transport, reducing trap states, and modulating film morphology in planar PSCs. Various dopants, including polymers, fullerene, metal oxides, organic halide salts, inorganic acids, solvents, and nanoparticles, have been reported for use in the engineering of HTL and ETL in p–i–n or n–i–p PSCs thus far.
It is possible to modify the properties of a host material by using dopants, which are substances that can be injected into the host material. Increased conductivity, altered alignment of energy levels, and improved morphology of thin-film insulators are thought to be accomplished most effectively through the use of dopants. Extrinsic dopants have been studied in this context, and researchers have attempted to limit the flaws and device instability caused by these extrinsic dopants, while still attaining potential performance increases in spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs. The investigation of novel doping substances is still in its early stages. More in-depth discussion is provided on doping mechanisms and their relevance to PSC performance and stability. Because of the indirect nature of the procedure, it is impossible to assess the consequences of doping. A complex chemical route (Scheme 1) is given by eqn (1) and (2), which involves a two-step redox process in which the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD is enhanced by the addition of LiTFSI (2). In the early stages of the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD by oxygen, the production of oxygen radicals is conceivable. These oxygen radicals are then removed from the atmosphere by LiTFSI. Because of the remaining Li+ cation, a LixOy species is produced, and the TFSI anion catches and stabilises the oxidised spiro-OMeTAD (spiro-OMeTADc+). This reaction is delayed and depending on the environment and it may take several hours, a day, or even several weeks. In addition to being susceptible to oxidation, it is also sensitive to water, oxygen, and light.
In addition, because it is the only liquid in PSCs, TBP tends to evaporate with time, contributing to the device's instability. In 2018, the discovery of TBP–LiTFSI compounds was based on the mechanism of pyridine ring coordination. As a result, TBP and LiTFSI are both restricted in their hygroscopicity and evaporation speed by the formation of complexes, although their beneficial effects in PSCs are still maintained (Scheme 2).

Flexible molecular structure and efficient photo-electrical properties make the organic small molecular HTMs as a best suited candidate in a PSCs with high performance and spiro-OMeTAD are one such organic small molecular HTM. At the same time, the disadvantages are high cost, complicated multistep synthesis, expensive precursors, tedious purification process and poor hole mobility and these are solved with various other HTMs similar to spiro-OMeTAD. Also, the HOMO energy level of spiro-OMeTAD (−5.13 eV) does not fit with the valence band (VB) of perovskite (−5.43 eV) because of its huge energy offset. Selection of alternative conjugated skeletons promotes strong intermolecular π–π stacking and it acts the best alternate to spiro-OMeTAD. HTM with no spiro-linkage are meant to be the best alternate to spirobifluorene design and such HTMs are used in PSCs like thiophene derivatives, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene pyrene, acene, benzodithiophene, carbazole, dithienosilole, indacenodithienothiophene, phenoxazine, spirofluorene, truxene, triphenylamine, and phthalocyanine. Cost of HTM can be decreased by simplifying the spiro-OMeTAD's molecular structure. Variation in electron-withdrawing cores or end capping electron donating groups can tune the optical and electronic properties of small-molecule HTMs with D–A–D structure. HTM that includes phenoxazine, and S,N-heteropentacene as cores with absorption in the visible and near infrared region has shown more than 15% of PCE. An electron-withdrawing group might tend to minimize HOMO energy level for achieving a higher Voc in a PSCs. Very few studies found on the usage of D–A–D type HTM in PSC devices, leads to the decision to explore the hypothesis through synthesis and evaluation of two novel HTMs to develop efficient and stable PSCs. With only few reports on D–A–D type HTMs, only benzothiadiazole (BTD) unit was applied highly as an electron deficient core. Similarly, it shows facile synthesis procedure, cheap productions, and flexible processing. In solid thin films tough intermolecular interactions produce high crystallization and this gives high charge carrier mobility and hence D–A conjugated small molecules are best suited for HTLs (Fig. 5).

Recent studies have shown that the most effective PEA2PBI4 perovskite passivation additive in a three dimensional (3D) perovskite is the bio halide salt phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI). To fabricate excellent PSCs, Cui and his team designed and proved the reduction in carrier recombination loss promoted by the built-in electric field in p-type perovskite/n-type perovskite homo-junctions. An outstanding PCE of 16.1% was achieved through a PSCs that uses the PC-casted additive-free spiro-OMeTAD layer that was exposed to simulated AM 1.5 G sunlight with a 1.00 cm2 opening. Even at 80 °C after 500 hours, a centimeter square PSC from an encapsulated PSC retains over 70% of its initial PCE, compared to less than 20% on other existing devices. Environmental degradation processes like H2O dominate the degradation and it is proven by conducting a stability test in an inert atmosphere where the degradation was only less than 2% over 1500 hours.

Spiro-OMeTAD is the prime and extensively used HTM in the PSCs area. In the original form, spiro-OMeTAD has low hole mobility, and it is due to the presence of its propeller-like structure from the triphenylamine (TPA) moiety and attributed to the sp3-hybridization atom linkage. High intermolecular distance is achieved through these structural properties and the resultant dopants are indispensable. “Spiro concept” (Fig. 6A) includes two extended p-systems that are linked to a tetrahedral sp3-hybridized atom, which results in an orthogonal configuration between the aromatic rings. Morphological stability is enhanced with this spiro linkage, but the electronic properties of the electroactive moieties remain the same. The excellent properties of 9,9′-spirobifluorene make it extensively used in photovoltaic applications (Fig. 6B). The advantages of this kind of molecular structure are: (i) a highly sterically needed structure that stimulates molecule rigidity, (ii) high glass transition temperature (Tg), (iii) crystallization is effectively minimized below the glass transition temperature (Tg) and amorphous state stability is improved, and (iv) weak intermolecular π–π interactions that increase the solubility. Spiro-OMeTAD was the first spiro-based HTM reported for PSCs and it was developed with a spiro-bifluorene core. The efficiency of this HTM inspired the researchers to develop various such HTMs with spiro architecture. The spiro strategy is successful for designing efficient HTMs in the solar cell because of its symmetric globular structure, high molecular weight, and minimum cohesion between the molecules. These features result in increased stability in the amorphous state.

Chemical doping refers to one of the significant techniques used in organic electronics to enhance the device efficiency through energy level controls, increased conductivity, reduced ohmic loss in the transport layer and injection barrier observed at the electrode interface. Fundamental concepts of p-doping in organic semiconductors is the generation of additional mobile charge carriers by electron acceptors which removes the electrons from the HOMO to generate holes in the intrinsic HTM. Additional charge carriers lead to the improvement of charge carrier density in the organic semiconductor and result in increased conductivity. An efficient doping process needs the best suited electron affinity of the dopant based on the energy levels of an organic semiconductor. The typical HTL of PSCs is highly doped with p-type dopant to provide the required electrical conductivity for the state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD and other wide bandgap HTMs. Various p-type dopants were fabricated and realized including 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ), copper(II) and cobalt(III) complexes. At present, the combination of second-generation cobalt complex-based FK20980 and Li-TFSI and an additive of 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) as the morphology controller is often used to improve the HTM conductivity. Currently, including ZnTFSI2 as a dopant exhibits improved stability and hole mobility.
In spite of the advantages, using dopants is critical since it causes various issues with stability because of its complex oxidation process and poor ion migration. HTL becomes highly hydrophilic with Li-TFSI, due to its hygroscopic nature. It tends to cause chemical degradation and has an adverse effect on the device stability. Researchers had shown the reaction of tBP with perovskite and dissolve it. This induces corrosion and might stimulate a chemical reaction with HTM. High research interest was focused to identifying the best HTM that could be used in scalable manufacturing with less expense and also to give a complete knowledge of the link between HTM structure and performance of PSCs. This success has grabbed the attention of various researchers who have focused on spiro-type compounds and enhancing the PCE with minor modifications to the structure. Nevertheless, the hygroscopic Li salt and the corrosive pyridine derivative may cause the corrosion of the perovskite layer, resulting in a negative effect on the device stability. Therefore, it is very important to explore additional doping materials to improve the devices performance.

Spiro-OMeTAD is the commercially available HTM. Its development is complex, purification is expensive and hole conductivity is very low and these factors have a high impact on cheap and large scale photovoltaic applications. Various researchers were proposed as an alternative to spiro-OMeTAD, but it has not been satisfactory. More understanding is needed about the efficiency of spiro-OMeTAD as an HTM. Large-scale production of traditional spiro-OMeTAD is limited due to its tough purification process and low yield synthesis. The hygroscopic nature of spiro-OMeTAD attracts moisture and it affects the long-term stability of the device. It is observed that additional dopant or additive improves the electrical properties of the low charge carrier mobility (∼10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 in pristine film) of spiro-OMeTAD. HTM could be oxidized by Li-TFSI under light or heat excitations, but the process of oxidation in the open air affects the device reproducibility as the oxidation degree is uncontrolled and it deteriorates the device stability. Device performance and stability are degraded by the pinhole channels created by the migration of Li-TFSI. Inclusion of dopants and oxidation increases the complexity of processing and also the cost. For increasing the PSCs various thermally stable new small molecule dopant-free HTMs were seen.

Efficient HTM is achieved through the improvement of the design diversity of spiro-fused rings. The compounds designed and developed with single spiro as the core and arylamines as arms are dominant HTMs in PSCs (Fig. 7). Nevertheless, given the availability of excellent HTMs, optimization of HTMs to sensitive-dopant-free HTMs for improving the PSCs efficiency and stability needs more studies and alternative HTMs are being designed to replace spiro-OMeTAD. The inert spiro-core of spiro-OMeTAD stimulates the modification and optimization of its properties and hence the change in spiro-core enhances the photovoltaic performance. Moreover, it is observed that the core skeleton of the spiro-based HTM is generally single spiro-ring dominant (Fig. 8 and Table 1). Spiro based HTM that proves more than 20% PCE are found to be dependent on either spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] or spiro[cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4b′]dithiophene-4,9′-fluorene] as the core skeleton. With the presence of various spiro based HTMs, spiro-OMeTAD-triphenylamine based HTM combined with several distinct π-functional molecular part had exhibited the high performance because of its simple synthesis process and great growth in PCE. With the support of F4TCNQ to lower the HOMO level of 2mF-X59 and enhance its hole transfer, the optimized 2mF-X59 based PSC shows the highest PCE of 18.13% without sensitive dopants compared to the PCE of 18.22% for spiro-OMeTAD based PSC with a sensitive dopant.

With the less of symmetry of spiro-core, a new spirobisindane-based HTM, spiro-I, which is capable of forming amorphous films with high uniformity and morphological stability is designed. This HTM proves similar efficiency for small areas compared to larges area with high air stability. Yan Liu and his team members designed 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) as a p-spacer and t-butyl (tBu) groups for substituting a new spirobifluorene core-based oligoaryl compound synthesized (spiro-tBuBED) comprising of two stages free of starting material metalations through direct C–H bond activation/arylation reactions. Spiro-tBuBED is exempted from oxidation treatment and proved to be 18.6% PCE. Studies related to the dependency of structure and performance relationships concerning the impact of molecular configuration, spiro number and hetero-atoms in spiro rings on HTM efficiency and this is addressed with the development of two novel H-shaped HTMs, G1 and G2 based on the di-spiro-rings as the core. Incorporation of carbazole block into spiro-skeleton might bring the merits together and the final spirocore spiro[fluorene-9,8′-indolo[3,2,1-de]acridine] (SCZF) could be mixed with amino branches to develop a new HTM. Considering this, Zhu et al. and their team developed a new HTM named SCZF-5 based on the SCZF core and SCZF-5 (84%) based PSC, which proved the long term stability and durability compared to spiro-OMeTAD (50%) and SAF-5 (63%). From several reports of studies on small molecule-based HTMs, a higher PCE of 20.2% is attained by the HTM used in new devices and is synthesized based on a molecular engineered fluorene–dithiophene (FDT) core replaced using an N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine donor group that has an easy structure with a dissymmetric nature. This explored the study of new small molecular HTMs for inverted p–i–n PSC.
The incorporation of different aromatic π-conjugated groups increases the HTM conjugation. It leads to the efficient π–π stacking in the familiar SFX skeleton HTM film, which benefits the charge transportation. Jeon et al. developed a fluorene-terminated HTM that has a well-adjusted energy level and maximum glass transition temperature for ensuring efficient and stable PSCs. The device retains nearly 95% of the performance recorded in the initial stage for more than 500 hours after thermal annealing at 60 °C. Chun Chen and team analyzed D–A–D HTM with a spiro linkage in PSC as primarily and describe the PSC performance. Additional thiophene–iodide interactions are developed due to the sulfur atoms present in the SDTF core and similarly, these components were tested through the Cs0.05(MA0.166FA0.833)0.95Pb(Br0.166I0.833)3 triple-cation PSCs fabrication. Despite minimal hole mobility, doping of the HTM layer in PSC, SDTCz2F proves high PCE as 16.4% compared to 14.5% and 14.3% for SBFCz2 and SDTFCz2, respectively. The introduction of novel HTMs that include cyclic spiro-backbones appended with four diphenylimidazole substituents, namely spiro-omethoxyimidazole, or spiro-OMeIm 2.

The electron rich sulfur containing thiophene containing HTM compounds are useful for building blocks with interesting optoelectronic properties, among others, in various fields, including organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic solar cells (OSCs), and PSCs. Longer conjugation improves the electronic coupling of molecules. Oligothiophenes have free rotation around the single bonds and hence their conjugation length is shorter compared to fused thiophenes since fused thiophenes provide intra and interchain charge transportation through coplanar confirmation by improved π–π overlap and hence fused thiophenes are used in π-spacer of many molecules (Fig. 9). Various research studies have studied the synthesis of fused heterocycles as cores in an HTM and as the synthesis of non-fused heterocycle is easy and needs more research on it. More research is evolving to develope new fused thiophene molecules as core building blocks for HTMs in PSCs to achieve high PCE. Such thiophenes are thiophene–vinylene–thiophene, indacenodithiophene, thiophene derivatives, naphthodithiophene, benzotrithiophene, benzodithiophene, and tetrathienoanthracene (Fig. 10 and Table 2). From various HTMs made of fused-thiophenes, cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) derivatives are known to be efficient HTM in PSC with excellent photovoltaic performance due to their structure which is strong and planar that benefits the intermolecular π–π interactions and ability to transport the holes. Moreover, the YC-1 based device shows excellent stability by sustaining 85% of the first recorded performance even after 500 hours of storage. This is more than 64% stability recorded in the spiro-OMeTAD based device. Solution processing ability is improved by introducing a side or lateral substituent in an electronic skeleton. Benito et al. studied the photovoltaic performance of three new three-armed heteroatom-containing core (N, O, S, or Se) has a relative effect on the HTM's optical and electrochemical properties and hence the photovoltaic performance. The initial PCE value was retained after 600 hours without encapsulation in HTMs with excellent long-term stability and enhanced foil morphology and hydrophobicity to better understand the uniqueness of the thieno-[3,2-b]indole and index-diphene (IDT) cores.

Sathiyan et al. showed that dicyanovinylene and thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TTz-1) electron removals are end-capped as an electron acceptor for A–D–A model HTMs obtained from low-cost compounds with a donor of triphenylamine in a Pd-free, feasible HTM synthesis. Nitrogen sites are used to substitute molecular packing, solubility, film structure, hydropathy properties, and the glass transition temperature. Also, BDT gives 4 parts of donor substitution and π-overlap is extended by the thiophene addition. This is considered to be a suitable HTM both in structure and energy for Sn-based PSC. Construction of two novels (D–π–D) dual donor structure (BDT-PTZ = 18.26% and BDT-POZ = 19.16%) with fused-thiophene unit aims the improvement of electron-donation ability in an molecular conjugated skeleton for increasing the hole mobility and facilitates the matching of frontier energy levels that consists of 4,8-di(hexylthio)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) as π-conjugated linker, and N-(6-bromohexyl)phenothiazine (PTZ)/N-(6-bromohexyl)phenoxazine (POZ) as donor units. Similarly, the optimization of π-bridge in HTMs is demonstrated by comparing the charge collection probability of PBT and NDT, and their recombination kinetics by measuring Jsc and Voc at various light intensities. This helps to improve the PSC performance by increasing the charge extraction and hole transportation.
Li et al. investigated the replacement of thiophene by naphthalene in PCA-1 and yielded PCA-2. Yet, all this research proved that A–D–A structured HTMs have the least absorption beyond 800 nm, as the energy levels of small molecule materials need fine-tuning. Application of these materials as HTMs in PSC, exhibits excellent results, but the light absorption is non-productive. These properties are retained by introducing a very strong electron-withdrawing end group and this material proves high absorption in the UV-vis-NIR region (300–900 nm). BTT-4 exhibits a high PCE of 19% and higher conductivity than BTT-3. Several research studies have suggested the successful application of A–D–A and D–A–D type N, S, Se-heteroacenes with the combination of pyrrole, thiophene, and selenophene rings based on HTM in PSCs (Fig. 11). Arora and his team proved the potentiality of HTM-1 and HTM-2 in designing triple-cation [Csx(MA0.17FA0.83)100−xPb(I0.83Br0.17)3 where x = 5%] based PSC and that displayed PCEs of 17.7% and 16.1% correspondingly. Wang and team (2019) investigated three conjugated quasilinear segments of fluorene, built with two bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino groups for structurally simple molecular semiconductors Z1, Z2, and Z3 at the end. In addition, MPA-BTTI-based devices show better thermal and light stability and retain 90% of the initial PCE after 500 h of continuous illumination. At the thermal stress of 80 °C for 800 h of constant atmosphere, it shows 94% of actual PCE.

Improved π–π stacking effect between the molecules enhances the hole transfer in the thin films. Hence, thiophene-fused molecules tend to be fascinating organic semiconductors that possess high charge transportation. Dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) is one of a simple thiophene-fused unit with a strong electron-donating feature. DTP skeleton with co-planar structure is found to be rich in electrons and hence modification is easier for having an appropriate energy level for effective hole extraction from PSC and also, nitrogen site is used for suspending several substituent's to tune the molecular packing, material solubility, film morphology, hydrophobic property, and glass transition temperature. Large π-conjugated surface and hetero-atoms are the structural elements that promote the interaction between the molecules. Here, BDT and DTP central cores are substituted with four N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline units in the 2nd and 3rd positions of the thiophene ring and leads to tetrakistriphenylamine (TTPA) derivatives. Dong and his team members investigated the thermal stability of thiophene bridges that substituted a star-shaped DTP core flanked by a two-fold triphenylamine arm. Compared to doped spiro-OMeTAD (19.59%), PSCs with an n–i–p structure having dopant-free DTPC8-ThDTPA achieved an excellent PCE of 19.42%.

Hybridization of triarylamine-based donor groups with the 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (MPDTP) and N-(4-(4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrol-4-yl)phenyl)-4-methoxy-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline (TPDTP) units produces novel HTMs such as H16 and H18. With the long-term aging test, H16 proves high stability in the dark with a humidity of 20% after 1440 hours. The commercial use of H16, the DTP based HTM is improved due to its cheap synthetic cost (1/15) and high efficiency compared to spiro-OMeTAD. HTMs built with DTP based semiconductors prove efficient for n–i–p fabricated on MA0.7FA0.3PbI2.85Br0.15 device exhibits more than 20% PCE, which is higher, compared to all other PSCs with un-doped molecular HTMs. Careful merging of π-conjugation extension and N-alkylation on the DTP core permits the manipulation of the energy levels, hole mobility and film-formation ability over perovskites.

Further investigation is carried out into the influence of p-alkoxytriphenylamines on various alkyl chains that are included to increase the HTM molecule's solubility. Longer aliphatic side chains have no influence over the electronic energy level but influence the material conductivity. Apart from the lower solubility of ATT-OMe, it can be heated and spin-coated at 100 °C with no change in the device performance, while it is adverse in the case of spiro-OMeTAD, its efficiency decreases if heated higher than 70 °C. The anthra[1,2-b:4,3-b′:5,6-b′′:8,7-b′′′]tetrathiophene (ATT) is found to be a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon that is rich in sulphur and a has flat and strong π-conjugated structure having 4 thiophene moiety combined with anthracene. Molecules based on ATT are stable to heat, the purification process is simple and cheap and ATT-OMe shows conductivity is large compared to spiro-OMeTAD. In X41, tertiary amine group is attached to the tail end of the alkyl chains as shown in AS37 and also, X44 to quaternary ammonium is merged with associated counter ions TFSI. It is observed that the thiophene unit in PCA-1 replaced by a fused naphthalene unit in PCA-2. Performance evaluation of PCA-1 and PCA-2 for application of HTL in PSC is done by Li Yong et al. compared to the PSC devices that have n–i–p planar and mesoscopic MAPbI3 structure and dopant free HTL materials, PCA-1 devices proved efficient PCE, excellent stability and very small hysteresis under proper atmosphere. π–π stacking is prevented during the spin coating process by the presence of peripheral tBu groups.


Such two-dimensional (2D) CPDT-based HTMs are connected by p-methoxytriphenylamine (CT1) and p-methoxydiphenylamine (CT2) substituted carbazole (CT3 and CT4) structures, rather than spiro-CPDT-based HTMs (Fig. 12 and Table 2). A HTM, which is a flexible, saddle-like, the π-conjugated skeleton that contains four fused thiophene rings, forms a cyclo-octatetrathiophene (CoTh) provided with four triphenylamines (CoTh-TTPA) is designed. Investigations prove that HTM combined with mixed perovskite ([FAPbI3]0.85[MAPbBr3]0.15) and effective triple cation perovskite ([(FAPbI3)0.87(MAPbBr3)0.13]0.92[CsPbI3]0.08) achieved remarkable light-to-energy efficiencies of 16.3% and 15.9% correspondingly. Which is the minimum compared to spiro-OMeTAD HTM. In the same way, investigations were carried out on thermally stable thiophene-based 4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophene-based core small molecules (CDTh1 and CDTh-EtHex2) and found that methoxy-substituted triphenylamine side arms as donor group are able to be synthesized and purified by a short synthetic route that yields high through an easy Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling. An easy synthetic way of hybridizing an arylamine-based ligand is used to prepare a bithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TbT) conjugated moiety based three HTMs (TbT-1 = 15.59%, TbT-2 = 14.25%, & TbT-3 = 18.37%). It is marked with an insignificant higher value compared to the benchmark of spiro-OMeTAD (PCE = 17.19%). New compounds are based on attachment of lengthy alkyl chains is found to solve this issue but suspected to affect the conductivity. High efficient HTM is designed by the promotion of intermolecular assembly by π–π and S⋯S interactions through fusion of oligothiophene-based π-conjugated systems as central core.


The extended π-structure of the D′–A–D–A–D–A–D′-type HTM improves the hole extraction or collection by minimizing the moisture attraction and hence the perovskite layer is protected compared to smaller D–A-type molecules. The hydrophobic property of HTM improves the device stability and hence retards the intrusion of water and it is observed to retain 80% of its initial performance over 500 h under the conditions of 60% relative humidity/1 sun light-soaking without encapsulation. Very few HTMs with more twisted structures are observed in fluorine-substituted benzothiadiazole (FBT) and these FBT are the core structures where JY6 and JY7 with mono-fluorinated BT and difluorinated BT are tested and compared. Compared to JY7 with two F atom substitutions, monofluorinated BT in JY6 proved to increase hole mobility, hole extraction and hole transportation. Furthermore, investigations prove that various alkoxyl chain lengths on triphenylamine have an insignificant impact on the photo-physical and electrochemical properties, whereas the impact on conductivity, hole mobility and hole extraction is high. Hua Yong and team carried out a systematic investigation of the solar cell performance and the impact of two different acceptor cores (BT and TP) on optical and electronic properties, where it was proved that TP is the stronger electron-deficient unit and it enhances the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) within the D–A–D organic molecules. Four BT-based HTMs (CS01, CS03, LCS01 and EP02), with methoxyphenyl substituents that increase the conjugation in the molecule with smother films, and minimal carrier kinetics, were achieved by synthesizing them rapid, low cost and effectively. Likewise, the FBT unit has been established for the implementation of novel amorphous HTMs, namely JY6 and JY7, as their central structures. Such an electron-deficient movement is seldom seen in HTMs with highly changed structures. A good degree of energy, good thermal stability and good hole extraction and hole transfer capability are available for JY6 with mono-fluorinated BT. The results show that FBT is successful in building highly twisted HTMs that can provide new inside information on potential HTMs (Fig. 13 and Table 3).

Using donor–π spacer–donor (D–π–D) molecular configuration, certain low-cost alternative HTM was designed with the combination of conjugated electron-rich cores with arylamine end-caps. At times, the introduction of the electron-rich core leads unfavorable lift in HOMO energy level and minimal stability, yet few HTMs prove high efficiency compared to spiro-OMeTAD. With the C and N atoms at the ninth and tenth position successful synthesizing of high purity 4,4′-(10-(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine-2,7-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) (ACR-TPA) is done. The studies illustrate that HTM has the least absorption in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) area. For a hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide PSCs, a new HTM was synthesized using a low band-gap quinolizino acridine based molecule. Polymer serves as a hole transporter similar to colorless HTMs, but perovskite serves as a light extractor. The HTM compound based on the functionalized colored new low band gap quinolizino acridine (QA), proves to be an efficient p-type HTM in the MAPbI3 solar cell. A new TDT-OMeTPA 3D HTM with coplanar QA as the center with 50 times more than the TTPA-OMeTPA has been developed by Zhang et al. The advantages of the most recent composition 3D HTM definition in PSCs are demonstrated in this study using central quinolizino coplanar.


A good balance is achieved in terms of efficiency, stability and expense by the synthesis of low complexity, high-performance HTMs. With these features, Zhang and the team designed a modest core electron-deficient quinoxaline unit in conjunction with methoxyl substituted triphenylamines (MeOTPA) endcaps for constructing new and inexpensive D–A–D featured HTMs TQ1 and TQ2. Quinoxaline core substituents have an impact on photovoltaic performance. Thienyl substituent-based TQ2 is superior compared to its phenyl analogue TQ1 in the features of extracting and conducting holes. A large-sized device with a working area of 1.02 cm2 is fabricated and its highest PCE of 18.5% proves its outperformance compared to spiro-OMeTA. Analysis of single crystals reveals that the presence of thienyl substituent groups in TQ2 leads to high interactions between S–S and S–π molecules. This reduces the distance between the channels of hole hoping to influence the HTM layer charge transportation. The palladium-catalyzed C–N coupling pathway was effectively replaced by a simple successive condensation approach by Mohammad Khaja Nazeeruddin and co-workers, resulting in a low-cost HTM that can be employed in efficient PSCs. The innovative procedure presented by the researchers did not involve any purification, harsh conditions, or a catalyst. An organic compound called N,N′-(naphthalene-5-diyl)bis(1,2-diphenylquinoxalin-6-yl), abbreviated as BEDN, was used to boost PCE by 17.85%, making it on par with the most recent state-of-the-art HTM spiro-OMeTAD technology in terms of efficiency (19.50%). The expected cost per gram of BEDN is 1.38 dollars less than the price of OMETAD (92 dollars per gram).


Fluoranthene is a cyclopentene-fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a rigid planarized structure that stimulates strengthened stacking formation. More specifically, as a substructure of fullerene, fluoranthene has a standard electron-deficient behavior due to its cyclopenta-fused composition. Better advantages of the fluoranthene unit, such as cost-effectiveness, good planar structure, simple functionality and high thermal and chemical stability influence its application as the main structural framework. Additionally, the unique central cyclopenta-fused ring provides the electron-deficient feature for fluoranthene, and hence is used as an electron extraction core for synthesizing several D–A type HTMs. As a result, fluoranthene may also be a good electron retraction component for the construction of PSCs D–A type HTMs, as demonstrated in the literature. With these performance factors in mind, it is important to create a new D–A combination for HTMs with low difficulty and without dopant. Fluoranthene has no precise studies but is known to be the best alternative to dopant-free HTM construction and one of the traditional cyclopentene-fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with a stable planar structure. Functionalization of fluoranthene functional units is done using methoxy-substituted triphenylamine (TPA) units on the 3-, 8-positions or 3-, 8-, 9-positions for constructing linear and star-shaped structures by adjusting their structural geometry (linear vs. branched), the link between electron-donating and electron-withdrawing units (single bond vs. ethylene), and the position of replacement of the methoxy side-groups (para-vs. meta-). The results proved the efficiency of the FBA3 molecule to serve as an excellent dopant-free organic and cost-effective HTM in a typical PSC with 19.27% PCE.


Excellent photoluminescence quantum production, high thermal and chemical stability, common organic solvent solubility, and the best film-forming ability of fluorene highlight its suitability as being the best candidate for developing light-emitting conjugated materials. Yet, the possibility of additives damaging the long term stability is high and those are mainly used in typical PSCs with an n–i–p structure. Even though certain results prove the efficiency of small molecular HTM based planar inverted devices viz., such as Trux-OMeTAD (18.05%), TPA–TVT–TPA (16.32%), TPASB (16.2%), and TPAC3M (16.58%), there is a need to understand and analyze the device stability (Fig. 14 and Table 4). Similar to this, Sonar and his team recorded by substituting triphenylamine (TPA) groups at various positions such as 2 and 7 or 3 and 6. This HTM molecule TPA-3, 6-FLTPA-TPA-based device achieved 13.9% PCE under open air, whereas the TPA-2, 7-FLTPA-TPA-based device exhibits 17.1% PCE which is greater than the previous and with FF enhancement. Excellent stability is also exhibited compared to N4,N4,N4′′,N4′′-tetra([1,10-biphenyl]-4-yl)-[1,1′:4′,1′′-terphenyl]-4,4′′-diamine (TaTm) having the same ageing test criteria.

Later on, Hua Yang et al. and team suggested that YT2, while used as HTM in PSCs after successful synthesis 8 the non-coplanar 9,9′-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-substituted fluorene moiety is the best suited candidate HTM that provides strong molecular building core. Same group while added with two new easy accessible 9,9′-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-replaced fluorene-based HTMs having H (YT1) and methoxyphenyl-fluorene (YT3) as the end groups and developed to apply in (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 and CsPbI2Br PSCs based on YT3 is observed to achieve excellent PCE of 20.23% and 13.36%, correspondingly which are higher than that based on spiro-OMeTAD with PCE of 19.18% and 12.30%. Added to this, YT3-based PSC exhibits 600 hours of excellent stability. Normally, a change in the phenyl ring structure that connects fluorene and triphenylamine functional units always produce an adverse impact on the molecules and hence reduces the performance of HTM in PSC. Latest researchers carried out a systematical study on the association of HOMO energy levels of HTMs and the photovoltaic parameters, especially Voc for spirobifluorene-based derivatives, fluorene–dithiophene derivatives and tetraphenyl–arylamine derivatives, respectively. Modification of the aliphatic chain at 9,9′-position of fluorene core, the FH-3 shows normal energy level, high thermal stability, appropriate structure pack and high hole mobility with excellent efficiency recorded as 18.4%.

Wide investigations in solid state dye-sensitized solar cells on carbazole moiety based HTM based on carbazole moiety demonstrated excellent efficiency. Yet only a few studies exist on the impact of linking topology and carbazole based HTM. Interesting properties of HTM based carbazole include inexpensive 9H-carbazole starting material, excellent chemical and environmental stability given by the complete aromatic unit (Fig. 15 and Table 5). The introduction of various functional groups in to the nitrogen atom provides better solubility and well-adjusted optical and electronic properties. In the synthesis and characterization of novel carbazole-based HTMs with two or three armed chemical structures, which were linked through phenylene-derived central core units. This is due to the presence of rigid intermolecular interaction between the perovskite layer and the huge hydrophobicity. Similarly, π-conjugated carbazole central core units, such as an extended two and four fused benzene ring fused aromatic unit (Cz-N and Cz-Pyr) can be envisioned as a promising strategy in order to design simple and efficient HTMs with increased thermal and electronic properties. The presence of X25 in carbazole moiety improves the conductance and molecular planarity compared to X2 in TPA unit and similar in case of obtaining lowered HOMO energy level. Studies on carbazole derivative precursors, namely, 3,6-dimethoxydiphenylaminecarbazole (CzDMPA) have already proved the extensive use of these in PSC and also their high efficiency. Hence, the introduction of methoxy groups is adequate. The covalent connection to the substratum surface shows high tolerance in perovskite processing and guarantees proven surface coverage.

Similar to triarylamine, the low costs of carbazole and its derivatives, with a lower redox potential due to strong electron-donating properties, have been extensively examined because of their good chemical stability with complete aromaticity, and molecular stability. Pyrrole-containing heteroacene HTMs dependent on carbazole, indolocarbazole, and fused indoles have recently been extensively investigated as a related p-type analogue to triarylamine because of their interesting features: low cost of carbazole and its derivatives, low redox potential due to high electron donating property, good chemical and environmental stability due to maximum aromaticity, and molecular stability (Fig. 16 and Table 5). Indeno-[1,2-b]carbazole group, in addition to the merit of having bulky planar structure, also inherits merits from fluorene and carbazole. M129, with an indeno[1,2-b]carbazole donor, generated PCE of 20.35% and 17.50% in doped and dopant-free PSCs, correspondingly. Various researches were carried out to study the device stability while these extrinsic factors are absent. Jeffrey and team proved the efficiency of PSC as it could retain 94% of peak efficiency even under the combined stresses of light (UV), oxygen and moisture for 1000 hours of continuous unencapsulated operation in an open atmosphere with a humidity of 10–20%. To link methoxydiphenylamine-substituted carbazole (pPh-2MODPACz), which has outstanding hole mobility and conductivity, along with effective hole extraction ability and good film-forming characteristics, one of the most essential bridges is p-phenylene (P-phenylene). In prior investigations, devices using spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM have obtained efficiencies of roughly 20% and 16.07% using MAPbI3-based PSCs using doped and undoped pPh-2MODPACz as the HTM. These findings are conceivable due to pPh-2MODPACz's outstanding charge carrying features, as well as its total coverage of the perovskite and its superior hole extraction abilities. In addition, pPh-2MODPACz-based PSCs' device stability has been greatly enhanced. As we show in this study, a simple-bridge linkage between the holetransporting units can be used to create effective holetransporting units.

In PSCs, phenothiazine has been introduced as a low-cost substitute for dimethoxydiphenylamine, which accounts for around 90% of the final cost of hole-transporting products. Recent studies have proven the performance, cost-effectiveness and potential benefits of phenothiazine HTM in PSCs which exhibit various possibilities of functionalization. Its chemical stability exhibits high hole mobilities with good solubility, forming the basis for good film formation. For all these reasons, we foresee phenothiazine as a particularly promising core unit for designing low-cost, environmentally friendly HTMs for high-performance PSCs (Fig. 17 and Table 6). Salunke et al. designed an organic-eco-friendly phenothiazine that has an azomethine π-bridge HTM. This HTM has a distribution of dimethoxy triarylamine groups and a reported increase in efficiency over mono substitution (AZO-I = 12.6%, AZO-II = 14%). Specifically, Docampo and team members investigated azomethine based EDOT core HTM (EDOT-OMeTPA), and proved that Schiff base condensation chemistry achieves optimal cost HTM with high performance and low impact on the environment. In a solution-processed lead trihalide PSCs, phenothiazine-based structure is proved to be an HTM. PTZ1 and PTZ2 are the phenothiazine-based compounds that is developed using straightforward Buchwald–Hartwig and Suzuki–Miyaura cross-couplings correspondingly under AM 1.5 sun, an increase of 2.1% (PTZ1) to a remarkable 17.6% (PTZ2) PCE is measured, which proves the suitability of phenothiazine-based compounds as HTMs in PSC. Using a Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction, Liu et al. developed a novel electron-rich small molecule (PTZ-TP) with phenothiazine as the middle and triphenylamine side groups.

For recent advances in PSCs, new building blocks of cores and periphery classes for organic HTMs have gained a lot of coverage. A series of HTMs with several transport components such as the TPA group are synthesized and the impact of variation in the HTM's molecular structure on the electrical properties and performance of PSCs is assessed. The development of simple, cheap and eco-friendly HTM is most needed for the commercialization of PSC (Fig. 18–20 and Table 7).

TPA entities that have butadiene derivatives exhibited excellent hole mobility and better film formation when used in organic photoconductors. Their absorption band maxima are located in the visible region, at 451 nm for HTM1 and at 471 nm for HTM2. Thus, it is deduced that various π-position substituents (electron-donating ability –OCH3 –CH3) on the phenyl rings of the TPA unit have no strong impact on the energy levels, since triphenylamine and butadiene derivatives form a large π-conjugated system. Very limited literature is found on the studies of non-fused heterocycles as cores for linear TPA HTMs. They were designed with a carbazole unit and used as a comparative compound that provided a clear understanding of the relationship between non-fused heterocycles and charge transport property. It is also important to observe that M104 offers a synthetic cost of only 309.65 RMB per g or 49.38 $ per g, whereas spiro-OMeTAD bought from OLED (China) is 1000 RMB per g or 166 $ per g. The exploitation of alkyl chain length is a powerful strategy for the concentration of organic materials' properties to enhance their performance in a variety of applications. Pham et al. produced a new low-cost HTM based on a readily available inexpensive anthanthrone (ANT) dye that was functionalized with a diphenylamine (DPA) end-capping group. In a PSC, quart-p-phenylene1 is used as an HTM candidate (FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/Csx(MA0.17FA0.83)(100−x)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3/1/Au) configuration. With a system configuration of FTO/bl-TiO2/mp-TiO2/MAPbI3/HTM/Au, two novel star-shaped triarylamine-based hole transport materials with triphenylamine (STR1) or a partly oxygen-bridged TPA (STR0) HTMs were measured in PSCs. The silicon and TPA-derived design strategy facilitates reducing synthetic costs and achieves the highest efficiency of power conversion (19.06%), which is one of the greatest PCE among p–i–n PSCs to date. Furthermore, the devices display negligible hysteresis, strong reproductiveness and durability.
To use 3D tetraphenylbutadiene derivatives decorated with TPA or TPA fragments, they are first prepared as HTMs in PSCs. Followed by Nishim et al. pointed out that vinyl triarylamine positioning and the number of units around the center of benzene influences greatly the molecular electronic characteristics. PSCs based on TOP-HTM 3 additive contained high PCE of 17.5% (forward scan)/18.6% (reverse scan), equivalent to that of the PSC comparison unit based on spiro-OMeTAD additive consisting (18.0%/18.4%). Chen et al. were synthesized using conventional Suzuki and Buchwald Hartwig-coupling reactions with a triphenylene-core basis, with two new HTMs (TPH-T) used in mixed ion (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 PSCs with superior performance (19.4%) can be attributed to the desirable energy-level distribution, as well as the excellent charge mobility and extraction efficiency. Many metastable cavities are formed by twisted conformations and hydrogen bonds, which can help with hole transport. A group of new V-shaped hole-transporting materials containing TPD-type moieties conjoined by a Trogers base core was formed by Braukyla et al. The TB center provides angle-wise orientation for TPD fragments, preventing crystallization and making the examined compound completely amorphous, whereas directed para-substituted TPD type moieties have high charge mobility. These TB-based HTMs are amorphous, don't need to be annealed at elevated temperatures, and can be treated in the air. According to preliminary tests in PSCs, this class of TB-linked molecules will act as HTM. Similarly, a simple two-step synthesis procedure that yields a high yield of the target product was used to synthesise and investigate two diphenylamine-substituted carbazole fragments bound by a nonconjugated methylenebenzene unit.

Copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) was the first organometallic compound to be identified as an HTL for PSCs in late 2014. The CuPc-based devices had a PCE of 5% overall. Several new HTMs based on metal phthalocyanines have since been produced to increase performance, owing to their versatility, ease of synthesis and purification, high thermal and chemical stability, and high carrier mobility. Furthermore, a recent study found that non-metal phthalocyanine HTM-based organic small molecules were more efficient and stable than metal phthalocyanine HTM-based devices. Its most active study is the change of the metal site to zinc, nickel or copper phthalocyanine. The high reliability in PSC, hole mobility, low cost and heat/chemical stability of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) have attracted much attention, and it has high charge carrier mobility in its pristine forms (Fig. 21 and Table 8). To make the CuPc solution-processable, various functional groups were added, resulting in the alkyl, TPA, and TIPS-pentacene related CuPc derivatives. The latest study on CuPc showed high performance of more than 20% (20.09%) and high reliability in the PSC. The CuPc device demonstrated excellent thermal stability at 85 °C for 2000 hours and light stability for 100 hours.

Metal phthalocyanines (MPCs) are another class of HTM widely used as p-type semiconductors in thin film transistors and organic solar cells. The unique features of this are minimum production charges, relatively high hole mobility, excellent hydrophobicity and good optical, thermal and chemical stability. Deep absorption in the red and near-IR regions makes this HTM the best suited and has been used as an HTM in PSC in the recent past. Variation of the central metal and peripheral substituents tunes the photo-electronic properties of phthalocyanines. At the same time, adequate substitution of porphyrinoid modifies the crystal packing. On the other hand, both in the solid and liquid state, the tBu-group affords good Pc solubility and minimized π–π stacking but it remains rigid. Because of some of their special characteristics, such as ease of synthesis, high hole mobility, and high stability, metal phthalocyanines have been commonly used as p-type semiconductors in organic solar cells and thin-film transistors. The findings demonstrate that both the individual optoelectronic properties of ZnPcs and the accumulation of these tetrapyrrolic semiconductors in the mixed-ion perovskite ((FA)0.85(MA)0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3) solid thin film have a substantial effect on photovoltaic efficiency.
Due to the large range of hole mobilities, MPcs with several functional groups can have a strong influence on their molecular path. The preferred face-on molecular alignment for Me6Bu-ZnPc is only observed on the perovskite substrate, showing the role of methyl substituents in influencing molecular alignment through particular interactions between the MPc molecule and different locations of perovskite material on the surface. For PSCs with high efficiency and long-term stability, efficient and sustainable HTMs are needed. MPcs with several substituents can have a significant impact on their molecular paths, resulting in a wide range of hole motilities. When spin-coated on perovskite, solution-processed CuPrPc as HTM is used to fabricate the planar PSCs. Finally, the overall PCE was 17.8% with improved durability, and after 800 hours of storage at 75% humidity, they retained over 94% of their original efficiency. Furthermore, these ZnPc-dimers with 2,5-thienyl derivatives (ZnPc-th-ZnPc 1, ZnPc-flu-ZnPc 2, ZnPc-DPP-ZnPc 3, and ZnPc-p-ZnPc 4) showed greater stability than doped spiro-OMeTAD in dark storage conditions with a relative humidity of 20 percent for 500 hours and at 500 °C with a relative humidity. The recommended face-on molecular alignment for Me6Bu-ZnPc is only observed on the perovskite substrate, enhancing the quality of the methyl substituent's in regulating molecular alignment through special interactions between the MPc molecule and various sites of perovskite content on the surface. Me6Bu-ZnPc HTM thin film serves as an encapsulation sheet, with its high hydrophobicity and strong coverage. Me6Bu-ZnPc HTM thin film acts as an encapsulation layer, with its high hydrophobicity and good coverage.

The introduction of a twist to the molecular structure is supposed to increase structural rigidity and increase the Tg value, all of which are beneficial for the material's thermal stability. In comparison with traditional planar and spiro-type molecules, where the interactions are typically the primary intermolecular interactions, the rigid conformation of helicenes can also have intermolecular interactions such as heavy CH interactions in polycrystalline packing patterns. LEDs, organic field-effect transistors and OSCs are a few organic electronic devices that use helicenes as HTMs (Fig. 22and Table 9). Mild changes in the intermolecular interactions have a great influence on the intrinsic hole mobility. This is the first report providing knowledge on using azahelicene frameworks as HTM provides 17.34% of PCE in a PSC and outperforms spiro-OMeTAD. To better understand the unique role of helicene as a kernel block in the discovery of exotic organic semiconductors, thia[5]helicene (T5H) is duplicated and aminated with electron-donating dimethoxydiphenylamine to yield T5H-OMeDPA, which is compared to its PET congener (PET-OMeDPA). As a result, the T5H-OMeDPA single crystal has a potential hole mobility of around 5 times that of PET-OMeDPA. Quite interestingly, contributing to a larger domain of molecular aggregate, the solution-processed racemic glassy film of T5H-OMeDPA has a 3 times higher hole-mobility than the PET-OMeDPA equivalent. Controlling the manner of molecular packing and the size of molecular aggregates is critical in next-generation PSC device application systems. Thin films can be made by solution depositing thin films of DBC-OMeDPA, which has greater hole mobility than the current state of the art spiro-OMeTAD power. The current hole-higher transporter's glass transition temperature allows for long-term functioning under heat and full sunshine soaking.

As a fused conjugated aromatic ring, pyrene has excellent charge transport ability due to its strong electron relocation. In this regard, pyrene is focused as its isolation from coal tar is easier and the production is done in an extensive range of combustion standards. The strong electron delocalization feature of pyrene gives high charge transportation due to the presence of 4-fused benzene rings of an alternate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (Fig. 23 and Table 10). Pyrene core derivatives are applied as HTMs through the substitution of functional groups in various ranges of pyrene. Hence, this HTM OMe-TATPyr, exhibits easy synthesizing, better performance, low cost and long-term stability is considered to be a promising substitute for the large-scale manufacturing of PSCs. Two new HTMs have been engineered for use in planar (FAPbI3)0.75(MAPbI3)0.17(MAPbBr3)0.08 dependent solar cells, which are based on TPA and carbazole core moieties and can maintain over 80% of their initial output after 50 days, which is better than comparable spiro-OMeTAD-based systems (50%). In this regard, pyrene is focused as its isolation from coal tar is easier and the derivatives with Bp-OMe, Py-Me, and spiro-OMeTAD as HTMs with doping had the best PCEs of 15.06, 18.57, and 19.28%, respectively, under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm2. Despite the fact that Bp-OMe-based PSCs had lower PCEs than Py-OMe-based PSCs due to the poor planarity and hole flexibility, both Bp-OMe and Py-OMe appear to be promising powerful HTMs for PSCs when cost is considered. Significantly, the functionalized OMe-TATPyr two-dimensional conjugated molecular units with pyrene core bridged triarylamine groups improve charge delocalization and intermolecular stacking, with best PCE up to 20.6%. Such remarkable performance, combined with the synthesis of OMe-versatile TATPyr and its low cost, makes it a promising HTM for success and consistency.

Using detailed optical, electrical and electrochemical features of porphyrin molecules, their properties such as conductivity, electronic transitions and HOMO energy levels were assessed and it was proved that they have good conductivity and are well-aligned with the valence band of methylammonium lead iodide, the archetypal absorber in PSC (Fig. 24 and Table 10). Porphyrins are used as HTM in PSC due to the photophysical and photochemical properties of the porphyrin molecule's ability to adjust itself through the periphery functionalization (meso and β-positions) and difference in the metal center. To date, the successful design and application of a series of porphyrin HTMs in PSC reported. Similarly, boryl oxasmaragdyrins exhibit the merits viz., easy synthesis, simple purification, inexpensive and long-term moisture stability. High hole extraction and conveyance capabilities are achieved by combining a new pyrene-cored hole transporting material with fluorene-terminated moieties. The fact that TFAP is an easy and low-cost synthesis and that MAPbI3 PSCs have been handled with it, as well as its high efficiency in devices (19.7%), makes it appealing for potential PSC processing. The appealing characteristics of the fluorene terminal unit demonstrated in this study are essential for the development of new molecular HTMs in the future.
The excellent performance of dimeric porphyrin HTMs, especially WT3 fabricated PSCs, demonstrated a superior PCE of 19.44%. Porphyrin HTMs, in particular, are believed to result from advanced intermolecular packaging of dimeric-porphyrins and have been shown to outperform spiro-OMeTAD in terms of both inefficiency (18.62%) and stability. Recently, fluorinated PZn-HTLs (PZn-2FTPA and PZn-3FTPA) were discovered to have better hole transport properties than nonfluorinated PZn-HTLs (PZn-TPA). Additionally, their deeper HOMO energy levels contributed to higher open-circuit voltages, and their better face-on stacking improved hole transport properties. Similarly, Zhu's research group developed arylamine-substituted porphyrin HTMs and they attained 16% PCE. In PSC based on ZnP, a PCE of 17.78%, was proved, whereas in a similar condition, spiro-OMeTAD gave 18.59% PCE. MA+ and FA+ perovskite together with Co(II)P and Co(III)P was obtained compared to 19.6% for spiro-OMeTAD. A layer of efficient HTM (boryl oxasmaragdyrins HTMs = SM01, SM09, and SM13) provides good absorption spectra in the low-energy area, excellent redox reversibility, high thermal stability, best-suited energy levels with MAPbI3 perovskite, and a planar structure with good hole mobility. Similarly, a PSC that uses SM01 provides low photovoltaic performance due to the terminal carboxylic acid functional group and CH3NH3PbI3 interactions. Based on the effect of Co(II) and Co(III) redox couple, the best efficiency of 20.5% for the (CsFAMA)Pb(BrI)3. This is one of the highest PCEs ever recorded among PSCs that use porphyrin-based HTLs. The porphyrin HTM films shown in this work have a high capacity for hole transport, particularly in the case of Y2. While deposited on perovskite, the low HOMO level, high hole mobility, and absence of surface pinholes result in an open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current of Y2 comparable to those of spiro-OMeTAD. We can still determine whether porphyrin-based HTMs have any additional positive properties beyond their excellent holetransporting ability. Nonetheless, unlike spiro and the majority of organic frameworks, a porphyrin's total of 13 positions on the peripheral (4 meso and 8 beta positions) and coordination centre indicates a high degree of structural versatility, allowing for future fine-tuning of photophysical, electrochemical, and charge-transporting properties. Given the scarcity of porphyrin-based HTMs suitable for application in PSCs, this work establishes a new paradigm for hole transporters based on porphyrin families.

High efficiency is achieved by the suppression of recombining free carriers at the effective interface between perovskite and electrode in a perovskite layer by the extraction and generation of holes using HTM. Various HTMs have been developed and used to date, but there is still a great need to identify a natural and eco-friendly material that is simple and highly efficient. The above-mentioned needs were satisfied by the cyclic tetrapyrroles, including chlorophyll (Chl) derivatives (Fig. 25 and Table 11). Additionally, the photoexcited electrons can delocalize throughout the entire π-system which leads to excellent charge transportation. Existing commercial HTMs provide more than 20% efficiency with good thermal and light stability, yet the natural Chl derivative is inexpensive and available abundantly and hence making it a great competitor to the other HTMs. There is an immediate demand for cheap, eco-friendly and readily available HTMs. Chl, a key pigment for photosynthesis is readily available in the nature and the central source of light absorption and charge transferring processes in photosynthesis pathway.

Previous studies reported the classical cyclic tetrapyrrole structure of natural and synthetic derivatives of Chl owing to their optoelectronic properties. Later in the PSC, Chls are used as an HTL. Li et al. studied and recorded 13% of PCE and it motivated the use of Chl as HTL due to its advantages such as high resources, simple synthesis and eco-friendliness. Changes in the peripheral substituents might tune the absorption spectra and energy levels. It also has good charge mobility with no dopant. Earlier studies showed the use of monolayer Chl as HTL which had certain limitations like, instability, charge recombination and lack of hole mobility. Hence, Li Na et al. evaluated the bilayer Chl-based PSC photovoltaic performance and proved the good stability and higher PCE (14.1%) and it is the prime time of using bilayer Chl as HTL, yet it proves to be a promising method. Naturally occurring Chl pigments play an essential part in electron/energy transfer in the normal photosynthesis process, which is of course used. The Chls demonstrate an extremely smooth film surface, high hole mobility, reasonable energy and effective injection speeds, which are the key characteristics of efficient PSC hole operators. In PSC with small PCE from ZnPor-based PSC, ZnBChl and ZnPor were newly synthesized and used as HTM, especially for their small energy differences from the ZnPor-MAPbI3 perovskite with the highest HOMO. The HOMO degree of MAPbI3 perovskite was lowly emphasized to extend this energy difference by the inclusion of FA+ and Br− ions in the MAPbI3 crystal.

The triazatruxene core is designed with three indole units merged by a single benzene ring and taken as a two-dimensional π-system (Fig. 26 and Table 12). This gives a huge aromatic surfaces to overlap with each other to transfer the inter-molecules efficiently and also gives chemical versatility for tuning the morphological and electronic properties. The fundamental core of TAT is triazatruxene, which can be made cheaply from precursors synthesized from plentiful natural products. TAT is also synthetically flexible, thanks to reactive sites on indole N atoms and benzene rings, which allows for fine-tuning of optical, electrical, and morphological properties. Furthermore, the three nitrogen atoms in each indole unit should aid in the stabilization of the oxidized HTM's radical cation during system use. Finally, the rigid planar chemical structure can help improve the resistance of the material to photo and thermal decomposition. The electron donor–acceptor (D–A) substituted dipolar chromophore (BTPA-TCNE) is synthesized to serve as an efficient HTM (BTPA-TCNE) for PSC. The synthesis of BTPA-TCNE using a simple reaction between a triphenylamine-based Michler's base and tetracyanoethylene and the subsequent derivatives using BTPA-TCNE as the HTM to have a high PCE of 17.0%, outperforming existing HTMs.

An inverted 3-F-br-4C PSC device exhibited 17.2% PCE with low hysteresis, good storage and operational stability. Furthermore, while tested for stability on encapsulated 16 mm2 devices working at MPP, uninterrupted sunlight proved greater than 90% retention of the actual PCE (15.6%) after 1300 h at 35 °C. Motivated by these results, a planar and electron-rich di-indolotriazatruxene (DIT) was presented. Two truxene-based molecules: Trux1 (ref. 391) and Trux2, the second one having phenylene spacer between the truxene core and the three-terminal bis(panisyl)amine groups-was used in PSC. Here, as a first of its kind, is an investigation of the photovoltaic behaviour of both direct (or n–i–p) and inverted (or p–i–n) configuration devices and peculiar behaviour is observed regarding the referred HTM. Their photovoltaic performance is detrimental due to their weak hole transportation. Their photovoltaic performance is detrimental due to their weak hole transportation. Connel et al. created the TAT-tBuSty HTM from low-cost raw materials, greatly simplifying the manufacture of a high-quality HTM. The efficiency of the champion is 20.3% (19.4% stabilized efficiency) in a Cs-FA mixed-cation PSCs. The average cost of purified TAT-tBuSty is expected to be $69.90 per g, or 35% less than spiro-OMeTAD; ca. $112.05 per g.

Comprehensive research requires HTMs small molecule which maintain the merits and excludes the spiro-OMeTAD demerits. Minimal electrical conductivity is shown by a thin film composed of initial spiro-MeOTAD molecules. The density and form of the charge carrier are effectively controlled by electronic doping. Finally, the affinity of the electron (ionisation potential) of a host energy dopant plays an important role in the realisation of doping viability. Using additives like Li-TFSI, TBP, and tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III)bis(tri-fluoromethylsulphonyl)imide to the spiro-OMeTAD improves its electrical properties (FK209). Several experiments were conducted to substitute hygroscopic Li-TFSI dopants with highly reliable additives. Drug substances such as Li-TFSI, Na-TFSI, AG-TfSI, Co(III) complexes, WO3, Cu(II) dopants in spiro-OMeTAD have been proven to be able to generate and modify charging systems. The rapid weakening of the structure is also accelerated. The Li-TFSI dopant has a salt-oriented property and is hygroscopic. Many unpatented HTM approaches have been employed for the development of pretty stable PSC.

On the other hand, have expensive and complicated synthesis methods and must be prepared solely for successful PSC. Besides demerits, spiro-OMeTAD synthesis and cleansing are repetitive and cost approximately USD 400 per grams. Formalized paraphrase it also has limitations such as dopant concentration susceptibility, PSC instability as a result of use, low solubility in organic solvents, and high volatility. Because of the aforementioned flaws, p-type HTM was produced, which is more durable and less costly. The use of additives is critical since the hole carrying substrate becomes particularly hydrophilic as a result of the hygroscopic existence of dopants, resulting in chemical degradation. It has a negative impact on the device's reliability. One of the best methods for stabilizing the PSC is to use a dopant-free and highly hydrophobic HTMs that serves as a protective barrier against moisture and prevents the diffusion of additional moieties.

By using rational molecular architecture, the next generation of HTMs will be able to bypass these bottlenecks. A symmetrical arrangement is important from the standpoint of chemical structure to facilitate π–π stacking interactions, resulting in high hole mobility. So far, several small-molecule HTMs have been successfully used in different forms of PSCs. A list of novel small molecule HTMs is presented in Table 2. Doping is commonly used to achieve the necessary electrical conductivity in massive band gap HTMs; due to the hygroscopic nature of dopers, an HTM coating becomes highly hydrophilic, causing chemical corrosion and negatively affecting the overall device's stability. Using the required method to transport material free of dopants and highly hydrophobic troughs to serve as a moisture defence layer and avoid the dissemination of exterior drips is one interesting strategy for stabilizing the reinforcement of PSCs.

The best energetic configuration and best suited affinity towards the perovskite reduce the loss and hence spiro-OMeTAD is considered to be the most efficient HTM. Even though various small molecule HTMs with high solar performance have been developed, there is a high demand for highly performable dopant-free HTMs with excellent physical properties (Fig. 27 and Table 13). Moreover, it is highly important to study the effects of DF-OHTMs deposited on top of the perovskite layer on PSCs stability. PSCs with efficient HTM shall be based on the criteria viz., exact energy level (HOMO/LUMO) with perovskite, rapid hole extracting/transporting, application of uniformly thin film morphology, high stability in internal structure and inexpensive. Application of dopant-free D–A small molecule HTMs influences the increase in efficiency and helps fabrication cost reduction. With the presence of various spiro-based HTMs, (spiro-OMeTAD-TPA) combined with several distinct π-functional molecular derivatives had exhibited high performance because of its simple synthesis process and great growth in PCE.

In MAPbI3 based PSCs, the novel HTM (4,4′-spirobi[cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene]) derivative (spiro-CPDT) showed 15.0% higher PCE than the p-doped spiro-MeOTAD device, affecting the device's cost-effectiveness. For instance the Dong Zhu et al. and his team synthesized by incorporating a TPA into spiro-based 10-phenyl-10H-spiro[acridine-9,9′-fluorene] (SAF) core named as SAF-OMe achieving a champion PCE of 16.73% in 2016. Extended conjugation D′–A–D–A–D–A–D′-type PSC proved 17.3% efficiency and improved stability with no encapsulation. This PSC with the new DF-HTM retains 80% of its initial performance over 500 h under the conditions of 60% relative humidity/1 sun light-soaking without encapsulation. Paek et al. suggested a DF-OHTM for a PSC that constitutes strong quinolizino acridine and flexible triphenylamine donor based star-shaped D–π–A type hole transporting molecule termed as FA-CN/TPA-CN and it reached the PCE of FA-CN = 18.9% and long term stability with 65% of first value with continuous light for 1300 h.
Following the previous work, Rakstys and the team were successful in replacing three dopant-free HTMs (central QA core of FA-CN with triazatruxene (named KR321)) to form a face-on orientation. The entire series preserves tri-azatruxene donor and malononitrile acceptor groups. The π-bridge was modulated with 3-hexylthiophene, 3,3′′-dihexyl-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene and 4,4-dihexyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene, respectively. Using the good semi-locked tetrathienylethene (TTE) as DF-OHTM based on small molecules achieved a PCS of 20% through the well adjusted molecular planarity. Passivating interface and compositional adjustment of the DF-OHTM in the n–i–p type achieves 21.04% PCE with a steady-state efficiency of 20.36%. This is the highest PCE for a PSC which is based on (DTP-C6Th) a simple dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole-cored dopant-free small molecule HTM. An unencapsulated device that uses DTP-C6Th HTMs exhibits very minimum degradation in performance while a nitrogen gas glove box is used for storing it. Also, even if it is present in the open air for 60 days, it retains 85% of its initial performance. Both efficient hole transport and successful interfacial hole transfer in the solar cell system are responsible for X44's superior photovoltaic efficiency.
Wei Huang and his team members (2018) developed N,N′-bicarbazole as the key functional unit and developed two novel dopant-free HTMs (3,6 BCz-OMeTAD and 2,7 BCz-OMeTAD) by 2-phase reactions with close quantitative yields. The lab synthesis and purification cost of 3,6 BCz-OMeTAD and 2,7 BCz-OMeTAD are about to be nearly $8.55 and $14.00 per g respectively. This feature makes it suitable for large-scale commercial manufacturing. The large scale PSC based on 2,7 BCz-OMeTAD proves high performance and retains 90% of the initial performance even after being explored without encapsulation in the open air for 2000 hours. The potential of ICZ-based DF-OHTMs in PSCs has yet to be thoroughly exploited, considering their simplicity of synthesis, low cost, and versatility of modification. Rigid conjugated electron-rich aromatic ring is achieved by incorporating “donor–acceptor” (D–A) structure and a rigid conjugated indolo[3,2-b]carbazole (ICZ = C201 and C202) core and it has successful application in optoelectronics domain. Furthermore, investigations are needed to study the potential of using ICZ-based DF-HTMs in PSC owing to their easy synthesis, inexpensiveness and flexibility in changing.
Comprehensive consideration of matched-degree of energy levels, hole-transporting ability, photovoltaic conversion efficiencies and recombination of the two HTMs highlights the critical roles of developing multi-triarylamine and thiophene-rich molecules as candidates for more efficient HTMs for PSCs. Numbers of investigations were made with highly planar π-conjugated HTMs used in PSC. Those investigations have proved that, compared to non-planar core HTMs, HTMs with planar cores enhance the photovoltaic performance and hole-transporting capability. Arrangement of 4-hexylphenyl groups in IDT-TPA and IDTT-TPA are slightly modified out of the plane of the IDT and IDTT core and it leads to high steric hindrance effect in molecular packing. CuPc-Bu and CuPc-OBc are two novel compounds of CuPc that are employed as dopant-free HTMs in PSC. Among these two derivatives, PSC using dopant-free CuPc-OBc as HTM beats PSC using CuPc-Bu with PCEs of 17.6% and 14.3% respectively. A rigid planar 6,12-dihydroindeno[1,2-b]fluorine (IDF) core with a variety of bulky periphery groups to design dopant-free HTMs of IDF-SFXPh, IDF-DiDPA, and IDF-TeDPA is updated. Surprisingly, n–i–p planar PSC employing dopant-free IDF-SFXPh proved 17.6% PCE with better long-term stability compared to doped spiro-OMeTAD. Synthesis of DF-OHTM in sulphur–oxygen interaction in thienoisoindigo (TII) resists the conformational rotation and gives a rigid planar heterocycle that improves the ability to withdraw electrons and π-system coplanarity. H7-based PSC when exposed to an argon atmosphere, retains 86.3% of its initial PCE even after 100 hours. With morphological study, it is observed that H3–H7 films are smooth and hydrophobic, whereas perovskite film spin-coated on H3–H7 film are micrometer measured grains that are uniformly spread.

In the last decade, organic–inorganic halide PSCs has been significant interest as a possible solar clean energy source with a PCE exceeding 25%, which is significantly higher than existing technologies. This study focuses on the major groups of small organic molecules based on published papers by scientists and academics on the synthesis and development of new types of HTMs based on small organic compounds in PSCs. In summary, organic small-molecule HTMs have been the most frequently created category in PSCs due to their synthetic variety, adjustable characteristics, high purity, and ease of solution processing.

According to the discussion above, we categorized and carefully evaluated organic HTMs according to their functional groups, architectures, dopant composition, and component categories in this review paper. Consequently, triphenylamines were used to create the majority of the novel HTMs. For a perovskite/HTM heterojunction, it's essential to choose the correct HTM first. Furthermore, chemists have developed several modified wide ranges of synthetic techniques were used, with a particular focus on the chemical structure–property relationship; stability and system efficiency were also discussed. As a result, extending the conjugation system, which relies on donor–acceptor moiety, was used to develop the bulk of new HTMs. Chemical doping is an important way to control the energy levels of optoelectronic materials, and tune the optical properties of HTMs. Recently, it has been revealed that spiro-linked organic small molecules can be used to improve charge carrier mobility and device performance by overcoming the spiro-OMeTADs such as a complicated synthesis process, high cost, and the requirement for hygroscopic dopants. However, for most of the dopants, only a few current and well-studied materials are permitted. There is considerable enhancement in the overall power output and reliability of PSCs, but fast deterioration and a very short operating lifetime are commonly mentioned problems for high-efficiency doped HTMs. The next step for researchers should be to investigate novel materials as dopants. We believe that doping techniques are critical for further improving the system efficiency of PSCs compared to industry, given their progress in other photovoltaic technologies.
A novel fused planar core structure and extended π-conjugated HTMs exhibit equal or better performance and enhance the HTMs to have comparably high conductivity and hole mobility without external dopants. A wide range of chemical structures with excellent mobility, conductivity, and thermal stability may be produced in the context of DF-OHTMs. The DF-OHTMs have made a considerable contribution to device stability, but they've also become popular because of improvements in perovskite device power conversion efficiency that have come about as a result of using these materials. Based on the analysis above, the use of dopant-free and strongly hydrophobic hole transporting materials as a protective layer may be one successful technique for strengthening PSCs. Tiny variations in the chemical structure, such as similar atoms and electronic properties, as well as changes in modification functions or the length of the p-conjugated systems, will result in major differences in the behaviours of hole transporting efficiencies. While this approach offers an enhanced durability, it drastically affects the reliability, pinholes in the film morphology, humidity, and thermally induced volatility, as well as the perovskite–HTM interface and hazardous chemical interactions. Apart from their significant importance to system reliability, DF-OHTMs have proven extremely desirable due to their increase in the power conversion efficiency of perovskite systems. The performance of the unit using a DF-OHTM, on the other hand, still seems to be poor, but that can be compared with the spiro-OMeTAD device.
Despite the fact that many articles on HTMs have been released, there is still a need to evaluate and assess improvement in organic HTMs. Molecular architecture and synthesis are aided by the association found between chemical structures and their physicochemical properties. Another approach is to look at a wide range of chemical structures as p-type compounds, which can lead to new paths to improving the PCEs. The impact of HTM's optical bandgap (Eg) is constantly a subject of discussion. Our analysis demonstrates that a critical field of review is the sustained growth and production of low-cost, reliable HTMs as a replacement for commonly publicized established traditional materials such as doped spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA, which are both expensive and unstable. It is highly challenging to create innovative HTMs that contain all desirable characteristics, such as (i) low cost and ease of processing, (ii) suitable HOMO level alignment with the perovskite's valence band, (iii) glass transition temperature greater than 100 °C, (iv) outstanding thermal and photochemical stability, (v) dopant-free, (vi) perovskite surface trap passivation, and (vii) do not include ink. Another important problem in moving this technology towards commercialization is the toxicity of lead and the solvents used to dissolve the perovskite precursors and HTM materials during the manufacture of PSCs. When wide-area manufacturing procedures are taken into consideration, the situation becomes even more severe due to the high quantities of solutions and solvent vapours. A great deal of effort is being put into finding ways to make perovskites that are free of lead. New HTMs have a promising future in light of current molecular engineering trends and advancements, as well. It is envisaged that new functionalized materials would increase the performance and stability of PSCs by simultaneously encapsulating (for humidity and UV radiation) and trapping passivation.
Given the strength of synthetic organic chemistry, there is no doubt that the development of novel and more efficient molecules will be limited only by the scientists' creativity. And we hope that this review will serve as a catalyst for the establishment of such partnerships and the continued growth of high-performance PSCs. PSCs are expected to continue to improve as the design and synthesis of HTMs for them improves. Nonetheless, there is no question that organic chemicals will continue to play a significant role in the PSC architecture. We hope that this summary of recent HTM advances arranged by the chemical family will act as a catalyst for the chemists working on this exciting field of organic molecules for the next generation.
