A series of low band gap photovoltaic copolymers containing benzodifuran-alt-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (BDF-alt-TT) were designed and synthesized. Functional groups with different electron-withdrawing abilities such as carbonyl, ester, fluorine, sulfuryl and cyano were introduced to the thieno[3,4-b]thiophene unit to finely tune the molecular energy levels of these copolymers. All these copolymers are characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy and electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) to evaluate the effects of these electron-deficient functional groups. According to their electrochemical behaviours, the electron-deficient abilities of these functional groups can be arranged in the order carbonyl < fluorine + ester < fluorine + carbonyl < sulfuryl < cyano + ester. It was found the sulfuryl group and cyano substituted copolymers show blue-shift in absorption spectra compared to the other three copolymers, indicating that sulfuryl and cyano groups may cause stronger steric hindrance to the conjugated backbones. The photovoltaic properties of these copolymers were also investigated by making polymer solar cell (PSC) devices. Interestingly, although the copolymers have different molecular structures, the optimal D/A (polymer/PC71BM, wt/wt) ratios of all of the devices are 1:1.5. 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO) was used to further improve the photovoltaic performance of the devices. The champion efficiency of 5.23% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.63 V was achieved from PBDFTT-CF/PC71BM based devices. The device based on the cyano-substituted copolymer, PBDFTT-ECN, shows a rather high Voc of 0.87 V, but the short current density (Jsc) is significant lower than the device based on PBDFTT-CF, and its seems that the offset between the LUMO levels of PBDFTT-ECN and PC71BM is too small to achieve efficient charge separation. In conclusion, the molecular energy level of the copolymers with the alternating aromatic–quinoid (A–Q) structure, BDF-alt-TT, can be tuned effectively by introducing electron-deficient groups. Furthermore, according to the photovoltaic results of PBDFTT-S and PBDFTT-CNF, a LUMO level of −3.70 eV may reach the threshold of getting efficient charge separation of the polymer/PC71BM blend.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are an attractive alternative to inorganic photovoltaic technologies. In the past decade, much progress has been made in designing and applying low band gap (LBG) conjugated polymers in highly efficient PSCs. In order to realize low band gap, two approaches of molecular design have been broadly used in building conjugated polymers. To build conjugated backbones with alternative donor–acceptor (D–A) structure, i.e. to copolymerize electron-rich conjugated units and electron-deficient conjugated units alternatively, is one effective approach to get LBG polymers. Electron-rich units, such as cyclopenta-[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene, 2,7-carbazole, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]germole and benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene, and electro-deficient units, such as 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT), diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP), thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD), thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole and isoindigo, have been employed as building blocks in constructing highly efficient photovoltaic polymers for the applications in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices. To build conjugated backbones with alternating aromatic–quinoid (A–Q) structure, i.e. to copolymerize conjugated units with strong aromatic properties and conjugated units with strong quinoid properties, is another effective approach to get LBG polymers. The polymer family based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and thieno-[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) units is one of the most successful examples designed through the A–Q approach, and over 7% efficiencies been realized by using this kind of polymers as electron donor materials in PSCs.

As it is already known, the key parameters of PSC devices, including short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) as well as power conversion efficiency (PCE), can be tuned by modulating molecular energy levels of the materials. Therefore, the fine tuning of molecular energy levels of conjugated polymers is of crucial importance to fully exploring their photovoltaic properties, and important progress has been achieved by modulating the molecular energy levels of LBG polymers. In these works, molecular energy levels of conjugated polymers were tuned by changing the electron-withdrawing or -donating effects of the conjugated building blocks on their backbones or/and the substituents on their side groups. According to the progress of molecular energy level modulation, many interesting works have been reported for conjugated polymers with D–A structure, while only a few successful examples can be found for conjugated polymers with A–Q structure. Therefore, modulating the molecular energy level of the A–Q polymers is still an important and interesting topic for molecular structure design of photovoltaic polymers.
Recently, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDF) units were copolymerized with different conjugated building blocks and two kinds of LBG polymers, i.e. the polymers with the D–A structure and the polymers with the A–Q structure, have been prepared and showed interesting photovoltaic properties. In this work, alkoxy-substituted BDF units were copolymerized with TT units to yield a series of new LBG polymers, and functional groups with different electron withdrawing effects were used as the substituents on the TT units to tune the molecular energy levels of the new polymers. As shown in Scheme 1, electron withdrawing substituents like fluorine, ester, carbonyl, sulfonyl and cyano groups were introduced onto the TT units. These new polymers were characterized fully and the results provide basic and useful information for molecular design of the conjugated polymers with A–Q structure.

Tetrahydrofuran (THF) were dried over Na/benzophenone ketyl and freshly distilled prior to use. The other materials were commercial level and used as received.


1H NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker arx-400 spectrometer in CDCl3 at 293 K. Absorption spectra were collected on a Hitachi U-3100 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The molecular weight of the polymers were measured by GPC, wherein polystyrene was used as a standard by using chloroform as eluent. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted on a CHI650D electrochemical workstation with glassy carbon, platinum wire, and Ag/Ag+ electrode as working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode respectively, in a 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System (QE-R3011) from Enli Technology Inc. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell.


Polymer solar cell devices were fabricated under conditions as follows. After spin-coating a 35 nm layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) onto a pre-cleaned indium-tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates, the polymer/PC71BM blend solution was spin-coated. The concentration of the polymer/PC71BM blend solutions used in this study for spin-coating were 10 mg mL−1 (polymer/o-dichlorobenzene), and o-dichlorobenezene was used as the solvent. The additive, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), with a certain volume ratio, was added prior to the spin-coating process. The thickness of the active layers was controlled by changing the spin speed during the spin-coating process and measured on an Ambios Tech. XP-2 profilometer. The devices were completed by evaporating Ca/Al metal electrodes with an area of 4 mm2 as defined by masks. The current–voltage (J–V) curves were measured under 100 mW cm−2 standard AM 1.5G spectrum using a XES-70S1 (San-EI Electric Co., LTD) solar simulator (AAA grade, 70 mm × 70 mm photo-beam size, 2 cm × 2 cm). The light intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated by a Monocrystalline silicon reference cell (SRC-1000-TC-QZ, purchased from VLSI Standards Inc.) prior to the J–V measurements.

The reactant was stirred and heated to reflux for 16 hours. Then the reactant was cooled to room temperature, and the polymer was precipitated by addition of 50 mL methanol, and then filtered through a Soxhlet thimble, which was then subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, and chloroform. The polymer was recovered as solid from the chloroform fraction by precipitation from methanol. The solid powders were dried under vacuum. The yields and molecular weight results of the polymers are as follows:

The synthetic routes for the monomers and copolymers are shown in Scheme 2. Pure 4,8-dehydrobenzo[l,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (1) can be obtained from several recrystallizations in acetic acid. 2-Ethylhexyl 2,6-dibromo-3-cyanothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate (TT-ECN) was synthesized from a starting material of 2-ethylhexyl-4,6-dihydrothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate (4). The bromination of compound 4 by N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in chloroform yields compound 5 as a colorless oil. Then compound 5 was mixed with cuprous cyanide in N′,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and kept at 150 °C, and the substitution reaction was completed after 15 hours. Subsequently, the oxidation of compound 6 was carried out at −78 °C with MCPBA as the oxidation reagent and the crude product of compound 7 was obtained and used without further purification. Finally, the new monomer, TT-ECN, was obtained as yellow solid powder by the bromination of compound 8 with NBS in DMF. All copolymers are prepared by Stille coupling reaction. These polymers show good solubility in chloroform, chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene. The molecular weights of these polymers were estimated by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) method using chloroform as eluent and monodispersed polystyrene as standard. The number average molecular weight (Mn) and the polydispersity index (PDI) vary from 30 K to 61 K and 1.3 to 2.4, respectively.


Fig. 1 shows the absorption spectra of the PBDFTT-C, PBDFTT-EF, PBDFTT-CF, PBDFTT-S and PBDFTT-ECN in chloroform and as spin-coated films on quartz substrates, and the optical data including the absorption peaks (λmax,abs), absorption edges (λedge,abs) in solutions and films and the optical band gaps (Eoptg) are summarized in Table 2. PBDFTT-C, PBDFTT-EF, PBDFTT-CF and PBDFTT-S show very similar absorption spectra and their peak values are located at ca. 700 nm. For these four polymers, the absorption edges are at ca. 780 ± 10 nm, corresponding to Eoptg of 1.5 eV. However, compared to the above four polymers, the absorption spectra of the solution and the film of PBDFTT-ECN are blue-shifted obviously, i.e. its absorption peak is at 620 nm, indicating that the introduction of a cyano group has a strong influence on the conjugation of the BDF-TT backbone.

To provide further insight into the fundamentals of molecular conformation, molecular simulation was carried out for these copolymers with a chain length of n = 2 at the DFT B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) level. The optimized geometries are shown in Table 1 and it should be noted that since the TT unit is an asymmetric building block, we need two dihedral angles, θ1 and θ2 in Table 1, to describe the conformation of these copolymers. As shown in Table 1, all these five polymers show very similar θ2, i.e. θ2 = 0–2°, indicating that at these positions, there is no steric hindrance between the BDF and the TT units. However, the θ1 dihedral angles of these polymers are different. As shown, PBDFTT-CF and PBDFTT-EF show similar θ1, i.e. θ1 = 21°, while the θ1 of PBDFTT-C and PBDFTT-S are 10.6° and 8.4° respectively. These results indicate that steric hindrance between BDF and TT units will be increased when fluorine atom is introduced onto the 5-position of the TT unit, because the fluorine atom is bigger than the proton. Since the cyano group is much bigger than both the proton and the fluorine atom, the biggest dihedral angle can be obtained in PBDFTT-ECN, i.e. θ1 = 38.6°, meaning that the backbone units of PBDFTT-ECN should not be conjugated as good as those in the other four polymers. Therefore, the absorption spectrum of PBDFTT-ECN is obviously blue-shifted compared to the other four polymers.

Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to measure the polymers' oxidation/reduction onset potentials. From Fig. 2, it can be seen that the p-doping processes of all the polymers are quasi-reversible. The oxidation onset values of all polymers are listed in Table 1 and it can be found that the substituents on the TT units affect the polymers' oxidation potentials obviously. The HOMO and the LUMO levels of the polymers were calculated according to the following equations: ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.8) (eV), EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.8) (eV), where the units of Eox and Ered are in V vs Fc/Fc+. Energy level diagrams for all polymers are shown in Fig. 3. The correlation between electron withdrawing abilities of the substituents and the HOMO levels of the polymers is quite clear: the electron withdrawing abilities of the substituents can be ranged by the order of carbonyl < fluoro + ester < fluoro + carbonyl < sulfonyl < cyano + ester and the HOMO level can be ranged by the order of PBDFTT-C > PBDFTT-EF > PBDFTT-CF > PBDFTT-S > PBDFTT-ECN, meaning that the polymer with stronger electron withdrawing groups on its TT units gives deeper HOMO level. This finding verifies the conclusions in the reported works and confirms that changing the electron withdrawing ability of the substituted functional groups on the quinoid units in A–Q polymers can be used as an effective tool to tune their molecular energy levels.
To further explain the various HOMO and LUMO values of these polymers with the same molecular backbones but different substituents on TT units, quantum chemical calculations were performed by using density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) bases set. To simply the calculation, two repeating backbone units of these five polymers were selected and also the alkyl groups were replaced by CH3 groups. As illustrated in Table 1, it was found the HOMO surfaces of all these five polymers are similar, which are delocalized on BDF and TT units. However, in comparison with the other four polymers, LUMO surface of PBDFTT-ECN is more localized on its TT units, indicating that the cyano group exhibits a stronger electron withdrawing effect than the fluorine. In detail, we also found that the sulfonyl on PBDFTT-S makes no contribution to extending the conjugation of its backbone units, i.e. its HOMO and LUMO surfaces cannot delocalize to the sulfonyl groups, but for the other four polymers, their electrons can be delocalized to carbonyl groups; moreover, we also found that the cyano groups on PBDFTT-ECN are well conjugated with the backbone. In addition, the calculated values of HOMO and LUMO levels of these five polymers are shown in Table 1 and the similar trend as observed in CV measurements are recorded. Therefore, it can be concluded when the electron withdrawing group is well conjugated with the backbone, the molecular energy level of conjugated polymer will be more affected.

The PSC devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (35 nnm)/polymers:PC71BM (∼100 nm)/Ca (10 nm)/Al (80 nm) were fabricated to investigate photovoltaic properties of these polymers. In this work, polymer/PC71BM blend was dissolved into o-dichlorobenzene to make the solutions of the D/A blends (10 mg mL−1 for polymer) for spin-coating. At first, different weight ratios of polymer donor to PC71BM, (1:1, 1:1.5 and 1:2) were scanned, and we found that the 1:1.5 is the optimal D/A ratio for the devices based on all these new polymers. From the J–V curves of the PSC devices as shown in Fig. 4, the Voc of the devices based on PBDFTT-C, PBDFTT-EF, PBDFTT-CF, PBDFTT-S and PBDFTT-ECN are 0.56 V, 0.63 V, 0.63 V, 0.59 V and 0.87 V, respectively. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the devices varied from 1.92% to 4.5%. In order to further optimize the photovoltaic performance of the devices, 3% (v/v) 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used as additive in the solutions of the active layer materials. We found that for the devices based on PBDFTT-C, PBDFTT-EF, PBDFTT-CF and PBDFTT-S, by using DIO as an additive, both the Jsc and FF of the devices can be improved, while their Voc values changed little, and hence the efficiencies of these four kinds of devices can be obviously improved, and thus PCEs of ∼5.2% were recorded from the devices based on PBDFTT-EF and PBDFTT-CF. However, for the PBDFTT-ECN-based device, after adding DIO, both Voc and Jsc of the device drop so that a lower PCE was observed. In comparison with the reported work, the PSC devices based on PBDFTT-C, PBDFTT-EF, PBDFTT-CF and PBDFTT-S show similar behaviors upon the treatment of DIO as the PSC devices based on other PBDFTT and PBDTTT polymers, implying that the introduction of the small size functional groups as used in these four polymers has little influence on the device fabrication process; however, if functional group with strong steric hindrance to the adjacent backbone units is used, like the cyano group in PBDFTT-ECN, the optimal device fabrication process may be changed (Table 3).

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices based on polymers/PC71BM under the optimal conditions were shown in Fig. 5. Since PBDFTT-C, PBDFTT-CF and PBDFTT-S devices show similar EQE in the whole response regions, the integral current density values of these three devices deduced from the EQE curves are quite similar, which are coincident with the results obtained from the J–V measurements. It can be seen that the PBDFTT-EF based device showed better EQE in long wavelength direction which well matches the solar spectrum, and hence the highest Jsc value (15.75 mA cm−2) was observed from the PBDFTT-EF-based device. Conversely, the PBDFTT-ECN based device showed a narrower EQE spectrum and also lower EQE values in the whole response region compared to the other four polymers. According to the molecular energy level diagrams as shown in Fig. 3, when PBDFTT-ECN was used in the PSC device, the offset between the LUMO levels of the donor and the acceptor is only 0.2 eV, while for the devices based on the other four polymers, the offset values are equal to or over 0.3 eV. Considering that a big offset between the LUMO levels of the donor and the acceptor is helpful to realize efficient charge separation and the offset of 0.20 eV may reach the threshold value, the limited driving force of charge separation in the PBDFTT-ECN/PC71BM blend should be the main reason for the low EQE of the PSC device.

In conclusion, this work represents an example of the molecular energy level modulation for the conjugated polymers with the A–Q structure (BDF-alt-TT). In detail, the molecular energy levels of conjugated polymers with the A–Q structure (BDF-alt-TT) were designed, synthesized and characterized. Functional groups with different electron withdrawing effects, such as carbonyl, ester, fluorine, sulfuryl and cyano, were introduced to the TT units to finely tune the molecular energy levels of these copolymers. According to their electrochemical behaviours, the electron-deficient abilities of these functional groups can be arranged in the order carbonyl < fluorine + ester < fluorine + carbonyl < sulfuryl < cyano + ester. We found that the copolymers substituted by the functional groups with stronger electron withdrawing effect show deeper HOMO and LUMO levels. The champion efficiency of 5.23% with a Voc of 0.63 V and a Jsc of 13.88 mA cm−2 was achieved from the PBDFTT-CF/PC71BM based devices. The device based on the cyano-substituted copolymer, PBDFTT-ECN, shows a rather high Voc of 0.87 V, but the short current density (Jsc) is significantly lower than the device based on PBDFTT-CF. According to the photovoltaic results of PBDFTT-S and PBDFTT-CNF, a LUMO level of −3.70 eV might reach the threshold of getting efficient charge separation of the polymer/PC71BM blend.
