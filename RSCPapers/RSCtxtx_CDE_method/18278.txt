Solvent vapor annealing (SVA) is an effective post-treatment process to improve the quality of crystals and grains in metal halide perovskite films. Whereas SVA has been successfully adopted for the fabrication of perovskite films via the conventional two-step method, its adaptation to the simple single-step perovskite film deposition method has been limited because of the rapid transition of the precursor to the perovskite structure. In the present study, we demonstrate highly efficient and stable single-step-based inverted perovskite solar cells fabricated with perovskite films prepared using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and water as a combined solvent in SVA treatment. The treatment with DMSO alone resulted in the growth of large grains (∼900 nm) in the lateral direction at the surface region; however, voids and defects were observed in the vertical direction at the bottom interfacial region of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer, which resulted in poor device properties. Interestingly, the combined DMSO–water induced vertical growth of almost single grains and the healing effect of water improved the grain quality. As a result, we fabricated co-SVA CH3NH3PbI3 devices with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.52%. This PCE, which is much higher than that of pristine devices, was attributed to reduced nonradiative recombination. In addition, co-SVA solar cells displayed remarkable stability and their universality in various types of perovskite materials was demonstrated. We anticipate that our proposed process and mechanism will be widely used in the future development of perovskite-based devices.

Perovskite materials have emerged as a revolutionary material for light harvesting, with advantages such as high absorption coefficients, long carrier diffusion lengths, and tunable bandgaps. Recently, low-cost, solution-based perovskite solar cells with efficiencies exceeding 24% have been reported; such efficiencies have not been achieved with other emerging photovoltaic technologies. Because of these achievements, perovskite solar cells are considered the most promising candidates for next-generation solar cells. However, their poor stability in operating environments is a severe obstacle to their commercial application, and there is room for improving the characteristics of perovskite solar cells such that they reach or approach their theoretical limit. To address these challenges, researchers have proposed and investigated various ABX3 compositions, and numerous processes for producing good-quality perovskite films have been developed.

In general, perovskite films can be formed through one of two approaches: via a two-step method in which each precursor (a lead halide and organic halide salts) is separately deposited and reacted, or via a single-step method in which a perovskite precursor (e.g., methylammonium lead(II) iodide, MAPbI3) is applied to a solvent in a single step. In early research, the two-step method was mainly used for fabricating perovskite solar cells and was adapted to various processes such as slot-die coating, electro-deposition, and spray coating. One advantage of the two-step method is that it enables the deposition of good-quality, pinhole-free thin films via compaction of a uniform PbI2 film. However, the disadvantages of this approach are its relatively long reaction time and the fact that high efficiency can be achieved only through complicated control of the morphology in two layers. By contrast, the single-step method involves a simple process and a short processing time; however, the initial efficiency of devices based on films prepared via the single-step method is low because of the low quality of the spin-coated film. These problems have been overcome with the introduction of the anti-solvent method. The single-step anti-solvent process is currently the most widely used method for preparing films for efficient perovskite solar cells and has resulted in devices with the highest reported performance among perovskite solar cells. However, in a single-step perovskite film fabrication method with an anti-solvent, dimethylformamide (DMF) and DMSO (as the host solvents) are not completely removed by antisolvent dropping. Consequently, small amounts of solvents remaining in the intermediate film rapidly evaporate during the heat-treatment-induced transition into the perovskite film, which results in a relatively small grain size and a poor quality film.
Numerous studies based on the two aforementioned methods have been reported with the objective of achieving good perovskite films because the grain and crystalline constituents of perovskite films critically affect the performance of the corresponding photovoltaic devices. Furthermore, understanding the orientation of such crystals is essential for achieving better performance in future devices. To this end, chemical methods that introduce an additive into the precursor solution have been successfully demonstrated through control of nucleation and crystal growth. In addition, numerous post-treatment processes have been suggested to improve not only film quality but also process reproducibility and tolerance. Among them, solvent vapor annealing (SVA) using a polar solvent (e.g., water, alcohols, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) has garnered attention because of the simple process and universality of the approach. SVA has been applied to perovskite films via a two-step method to obtain fine films by accelerating the reaction between two layers resulting from the coalescence of small grains via a phenomenon known as Ostwald's refinement. Although water is considered to be detrimental to perovskite films (it has been reported to induce degradation of perovskite films when the relative humidity (RH) is greater than 40%), it has a grain healing effect and the grain size is increased below a certain humidity value. Unfortunately, however, the SVA process is strictly applied to the single-step fabrication of perovskite films because the polar solvents used in the SVA process have been reported to result in direct rapid transition to the perovskite structure during annealing. Therefore, the use of the single-step SVA process has been limited, and an efficacious post-treatment process for single-step perovskite solar cells is strongly demanded.
In this study, we propose a co-SVA single-step process using water and DMSO as polar solvents and apply the process to the fabrication of one-step perovskite solar cells with a planar p–i–n structure with advantages such as good flexibility, a simple fabrication process, and low hysteresis. First, when only DMSO SVA was applied, even though the perovskite films exhibited a large grain size on the surface side, the crystals and grains extending in the vertical direction exhibited poor quality. With the addition of water vapor, the crystals and grains of the perovskite film were greatly improved via the grain healing effect. All of these chemical processes were precisely investigated via XPS analysis. Using MAPbI3 devices fabricated with films prepared via the co-SVA method, we achieved a high efficiency of 19.53% and studied the relationships between the device characteristics and the crystal and grain orientation of the film, which was concisely elucidated using the combined techniques of grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS). Finally, we tested the stability of unencapsulated MAPbI3 devices under ambient conditions and verified the universality of the co-SVA method by comparing the performance of three different types of perovskite solar cells.


Fig. 1a displays the SVA process used in the experiment; the details of the perovskite film fabrication method are provided in the Experimental section. In the process, we adopted the SVA method using DMSO and water vapor as a post-treatment when forming a perovskite film through annealing. During the process, the crystals and grains of the MAPbI3 film grow through interaction of MAPbI3, CH3NH3I (MAI), PbI2, DMSO, and H2O. As shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images in Fig. 1b, the pristine film exhibited a small grain size of 200 to 400 nm and a root mean square (rms) roughness of 10.2–10.5 nm. By contrast, additional vaporization via the SVA process reduced the pressure difference and prevented rapid evaporation of the residual solvent within the film, which led to a perovskite thin film with large grains because fewer nucleation sites formed, slowing the growth process compared with the control circumstance. In the single DMSO SVA method, the reaction mechanism is suggested as eqn (1), and the method is very effective for perovskite grain growth depending on the DMSO concentration.

However, the single DMSO SVA method showed a very destructive phenomenon in which the perovskite structure completely decomposed when treated with an excessive amount of DMSO; an optimization process was therefore carried out (Fig. S1 and S2). The optimized SVA process (100:0) was performed with 1 μL of DMSO; the resultant thin film had large grains of approximately 400–933 nm, and the rms surface roughness was approximately 14.6–14.7 nm as the grain size increased. However, although the perovskite thin film based on 100:0 SVA had large grains and good film quality on the top surface side, random crystals that did not perfectly grow in the vertical direction were observed on the bottom surface, and voids and defects between the grains were observed in the corresponding cross-sectional SEM image.
In the case of SVA using water vapor as a single solvent, the aforementioned grain healing mechanism is expressed as eqn (2):
CH3NH3PbI3 + H2O (gas)  CH3NH3PbI3·H2O or (CH3NH3)4PbI6·nH2O + PbI2
(2)
The hydrates formed by H2O have a relatively low energy, which is favorable for stable grain formation. In the single-solvent water SVA process (0:100), we used only a small amount (1 μL) of water because we focused on the co-solvent SVA process. The perovskite film based on 0:100 SVA showed a grain size of 300–500 nm and an rms roughness of 10.3–10.5 nm, which is a film morphology very similar to that of the pristine film. We speculated that the mixed vapor of DMSO and H2O could induce grain growth and grain healing simultaneously and conducted a co-SVA method by controlling the concentration of each solvent. We subsequently optimized the process and obtained an ideal perovskite film when 1 μL of mixed solvent (75:25) was used. The films displayed large grains (approximately 300–900 nm) and became rougher (14.1–14.5 nm).
To elucidate the perovskite chemical composition and structure changes induced by the SVA process, XPS measurements and analyses were conducted and more detailed information is provided in Tables S1–S3. In the C 1s spectra, MAPbI3 greatly contributes to two core levels associated with the C–N bond (286.23–286.88 eV) and C–H bonds (284.8 eV) of the CH3NH3+ cation; as shown in Fig. 2a, these spectra are consistent with those reported previously. The first peak (284.24–284.37 eV) in the spectra is the intermediate phase. In comparison with the peak intensity of the intermediate phase of the pristine film, those of the intermediate phases of the SVA 100:0 and SVA 75:25 films are approximately 2.71 and 2.83 times greater, respectively, which indicates an additional reaction induced by the vapor. In the case of the SVA 0:100 film with only H2O vapor present, the peak intensity of its intermediate phase is increased by 3.11 times because of the hygroscopic character of CH3NH3I. The peak at 285.24–285.50 eV is attributed to a C–OH bond as an intermediate phase remaining in the film, where the intermediate is bonded with DMF (C3H7NO) or DMSO (C2H6SO); alternatively, it may indicate additionally adsorbed surface carbon singly bonded to a hydroxyl group.
The most important C–N bond (286.23–286.88 eV) can be classified into two types: CH3NH2, which is present in the film surface and grain boundary; and CH3NH3+, which is in the perovskite film, forming the complete ABX3 structure. When the SVA process was employed, the intensity ratios of the CH3NH2 and CH3NH3+ peaks changed distinctly. In the spectra of the SVA films, the intensity of the CH3NH2 peaks decreased compared with the intensity of the CH3NH2 peaks of the pristine film; in addition, the intensity of the CH3NH3+ peak increased. The greatest increase in intensity of the CH3NH3+ peak was observed for the SVA 75:25 film, which suggests a transition from the grain boundary to the ABX3 structure. New peaks (C–O–C/CO/O–C–O/OC–OH) with higher binding energies (287.33–289.63 eV) were attributed to the procedure used to prepare the SVA films, except for the pristine film.
In the N 1s spectra, CH3NH3PbI3 contributes substantially to three core levels: N–CO bonds (403.32–403.45 eV), C–N bonds (402.08–402.77 eV), and R–NH2 (amide) bonds (401.43–401.84 eV) of the CH3NH3+ cation, as shown in Fig. 2b. In the spectrum of the pristine film, the amide bond peak and CH3NH2 peak are the most intense compared with the corresponding peaks in the spectra of the SVA samples, indicating that CH3NH2 is present both at the surface and in the grain boundaries. In the spectrum of the SVA 75:25 film, the intensities of the amide bond and CH3NH2 peaks were substantially lower and the intensity of the CH3NH3+ peak was 69% greater than that of the CH3NH2 peak; the N–CO peak was also enlarged. These results also indicate that the vapor, intermediate phase, and perovskite grain boundaries reacted; similar trends were observed for the other SVA films. As the proportion of H2O vapor was increased, the intensity of the amide peak decreased further and that of the N–CO peak increased; similar to the trends in the C 1s spectra, these results are attributed to the hygroscopic nature of CH3NH3I.
In the O 1s spectra in Fig. 2c, an intermediate phase with the lowest binding energy (531.76–531.89 eV) and OC–OH (534.17–534.25 eV)/N–CO (534.46–534.82 eV)/H2O (535.97–536.06 eV) binding was mainly observed. In the intermediate phase, Pb–O bonds were particularly dominant because the PbO/Pb(OH)2 species that formed as a consequence of oxygen species (O2−, OH−) in the atmosphere weakly adsorbed onto and terminated Pb dangling bonds. Moreover, Pb–O species were likely formed via the strong Lewis base–acid bond between DMSO (C2H6SO) and Pb, as confirmed by the Pb 4f spectra in Fig. S3. In the spectra of the SVA 100:0 film, the total peak intensity of the intermediate phase increased approximately twofold compared with that of the pristine phase, with increases in the OC–OH/N–CO contents. When a higher proportion of H2O vapor was adopted, the peak intensity of H2O was newly measured, which suggested that the vapor of DMSO and water simultaneously reacted with the intermediate phase at perovskite grain boundaries.
Next, we fabricated MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells using the films prepared via the SVA process and compared their photovoltaic characteristics. The device configuration was a planar p–i–n-based structure (Fig. 3a); details of the fabrication method are provided in the Experimental section. Fig. 3b shows a statistical graph displaying the device efficiency of more than 50 cells as a function of the DMSO:DI water ratio during the SVA process (more detailed parameters of the solar cells are shown in Fig. S4). As shown in the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best-performing devices in Fig. 3c and Table 1, when only DMSO SVA was adopted, the device efficiency decreased even though the film had a larger surface grain size than the pristine film, with lower short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) values. Interestingly, in the cases where water vapor was used, the deteriorated efficiency of the devices was recovered and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was remarkably increased. The device corresponding to the film prepared using the 75:25 SVA process exhibited a maximum PCE of 19.53% with increased Jsc, FF, and open-circuit voltage (Voc) values. With increasing water concentration, the efficiency gradually decreased again with decreasing Jsc and Voc because reduced DMSO vaporization resulted in a smaller grain size of the perovskite film; however, in all cases, the performance of devices fabricated with SVA-treated films was better than that of devices fabricated with a pristine film.

Cross-sectional SEM observations were conducted to reveal the relationship between vertical perovskite grain growth and device efficiency improvement resulting from application of the SVA process. The SEM images in Fig. 3d–f show that the perovskite pristine film was formed with relatively small grains in both the vertical and horizontal directions; but, the SVA films exhibited larger grains. When only DMSO vapor was used, the overall grain size was larger than that of the pristine film; however, incomplete perovskite crystal formation resulted in cracks and voids between the grains, especially in the bottom region around the hole-transport layer (HTL). Thus, direct charge transport and collection between the HTL and the perovskite layer was greatly impeded, which led to low efficiency of the device. With the addition of water vapor during the SVA process, the favorable energetics for hydrate grain growth, as explained in the aforementioned section, led to mending of the grains of the perovskite, ensuring the formation of large grains in both the vertical and horizontal directions. In particular, the large grain size in the vertical direction promotes ideal vertical charge transport and collection without recombination between the vertical grain boundaries.

Fig. 3g shows the integrated Jsc values associated with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) data, which well match the Jsc values obtained from the J–V scans within 5% error. The quantum efficiency of the SVA 75:25 device was the highest over most of the examined spectral range. To gain deeper understanding of the recombination process in the fabricated devices, we measured the dependence of Jsc and Voc on light intensity (Plight). First, the variation of Jsc with Plight can be expressed using the power-law equation Jsc ∝ Plightα; the convergence of α to 1 means that the influence of bimolecular recombination in the device can be neglected. As shown in Fig. 3h, the pristine device exhibited an α value of 0.9957, which is close to 1, whereas the 100:0 device yielded α = 0.9052, which indicates severe bimolecular recombination within the device as a consequence of the poor grain and film quality diminishing the solar cell performance. In the device fabricated with the film prepared by the 75:25 SVA process, the value of α improved to 0.9995, which is an almost ideal value, indicating that bimolecular recombination was strongly suppressed by the superior perovskite film quality.

Fig. 3i shows a plot of Voc as a function of Plight, revealing a linear relationship expressed as nkBT/q (kB is Boltzmann's constant and T represents the absolute temperature). In the photovoltaic devices, trap-assisted recombination becomes dominant as the value of n approaches 2; when trap-assisted recombination is reduced, the value of n is close to 1, suggesting the dominance of bimolecular recombination. The value of n was lower for the SVA devices than for the pristine device (1.752) because grain-boundary-induced trapping was reduced in accordance with increasing size of the grains. In particular, the value of n is 1.408 for the SVA 75:25 device; this value has been reported to be the ideal value for an inverted perovskite solar cell.
To investigate the change in crystallinity and orientation of the perovskite films as a result of the SVA process, we carried out synchrotron-based 2D GIWAXS measurements. X-ray incidence angles of 0.2°, 0.3°, 0.5°, and 1.0° were chosen to acquire information related to film depth. The 2D GIWAXS images recorded at 0.3° (surface) and 1.0° (bulk) are shown in Fig. 4a–c, and each tetragonal (110) diffraction line cut with respect to the vertical direction (qz) is shown in Fig. 4d–f. In the line-cut profiles, the broadening and decreasing intensity of the (110) peaks with decreasing incidence angle indicates a multiple phase of the perovskite crystal, i.e., impurities and defects in the vertical and surface directions. In the pristine film, the (110) peak gradually decreases in intensity and broadens as the incidence angle decreases from 1.0° to 0.2°; but, the intensity of the (110) peak in the 100:0 film is rapidly quenched from the incidence angle of 1.0° to 0.5°, suggesting poor crystallinity in the vertical direction as a result of inferior film quality. Interestingly, the spectrum of the SVA 75:25 film shows a higher-intensity (110) peak that slowly decreases in intensity compared with that of the pristine film, indicating better crystallinity in the vertical direction. For easy comparison, we plotted the (110) maximum intensity in terms of the angle of incidence in Fig. 4g. The results suggest that when additional water vapor is added to the DMSO vapor, the perovskite grain healing and Ostwald ripening effect improve the vertical film quality not only inside the perovskite film but also at its surface.
To compare the preferred orientation of the pristine and the SVA 75:25 perovskite films, we plotted the azimuthal angle for each incidence angle, as extracted from the tetragonal (110) peak (Fig. 4h and i). In the azimuthal data at 1.0°, both films showed a preferred orientation along the vertical direction, with similar bandwidths of line cuts. However, with decreasing incidence angle, the bandwidth of the intensity for the pristine film rapidly broadened, indicating that the tetragonal (110) crystals were more randomly oriented than those in the 75:25 film. These results demonstrate the more preferred orientation and better crystallinity of the SVA perovskite films, as shown in the schematic illustration (Fig. 4g).
Whereas GIWAXS is widely used to explore the crystal structures of films, NEXAFS is a powerful technique to investigate the overall molecular orientation distribution. Therefore, we carried out NEXAFS at different incidence angles of X-rays with partial electron yield (PEY, ∼5 nm) and total electron yield (TEY, ∼20 nm) modes, which were tuned by controlling the retardance voltage. In both the PEY and TEY spectra, the main feature was a peak at a photon energy of 290.2 eV, which originates from the σ* orbital of CH3–NH3+. In the spectra of the pristine film, the intensity tended to decrease, indicating the standing molecular orientation with increasing X-ray angle in PEY spectra; this tendency was diminished in the TEY spectra, as shown in Fig. 5a and b. By contrast, the PEY spectrum of the SVA film decreased markedly with increasing incidence angle of X-rays, implying a lying-down molecular orientation; this tendency was retained even in the TEY spectrum (Fig. 5d and e). These results confirm the more ordered orientation of the CH3–NH3+ molecules on the surface of the SVA perovskite films and the overall random orientation of the CH3–NH3+ molecules of the pristine perovskite film.
To further analyze the orientation angle of the CH3–NH3+ molecules in perovskite films, the tilt angle of the molecular orientation was calculated using eqn (3) where the γ values (tilt angles of the molecules) were calculated by plotting the intensity versus cos2θ (with θ denoting the incidence angle of the X-rays and P is 0.85 for the bending magnet source):
(3)
The data are plotted in Fig. 5g and h. The calculated tilt angle of the pristine CH3–NH3+ was 71.52° for PEY and 54.59° for TEY, which are close to the magic angle interpreted as a random distribution. In the case of the SVA film, the CH3–NH3+ molecule yielded a tilt angle of 32.59° in the PEY region and the orientation was maintained at 39.90° even in the TEY region. To double-check this preferred orientation tendency, GIWAXS spectra were recorded with an incidence angle of 0.1°, ensuring detection of the surface region of the film. The GIWAXS results show that the pristine sample exhibits a random orientation from the isotropic distribution over the whole angle, whereas the SVA perovskite film exhibits a preferred orientation of approximately 30°, as shown in Fig. 5i. These results demonstrate that the rapid-evaporation crystal growth based on the conventional single-step process induced a random orientation of the perovskite film and that the proposed co-SVA method improved the orientation ordering by slow and large grain growth via a templating effect. Illustrations of the suggested CH3–NH3+ molecular orientations are shown in Fig. 5c and f.
The stability of perovskite solar cells is considered one of the most important properties for their commercialization. To investigate the effect of the SVA process on device lifetime, device performance was measured without encapsulation under ambient air (Fig. 6a); the temperature and moisture conditions were also tracked and recorded. Interestingly, the efficiency of the SVA 100:0 device gradually improved until approximately 250 h and then decreased, whereas the efficiency of the pristine device rapidly diminished. We attributed the behavior of the SVA 100:0 device to the grain healing effect induced by water molecules in the atmosphere. Notably, the SVA 75:25 device exhibited outstanding stability, retaining 80% of its initial efficiency over 1000 h because the large grains with good film quality and preformed hydrates prevented degradation under ambient conditions.
Finally, we fabricated three different types of perovskite solar cells and adopted the co-SVA method (75:25) to demonstrate the universality of the process: a wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite based on Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 (bandgap of 1.8 eV), which has strong potential for commercialization and is well suited for use in high-efficiency tandem solar cells; a mixed perovskite based on Cs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95Pb(I0.85br0.15)3, with a bandgap of 1.55 eV; and a small-bandgap perovskite based on Cs0.05FA0.95PbI3 (bandgap of 1.4 eV), which exhibits good thermal stability. As shown in Fig. 6c, all of the SVA perovskite solar cells exhibited markedly improved performance and the grain enhancement after the SVA process is confirmed from the SEM images in Fig. 6b. Among the SVA devices, the WBG solar cell fabricated with a planar inverted perovskite film and with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the electron transporting layer (ETL) exhibits a maximum PCE of 16.92% which is the record efficiency (Table 2).

In summary, we developed a co-SVA process for preparing perovskite films for single-step based perovskite solar cells. The use of pure DMSO vapor to prepare the perovskite film resulted in low film quality in the vertical direction, which in turn resulted in poor device performance. The addition of water vapor to the DMSO vapor enabled improved film quality over the whole direction, which ensured much higher efficiency of the device in comparison with the pristine device. With elucidation of the physical structure of the perovskite films, we found that the co-SVA perovskite films had more preferred and better crystal and grain orientation, which directly benefitted the solar-cell performance. Moreover, the co-SVA perovskite solar cells displayed superior stability, and their application in diverse types of perovskite solar cells demonstrated their versatility. Therefore, we expect our proposed process to not only be widely used for high-efficiency perovskite solar cells but also open a new opportunity for the development of new perovskite materials.


Nickel acetate tetrahydrate (Ni(OAc)2·4H2O) and poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and 1-Material, respectively. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) and PbI2 were purchased from Dyesol and TCI, respectively. Bathocuproine (BCP) and PCBM were acquired from Lumtec and Nano-C, respectively.

The process for fabricating the MAPbI3 perovskite precursor and films was exactly the same as that described in the previous work. Mixed perovskite Cs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3, narrow-bandgap perovskite Cs0.05FA0.95PbI3, and WBG perovskite Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 were fabricated via a one-step method reported elsewhere. The 0.1 M sol–gel NiOx precursor as a HTL was prepared by dissolving 24.88 mg of nickel acetate tetrahydrate and 6 μL of ethanolamine in 1 mL of ethanol, and then stirring at 65 °C for 2 h. The sol–gel NiOx was deposited onto a cleaned indium–tin-oxide (ITO) substrate by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 35 s; the coated substrate was then annealed at 120 °C for 10 min and then at 280 °C for 60 min. Another HTL of PTAA with a concentration of 2 mg mL−1 dissolved in toluene was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 35 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The fully dissolved MAPbI3 precursor was spin-coated onto the NiOx layer at 5000 rpm for 25 s, with 0.2 mL of chlorobenzene (CB) dropped 6–7 s after the spin-coating process was started. The other mixed perovskite precursors were spin-coated onto the PTAA layer at 1000 rpm for 5 s and then at 5000 rpm for 20 s, with 0.2 mL of ethyl acetate (EA) dropped 10 s before the spin-coating process was ended.

All of the as-fabricated films except CsFAPbI3 were subjected to solvent vapor annealing or thermal annealing at 100 °C for 30 min. The CsFAPbI3 film was thermally annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. In the solvent vapor annealing process, the perovskite films were placed on top of a hotplate and covered with a 100 mL glass Petri dish. Approximately 1 μL of DMSO:water mixed solvent was added to the center of the Petri dish during the thermal annealing process so that the mixed vapor was well evaporated inside the Petri dish, ensuring that it contacted the perovskite layer. More details of the perovskite film fabrication methods are provided in the ESI. The PCBM solution was spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at 1000 rpm for 40 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 20 min. The BCP solution was then spin-coated directly onto the PCBM layer at 4000 rpm for 35 s. The PCBM was dissolved in CB with a concentration of 20 mg mL−1, and BCP was dissolved in ethanol with a concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1. In the final step, a 100 nm-thick layer of Ag was thermally deposited onto the substrates as cathodes at a pressure less than 10−6 Torr inside a vacuum thermal evaporator.

2D-GIWAXS measurements were performed at the PLS-II 5A beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) in Korea. 2D-GIWAXS images were collected at 11.57 keV with a MAR charge coupled device (CCD) (sample-to-detector distance: 283.447 mm).


Carbon K-edge NEXAFS measurements were conducted at the PLS-II 4D beamline of the PAL in Korea with a p-polarized photon beam. Angle-dependent NEXAFS spectra were recorded using several X-ray incidence angles of 30°, 45°, 55°, and 70°.


The J–V characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 4200 source meter under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) light simulated using an Oriel solar simulator (Newport, class AAA solar simulator). The light intensity was calibrated using a Si solar cell certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The EQE was measured using an Oriel IQE-EQE 200B. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell. All of the electrical tests were conducted in ambient air.
