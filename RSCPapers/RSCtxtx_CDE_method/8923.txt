As organic solar cells (OSCs) work under illumination, the light-induced degradation issue is an inevitable barrier to the commercialization of OSCs. Herein, the photo-degradation mechanism of high-efficiency OSCs based on PM6:Y6 or its derivatives is investigated under different wavelength illumination in a nitrogen atmosphere. The PM6:Y6 aged device after 1 hour burn-in degradation exhibits significant losses in the open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) with the short-circuit current density (JSC) nearly unaffected. The VOC loss and FF loss are mainly ascribed to the reduced charge carrier mobility, especially the hole mobility, the weakened current extraction capability, and the increased non-radiative recombination in the aged device. The aged devices without a band-pass filter and with an ultraviolet filter show more severe photo-degradation than those with other filters, which shows that the ultraviolet portion contributes the most to the device photo-degradation. Based on the comparison of the donor-exposed devices, the acceptor-exposed ones, and the blend-exposed ones, it is inferred that the photo-degradation of PM6 dominates the photo-degradation process of the PM6:Y6 based devices. This work offers a new avenue for exploring the shortcoming that limits the device photo-stability, and unveils that one facile solution to improving the device photo-stability is enhancing the photo-stability of the donor.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted enormous attention over the past years for their merits of easy processing, low cost, light weight, semitransparency, and flexibility. Recently, progress in the design of organic semiconductor materials, optimization of the morphology, and modification of the carrier transport layer have elevated the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs to over 18%. Raising the stability of OSCs is an emergent task towards commercialization, although it is time- and resource-consuming. Typically, high-efficiency OSCs exhibit lifetimes on the order of tens or hundreds of hours, which is insufficient for most commercial applications.

Under real operation conditions, many factors are correlated with the instability or degradation of OSCs, such as the inherent stability, oxygen, water, heat, and light. Even without extrinsic degradation factors, there occurs a morphology change in the active layer and the diffusion of the carrier transport layer and electrode materials into the active layer. In the ambient environment, oxygen and water can diffuse through the whole device and cause severe physical and chemical degradation in the electrodes, interlayers, and active layers. Heat also provides additional thermodynamic energy and accelerates macroscopic phase separation in the bulk-heterojunction geometry even at a low temperature. As OSCs operate under illumination, light-induced degradation is an inevitable barrier to the long-term stability of devices, which is also considered to accelerate the above degradation processes. Therefore, interest has been raised in revealing the photo-degradation mechanism of OSCs.
Under continuous illumination in an inert atmosphere, OSCs usually exhibit a steep efficiency decrease within the initial degradation period, namely “burn-in” loss, followed by more gradual degradation over a longer period. The burn-in degradation of fullerene OSCs has been widely investigated, with photo-induced fullerene dimerization, blend demixing, and disorder-induced losses identified as potential degradation mechanisms. Recently, the photo-stability and burn-in degradation behaviour in non-fullerene OSCs have been also explored. The Brabec group compared the photo-stability of OSCs based on different ITIC-family non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) under LED illumination. They observed that subtle changes in the side chains and termini of ITIC-family NFAs impacted the device photo-stability significantly, primarily linked to the increased energetic traps induced by the breaking of conjugation. Uddin and co-workers employed PM6:N3 based OSCs to investigate the mechanism of burn-in loss where the burn-in degradation impeded the charge extraction and transport, increased the nonradiative recombination, and caused a worse energy-transfer process. Generally, as the wavelength range of a white LED lamp is 400 to 800 nm, its spectrum lacks UV radiation and cannot match well with AM 1.5G illumination. However, most photo-degradation studies on nonfullerene OSCs exploit the LED lamp, which fails to mimic the real situation. Considering the rapid development of non-fullerene OSCs, the light stability should be fairly evaluated and the photo-degradation mechanism should be thoroughly studied to promote OSC commercialization.
In this work, we investigate the photo-degradation mechanism of high-efficiency OSCs based on PM6:Y6 and its derivatives under different wavelength illumination in a nitrogen atmosphere by using different band-pass filters. The PM6:Y6 based fresh devices display an optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.7%, with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 25.7 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.852 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 71.8%. After 1 hour burn-in photo-degradation, the device exhibits significant losses in VOC, FF, and PCE, with JSC nearly unaffected. The VOC loss and FF loss are mainly ascribed to the reduced charge carrier mobility, especially the hole mobility, the weakened current extraction ability, and the increased non-radiative recombination in the aged OSCs based on PM6:Y6. The aged devices without a filter and with a UV filter show more severe photo-degradation than those with other filters, indicating that the ultraviolet portion contributes the most to the photo-degradation of OSCs. By designing and comparing the donor-exposed devices, the acceptor-exposed ones, and the blend-exposed ones, we infer that the photo-degradation of PM6 dominates the photo-degradation process of the PM6:Y6 based device. Our work puts a new perspective on exploration of the shortcoming that impairs the stability of OSCs, and suggests that the photo-stability of OSCs can be effectively elevated by enhancing the photo-stability of the polymeric donor.

The OSCs are constructed with a conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINN/Ag (Fig. 1a). The classical system, PM6:Y6, is selected as the active layer material. Fig. 1b shows the spectrum of the solar simulator used for the photo-degradation experiment in this work, and the spectra of AM 1.5G and common white LED lamps. Obviously, the spectrum of the white LED lamp lacks the crucial UV light portion.

To evaluate the influence of the incident radiation wavelength range on the device performance, the OSCs are exposed to different irradiation conditions, by using different band-pass light filters, namely infrared (IR), near-infrared (NIR), red (R), green (G), blue (B) and ultraviolet (UV) filters, under the illumination of the solar simulator. As Fig. 1c shows, the IR, NIR, R, G, B, and UV filters allow for the transmission of photons with wavelength >1000, >780, 600–780, 500–600, 400–500, and 300–400 nm, respectively. The fresh device incorporating PM6:Y6 shows a decent PCE of 15.7%, with a JSC of 25.7 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.852 V, and an FF of 71.8%, which is comparable to the reported value in the literature.
After 3 hour continuous illumination with different incident wavelength ranges, the curves of normalized JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE as a function of time under illumination with different incident wavelength ranges are also plotted. As shown in Fig. 2a, the devices without a filter exhibit the most intensive degradation, followed by the devices with UV, B, G, R, NIR, and IR filters. After 30 minutes of continuous illumination in a nitrogen atmosphere, the devices without a filter, with a UV filter, or with a B filter retain 74.9%, 79.0%, and 85.7% of the initial value, respectively, which means that UV irradiation dominates the photo-aging process. This result is consistent with the damage of ultraviolet light to fullerene OSCs.
Tables S1–S7 (ESI) summarize the photovoltaic parameters of the fresh and aged devices under different lighting conditions for 3 hours. According to Fig. 2c and d, and Fig. S1 (ESI), the key parameters (VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE) of the devices without a filter and with a filter are all on a downward trend under simulated AM 1.5G for 3 hours. For the device without a filter, the JSC value retains ∼91% of the initial value after 3 hours, while VOC and FF exhibit a 34% and 17% drop, respectively. By comparison, JSC, VOC and FF of the devices with a UV filter exhibit a 5.2%, 33% and 16% drop after 3 hours. The loss of device performance mainly comes from VOC and FF losses. These results reveal that the photo-degradation of the high-efficiency PM6:Y6 system mainly comes from the short-wavelength light illumination, implying the indispensable role of ultraviolet light in the evaluation of stability for OSCs.
To gain further insight into the initial fast degradation (burn-in loss) of the devices, we study the chemical and electrical properties of the fresh and aged OSCs after 1 hour illumination. Fig. 2b displays the J–V curves of the fresh devices, and the aged devices without a filter, and with UV, B, G, R, NIR, or IR filters after 1 hour illumination. Table 1 lists the PV parameters of the corresponding devices. To simplify the analysis, we select the fresh devices as the control device, and the aged devices without a filter, with a UV filter, or with a B filter after 1 hour illumination as the experimental devices. After 1 hour burn-in degradation, the performance of the devices without a filter, with a UV filter, or with a B filter drops by around 37%, 33%, and 23%, respectively. Fig. S2 (ESI) shows the dark J–V curves of the fresh devices, and the aged devices without a filter, with a UV filter, or with a B filter after 1 hour illumination. These aged devices exhibit higher leakage current density values and steeper curves at a high voltage range (>0.75 V) than the fresh devices, implying that illumination decreases the shunt resistance and increases the series resistance. This result can account for the FF loss in the PM6:Y6-based OSCs after illumination.

To further understand the mechanism behind photo-degradation, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and UV-vis absorption of the fresh and aged devices and the corresponding films are investigated. As shown in Fig. 3a, the devices without (w/o) a filter or with the UV or B filters after 1 hour illumination exhibit a slightly reduced EQE value compared with the fresh device. As a comparison, the fresh film and the aged films display almost the same absorption spectrum (Fig. S3b, ESI). This result indicates that the photo-induced degradation in an inert atmosphere has a negligible effect on the absorption ability of the PM6:Y6 film, while it decreases the EQE and JSC in the PM6:Y6-based device.
The photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) is measured to quantify the charge generation and extraction possibility of the fresh and aged devices. Thereinto, Jph and Veff are defined by the equations: Jph = JL − JD and Veff = V0 − Va, where JL and JD represent the light and dark current densities, Va is the applied bias, and V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0. It is assumed that at a high effective voltage (∼3.0 V), all excitons in the active layer can be effectively separated and all charges can be collected. The Jph/Jsat ratios under short-circuit conditions (ηcoll) and maximum power output conditions (ηdiss) are calculated to assist evaluation of the exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency. To simplify the comparison, Fig. 3b displays the Jph–Veff curve of the fresh device and aged devices w/o a filter, and with UV or B filters after 1 hour illumination. The fresh PM6:Y6-based device shows a saturation current density (Jsat) of 27.11 mA cm−2 and ηdiss and ηcoll of 95.36% and 85.20%. ηdiss/ηcoll of the degraded devices w/o a filter, and with UV or B filters are 83.16%/70.41%, 91.27%/77.56%, and 92.27%/79.37%, respectively. It shows that the light-induced degradation weakens the charge generation and extraction abilities of the devices, and therefore decreases JSC and FF. The short wavelength illumination has a major influence, which is consistent with the lower JSC and FF values in the short-wavelength light illuminated devices.
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy characterization is conducted to investigate the exciton dissociation properties, as shown in Fig. 3c. The aged films without a filter and with a UV filter after 1 hour illumination exhibit slightly higher fluorescence intensity than the fresh film, which manifests the decreased exciton dissociation in the short-wavelength light illuminated blend films. The recombination mechanisms in these devices are further investigated by studying the light intensity (P0) dependence of the J–V characteristics (Fig. 3d and e). The bimolecular recombination losses can be estimated using the power-law relation of J ∝ Pα0 to fit JSC as a function of the incident light intensity. In brief, a value of α equal to unity reflects the extreme case where all the free carriers are swept out and collected at the electrodes before recombination. The α values are fitted as 0.975, 0.953, 0.952 and 0.961 for the fresh device and the degraded devices w/o a filter, and with UV or B filters after 1 hour illumination, respectively. The result affirms that photo-degradation increases the bimolecular recombination of the aged PM6:Y6 based-devices. To analyze the trap-assisted recombination loss, the data are fitted according to the expression VOC ∝ nkT/q ln(P0), where k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, the temperature in kelvin, and the electron charge, respectively. The parameter n (generally in the range of 1–2) reflects the presence of carrier traps across the active layer or at the interfaces in devices, where the slope will be close to kT/q (n = 1) if bimolecular recombination governs. The n values of the fresh device and degraded devices without a filter, and with UV or B filters after 1 hour illumination are calculated to be 1.069, 1.223, 1.160 and 1.073, respectively. The result reveals that short-wavelength light illumination aggravates the trap-assisted recombination in the devices.
To study the effect of photo-degradation on charge transport, the electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) are evaluated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The hole-only device and the electron-only devices utilize the structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINN/Ag, respectively. Fig. S4 (ESI) displays the J0.5versus Vappl curves for the fresh and aged devices. The fresh films and degraded films w/o a filter, and with UV or B filters after 1 hour illumination exhibit a μh of 1.65 × 10−4, 2.99 × 10−6, 8.48 × 10−6, and 2.66 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and a μe of 1.79 × 10−4, 1.70 × 10−5, 4.95 × 10−5, and 6.89 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The hole mobility of the aged devices without a filter or with a UV filter is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the fresh device, and one order lower than that of the aged device with a B filter. By contrast, the electron mobilities of the aged devices without a filter, with a UV filter or with a B filter all exhibit a value one order lower than that of the fresh device. These results indicate that the donor and acceptor are both responsible for the photo-degradation of the PM6:Y6 system, and the donor plays a main role. As shown in Table S8 (ESI), the μe/μh ratios of the fresh and aged films without a filter after 1 hour illumination are 1.08 and 5.69, respectively. The huge imbalance of the electron and hole mobility caused by the photo-degradation accounts for the grievous FF loss in the aged devices.
Apart from the decreased JSC and FF in the aged devices, the reduction of VOC should also be studied. The total energy loss in OSCs, ΔEloss = Eg − qVOC (where q is the elementary charge, and Eg is the optical gap of the absorber), can be divided into three parts:
The energy loss due to recombination can be divided into radiative and non-radiative (Vnon-radOC) terms. Herein, we evaluate Vnon-radOC of the fresh device and the aged devices by the equation: Vnon-radOC = −kTln(EQEEL)/q (k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in kelvin, and EQEEL refers to the electroluminescence external quantum efficiency). The fresh device and the aged device with B filters after 1 hour illumination exhibit non-radiative loss values of 0.236 and 0.312 V, while VOC drops from 0.852 V for the fresh device to 0.746 V for the aged device with a B filter. The result confirms that the reduction of VOC is mainly ascribed to the increased non-radiative loss in the short-wavelength light illuminated devices.
AFM and TEM measurements are conducted for the fresh and aged films to investigate the morphology changes of the active layer after 1 hour illumination. Fig. 4 shows AFM and TEM images of the fresh film and aged films w/o a filter, and with UV or B filters after 1 hour illumination. The height images of these films exhibit a similar roughness (Rq) of around 1.50 nm. From the AFM phase images, there exist very small differences in phase separation, which may be correlated with the small contrast between PM6 and Y6. The TEM images of these films disclose more information about the phase separation. As shown in Fig. 4, the aged film with a B filter displays very similar phase separation to the fresh film, while the aged film without a filter or with a UV filter exhibits more severe and inhomogeneous phase separation than the other films.
To clarify the respective contributions of the polymer donor and NFA in photo-degradation, we design layer-by-layer (LBL) devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6/Y6/PDINN/Ag (Fig. 5a). During the fabrication process, the semi-finished products of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6 and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6/Y6 are deliberately exposed to simulated 1 Sun illumination for 1 hour. Specifically, the reference sample (“LBL-unexposed”) is kept in the dark until the J–V measurement. For the “LBL-blend exposed” sample, the semi-finished product of “ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6/Y6” is exposed to simulated 1 Sun illumination for 1 hour before deposition of PDINN. For the “LBL-PM6 exposed” one, the semi-finished product of “ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6” is exposed to simulated 1 Sun illumination for 1 hour before deposition of Y6. As shown in Table 2, the LBL-PM6 exposed and LBL-blend exposed devices exhibit similar PCEs of 12.92% and 13.61%, which are obviously lower than the LBL-unexposed devices (15.03%). JSC exhibits a very small loss after 1 hour illumination, while VOC and FF experience a severe loss, which is consistent with the trend of the aged BHJ devices. This result implies that the photo-degradation of the PM6:Y6 system may be caused by the photo-degradation of the polymer donor.

The lack of an LBL-Y6 exposed device is ascribed to the difficulty to fabricate LBL devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Y6/PM6/PDINN/Ag, as the deposition process of PM6 can obviously wash Y6 away from the substrate. To selectively expose Y6, we design a solution-exposed experiment. Specifically, for the control group, the PM6:Y6 blend solution is unexposed; for the “blend exposed” one, the PM6:Y6 blend solution is exposed to 1 hour illumination before spin-coating; for the “PM6-only exposed” one, the PM6 solution is exposed before adding Y6; and for the “Y6-only exposed” one, the Y6 solution is exposed before adding PM6. All solutions have 0.5% 1-CN additive added before exposure to simulated 1 Sun illumination for one hour (as shown in Fig. 5c). All these operations are carried out in an N2 atmosphere. Fig. 5d displays the J–V curves of the “blend exposed”, “PM6-only exposed”, “Y6-only exposed” and “blend unexposed” devices. Obviously, the J–V curve of the “Y6-only exposed” device is similar to that of the “blend unexposed” sample, while the “PM6-only exposed” and “blend exposed” devices perform worse (Table 2). The PCEs of the “PM6-only exposed”, “blend exposed”, “Y6-only exposed” and “blend unexposed” devices are 9.39%, 10.4%, 15.1% and 15.7%, respectively. It is noteworthy that, whether PM6 is in solution or as a film under illumination, the corresponding devices (“PM6-only exposed” and “LBL-PM6 exposed” devices) display inferior photo-stability. The results of the above two experiments with selective exposure show that the photo-degradation process of the PM6:Y6 system is mainly driven by the photo-degradation of PM6, which might be the result of UV-induced photolysis of polymers or morphological changes.
Two other high-efficiency systems, PM6:BTP-ec9 and PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl, are also chosen for the photo-degradation experiments. As shown in Fig. 6 and Table S9 (ESI), the devices based on PM6:BTP-ec9 and PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl retain 97.7% and 98.9% of the initial JSC values after 3 hour illumination, respectively. The VOC values of the PM6:BTP-ec9 and PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl devices decrease by 14.7% (from 0.849 to 0.724 V) and 17.2% (from 0.847 to 0.701 V), respectively. The corresponding FF values experience an 11.0% and 14.5% loss, respectively. It is obvious that the VOC values of the OSCs based on PM6:BTP-ec9 and PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl decrease rapidly, followed by the FF values, while JSC remains relatively stable. This phenomenon is consistent with the photo-degradation trend of the PM6:Y6 devices. It shows that our analysis of the photo-degradation mechanism of the PM6:Y6 system is also applicable to Y6 derivative systems.

To summarize, we investigate the photo-degradation mechanism of high-efficiency OSCs based on PM6 as the donor and Y6 or its derivatives as the acceptor under different wavelength illumination in an inert atmosphere via using different band-pass filters. The fresh devices based on PM6:Y6 exhibit a JSC of 25.7 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.852 V, an FF of 71.8%, and an optimal PCE of 15.7%. After 1 hour burn-in degradation, the device exhibits significant losses in VOC, FF and PCE, while JSC shows a fairly slow decline. Through a series of characterizations, we attribute the VOC and FF losses to the following. The light-induced traps can reduce the charge carrier mobility and current extraction possibility, and increase the non-radiative recombination in the PM6:Y6-based OSCs. A similar phenomenon is observed in OSCs based on PM6:BTP-ec9 and PM6: BTP-BO-4Cl. The aged devices without a filter and with a UV filter show more severe photo degradation than those with other filters, which indicates that the ultraviolet portion contributes the most to the photo-degradation of PM6:Y6-based OSCs. It is noteworthy that, whether PM6 is in solution or as a film under exposure, the corresponding “PM6-only exposed” and “LBL-PM6 exposed” devices display inferior photo-stability, indicating that the photo-degradation process of the PM6:Y6 system mainly derives from the photo-degradation of PM6. This can be also evidenced by the more obvious drop of the hole mobility than the electron mobility in the aged devices. Our work provides a new way for exploration of the shortcoming that limits the device stability, and discloses that enhancing the photo-stability of donors is a facile gateway to improving the photo-stability of OSCs.


PEDOT:PSS (CLEVIOS™ P VP AI 4083) was purchased from Heraeus. Polymer donor PM6 was purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. Y6 was purchased from 1-Materials Inc. PDINN was purchased from Suna Tech Inc. The solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All reagents were used directly.


The conventional devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINN/Ag. Patterned ITO-coated glass substrates (15 Ω sq−1) were cleaned via sequential ionization in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. All pre-cleaned ITO substrates were treated by oxygen plasma for 180 seconds to increase the work function and clearance. The PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated at a speed of 4000 rpm onto the ITO glass, and annealed at 150 °C for 15 min in air. PM6:Y6 was dissolved in a 1:1.2 w/w ratio with a total concentration of 18 mg mL−1 in chloroform. As an additive 0.5% vol of 1-chloronaphthalene was added. PM6:Y6 was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer and thermally annealed at 100 °C for 10 min to form active layers of 100 nm thickness in a nitrogen-filled glove box. Then PDINN (in methanol solution at a concentration of 1.0 mg mL−1) was deposited on the active layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s to afford a cathode buffer layer. The rear Ag electrode (150 nm) was thermally evaporated through a mask under a vacuum of ∼3 × 10−4 mbar. For the layer-by-layer (LBL) structure device, the donor material was dissolved in o-xylene solution with a concentration of 12 mg mL−1 and the acceptor material was dissolved in chloroform solution with a concentration of 14 mg mL−1 (0.5% vol of 1-chloronaphthalene was added). Firstly, the donor was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer at 6000 rpm for 30 s to form a front layer, followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 minutes. The acceptor was then spin-coated atop the donor layer with a rotational speed of 7000 rpm. After that, the active layers were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Then the PDINN layer was spin-coated onto the active layer and Ag was thermally evaporated. The active area of the devices was 3.97 mm2.


The device performance was measured in a glove box (H2O < 0.01 ppm, O2 < 10 ppm). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices were determined using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source measurement unit and a Newport solar simulator (Oriel Sol3A Class AAA) with AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). A standard Si secondary reference cell covered with a KG-5 filter was utilized to calibrate the illumination intensity. The entire solar cells were illuminated under the solar simulator and tracked by periodically measuring the J–V curves. The temperature of the devices was monitored and held at below 40 °C. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the blend films were acquired with a UV-vis instrument Evolution 220 (Thermo Fisher). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed on a Bruker Inova atomic microscope in tapping mode under ambient conditions. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurements were performed using a ZEISS LIBRA 200 FE instrument at a 200 kV accelerating voltage. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained on an FLS1000 PL spectrometer. EQEEL measurements were performed using a home-built setup using a Keithley 2400 to inject current into the solar cells, a Si detector (Hamamatsu 1010B) and a Keithley picoammeter for measuring the emission photon-flux. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured in air conditions using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd). The hole and electron mobilities were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The electron mobility was determined with the device structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINN/Ag and the hole mobility was determined with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The hole mobility and electron mobility of the active layer were obtained by fitting the quadratic SCLC region using the Mott–Gurney equation:

ε

r
 is the dielectric constant of the organic materials (assumed to be 3), ε0 is the free space permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), d is the thickness of the active layer, μ is the charge carrier mobility, and V is the applied voltage.
