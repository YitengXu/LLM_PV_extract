Two new star-shaped A–π–D molecules with triazine as a core and an acceptor unit, thienylenevinylene as the π bridge, and tert-butyl-substituted triphenylamine (tTPA)- or carbazole (tCz) as the end group and donor units of TTVTPA and TTVCz were synthesized for their application as donor materials in solution processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs). The charge transfer was convergent from peripheral groups to the central core along the conjugated branches in these star-shaped molecules (SSMs). TTVTPA and TTVCz are soluble in common organic solvents. Excellent thermal stability was observed for TTVTPA and TTVCz. OSCs were fabricated by spin-coating a blend of each SSM with the fullerene derivatives (PC61BM or PC71BM) as a composite film-type photoactive layer. The PV properties of the TTVTPA/fullerene derivative based OSCs were considerably better than those of the TTVCz/fullerene derivative blend based OSCs. A power conversion efficiency of 2.48%, a short-circuit current density of 10.57 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.69 V, and a fill factor of 0.34 were observed for the OSC based on the active layer of TTVTPA/PC71BM (1:7, w/w).

The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) type organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the blend of organic semiconductors and fullerene derivatives have been widely studied. OSCs have several unique advantages, such as light weight, low cost, flexible device and large-scale production capability. In particular, the solution processable small molecules for use in BHJ type OSCs applications have attracted considerable attention in recent years because of their unique advantages of a well-defined structure, easy purification, definite molecular weight, easy mass-scale production and good batch to batch reproducibility. Several efforts have been made to develop small molecules for OSC applications, including the linear molecules, star shaped-molecules (SSMs), X-shaped molecules, and dendritic molecules.

SSMs have been developed as a photo-energy conversion material for OSCs because of a numbers of advantages. SSMs can be designed to realize high mobilities, small band gaps and broad absorptions in the visible region in OSCs, by tailoring the functional groups in the core, the bridge, and end groups, resulting in an improvement of the photo-energy conversion efficiency (PCE). Several electron donor–π conjugated–acceptor (D–π–A) structured SSMs based on a triphenylamine (TPA) core derivatized with various conjugated bridges and electron-withdrawing groups have been investigated. SSMs with D–π–A structure exhibit a low band gap and broad absorption in the visible region because of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), an easily tuned energy level and band gap by adjusting the donor and acceptor units, and π-bridge units or length. In addition, the TPA cored SSMs with electron-acceptor dicyanovinyl (DCN) as end groups have been studied by several researchers. Introduction of the DCN group induces a shift of the absorption onset toward longer wavelengths and an increase in the open circuit voltage (VOC) under solar light illumination, resulting in the improved PCE of OSCs. A high VOC value (1.07 V) was observed for an OSC based on the unsymmetrical TPA core SSM. The incorporation of two DCN groups as the end groups leads to a broad absorption, high absorption coefficient, and low lying HOMO level, resulting in the high VOC of such SSM based OSCs. The TPA cored SSMs with different conjugated bridges (4,4′-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiophene (bT) and 4,4′-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiophene-vinylene (bTV)) for OSCs have also been reported. The OSC based on SSM with bTV bridges exhibits a broader absorption band and higher PCE than the one based on the SSM with bT bridges. In addition, photovoltaic (PV) performances of OSC based on the TPA cored SSM with D–A–D conjugated branches have been studied. The electron-acceptor benzothiadiazole or dialkylated diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) has been incorporated as the bridge of the SSM with D–A–D conjugated branches. The incorporation of the bulky group DPP as the acceptor in the conjugated branches may prevent the formation of an ordered, long range and coplanar π–π stacking, which could be beneficial for charge transport across the thin-film based OSC.
Other alternative, the trithienobenzene cored planarized SSMs for the photoactive layer of OSCs, has been reported in a previous study. Roncali et al. reported that incorporating the planar core could reduce the dihedral angle between the core and the branches of SSMs. The combined effects of planarization and rigidification of the trithienobenzene core leads to a significant enhancement of π-electron delocalization associated with a decrease in the energy gap for the SSMs. Moreover, the SSM with planar core appears to adopt a preferential horizontal orientation on the surface of substrate, which is more favorable for efficient absorption of the incident light. This horizontal orientation behavior associated with the enhanced π-electron delocalization inherent to the fused trithienobenzene leads to a considerable improvement in the performance of the resulting OSC. In addition to the trithienobenzene cored planarized SSMs, the triindole and isotrexin cored SSMs for OSCs have also been reported. Such SSMs with a strong electron-donating core exhibit an intensive absorption in a broad region and relatively high hole mobility. Despite the fact that the highest PCEs (5–7%) of the solution processable small molecule based BHJ type OSCs have been reported, the relatively low PCE is still a hindrance to their application. The PV performances of the SSMs with different central cores, conjugated bridges, and periphery groups have not been thoroughly investigated.
As mentioned earlier, SSMs with an electron-donating core have been extensively studied, including the TPA, trithienobenzene, triindole, and isotrexin cores. For these D–π–A structured SSMs, the direction of the dipole moments is divergent from the central core to the peripheral groups along the conjugated branches (Fig. 1(a)). In this study, two new solution processable A–π–D structured SSMs with triazine as the core and acceptor unit, thienylenevinylene as the π bridge, and tert-butyl-substituted triphenylamine (tTPA)- or carbazole (tCz) as the end group and donor units of TTVTPA and TTVCz were synthesized for their application as donor materials in solution processed BHJ type OSCs. The direction of the dipole moments is convergent from the peripheral groups to the central core along the conjugated branches (Fig. 1(b)). The incorporation of the electron deficient triazine group as the core decreases the LUMO level and energy gap of the SSM, which is favorable for harvesting large amounts of solar radiation. Moreover, the convergence of the dipole moments from the peripheral groups to the central core along the conjugated branches could avoid the formation of a long-ranged and coplanar π–π stacking. This is beneficial to the charge transport across the thin-film based OSC. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were used to study the chemical structure effect on the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the SSMs. The BHJ type OSCs based on the photoactive layer of SSM/fullerene derivative (PC61BM or PC71BM) blend films were fabricated. The mechanism of charge separation and transfer from the SSM to the fullerene derivatives was proposed, as shown in Fig. 2. The charges transfer from the triazine core of SSM to the fullerene derivatives formed channels. We also used atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to study the morphology of thin films prepared from SSM (TTVTPA and TTVCz)/PC61BM (or PC71BM) blends. We then fabricated OSCs having a conventional indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass/hole-transporting medium (HTM)/photoactive layer/Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) structure via spin-coating a blend of each SSM with PC61BM or PC71BM to form a composite film-type photoactive layer on an HTM layer deposited on ITO-coated glass. The PV performance of each of these OSCs was evaluated and, based on the result, we considered the influence of the molecular-structural features of our A–π–D structured SSMs on OSC performance.

1H NMR (600 MHz) spectra were recorded using a Varian Unity Inova spectrometer. Elemental analysis was performed using an elemental analyzer (Elementar Vario EL III). The glass transition temperature (Tg) and thermal decomposition temperature (Td; temperature at which weight loss reaches 5%) of the SSMs were determined using differential scanning calorimetry (TA Instruments, DSC-2010) and thermogravimetric analysis (TA Instruments, TGA-2050), respectively. Both the analyses were performed under a N2 atmosphere at a scanning (both heating and cooling) rate of 10 °C min−1. The temperatures at the intercepts of the curves in the thermogram (endothermic, exothermic, or weight loss) with the leading baseline were taken as estimates of Tg and Td. The absorption spectra were measured using a Hewlett-Packard 8453 UV-vis spectrometer. The fluorescence spectra were measured using an Acton Research Spectra Pro-150 luminescence spectrometer. Dilute o-DCB solutions of the TTVTPA and TTVCz were filtered through a 0.45 μm filter to remove the insoluble materials before spectral measurements. The redox potentials of the TTVTPA and TTVCz were determined using a CHI 611D electrochemical analyzer (scanning rate: 50 mV s−1) equipped with Pt electrodes and an Ag/Ag+ (0.10 M AgNO3 in MeCN) reference electrode in an anhydrous, N2-saturated solution of 0.1 M Bu4NClO4 in MeCN. A Pt plate coated with a thin polymer film was used as the working electrode; a Pt wire and an Ag/Ag+ electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The electrochemical potential was calibrated against ferrocene/ferrocenium. The morphology of the films prepared from TTVTPA/PC61BM and TTVCz/PC61BM blends was studied using an atomic force microscope (AFM, Seiko SII SPA400) operated in the tapping mode and using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-1400).


The OSCs fabricated in this study had an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass/hole-transporting material (HTM)/photoactive layer/Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) structure in which the photoactive layer consisted of an interpenetrating network of SSM and the fullerene derivative PC61BM or PC71BM. The ITO-coated glass (sheet resistance: 20 Ω square−1) was purchased from Applied Film Corp. PC61BM and PC71BM were purchased from American Dye Source and used as received. The OSCs were fabricated as follows: glass substrates with patterned ITO electrodes were washed well and then cleaned using O2 plasma treatment. A thin film of the HTM, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, AI4083, Heraeus Clevios GmbH), was deposited onto the ITO layer using the spin-casting method. The sample was dried at 150 °C for 30 min in a glove box. A mixture solution of SSM and fullerene derivative PC61BM or PC71BM (30 mg mL−1 in o-DCB) was stirred overnight and then filtered through a 0.2 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) filter and spin-coated (1500 rpm, 30 s) onto the HTM layer to prepare the SSM/PC61BM (or SSM/PC71BM) composite film-based photo-active layer. The sample was dried at 80 °C for 60 min in a glove box. In a high-vacuum chamber, the Ca/Al-based cathode was thermally deposited onto the SSM/PC61BM (or SSM/PC71BM) composite layer. The active area of the OSC was 0.04 cm2. After electrode deposition, the OSC was encapsulated. The cathode deposition rate was determined using a quartz thickness monitor (STM-100/MF, Sycon). The thickness of the thin films was determined using a surface texture analysis system (3030ST, Dektak). The PV properties of the OSCs were measured using a programmable electrometer equipped with current and voltage sources (Keithley 2400) under illumination with solar-simulating light (100 mW cm−2) from an AM1.5 solar simulator (NewPort Oriel 96000).


Chemical structures of the SSMs (TTVTPA and TTVCz) were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analyzer. SSMs were soluble in common organic solvents, including cyclohexanone, toluene, xylene, dichloromethane, chloroform, THF, and o-DCB. Excellent solubility is favorable for the solution processing of the SSM based photo-active layer. However, the operational stability of OSCs is directly related to the thermal stability of the component conjugated SSM. Thus, high values of Tg and Td are desirable. We measured the Tg and Td of two SSMs by thermal analyses using DSC and TGA, as shown in Fig. S1(a) and (b) (ESI), respectively. The transition temperatures were determined from the second round of the DSC heating scans. The values of Tg for TTVTPA and TTVCz were 135.8 °C and 168.6 °C, respectively. A higher Tg value was observed for the TTVCz compared to the TTVTPA. The reason for this difference may be that the propeller-shaped conformation of the TPA moiety is expected to increase the free volume between the SSMs, while the coplanar structure of carbazole permits a higher packing density. In addition, the values of Td for TTVTPA and TTVCz were 432.2 °C and 428.4 °C, respectively. The high thermal stabilities of TTVTPA and TTVCz are suitable for OSC applications.


UV-vis absorption spectra of the SSMs (TTVTPA and TTVCz) in o-DCB solution and as solid films are shown in Fig. 3. Table 1 summarizes the photophysical properties of the SSMs. As shown in Fig. 3, the absorption bands of TTVTPA and TTVCz in o-DCB ranged from 350 to 575 nm, and each conjugated molecule exhibited a broad absorption band. The maximum absorption wavelengths of TTVTPA and TTVCz in o-DCB were at 495 nm and 442 nm, respectively, representing the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions between the triazine core and the conjugated branches. The red-shift of the absorption band for TTVTPA relative to TTVCz should be because of the stronger electron-donating character and more efficient π–π* charge transfer of tTPA terminated branches. In addition, the absorption bands of TTVTPA and TTVCz thin films ranged from 350 to 625 nm. The maximum absorption wavelengths of TTVTPA and TTVCz as thin films were at 488 nm and 446 nm, respectively. The absorption bands of TTVTPA and TTVCz in thin film form were not red-shifted compared to that of the ones in o-DCB. This behavior is closely related to the molecular packing of SSMs in the solid state. The result indicated that a long range π–π stacking was not present in the thin film state for the A–π–D structured SSMs (TTVTPA and TTVCz). Most of the D–π–A or D–π–D structured SSMs exhibit a red-shift of the maximum absorption wavelengths in the thin-film state in comparison to that of the ones in the solution state. Nevertheless, the onset wavelength of the absorption band was increased for the SSMs in the thin-film state compared to the ones in solution state, especially for the TTVCz. In addition, the full widths at half-maximum (FWHM) of the absorption bands of the TTVTPA and TTVCz in the films were greater than those in solution, presumably because of the conformation of the SSMs in the thin-film state was more complex compared to the ones in the solution state. As a result, larger FWHM values were observed for the SSMs in the thin-film state.

In addition, we determined the band-gap energies (Eg) of the SSMs in the thin film state from the onset wavelengths of their absorption bands. As presented in Table 1, the values of Eg for TTVTPA and TTVCz were 2.05 eV and 2.09 eV, respectively. The lower value of Eg should reflect a higher amount of charge transfer between the triazine core and the conjugated branches for the TTVTPA compared to the TTVCz. Generally, the broader absorption and lower band-gap energy characteristics are expected to improve the solar-light absorption efficiency of the photo-energy conversion layer in OSCs, resulting in greater photocurrent generation.

Because the PV performance of OSC is related to the electro-chemical behavior of the SSM, we used cyclic voltammetry to investigate the electrochemical behavior of the SSMs and to estimate the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). The oxidation behaviors in the CV curves of the SSMs TTVTPA and TTVCz are shown in Fig. 4. The electrochemical properties of the TTVTPA and TTVCz are summarized in Table 1. The oxidation potentials (Eoxon) of TTVTPA and TTVCz were 0.76 V and 0.87 V, respectively. From those values, the HOMO levels of the SSMs were calculated according to the following equation:
HOMO = −e(Eoxon − Eoxon,ferrocene + 4.8) (eV)
where 4.80 eV is the energy level of ferrocene below the vacuum level, and the
Eoxon of ferrocene/ferrocene+ is 0.09 V in a 0.1 M Bu4NClO4/MeCN solution. The HOMO levels were obtained as −5.47 eV and −5.58 eV for TTVTPA and TTVCz, respectively. The HOMO level of TTVTPA is higher than that of TTVCz. It is also known that attachment of tert-butyl groups on electrochemically active sites of aromatic amines leads to a decrease in the HOMO level. Here, tCz terminated SSM (TTVCz) exhibited a lower HOMO level than that of the tTPA terminated SSM (TTVTPA), presumably because of the larger oxidation potential and weaker electron-donating ability of carbazole derivatives. In general, the HOMO energy level of a p-type conjugated molecule is an important parameter that affects the performance of BHJ-type cells. A high VOC value is typically obtained for OSCs fabricated from SSMs with low HOMO energy levels. Because no reversible n-doping process was observed in the CV spectra, the LUMO levels were estimated from the HOMO levels and the value of Eg determined from the UV-vis absorption spectrum using the equation:
LUMO = (HOMO + Eg) (eV)
The LUMO level was determined as −3.42 eV for TTVTPA and −3.49 eV for TTVCz. Conjugated molecules should have a high LUMO level for efficient charge dissociation in the BHJ type OSC. Note that the LUMO difference between the SSMs and PC71BM (∼−4.2 eV) is approximately 0.70 eV, i.e., there is a sufficient driving force to dissociate the exciton at the BHJ interface. Clearly, the electrochemical properties of these SSMs can be tuned by incorporating conjugated branches with different electron-donating groups (tTPA and tCz) as the terminated moieties.

The thermal properties of the TTVTPA/PC61BM and TTVCz/PC61BM blends were studied using DSC. The results indicated that Tg values of the SSMs were decreased significantly by the incorporation of the PC61BM units, especially for the TTVCz/PC61BM blends (Table 2). This observation is attributed to the plasticizer effect of the PC61BM. The incorporation of PC61BM enhanced the free volume between the SSMs; thus, reduced the Tg of the TTVTPA/PC61BM and TTVCz/PC61BM blends. Nevertheless, the Tg values of the TTVTPA/PC61BM and TTVCz/PC61BM blends were slightly increased with the increase of the PC61BM content. This result implies that the presence of a large amount of PC61BM units resisted the molecular motion of the SSMs.

Fig. 5 displays the normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of TTVTPA/PC61BM and TTVCz/PC61BM blends films prepared at various weight ratios. The absorption bands of the TTVTPA/PC61BM and TTVCz/PC61BM blends extended from 375 to 800 nm. The maximal absorption peaks of the TTVTPA/PC61BM and TTVCz/PC61BM blends were observed at approximately 500 nm and 450 nm, respectively, while that of PC61BM ranged from 300 nm to 375 nm. Moreover, the maximum absorption wavelength of the SSM/PC61BM blends increased with increasing amounts of PC61BM. A red-shift of the absorption bands was observed for the TTVTPA/PC61BM and TTVCz/PC61BM blend films compared to that of the TTVTPA and TTVCz films. This result implies that the incorporation of PC61BM units reduced the aggregation of the conjugated molecules and favors the ICT between the triazine core and branches. However, for TTVTPA/PC61BM blends, the absorption band was blue-shifted as a higher amount of PC61BM (1:7, 1:9, w/w) was incorporated into the TTVTPA films. This behavior implies that the coplanarity of the triazine core and conjugated branches was disturbed as a large amount of PC61BM units was incorporated. The conformation of the SSM was strongly affected by the increased incorporation of the PC61BM units. In addition, the maximum absorption of the PC61BM sample appeared at ca. 330 nm. The absorption intensity of the SSM/PC61BM blends decreased with increasing PC61BM content, which corresponds to the low absorption intensity of PC61BM in the visible absorption region.
The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of TTVTPA/PC61BM and TTVCz/PC61BM blends films prepared at various weight ratios are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI). TTVTPA and TTVCz exhibited PL maxima at ca. 700 nm upon excitation at 350 nm. The tTPA terminated TTVTPA exhibited a red-shift of the emission band relative to the tCz terminated TTVCz because of the stronger electron-donating ability of tTPA group. The PL emission was almost completely quenched by the addition of PC61BM to TTVTPA and TTVCz (w/w = 3:1). The complete quenching suggests that excitons generated by the absorbed photons dissociated almost completely to become free charge carriers (electrons and holes). Thus, effective charge transfer from the p-type conjugated molecule to the electron acceptor PC61BM occurs — a basic requirement for preparing OSCs that exhibit satisfactory PV performance.

The performance of the bulk heterojunction OSCs is strongly dependent on the morphology of the conjugated SSM/fullerene derivative composite film. To avoid recombination of the excitons, the P/N heterojunction phase must be controlled at the nanoscale level. We used AFM microscopy to investigate the compatibility and morphology of our conjugated SSM/PC61BM composite films. Fig. 6 displays the topographic and phase-contrast images of the TTVTPA/PC61BM blends films after annealing at 80 °C for 60 min. The surface roughness and thicknesses of the TTVTPA/PC61BM blends films are summarized in Table 2. In Fig. 6(a), the phase image indicated that an obvious phase separation was observed for the TTVTPA/PC61BM (w/w = 1:1) blend film. The dark areas in the image represent PC61BM domains because the electron-scattering density of PC61BM is greater than that of the conjugated SSMs. The closer packing of triazine cored SSMs presumably reduced the compatibility between the TTVTPA and PC61BM in the film. From the topographic image (Fig. 6(b)), we observed that the phase separation resulted in the high surface roughness of the TTVTPA/PC61BM (w/w = 1:1) blend film. As shown in Fig. 6(c), the phase separation was improved for the TTVTPA/PC61BM (w/w = 1:3) blend film. The size of TTVTPA domains were reduced as the addition amount of PC61BM was increased. Moreover, the surface roughness of the TTVTPA/PC61BM blend film was significantly reduced with the increase of the PC61BM content (Fig. 6(d)). As the content of added PC61BM was further increased, the improvement of the compatibility between the TTVTPA and PC61BM in the film was sustained for the TTVTPA/PC61BM (w/w = 1:5) blend film (Fig. 6(e) and (f)). A more homogeneous morphology was observed in the TTVTPA/PC61BM (w/w = 1:5) blend film in comparison with that of the TTVTPA/PC61BM (w/w = 1:3) blend film. For the TTVTPA/PC61BM (w/w = 1:7) blend film, we observed a phase-separated interpenetrating network with sizable PC61BM domains (Fig. 6(g) and (h)). Some degree of phase separation is critical for the efficient formation of free carriers to provide the optimal PV properties of OSCs. In addition, the distribution of the PC61BM units in the TTVTPA/PC61BM (w/w = 1:9) blend film (Fig. 6(i) and (j)) was less uniform compared to that of the TTVTPA/PC61BM (w/w = 1:7) blend film (Fig. 6(g) and (h)). The phase separation was obvious as an excess of PC61BM was incorporated into the TTVTPA/PC61BM (w/w = 1:9) blend film. The phase image revealed several PC61BM clusters (dark areas) in the TTVTPA/PC61BM blend film (Fig. 6(i)). As a result, a higher surface roughness was observed for the TTVTPA/PC61BM blend film (Fig. 6(j)). In addition, the topographic and phase-contrast images of the TTVCz/PC61BM blend films are shown in Fig. 7. An obvious phase separation was observed for the TTVCz/PC61BM (w/w = 1:1) blend film, while a phase-separated interpenetrating network with sizable PC61BM domains was observed for the TTVCz/PC61BM (w/w = 1:3) blend film. A lower surface roughness was observed for the TTVCz/PC61BM (w/w = 1:3) blend film compared to that of the TTVCz/PC61BM (w/w = 1:1) blend film (Table 2). As shown in Fig. 7(c), the PC61BM clusters were phase separated from the TTVCz/PC61BM (w/w = 1:5) blend film, which is accompanied with an increase of the surface roughness. The compatibility of TTVCz and PC61BM is different from that of TTVTPA and PC61BM. The conjugated branches of SSMs with different terminal groups exhibited different stacking packing morphology, thereby resulting in the different compatibility with PC61BM. To further characterize the distribution of PC61BM in the SSM/PC61BM films, a TEM investigation was performed. Bright-field TEM images of TTVTPA/PC61BM (w/w = 1:7) and TTVCz/PC61BM (w/w = 1:5) are shown in Fig. 8. The dark areas in the images represent PC61BM domains because the electron-scattering density of PC61BM is greater than that of the SSM. The PC61BM unit was found to be uniformly distributed in the blend film after being annealed at 80 °C for 1 h.


We fabricated OSCs incorporating a photoactive layer of the SSM/PC61BM blend film prepared by an optimized spin-coating procedure. Fig. 9 shows the photocurrent density–voltage plots of the OSCs. Table 2 summarizes the PV properties of these OSCs, including VOC, short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and PCE values. For the TTVTPA/PC61BM-based OSCs (OSC I-1–OSC I-5), the VOC value increased with increasing PC61BM content. The VOC value of OSC I-1 was considerably lower than those of the other OSCs (OSC I-2–OSC I-5). Although the value of VOC is determined primarily by the difference between the LUMO energy level of the electron acceptor (in this case, PC61BM) and the HOMO energy level of the electron donor (the conjugated SSM), it is also affected by the morphology of the photoactive layer. As shown in Fig. S2a, the PL emission was not completely quenched for the TTVTPA/PC61BM (w/w = 1:1) blend film. This incomplete quenching indicated that the excitons generated by the absorbed photons were not dissociated to free charge carriers (electrons and holes). Moreover, AFM images indicated that the phase-separated interpenetrating networks with sizable domains were not formed in the photoactive layer for the TTVTPA/PC61BM (w/w = 1:1) blend film (Fig. 6(a)). The effective charge transfer from the p-type conjugated TTVTPA to the electron acceptor PC61BM was limited. As a result, the electron–hole recombination occurred at the interface of TTVTPA- and PC61BM-based domains and resulted in the low VOC value of OSC I-1. However, the JSC, FF, and PCE values of OSCs increased upon increasing the PC61BM content. The highest JSC, FF, and PCE values were observed for the OSC I-5. This result indicates that the optimal composition of TTVTPA and PC61BM was approximately 1:7 (w/w) for the TTVTPA based OSCs. Higher concentrations of PC61BM favored the formation of phase-separated interpenetrating networks with sizable domains in the photoactive layer, which in turn led to an effective charge separation and charge transfer. An efficient dissociation of the exciton, and higher charge collection to the electrode are favorable for enhancement of the OSC Performance. The hole mobilities of the SSM/PC61BM blend films were measured by the space-charge limited current method with a typical hole-only device structure of ITO/PEODT/SSM:PC61BM/Au. The results are plotted as current density (J) vs. voltage (V), as shown in Fig. 10. The hole mobilities of the blend films are summarized in Table 2. The hole mobilities of the TTVTPA/PC61BM blend films increased upon increasing the PC61BM content (Table 2). The hole mobilities of the TTVTPA/PC61BM blend films are in the range from 5.9 × 10−6 to 2.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. The highest hole mobility (2.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) was observed for the OSC I-4. According to the literature, the electron-mobility of PCBM is 4000 times higher than the hole mobility in the pure conjugated polymer. Moreover, the ratio between the electron mobility and hole mobility is only a factor of ten in the polymer/PCBM blend film, resulting in a more balanced charge transport. The hole mobility and charge balance seems to be enhanced by incorporation of PC61BM into the polymer composite. However, excessive incorporation of the PC61BM content was not favorable for the charge transfer and the PV performance of the OSCs. OSC I-5 exhibited poor hole-mobility and PV performance than those of OSC I-4. The micro-phase separation and aggregation of PC61BM resulted in charge recombination and current leakage, which decreased the JSC and PCE values for OSC I-5.

In addition, the VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE values of the TTVCz/PC61BM blend film based OSCs (OSC II-1–OSC II-3) increased upon increasing the PC61BM content. The highest JSC and PCE values were observed for the OSC II-2, which is because of the fact of that the optimal composition of TTVCz and PC61BM was about 1:3 (w/w) for the TTVCz based OSCs. In addition to the efficient solar light absorption, the PV performance was closely related to the charge transfer ability of the SSM/PC61BM blend film. The phase-separated interpenetrating networks with sizable domains in the photoactive layer were formed for the TTVCz/PC61BM (w/w = 1:3) blend film, which led to the improved hole-mobility (1.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and higher PV performance of OSC II-2. In addition, the values of VOC of the TTVCz/PC61BM based OSCs (OSC II-1–OSC II-3) were larger than those of the TTVTPA/PC61BM based OSCs (OSC I-1–OSC I-5), presumably because of the lower HOMO level of TTVCZ compared to that of TTVTPA. In contrast, TTVTPA/PC61BM based OSCs exhibited larger values of hole-mobility, JSC, FF, and PCE than did those of the TTVCz/PC61BM based OSCs. We attribute the improved charge mobility and PV performance of TTVTPA/PC61BM-based OSCs to the improved conjugation of the tTPA group terminated TTVTPA.
In addition, the current density versus voltage curves indicates that the series resistance (RS) is high and the shunt resistance (RSH) is low (Fig. 9). The RS and RSH values of OSCs are summarized in Table 2. The RS and RSH values of BHJ type OSCs are closely related to the morphology of the SSM/PC61BM blend based photoactive layer and the quality of the interfacial contact between the SSM/PC61BM blend layer and the cathode. The RS values of the OSCs were decreased with increasing PC61BM content. The lowest RS value was observed for the OSC I-4 based on the TTVTPA/PC61BM (1:7, w/w) blend. The phase-separated interpenetrating networks with sizable domains in the photoactive layer allow for more efficient intra- and inter-molecular charge transport through the conjugated SSMs in the TTVTPA/PC61BM blend layer. Consequently, a lower RS value was observed for the OSC I-4. The influence of the PC61BM content on the TTVCz/PC61BM blend based OSCs (OSC II-1–OSC II-3) is similar to that of the TTVTPA/PC61BM blend based OSCs (OSC I-1–OSC I-5). OSC II-2 exhibited a lower RS value than that for OSC II-1 and OSC II-3. In addition, a low RSH value of the OSC was observed because of the poor contact between the photoactive layer and cathode. Poor contact between the photoactive layer and the cathode caused an increase in the charge recombination and leakage current, which resulted in the low RSH value of OSC. The RSH values of the OSCs were decreased with increasing PC61BM content, which is attributed to the decrease in the surface roughness value of the SSM/PC61BM blend films. A lower surface roughness led to the poor interfacial contact between the photoactive layer and cathode. As a result, lower RSH values were observed for the OSC I-4 and OSC II-2 compared to those of the other OSCs. Nevertheless, the PV performance of OSCs was enhanced with an increase in the PC61BM content in the photoactive layer.

To further improve the PV performance of TTVTPA- and TTVCz-based OSCs, PC71BM was introduced instead of PC61BM as the electron-acceptor in the photoactive layer of the OSCs. Photocurrent density–voltage plots of the SSM/PC71BM blend film based OSCs (OSC III-1 and OSC III-2) are shown in Fig. 9. The PV properties of these OSCs are summarized in Table 2. Because the optimal composition of the TTVTPA/PC61BM and TTVCz/PC61BM blends are 1:7 and 1:3 (w/w), respectively, the OSC III-1 and OSC III-2 based on TTVTPA/PC71BM and TTVCz/PC71BM blends with compositions of 1:7 and 1:3 (w/w) were studied. Indeed, AFM images indicated that phase-separated interpenetrating networks with sizable domains in the photoactive layer were formed for the TTVTPA/PC71BM and TTVCz/PC71BM blend films (Fig. S3, ESI). Moreover, TEM images indicated that the PC71BM units are uniformly distributed in the TTVTPA/PC71BM and TTVCz/PC71BM blend films (Fig. S4, ESI). OSC III-1 fabricated from the TTVTPA/PC71BM blend (w/w = 1:7) film exhibited a hole-mobility of 2.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, a VOC of 0.69 V, a JSC of 10.57 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.34, and a PCE of 2.48%. The TTVCz/PC71BM blend (w/w = 1:3) film based OSC III-2 exhibited a hole-mobility of 1.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, a VOC of 0.78 V, a JSC of 6.0 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.31, and a PCE of 1.45%. The RS values of OSC III-1 and OSC III-2 are 36.5 and 81.1 kΩ cm2, respectively, while the RSH values are 0.16 and 0.71 kΩ cm2, respectively. Considerably higher JSC and PCE values were observed for the SSM/PC71BM blend film based OSCs compared to those of the SSM/PC61BM blend film based OSCs. This difference was because of the stronger and broader absorption of PC71BM in the visible region. In addition, the JSC and PCE values of the A–π–D structured SSM (TTVTPA and TTVCz) based OSCs are comparable to that of the literature reported D–π–A and D–A–D structured SSM based OSCs, even though the triazine cored SSMs (TTVTPA and TTVCz) exhibited shorter absorption wavelengths than the TPA cored SSMs. This result indicate that the charge generation and transporting capacity of the A–π–D structured SSM based OSC were comparable to those of the D–π–A or D–A–D structured SSM based OSC. The convergence of dipole moments from the peripheral groups to the central core along the conjugated branches is beneficial to the charge transport from the SSM to the fullerene derivative.


Two new A–π–D structured SSMs (TTVTPA and TTVCz) were developed for their application as donor materials in solution processed BHJ type OSCs. The incorporation of the electron deficient triazine group as the core decreases the LUMO level and energy gap of the SSMs. The red-shift of the absorption band for TTVTPA relative to TTVCz is because of the stronger electron-donating character and more efficient π–π* charge transfer of tTPA terminated branches. This is favorable for harvesting large amounts of solar radiation. In addition to the efficient solar light absorption, the PV performance was closely related to the charge transfer ability of the SSM/fullerene derivative blend film. TTVTPA/fullerene derivative based OSCs exhibit larger values of hole-mobility than do the TTVCz/fullerene derivative based OSCs. Consequently, the PV properties of the TTVTPA/fullerene derivative based OSCs were considerably better than those of the TTVCz/fullerene derivative blend based OSCs. This study provided a new approach for the chemical design of star-shaped conjugated molecules for OSC applications.
