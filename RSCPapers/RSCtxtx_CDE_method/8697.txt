Mixed-organic-cation FAxMA1−xPbI3 films were prepared using a one-step solution deposition method in ambient air. The formamidinium (FA+) fraction ‘x’ was varied from 0.1 to 1 by changing the amounts of formamidinium iodide (FAI) and methylammonium iodide (MAI) in the precursor solution. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a structure of FTO glass/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/FAxMA1−xPbI3/carbon electrode were designed and fabricated. The effects of the FA+ fraction ‘x’ on the structure, morphology and optical properties of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 films as well as the photovoltaic performance of PSCs were studied. The results showed that the photovoltaic inactive δ-phase FAPbI3 can be formed in the presence of high contents of FA+ (x = 0.8 and 1.0). The band gap of FAxMA1−xPbI3 decreased from 1.58 eV to 1.49 eV when the FA+ fraction x increased from 0.1 to 1. The PSCs based on FA0.4MA0.6PbI3 exhibited an optimal photovoltaic performance, yielding Voc of 0.8 V, Jsc of 22.84 mA cm−2, FF of 0.48 and PCE of 8.77%.

Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on organic–inorganic composite perovskite materials have attracted enormous attention over the past ten years due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE), low preparation cost and simple process. As emerging photovoltaic devices, PSCs were first mentioned in 2009 when their efficiency was only 3.8%. Since then, the efficiency has been continuously updated and has achieved very remarkable results; after certification, the PCE of PSCs reached 23.2%. Perovskites represent a class of materials with a chemical formula of ABX3, where A represents a large-sized cation or group such as cesium (Cs+), methylammonium (CH3NH3+, MA+), and formamidinium (HC(NH2)2+, FA+) or two mixed ions; B is a small-sized metal cation such as Pb2+, Sn2+ or two mixed ions; and X is a halogen anion, for example, iodide (I−), chloride (Cl−), bromide (Br−) or two mixed ions. MAPbX3 is a common perovskite material with bipolar carrier transport characteristics, a long carrier diffusion length, a suitable optical band gap of approximately 1.55 eV, a high absorption coefficient and a wide absorption range from visible to near-infrared. However, the irreversible decomposition of MAPbI3 after its contact with moisture in air results in a reduced PCE and unstable PSCs based on the MAPbI3 absorption layer. To overcome these problems, other types of perovskite solar cells based on compounds such as FAPbI3 and CsPbI3 have been developed in recent years.

Compared with MAPbI3, FAPbI3 has a band gap value of 1.47 eV, which is closer to the optimal band gap (1.34 eV) of a single junction cell. Therefore, FAPbI3 broadens the absorption range and exhibits higher photoelectric conversion efficiency. In addition, the phase transition for MAPbI3 occurs once the temperature exceeds 60 °C, making FAPbI3 have better thermal stability. However, FAPbI3 also has inherent instability. At room temperature, FAPbI3 is in the yellow δ-FAPbI3 phase. When the temperature is higher than 150 °C, the yellow δ-FAPbI3 phase converts to the black α-FAPbI3 phase. Black α-FAPbI3 is used as a light-absorbing material for PSCs. Black α-FAPbI3 is unstable at room temperature and easily turns into yellow δ-FAPbI3. Both MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 have disadvantages as the absorption layers of PSCs. It was found that the use of mixed-organic-cation perovskite materials such as FA1−xMAxPbX3 can help avoid these disadvantages. At room temperature, the MA+ cation stabilizes α-FAPbI3 and inhibits its conversion to yellow δ-FAPbI3. Therefore, the mixed-organic-cation FAxMA1−xPbI3 exhibits certain advantages in improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs. Moreover, researchers found that mixed-organic cationic perovskites have some properties of an ideal light absorber: a tuneable band gap, a high absorption coefficient, bipolar carrier transport characteristics, a long carrier diffusion length, and high defect tolerance. These functions are beneficial in improving the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. In addition, employing a layer of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic semiconductors on top of perovskite to further extend its photoresponse is considered a simple and promising way to enhance the efficiency of perovskite solar cells.
The traditional structure of PSCs is made up of FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au electrode. Among them, Au is a noble metal and spiro-OMeTAD is more expensive than Au. The high costs of the hole transport materials (HTMs) and the noble metal electrode will surely hinder the commercialization of PSCs in the future. Hence, in our work, PSCs with a structure of FTO glass/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/FAxMA1−xPbI3/carbon electrode were designed and fabricated. The carbon materials replaced noble metals Au or Ag as the counter electrode, and the perovskite layer served not only as a light harvester but also as a hole-transporting material. These two ways will lead to decreased costs and improved stability of PCSs. Certainly, the conversion efficiency of carbon-based HTM-free PSCs was lower than that of the state-of-the-art devices. The important reason is that the poor contact at the interface of perovskite/carbon can lead to a low fill factor of PSCs.
In this work, the mixed-organic-cation FAxMA1−xPbI3 (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0) perovskite films were prepared using a one-step solution deposition method in ambient air. A mixed solvent of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as the solvent. PbI2, MAI and FAI were used as the solutes. Ethyl acetate was used as the anti-solvent. The anti-solvent technique introduced in a one-step solution process can improve the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite films because it can force the solute to precipitate rapidly. PSCs with the structure of FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/FAxMA1−xPbI3/carbon electrode were fabricated in ambient air. The effects of the FA+ fraction ‘x’ on the structure, morphology and optical properties of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 absorption layer as well as the photovoltaic performance of PSCs were studied.

The mixed-organic-cation FAxMA1−xPbI3 films were prepared using the one-step solution deposition method in ambient air. For the one-step solution process, a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO was used as the solvent. PbI2, MAI and FAI were used as the solutes. Ethyl acetate was used as the anti-solvent. In a typical one-step method, 1 mmol PbI2, 0.1 mmol FAI and 0.9 mmol MAI were dissolved in a mixed solution of 200 μL DMSO and 800 μL DMF. The resulting solution was stirred for 5 min to prepare the precursor solution with the concentration of 2 M. A typical synthesis process for the FAxMA1−xPbI3 films was performed as follows. First, the substrates were pre-heated on a hot plate at 100 °C for 5 min. The precursor solutions were immediately spin-coated on the substrates (FTO or TiO2 mesoporous layer). The anti-solvent ethyl acetate was added before the film became turbid during spin coating. Next, the FAxMA1−xPbI3 films were dried for 30 min at 100 °C to obtain high-coverage FAxMA1−xPbI3 films. In order to study the effects of the FA+ fraction ‘x’ on the structure, morphology and optical properties of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 films as well as the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, the amounts of FAI in the precursor solution were varied from 0.1 to 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1 mmol; accordingly, the amounts of MAI were changed from 0.9 to 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2 and 0 mmol, respectively. The mixed solvent and the concentrations of the precursor solutions were kept constant. The deposition process parameters for various samples are listed in Table 1.

The morphology, phase structure and purity of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 films were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, SU8010) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/MAX Ultima IV, Rigaku). The optical properties of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 films were recorded using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-3600 Plus) and a fluorescence spectrometer with an excitation source of 325 nm (Finder Vista).

The PSCs with a structure of FTO glass/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/FAxMA1−xPbI3/carbon electrode were prepared according to the method described in our previous report: in the first step of the PSC fabrication process, the compact TiO2 layer with the thickness of 50 nm was prepared on the FTO substrate by spin-coating. Second, the mesoporous TiO2 layer with the thickness of 500 nm was deposited onto the compact TiO2 layer by spin-coating. The fabrication process of the compact TiO2 layer and the mesoporous TiO2 layer was described in detail in our previous report. Third, the FAxMA1−xPbI3 absorber layer was prepared onto the mesoporous TiO2 layer using a one-step solution deposition method in ambient air. The carbon electrode was coated on the FAxMA1−xPbI3 absorber layer by blade-coating and then dried at 110 °C for 30 minutes. Fourth, the PSCs were encapsulated using paraffin. The effective cell area was 0.066 cm2, which was defined by a black mask. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs were recorded using a Keithley Model 2400 digital source meter and solar simulator (Newport 94043A) under standard AM 1.5 solar illuminations with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The J–V curves were measured at a reverse scan (RS) from the open-circuit to the short-circuit with a scan rate of 0.18 V s−1. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were collected using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) at a bias potential of 1.0 V in the dark with a frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 105 Hz; the magnitude of the alternating signal was 10 mV. The impedance parameters were determined by fitting the impedance spectra using the Z-View software.



Fig. 1(a) provides the X-ray diffraction patterns of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 films prepared using different FA+ fractions (‘x’). The main peaks appearing at 2θ = 14.04°, 19.94°, 24.48°, 28.32°, 31.86°, 34.92°, 40.52° and 43.04° can be indexed as the (110), (112), (202), (220), (310), (312), (224) and (314) crystallographic planes of the perovskite crystal structure, respectively. A photovoltaic inactive δ-phase FAPbI3 was observed in the presence of high contents of FA+ (x = 0.8 and 1.0). In addition, the diffraction peak for PbI2 is clearly found at 2θ = 12.64° for the FAxMA1−xPbI3 films with x = 0.1 and x = 1.0. The diffraction peak at 2θ = 12.64° is assigned to the (001) plane of PbI2 (JCPDS No. 07-0235). The results indicated that the FA+ fraction ‘x’ affected the phase purity of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 films. Furthermore, the XRD patterns showed that an increased FA+ composition caused the diffraction peaks slightly shift to lower angles. Fig. 1(b) shows the typical magnified result of the (220) diffraction peak in Fig. 1(a). This shift was due to the deformation of the crystal lattice when FA+ ions instead of MA+ ions were in the perovskite crystal structure, which can be explained by the Bragg equation. Since the size of FA+ (0.279 nm) is larger than that of MA+ (0.270 nm), the diffraction angles gradually decreased according to the Bragg equation 2dsinθ = nλ when more FA+ ions replaced MA+ ions.

The morphology of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 films as a function of the FA+ fraction ‘x’ was studied using FE-SEM. Fig. 2 shows the FE-SEM images of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 films prepared at various FA+ fractions (‘x’). The FAxMA1−xPbI3 films were very dense, and there were no voids or pinholes for all samples. The FA+ fraction exhibited an obvious effect on the grain size and the morphology of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 films. The grain size of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite films became larger as the FA+ fraction ‘x’ increased, particularly when most FA+ ions replaced MA+ ions. The average grain size for x = 0.8 and x = 1 was approximately 1.2 μm. The FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite films for x = 0.3 and x = 0.4 exhibited a much compact and smooth surface with the grain size of approximately 0.4 μm. The surface morphology of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 films affected the connection between the perovskite absorption layer and carbon electrode. Fig. 2(h) also shows the cross-section image of a complete perovskite solar cell. It presents the compact TiO2 layer, the mesoporous TiO2 layer, the FAxMA1−xPbI3 layer and the carbon electrode layer of the perovskite solar cell; their thicknesses were about 50 nm, 500 nm, 300 nm and 600 nm, respectively. The perovskite layer having 300 nm thickness could absorb sunlight and produce enough electron–hole pairs effectively.

The optical properties of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 films were studied using a UV-vis spectrophotometer at room temperature in the wavelength range of 300–900 nm. Fig. 3(a) shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 films for x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1. The absorption spectra show strong dependence on composition ‘x’. It is obviously seen from the absorption spectra that the absorption edge gradually shifts towards a longer wavelength and the absorption range widens as the value of ‘x’ increases from 0.1 to 1. The optical band gap of FAPbI3 (1.43 eV) was smaller than that of MAPbI3 (1.55 eV). Therefore, when more FA+ ions replaced MA+ ions, the absorption edge of FAxMA1−xPbI3 gradually shifted towards the longer wavelength. Fig. 3(b) provides the enlarged area around the absorption edge of the perovskite FAxMA1−xPbI3. The band edge position as a function of the FA+ fraction x is shown in Fig. 3(c). The band gap of FAxMA1−xPbI3 decreased from 1.58 eV to 1.49 eV when the FA+ fraction x increased from 0.1 to 1. The tunable band gap of FAxMA1−xPbI3 probably has better PCE than the observation for MAPbI3 due to its wide light absorption range.


Fig. 4 shows the room-temperature steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 films under 325 nm light excitation. A strong PL emission peak was clearly observed, which corresponded to the characteristic band-edge emission of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 films. When the FA+ content, i.e., ‘x’ increased from 0.1 to 0.8, the PL emission peak of FAxMA1−xPbI3 gradually shifted from 765 nm to 802 nm. However, the PL emission peak of FAPbI3 was at 799 nm. The energy corresponding to the PL peak is listed in Table 1. This result was consistent with the result of absorption spectra in Fig. 3.

To identify the effects of the ‘x’ composition on the photovoltaic performance of FAxMA1−xPbI3-based HTM-free PSCs, a series of PSCs with a structure of FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/FAxMA1−xPbI3/carbon electrode were fabricated by adjusting the FA+ fraction ‘x’ to 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1. The deposition process parameters for the compact TiO2 layer, mesoporous TiO2 layer and carbon electrode were kept constant. The cross-sectional view SEM image of typical PSCs is shown in Fig. 2(h). Solar cells SC1, SC2, SC3, SC4, SC5, SC6 and SC7 corresponded to x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1. Fig. 5(a) provides the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves of these PSCs obtained by a reverse scan (RS) from open-circuit to short-circuit with a scan rate of 0.18 V s−1. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of the short-circuit current densities (Jsc), open-circuit voltages (Voc), fill factors (FF) and power conversion efficiencies (η) of these PSCs are listed in Table 1. Pure FAPbI3-based PSCs exhibited Voc of 0.74 V, Jsc of 10.90 mA cm−2, FF of 0.40 and PCE of 3.26%. All FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite solar cells exhibited a better performance than pure FAPbI3 PSCs. In particular, FA0.4MA0.6PbI3 PSCs exhibited an optimal photovoltaic performance, yielding short-circuit current density of 22.84 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage of 0.80 V, fill factor of 0.48, and power conversion efficiency of 8.77%. It can be seen that Jsc gradually increased with an increase in the FA+ component ‘x’ from 0.1 to 0.4. When the FA+ fraction was x = 0.4, FA0.4MA0.6PbI3 exhibited the highest Jsc value of 22.84 mA cm−2. Then, Jsc gradually decreased as the FA+ ratio increased from 0.4 to 1. FF and PCE showed the same trend as Jsc. Solar cells SC6 (x = 0.8) and SC7 (x = 1.0) showed much lower Jsc and PCE than the solar cell SC4 (x = 0.4) due to their inactive δ-phase perovskite at room temperature. The lower Jsc and PCE values for the solar cells SC1 (x = 0.1) and SC2 (x = 0.2) than those for the solar cell SC4 (x = 0.4) were due to PbI2 not being completely converted to perovskite, as seen from the XRD patterns in Fig. 1(a). Furthermore, the fill factor, FF, was correlated to the contact resistance at the interfaces of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite layer and carbon electrode. The improved fill factor was mainly ascribed to the perovskite layers fabricated at x = 0.3 and 0.4 having fine smoothness and coverage, yielding a smaller contact resistance at the perovskite/carbon interfaces. The increased short-circuit current densities (Jsc) and the fill factors (FF) were responsible for the enhanced power conversion efficiencies.


Fig. 5(b) shows the J−V curves of the FA0.4MA0.6PbI3 PSCs obtained from a forward scan (FS) and reverse scan (RS) with a scan rate of 0.18 V s−1. As compared to the reverse scanned J–V curve, the forward scanned J–V curve shows that the photocurrent decays initially and continuously, leading to decrease in FF and Voc. The J–V hysteresis for PSCs is a critical issue because it is related to the power conversion efficiency and stability. Therefore, it is necessary to analyse the causes and solutions of hysteresis in PSCs.
The hysteresis predominantly arises due to three possible reasons. (1) The charge trapping/detrapping in deep level defects is related to the hysteretic behaviour because the charge transport can be influenced by the filling and releasing of charges at the deep trap states. The deep trap states can be formed on a perovskite film, the interface of TiO2/FAxMA1−xPbI3 and FAxMA1−xPbI3/carbon, a surface or a grain boundary. (2) Ion migration plays a critical role in generating hysteresis. Because of the low formation energy, there are many cation and anion vacancies in perovskite films, and the ion migration under the action of electric field will be dominated by vacancies. The organic FA+ and MA+ cations, Pb2+ cation and iodide anion are taken into consideration. (3) The equivalent chemical capacitance at the interface of TiO2/FAxMA1−xPbI3 and FAxMA1−xPbI3/carbon plays a more important role in hysteresis. As can be seen from the results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, PSCs possess capacitance and charge transfer resistance at the interface of TiO2/FAxMA1−xPbI3 and FAxMA1−xPbI3/carbon. RS is related to the charging process of a capacitor and FS is related to the discharging process. Therefore, the capacitive current is responsible for hysteresis. Nevertheless, the origin of the J–V hysteresis needs to be further clarified.
In PSCs, the perovskite layer not only plays a role in light absorption, but also serves as a medium for charge transport; this is directly dependent on the quality of the perovskite layer and has an important influence on the performance of the PSCs. The interfacial charge transport properties of PSCs were studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 6 shows the Nyquist plots of solar cells SC2, SC3 and SC4. Theoretically speaking, two semicircles should be observed in the Nyquist plots for the carbon-based hole conductor-free PSCs. However, only one semicircle was observed in the Nyquist plots for solar cells SC2, SC3 and SC4. The observed semicircle was ascribed to the charge transfer process occurring at the perovskite/carbon interface. The charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/perovskite interface was too small to be detected due to the fast electron injection, significantly large contact area and better interface contact. The equivalent circuit of the simplified transmission line is shown in the inset of Fig. 6, where Rs is the series resistance, Rct is the charge transfer resistance at the perovskite/carbon interface, and CPE is the cell capacitance. The impedance spectra were fitted to the equivalent circuit using the Z-view software. The values of the series resistance, Rs, were 43.1 Ω, 56.1 Ω and 42.5 Ω for solar cells SC2 (x = 0.2), SC3 (x = 0.3) and SC4 (x = 0.4), respectively. At the same time, the Rct values were 379.8 kΩ, 294.9 kΩ and 88.1 kΩ for solar cells SC2, SC3 and SC4, respectively. The solar cell SC4 exhibited the lowest series resistance, Rs, and charge transfer resistance, Rct, which indicated that the solar cell SC4 has the best contact at the perovskite/carbon interface. Therefore, SC4 has the highest current density and fill factor, resulting in an optimal photovoltaic performance.

The perovskite solar cell has been proven to be one of the particularly promising third-generation solar cells due to its low cost and high power conversion efficiency. However, the poor environmental stability of PSCs hinders their industrial commercialization. The instability is caused by internal factors such as ion migration, electro-migration and interfacial reaction as well as external factors such as moisture, oxygen, temperature and UV light. One key factor is the decomposition of perovskite after exposure to moisture. In this work, although the perovskite FAxMA1−xPbI3 layers were prepared in ambient air, the stability of the perovskite layers as well as the device improved via two aspects. One is that the anti-solvent ethyl acetate was introduced to control the crystallization of perovskite. The other is that paraffin was used to seal the device from moisture. Fig. 7 shows the power conversion efficiency degradation curves for FAxMA1−xPbI3-based PSCs in ambient air. For the PSCs prepared at x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4, the efficiencies of the device retained 42.5%, 63.7%, 67.3% and 75.8% of its initial efficiency, respectively, after exposure to ambient air conditions for over 670 h. The efficiency degradation gradually slowed down with an increase in the FA+ fraction x. The results indicated that the stability of the devices incorporating formamidinium may be significantly improved. In order to develop long-term stable perovskite solar cells with commercial viability, future research must focus on improving the intrinsic stability of the perovskite absorber layer, carefully designing the device geometry, and finding durable encapsulation materials that can seal the device from moisture.


In summary, the mixed-organic-action FAxMA1−xPbI3 films and PSCs with a structure of FTO glass/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/FAxMA1−xPbI3/carbon electrode were prepared in ambient air. An easy anti-solvent ethyl acetate technique was introduced while fabricating the FAxMA1−xPbI3 films to improve the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite films. The FA+ fraction ‘x’ strongly affected not only the structure and optical properties of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 films, but also the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. The photovoltaic active pure-phase FAxMA1−xPbI3 films were formed when the FA+ fraction x was less than or equal to 0.6. However, the photovoltaic inactive δ-phase FAPbI3 was formed in the presence of high contents of FA+ (x = 0.8 and 1.0). The band gap of FAxMA1−xPbI3 decreased from 1.58 eV to 1.49 eV when the FA+ fraction x increased from 0.1 to 1. As a result, the PSCs based on FA0.4MA0.6PbI3 exhibited an optimal photovoltaic performance, yielding Voc of 0.8 V, Jsc of 22.84 mA cm−2, FF of 0.48 and PCE of 8.77%. Our results demonstrate that the mixed-organic-cation FAxMA1−xPbI3 can be a good active layer material for perovskite solar cells.
