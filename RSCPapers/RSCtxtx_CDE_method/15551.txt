A series of random terpolymers with donor–acceptor–donor–acceptor molecular configuration, comprising fluorinated benzotriazole (FTAZ) and thienothiophene-capped diketopyrrolopyrrole (TTDPP) as the first and second electron-accepting moieties and thienyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDTT) as the electron-donating unit, are designed for polymer solar cells. By tuning the ratio of TTDPP and FTAZ, the optoelectronic properties of the terpolymers are systematically varied. All materials exhibit a broad absorption window spanning from 300 to 900 nm, illustrating the success of the terpolymer approach. Fullerene-based polymer solar cells fabricated from the terpolymer with the highest content of TTDPP afford a power conversion efficiency of 5.7%, with a short-circuit current density of 15.2 mA cm−2. On the other hand, solar cell devices composed of the terpolymer with the lowest content of TTDPP and the narrow gap non-fullerene acceptor IEICO-4F exhibit a higher efficiency of 6.3%, with an enhanced short-circuit current density of 17.5 mA cm−2, as a result of a better complementarity in the absorption of the donor and acceptor materials and well-balanced charge carrier mobilities. This efficiency represents the best value for fullerene-free polymer solar cells based on DPP-containing polymers to date.

In the field of renewable energy, solar cells are obviously very attractive because of their direct and clean conversion of solar light to electrical energy. Among the various solar cell technologies, polymer-based solar cells (PSCs) show advantages in terms of aesthetics, mechanical flexibility, power-to-mass ratio, and sensitivity for diffuse light. Moreover, they can be fabricated using convenient and easily scalable solution-processing methods like roll-to-roll printing and the optoelectronic device properties can readily be fine-tuned via molecular design of the photoactive polymer materials.

Since the first report of a bilayer solar cell in 1986, organic solar cells have witnessed continuous development. Through the use of advanced electron donor polymers with broad absorption spectra, suitable energy levels, and adequate charge transport properties in combination with fullerenes or alternative electron acceptor materials in bulk heterojunction blends, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching 14 to 17% have been achieved for single and multi-junction devices, respectively. Nowadays, the development of electron donor polymers mainly focuses on the alternating donor–acceptor (D–A) or ‘push–pull’ motif. Over the past few years, a variety of D–A alternating copolymers have been developed and optimized for their application in PSCs, and relations between their structures, active layer blend morphologies and device performances were investigated. Many D–A type low bandgap copolymers show strong absorption above 600 nm, but weaker absorption between 400 and 600 nm, due to strong intermolecular charge transfer between the donor and acceptor subunits. This limits the number of absorbed photons in the visible range, which is only partly solved by the methanofullerene acceptors generally used, resulting in non-optimal photocurrents.
A promising approach towards ‘ideal’ low bandgap copolymers is the random terpolymerization strategy, wherein three different monomers are used to (i) extend the absorption window, which is beneficial for photon harvesting, (ii) tune the molecular energy levels by controlling the monomer composition, and (iii) control the molecular packing and crystallinity of the resulting copolymers by proper choice of the comonomers. We have recently reported terpolymers consisting of thiophene as a donor and fluorinated quinoxaline and isoindigo as acceptor moieties, which showed broad absorption spectra, morphological compatibility with fullerene derivatives, and higher performances than the regular D–A alternating copolymers. We have also demonstrated that, compared to ternary blends, a broad spectral coverage could be realized without creating additional compatibility issues between the individual materials.
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) is one of the more attractive acceptor building blocks, widely used in both D–A alternating copolymers and terpolymers because of its high extinction coefficient, strong electron-withdrawing power, and molecular planarity. The strong absorption of DPP-based alternating copolymers in the wavelength region from 500 to 900 nm and a rather weak absorption in the range from 350 to 500 nm enable to identify high bandgap polymers with complementary absorptions towards the design of terpolymer systems with better overall coverage of the solar spectrum. So far, thiophene-capped DPP (TDPP) and pyridine-capped DPP (PyDPP) have been used in combination with other acceptors for terpolymer systems, and PSCs based on these materials have demonstrated PCEs over 7%. Even though already utilized in regular D–A alternating copolymers, thienothiophene-capped DPP (TTDPP) has received little attention. Since TTDPP-based alternating copolymers have weak absorption in the short wavelength region, acceptors with complementary absorption are interesting partners in a terpolymer approach. In previous studies, we demonstrated that high bandgap copolymers containing a fluorinated benzotriazole (FTAZ) moiety possess a strong absorption in the wavelength range of 400 to 650 nm. Besides, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) has been one of the most widely used electron-donating building blocks due to its rigid and planar conjugated structure. Considering the above-mentioned advantages, we envisaged that a combination of TTDPP and FTAZ with BDT in a terpolymer backbone could be attractive for PSC applications.
On the electron acceptor side, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have rapidly become the materials of choice. These NFAs have several advantages over fullerene acceptors, including their more convenient synthesis methods, lower cost, and adjustable absorption and molecular energy levels. PCEs of 11–14% were achieved in fullerene-free PSCs through rational design of NFAs and donor polymers and tuning the morphologies of the photoactive layers. It was found that cascaded energy level alignments and complementary absorption between the donor and NFA are imperative to achieve a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current density (Jsc), and consequently a high PCE. High bandgap polymers which have complementary absorption with NFAs such as ITIC in the wavelength region of 300–800 nm have been widely utilized in fullerene-free PSCs. Low bandgap materials such as DPP-based polymers have also been used as donors in combination with ITIC. The performances and energy losses of fullerene-free PSCs made from DPP-based low bandgap donor polymers and NFAs are summarized Table S1 and Fig. S3 (ESI). However, these fullerene-free PSCs gave only PCEs up to 4.1% due to their low Jsc values and fill factors (FFs). Thus, new DPP-based donor polymers with complementary absorption spectra to NFAs are required to achieve high Jsc values and PCEs.
In this paper, we report the synthesis, characterization, and solar cell performances of three random terpolymers P1–P3 with D–A1–D–A2 molecular configuration (Scheme 1), wherein FTAZ (A1) and TTDPP (A2) are used as the first and second electron-accepting moieties and thienyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDTT) as the electron-donating (D) unit. The absorptions and energy levels are tuned by varying the contents of the FTAZ and TTDPP units. Fullerene-based PSCs containing P1 and PC71BM show a PCE of 5.7%. Fullerene-free PSCs are also fabricated using the narrow gap NFA IEICO-4F. A higher PCE of 6.3% is obtained for the fullerene-free PSCs based on P3 due to complementary absorption between the donor polymer and IEICO-4F. This is the highest efficiency obtained so far for fullerene-free PSCs based on DPP-type donor polymers.


Scheme 1 shows the synthesis of the random terpolymers P1–P3. The terpolymerization was accomplished via Stille cross-coupling of BDTT, FTAZ and TTDPP (see ESI for synthetic details). Three different FTAZ:TTDPP ratios were used to investigate the effect of the acceptor ratio on the optoelectronic properties and the performances of the PSCs. The polymers could be readily dissolved in THF, chloroform, chlorobenzene (CB), and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). The molar masses, dispersities, optical, and electrochemical properties are summarized in Table 1.

The thermal properties of the polymers were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). All terpolymers showed excellent thermal stability (with respect to mass loss) with decomposition onset temperatures above 420 °C (Fig. S1, ESI). Further analysis by DSC did not show any discernible transitions (i.e., no clear glass transitions and/or melting behaviour) between −90 and 420 °C, the upper limit of thermal stability.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of polymers P1–P3 as thin films and in chloroform solution are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. S2 (ESI), respectively. All copolymers show absorption bands around 300–600 nm, which can be ascribed to π–π* transitions of the polymer backbones, and around 650–900 nm, which can be attributed to intramolecular charge transfer from the BDTT to the FTAZ and TTDPP units. As anticipated, the absorption in the long wavelength range was stronger when the content of TTDPP increased (P1), while the strongest visible absorption was observed for the material with the largest FTAZ ratio (P3) because of its weaker electron-accepting character. As a result, strong and broad absorptions ranging from 300–850 nm were seen in all cases, which are beneficial for photocurrent generation in the resulting PSCs. Compared to their absorption in solution, all terpolymer thin films exhibited slightly broader absorption profiles because of interchain aggregation in the solid state. The optical gaps (Eopg) for P1, P2, and P3, as calculated from the absorption edges of the thin film spectra, are 1.43, 1.46, and 1.54 eV, respectively (Table 1). The absorption spectra of the pristine polymer films were also compared with those of the terpolymer:fullerene blend films (Fig. 1b).
To get additional information on the molecular stacking of the terpolymers, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on pure terpolymer films spin-coated on Si wafers from o-DCB solution (Fig. 2). Terpolymer P2 showed a distinct diffraction peak in the small angle region at 4.3°, which indicates the formation of an ordered structure with a packing distance of 2.05 nm. In contrast, there is only a weak diffraction peak for P1 and P3 in the small angle region, indicating a less crystalline nature. The diffraction peak at 2θ = 24.3° for all terpolymers points to π–π stacking of the conjugated polymer backbones with a distance of 0.37 nm, indicating intermolecular interaction between the terpolymer backbones.
The electrochemical properties of the random terpolymers were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), providing information on the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of P1, P2, and P3 as determined from the oxidation and reduction onsets, respectively, are −5.28/−3.60, −5.20/−3.57, and −5.27/−3.51 eV (Fig. 3a and Table 1). Whereas the HOMO levels are mainly determined by the electron donating thienyl-substituted BDT units, the LUMO levels are largely controlled by the acceptor segments. The highest LUMO value of −3.51 eV was observed for P3, which contains the smallest amount of the strong TTDPP acceptor. The reasonably large offsets between the LUMO energy levels of the terpolymers and either PC71BM or IEICO-4F indicate that charge transfer from the terpolymers to the electron acceptor materials can be effective (Fig. 3b).

To explore the effect of the changing FTAZ/TTDPP ratio in the terpolymers on the photovoltaic properties, fullerene-based PSCs were fabricated and evaluated using the conventional device configuration glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/terpolymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The PSC devices were first optimized by varying the terpolymer:PC71BM weight ratios, photoactive layer thicknesses, and solvent additives (Tables S3–S5, ESI). The J–V curves of the best devices are shown in Fig. 4a and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. By increasing the TTDPP content (P3→P1), the Jsc notably increased. The highest Jsc was obtained for the P1:PC71BM-based devices. Hence, PSCs based on P1 showed the highest PCE of 5.7%, with an average efficiency of 5.6% over 8 devices. The photocurrent of the P1-based device could be further enhanced by adding 1% of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a processing additive. However, this was accompanied by a drop in Voc and FF and thereby the overall PCE (5.6%) (Table 2). The P2-based devices showed a lower maximum efficiency of 3.2%. In this case, the performance was enhanced to 5.5% upon the addition of 3% DIO. The best PCE obtained from PSCs based on P3, the polymer with the highest content of FTAZ, was 5.0%. All devices gave rather low Voc's (<0.70 V) because of the high-lying HOMO energy levels of the terpolymers and the low-lying LUMO of PC71BM. As a result, the minimum energy a strongly absorbed photon loses in its conversion process to an electron in the external circuit is a large value of ca. 1.0 eV. This energy loss (Eloss) is determined as outlined in Fig. S4 (ESI) and is listed in Table 2 for all polymer:PC71BM blends.

The trends in Jsc were confirmed by external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements (Fig. 4b). With increasing TTDPP content, EQE responses extending to longer wavelengths were observed, similar to the trends in the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 1a). The devices based on P1 showed a wide EQE response with a maximum of 64%. The currents extracted from the integrated EQE spectra matched reasonably well (less than 5% error) with those determined from the J–V measurements (Table S4, ESI).
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the influence of DIO on the topographical morphology of the P1–P3:PC71BM blend films (Fig. S5, ESI). The root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of the P1:PC71BM blend film without DIO was 0.8 nm. After addition of 1% DIO, this slightly increased to 1.2 nm. More interestingly, a comparison of the AFM images at higher magnification (Fig. 5) indicates a more pronounced formation of nanofibrils, which is expected to contribute to the improvement of the Jsc, but concurrently to a reduction of the Voc. Also for the P2- and P3-based films, addition of DIO yields the formation of fibrillar structures, but less clear than observed for the P1-based film. This suggests that more distinct phase separation between the polymers and fullerene leads to improved free carrier generation, charge transport and collection to provide a better Jsc and FF. Consequently, the PCEs of the P2-based devices increased from 3.2 to 5.5% and from 3.7 to 5% for P3. However, the Voc values of the terpolymer-based devices were reduced by ∼0.02 V in the presence of DIO. This can be attributed to the fact that there are more ordered polymer and fullerene domains in the active layer after adding the processing additives.
To further elucidate the effects of the different compositions on the photovoltaic performances, the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of the photoactive layers were determined by the field independent space charge limited current (SCLC) method using hole-only devices with configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and electron-only devices with configuration ITO/ZnO/active layer/Ca/Al. The SCLC could be estimated using the Mott–Gurney equation (eqn (S3), ESI). The J–V curves and SCLC fits are depicted in Fig. S7 (ESI) and the SCLC mobilities are summarized in Table 3. Relatively high μh and μe values were observed for the P1:PC71BM blend. However, the addition of 1% DIO creates an imbalance between μh and μe, which has a negative effect on the FF, which dropped from 0.60 to 0.57. This obviously has a direct impact on the PCE (Table 2). In contrast, the P2:PC71BM and P3:PC71BM blends showed enhanced and more balanced hole and electron mobilities upon the addition of 3% DIO, which is consistent with the upward trend in Jsc and FF, as well as the final PCE (Table 2).

To further widen the absorption of the active layer up to the near-infrared (NIR), fullerene-free PSCs were fabricated by combining the terpolymers and IEICO-4F. This narrow gap non-fullerene acceptor was chosen because of its absorption window from 600 to 1000 nm. As shown in Fig. 1a, the terpolymers and IEICO-4F show complementary absorption covering the entire visible range up to the NIR, which is beneficial for a high photocurrent. The P3:IEICO-4F blends demonstrated stronger and broader absorption in the visible and NIR as compared to the other blends (Fig. 1c).

Inverted fullerene-free PSCs were fabricated with device configuration glass/ITO/ZnO/terpolymer:IEICO-4F/MoO3/Ag. The devices were optimized by varying the terpolymer:IEICO-4F weight ratios, photoactive layer thicknesses and solvent additives (Tables S6–S8, ESI). Fig. 6a and Table 4 depict the J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters of the best devices. The performances of the devices decreased with increasing TTDPP content (P3→P1), unlike those of the fullerene-based PSCs. Better performances were achieved using 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as an additive. The optimized fullerene-free devices based on the P1:IEICO-4F blend processed with 0.5% CN exhibited a PCE of 5.2% with a Jsc of 16.1 mA cm−2, while the P2:IEICO-4F blend gave a PCE of 5.5% with a Jsc of 15.7 mA cm−2. A maximum PCE of 6.3% with a high Jsc of 17.6 mA cm−2 was recorded from the P3:IEICO-4F active layer, which is the highest PCE obtained so far for fullerene-free PSCs based on DPP-type donor polymers. The high Jsc of the P3-based fullerene-free device can be attributed to the complementary absorption, as confirmed by the EQE spectra (Fig. 6b). All fullerene-free PSCs devices showed two distinct spectral contributions to the EQE, one from the terpolymers up to 865 nm and another from IEICO-4F in the NIR, which is consistent with the absorption spectra of the blend films (Fig. 1c). This further confirms that both the donor polymer and the acceptor contribute to the photocurrent. The EQEs of all blends extended up to ∼1000 nm. The EQE of the P3:IEICO-4F blend is higher, which indicates efficient photon harvesting and charge collection within the P3:IEICO-4F devices, in agreement with its higher Jsc. The currents calculated from the integrated EQE spectra are consistent with less than 5% error of those determined from the J–V measurements (Table S8, ESI).

By replacing PC71BM with IEICO-4F as electron acceptor, the absorption window is effectively extended to longer wavelengths. This does, however, not go at the cost of a reduced Voc, which remains almost unaltered when replacing PC71BM by IEICO-4F, since both materials have similar LUMO energy levels. Indeed, the minimum energy lost per strongly absorbed photon, listed in Table 4, decreases by about 0.2 eV as compared to the PC71BM case, while peak EQE values remain in the 60% range. In contrast to previous reports, we thus do not observe a correlation between Eloss, which provides a measure of the driving force for electron transfer, and the peak EQE values, which are measures of the free charge carrier generation yield.
To study the charge transport properties of the blends, the hole and electron mobilities were measured by the SCLC method and the results are summarized in Table 3 and Fig. S8 (ESI). All blends again revealed balanced hole and electron mobilities, which reduces bimolecular recombination and maximizes the photocurrent and FF of the PSCs. Among the fullerene-free devices, the P3:IEICO-4F active layer showed both the highest hole and electron mobilities, which contributes to the high Jsc. However, compared to the fullerene-based PSCs, the hole and electron mobilities are somewhat lower and less balanced (Table 3), which can explain the lower FF.
The morphologies of the terpolymer:IEICO-4F blends, with and without 0.5% CN, were investigated by AFM (Fig. S5, ESI). When the CN additive was added to the blends, the surfaces became smoother. Probably more relevant towards a better understanding of the reported photovoltaic properties is the observation of a more pronounced nanoscale phase separation, here more granular in nature compared to the fibrillar structures for the fullerene based devices, as visualized in Fig. 7 for the PSCs based on P1.
Although the obtained solar cell efficiencies are the best achieved so far for DPP-based donor polymers in combination with non-fullerene acceptors (Table S1, ESI), they are still considerably lower than what has been obtained for the state of the art combinations. A few reasons can be formulated by comparing Voc, Jsc and FF values. In our case, the Voc values are inherently limited due to the use of rather high-HOMO donor polymers and the relatively low-LUMO IEICO-4F acceptor. This combination was chosen for its attractive complementarity in terms of absorption rather than aiming for high Voc's. With respect to the Jsc and FF, the comparison is less straightforward. The imbalance in terms of hole and electron mobilities is partly responsible for the reduced values. On the other hand, it is known that only a limited amount of low bandgap donor polymers tend to afford high efficiencies in combination with non-fullerene acceptors (i.e. PTB-7, PBDB-T and very related structures). The rationale behind this is poorly understood, but it has been attributed to the specific aggregation features of these polymers, confining the nucleation and growth of the non-fullerene acceptor molecules and thereby resulting in phases with high purity and optimized morphology. So far, DPP-based polymers do not seem to be able to afford similar optimum morphologies.

Three new poly(BDTT-FTAZ-TTDPP) terpolymers were successfully synthesized using the Stille polymerization technique by varying the molar ratios of the two acceptor moieties (TTDPP and FTAZ). The absorption spectra clearly demonstrated the effects of the varying amounts of each of the subunits. The TTDPP-rich polymer P1 exhibited a broader absorption range (300–900 nm) because of the stronger electron-accepting ability of TTDPP. The highest solar cell efficiency of 5.7% was also achieved for the P1:PC71BM blend due to a combination of improved light absorption and increased hole mobility. On the other hand, a higher PCE of 6.3% was achieved for the fullerene-free PSCs based on P3 and IEICO-4F, with a broad spectral photo-response from 300 to 1000 nm. The better performance of the P3:IEICO-4F-based devices can be attributed to the more complementary absorption spectra of P3 and IEICO-4F, a favourable blend morphology and balanced charge carrier transport. To the best of our knowledge, this efficiency of 6.3% is the highest value recorded to date for fullerene-free PSCs based on DPP-based donor polymers.
