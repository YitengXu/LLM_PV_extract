Long afterglow Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy phosphors were introduced into the TiO2 photoanode of CdS quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) as both a scattering and down converting layer, and the photovoltaic performances of the cells were investigated. The results show that the cell with Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy achieves a power conversion efficiency of 1.40%, which is an increase of 38% compared to the cell without Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy (1.02%). The performance improvement is attributed to enhanced light harvesting via improved light absorption and scattering processes. After a single sun illumination for 1 min and subsequent removal of the light source, the cell with Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy could be driven even in the dark by the long persistent light from Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy.

The sensitized solar cell (SSC) has attracted significant attention as a promising renewable energy device compared to the conventional silicon solar cell because of its low cost and relatively high conversion efficiency. The quantum dot-sensitized solar cell (QDSSC), an important member of SSC, has attracted considerable attention due to the high absorption coefficient and quantum confinement effect of quantum dots (QDs). The key element in QDSSC is its photoanode, which consists of highly porous wide band gap semiconductors, typically a TiO2 or ZnO network with sensitizers on their surface because efficient light harvesting by photoanode plays an important role in enhancing the performance of photovoltaic devices.

Conventionally, a second layer consisting of ZnO, TiO2 or ZrO in the form of large aggregates, spheres, porous beads or nanoplates are used on the top of the photoanodes as a light-scattering layer to localize the incident light within an electrode and enhance light absorption by increasing the optical path length. Recently, another attractive strategy to improve light harvesting was explored by introducing light-converting materials such as up-converting and down-converting materials. These materials could transform lower (higher) energy photons into high (low)-energy visible photons, which are easily absorbed by the sensitizer. In our previous work, a bifunctional structure consisting of long afterglow SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy phosphors on the top of the TiO2 layer was used in CdS QDSSCs, offering both light scattering and light down-converting properties. However, the emission peak of SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy is about 512 nm, which cannot be effectively absorbed by CdS QDs (2.4 eV). Therefore, the contribution of light down-conversion can not be fully utilized for enhancing cell efficiency. Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy is another widely used commercial long afterglow phosphor with a peak emission wavelength below 500 nm, which should be a more ideal down-converting material for CdS QDs.
In this work, we further studied the application of long afterglow Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy phosphors as efficient bifunctional structure layer in CdS QDSSCs. The cell with Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy shows a conversion efficiency of 1.40% under a single sun illumination, which is an increase of 38% compared with the cell without it (1.02%). There is a large improvement as compared to our previous work, which employed a SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy bifunctional layer (only an increase of 26.5%). Furthermore, because of the irradiation by the long persistent light from Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy, the cell with Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy can also be driven even if the light source is turned off after illumination.

The nanocrystalline TiO2 layer was prepared by screen printing of P25 (Degussa) with a mean size of 25 nm on the F-doped SnO2 (FTO) (resistivity: 14 Ω m−1, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan). Subsequently, the scattering layer of Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy phosphors (Jinan Xingyue LED Technology Co., Ltd) was deposited on the top of the TiO2 layer by screen printing. Then, as-prepared electrodes were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min.

Then, CdS QDs were deposited on the as-prepared electrodes by microwave-assisted chemical bath deposition (MACBD), as reported in our previous works. In brief, the electrodes were immersed in a sealed vessel with a CdS precursor aqueous solution (0.05 M Cd(NO3)2 and 0.05 M CH4N2S, Sinopharm Chemical Reagents Co., Ltd). Then, the vessel was placed into an automated focused microwave system (Explorer-48, CEM Co.) and treated with microwave irradiation having a power of 100 W at 150 °C for 30 min.
The QDSSCs were sealed in a sandwich structure with a 60 μm spacer (Surlyn) using a thin Pt counter electrode. The redox electrolyte was composed of 0.5 M Na2S, 2 M S, and 0.2 M KCl in a solvent mixture of 70% methanol and 30% water by volume. The active area of the cells was 0.2 cm2.
The morphological analysis of the electrodes were carried out by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, JEM-2100) to detect the elements in the samples. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed on an imaging photoelectron spectrometer (Axis Ultra, Kratos Analytical Ltd) with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. UV-vis diffuse reflection and absorption spectra of the electrodes were detected using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3900). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were examined using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon Fluoromax-4). The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curve was measured using a Keithley model 2440 Source Meter under the illumination of simulated AM1.5G solar light from a Newport solar simulator system (equipped with a 1 kW xenon arc lamp, Oriel). The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured as a function of wavelength ranging from 300 to 600 nm using an Oriel 300 W xenon arc lamp and a lock-in amplifier M 70104 (Oriel) under monochromatic illumination. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed using an electrochemical workstation (AUTOLAB PGSTAT302N) under 100 mW cm−2 illumination in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz–100 kHz, and the applied bias voltage and AC amplitude between the counter electrode and the working electrode were set at the open-circuit voltage of the cells and 10 mV, respectively.

The morphology and structure of the electrodes were characterized by FESEM, as depicted in Fig. 1. The pure P25 electrode consists of a random agglomeration of TiO2 particles, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. For P25/Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy electrode, the phosphor particles with a size range of 2–8 μm are distributed on the surface of the TiO2 film (Fig. 1b). Fig. 1c displays the FESEM image of the P25/Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy/CdS electrode. An clear difference in the surface morphology is observed compared with the P25/Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy electrode, indicating the successful attachment of the CdS QDs on the surface of the TiO2 film. The composition of the P25/Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy/CdS electrode was identified by EDS measurement, as shown in Fig. 1d. The quantitative analysis of the EDS spectrum reveals that the atomic ratio of Cd versus S is nearly 1, indicating that the deposited CdS QDs are likely to be stoichiometric. This result confirms that the CdS QDs were successfully assembled on the surface of the electrode via the MACBD process. To further investigate the atomic ratios of Cd and S, the surface chemical composition of P25/Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy/CdS electrode was characterized by XPS measurements. Fig. 2a shows the XPS survey spectra of P25/Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy/CdS, in which Ti, O, Cd, S, Sr and Al peaks are evident. Fig. 2b and c show the high resolution XPS spectra of the 3d orbital of Cd and 2p orbital of S, respectively. It can be calculated that Cd is 7.57% and S is 7.27% in the electrode, indicating that the deposited CdS QDs are almost stoichiometric, which further confirms the successful deposition of CdS QDs.


Fig. 3 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the P25, P25/CdS and P25/Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy/CdS electrodes. Compared with the absorption spectrum of the P25 electrode, there are clear absorption peaks near 500 nm for the P25/CdS and P25/Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy/CdS electrodes, which are attributed to the contribution from CdS QDs. It should be noticed that P25/CdS and P25/Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy/CdS electrodes have almost the same absorbance profile, indicating that the introduction of large Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy particles does not influence the amount of CdS deposited on the electrodes to a significant extent.
The UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra of P25 and P25/Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy electrodes were measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere, as shown in Fig. 4a. It is observed that the P25/Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy electrode has a higher light reflectance than the bare P25 electrode, which confirms that the additional Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy particles can improve the light scattering capability, especially in the visible light range, resulting in improved light harvesting.Fig. 4b shows the PL excitation and emission spectra of Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy phosphors. The excitation spectrum with a peak at 365 nm is assigned to the characteristic 4f7 → 4f65d1 transition of Eu2+. A broad emission spectrum with a peak at 490 nm is observed, which is typical for the 4f65d1 → 4f7 emission of Eu2+. The luminescence at 490 nm falls well in the absorption range of the CdS QDs. This indicates that Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy can be used as an effective light down-converting material to improve light harvesting for CdS QDSSCs. Under light excitation, Eu2+ is oxidized to Eu3+ and Dy3+ is reduced to Dy2+. Then, the thermal excitation of Dy2+ to Dy3+ occurs, followed by electron capture by Eu3+, and subsequently time-delayed Eu2+ emission occurs, resulting in a long afterglow. Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy exhibits a high quantum efficiency of 80.4%, obtained by the method described by Wang et al. After illumination, the strong light emitted by Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy can be easily observed by the naked eye and lasts for 8–10 hours. Such a long persistent light can be considered to drive solar cells in the dark, although its intensity still needs to be substantially improved.

Fig. 5 shows the EIS spectra of the cells with the P25/CdS and P25/Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy/CdS electrodes, while the inset depicts the corresponding equivalent circuit. The EIS spectra are characterized by the presence of two semicircles in a Nyquist plot. The high frequency semicircle is related to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the interface between the electrolyte and counter electrode. The larger semicircle at low frequency is due to the contribution from electron transport resistance (Rw) and interfacial capacitance at the interface between photoanode and electrolyte. The fitted Rw of the cell with P25/Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy/CdS electrode is lower than that of the cell with P25/CdS electrode, reflecting the acceleration of electron transfer in the photoanode. This result indicates a favourable electron transport and a reduction of electron recombination due to the introduction of Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy.
The J–V curves of QDSSCs with the P25/CdS and P25/Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy/CdS electrodes are shown in Fig. 6a. The open circuit potential (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and conversion efficiency (η) of all the cells are listed in Table 1. It can be observed that the Jsc and η have significantly increased from 7.38 mA cm−2 and 1.02% for the cell with the P25/CdS electrode to 10.0 mA cm−2 and 1.40% for the cell with the P25/Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy/CdS electrode. The IPCE spectra in Fig. 6b shows that the cell with the P25/Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy/CdS electrode exhibits a value of 53.2% at 365 nm, while for the cell with the P25/CdS electrode the value is only 49.6%. The improvement of IPCE at the wavelengths below 400 nm is mainly attributed to the light down-converting by Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy. From the PL excitation and emission spectra in Fig. 4a, it can be seen that Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy phosphors can absorb high energy photons and emit lower energy photons. The emitted 490 nm green light can be easily absorbed by the CdS QDs to generate the photo-induced electrons, leading to the obvious enhancement of IPCE at about 365 nm. The better absorption of the 490 nm light from Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy phosphors compared with the 512 nm light from SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy phosphors by CdS QDs enhances the light down conversion contribution for efficiency improvement. Therefore, a larger improvement in cell efficiency is achieved here compared with our previous work that employed a SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy bifunctional layer. From the diffuse reflectance spectra in Fig. 4b, the improved light scattering in the visible light range should contribute to the increase in IPCE at wavelengths above 400 nm with the introduction of Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy particles. Therefore, the introduction of Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy into the photoanode plays an important role in the improvement of cell performance by offering both light scattering and light down-converting properties.

Fig. 7 shows the photoimages of the P25/Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy electrode in room light and in the dark after a single sun illumination for 1 min. Because of the excellent long persistent property of Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy, after the sun illumination for 1 min, the P25/Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy electrode emits blue light in the dark. The performance of the cell with P25/Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy/CdS electrode was investigated by a source meter in the dark. The cell shows an Jsc of 0.55 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.19 V and η of 0.09%, which are higher than those of the cell with SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy used in our previous work (η of 0.04%). Although the value is low, this novel concept is worth exploring because it could provide the possibility of fulfilling the operation of solar cells in the dark if the performance of long afterglow phosphors can be further improved in the future.

In summary, the CdS QDSSCs with a long afterglow Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy phosphor on the top of the TiO2 layer achieved a conversion efficiency of 1.40% under one sun illumination, which is an increase of 38% compared with cell without Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy. The improvement in the efficiency is attributed to the enhanced light harvesting mainly via the light down-converting and the improved light scattering with the introduction of Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy. After the illumination of 100 mW cm−2 and the subsequent removal of the light source, the cell with Sr4Al14O25:Eu,Dy could still be driven by the long persistence of light even in the dark.
