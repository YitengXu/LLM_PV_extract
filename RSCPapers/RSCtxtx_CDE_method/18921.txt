Most of the currently available small molecule bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ OSCs) only utilize visible light and, to further increase the efficiency, the development of new organic materials that harvest near-infrared (NIR) light to produce an electric current is essential. Herein, a new A–π2–D–π1–D–π2–A type dimeric porphyrin-cored small molecule (CS-DP) is designed, synthesized and characterized. The use of CS-DP with a narrow bandgap (Eg) (1.22 eV) and the deep energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) affords the highest power conversion efficiency of 8.29% in BHJ OSCs with PC71BM as an acceptor, corresponding to a short circuit current of 15.19 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 0.796 V and a fill factor of 70% under AM 1.5G solar irradiation. The high device performance is attributed to the visible-near-infrared light-harvesting capability of CS-DP, and the super low energy loss feature. The energy loss (Eloss) lies between 0.43 and 0.51 eV in the system, which is related to the very small energy offset of the LUMOs between the CS-DP donor and PC71BM (ΔELUMO = 0.06 eV). The value of ΔELUMO, which is considered as a driving force for the photoinduced charge separation, is much smaller than the empirical threshold of 0.3 eV, but would not be a limiting factor in the charge separation process. The results indicate that there may be room for further improving the PCE for low bandgap dimeric porphyrin systems.

Solution-processed organic solar cells based on bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends have drawn much attention in recent years for electricity generation complimentary to silicon technologies. Impressively, small-molecule (SM) active materials have been rapidly developed for the least batch-to-batch variation in physical and optoelectronic properties, and the reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction small-area devices reaches 10%. Among them, porphyrins as one unique family have also been successfully demonstrated as active materials because of their superior light-harvesting capability in the visible region and freely tunable photophysical and photochemical properties by facile structural modification. We have developed a series of A–D–A structural molecules based on the meso-alkyl substituted porphyrin-core and obtained PCEs up to 8.21%. Meanwhile, Peng et al. developed porphyrin-diketopyrrolopyrrole molecules with efficiencies steadily increasing from 4.02% to 9.06% by morphological modification. Though porphyrin-based donor materials have demonstrated their enormous potential in photovoltaic applications with outstanding performance, porphyrin based materials have an important disadvantage of lacking light-harvesting ability beyond 850 nm, thus limiting their cell performances. Since 50% of the total solar photon flux is located in the red and near-infrared (NIR) spectra (600–1000 nm), it's quite urgent to develop efficient NIR absorbing molecules for high performance organic solar cells.

In the previous work, we showed that the ability of a monomeric A–D–A structural porphyrin donor to harvest light is significantly red-shifted in thin films because of strong π–π intermolecular interactions. Meanwhile, the devices based on the donor showed an efficient photocurrent response from 300–850 nm, indicating that there is yet plenty of space to further widen the light-harvesting region. The current status and limitations of SM organic solar cells (OSCs) motivate us to develop a new class of conjugated porphyrins to optimize light absorption and energy levels, with the focus on extending light absorption to the near infrared region, and developing highly efficient NIR OSCs. Definitely, the coupling of two porphyrin macrocycles through an ethynyl linker is a conventional method to obtain an essentially coplanar porphyrin molecule, which is an effective way to extend the absorption of a porphyrin toward the deep-absorption region. Furthermore, employing meso–meso linked porphyrin dimers can improve extinction coefficients regularly with the strong exciton coupling between two porphyrin moieties and decrease the π–π* gap concomitantly with the increased π-conjugation. This strategy is especially successful for obtaining highly efficient porphyrin-based dye sensitized solar cells with light harvesting in the NIR region. Besides, the donor–acceptor approach is of value in developing high performance organic solar cells.
To achieve better performances of SM OSCs based on porphyrin donors, we attempted to further improve the device performance based on the fusion of π-extended porphyrin with the following considerations: (1) extended π-electron conjugation systems with even stronger light-harvesting abilities both in the visible and the near-infrared region; (2) ample intermolecular interactions for efficient charge transfer, thus enhancing charge mobility; (3) well-defined and rigid molecular structures to ensure molecular ordered arrangement in the solid state; (4) flexible alkyl chains that can ensure a high level of solubility and suppress molecular aggregation. Herein, we strategically construct a new A–π2–D–π1–D–π2–A molecule (CS-DP in Scheme 1) with highly visible-NIR absorption, in which two porphyrin monomers are tethered via an ethynyl linker (π1), and ended with electron deficient 3-ethylrhodanine (A) via the second ethynylbenzene (π2) linker. Moreover, aliphatic side chain substituents can be readily introduced to the orthogonal position in porphyrins to manipulate material solubility and solid-state packing. The physical properties of CS-DP were investigated by various experimental methods, and its superior light-harvesting ability towards the near-infrared region led to a remarkable device performance with the highest efficiency of 8.29% in SM BHJ OSCs with a current density of 15.14 mA cm−2.

The synthetic route to CS-DP is shown in Scheme 1 and the details are provided in the ESI. The precursor 3 was “one-pot” synthesized sequentially through the triisopropylsilyl deprotection of 2 in tetrahydrofuran (THF), the coupling reaction with 1 in the presence of PdCl2(PPh3)2 and CuI. Then the Knoevenagel condensation of 3-ethylrhodanine with compound 3 afforded the targeting molecule CS-DP, which was carefully purified by thin-layer chromatography and Soxhlet extraction. For comparison, the A–D–A structural porphyrin monomer (MP) was also prepared according to our previous research. All the new compounds involved were characterized by standard spectral and analytical methods. Attached with peripheral branched alkyl chain substituents, CS-DP is readily soluble in common organic solvents such as CH2Cl2, CHCl3, THF and chlorobenzene at room temperature. The thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates the high thermal stability of MP and CS-DP (Fig. S2, ESI), which show a 5% weight loss at approximately 357 °C and 383 °C, respectively, under a nitrogen atmosphere. The results suggest that the dimeric porphyrin-cored small molecule should be appropriate as a donor material for solution-processing and thermal annealing treatment in device fabrication.


The absorption spectra of MP and CS-DP in CHCl3 and in films are shown in Fig. 1, and the data are collected in Table 1. The absorption spectrum of MP in dilute solution exhibits intense absorption bands at 472 nm, 502 nm and 696 nm with a high molar extinction coefficient of 1.64 × 10−5 cm−1, 1.95 × 10−5 cm−1 and 1.81 × 10−5 cm−1, respectively. As expected, the maximum absorption of CS-DP was significantly red-shifted to 791 nm in comparison to the monomer analogue MP, indicating a lower band gap of CS-DP due to the strong electron coupling and electronic delocalization of the dimeric porphyrin core tethered by ethynyl linkers. Compared to its absorption in solution, the thin film of CS-DP exhibits a significantly broadened and bathochromic absorption with the Q band extending to the NIR region over 1100 nm. Impressively, CS-DP with the A–π2–D–π1–D–π2–A configuration shows a red-shifted Q-band by 117 nm in thin films contrasting sharply with the A–π–D–π–A structural MP. The result indicates that the dimeric porphyrin centre is more favorable in self-assembly, leading to strong intermolecular π–π interactions. The optimal conditions for CS-DP/PC71BM film morphology engineering in device fabrication inspired us to study the absorption spectra of the blend films of CS-DP/PC71BM, processed at a 4:5 weight ratio in chlorobenzene (CB) under different conditions, including (a) pristine film, (b) pyridine additive, (c) pyridine additive and thermal annealing, and (d) pyridine additive, thermal annealing and solvent-vapor annealing (Fig. S3, ESI). Their absorption spectra are consistent with the spectra of the CS-DP film in the range from 400 to 1200, but show slight differences in Soret and Q bands, which are strongly correlated with the morphology of the blend films processed under different conditions. The pyridine additive can suppress self-aggregation through the π–π interaction of big planar porphyrin molecules in the film because of its coordination to the central zinc ion. As a result, the aggregation type of the blend film changed from J-aggregation without pyridine to H-aggregation with pyridine, leading to blue-shifted Soret and Q bands. Subsequent 110 °C thermal annealing (TA) would remove a large proportion of pyridine additive, and the J-aggregation becomes dominant in the blend film, corresponding to slight bathochromic shifts of both Soret and Q bands in comparison with the film with only the pyridine additive. In addition, the absorption peaks of the blend film after extra SVA remained essentially unchanged with a slightly lower absorption coefficient.

The electrochemical properties of CS-DP and MP in CH2Cl2 solution were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S4) and the data are listed in Table 1. The ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) values are 4.96 and 3.74 eV for CS-DP, and 5.16 and 3.70 eV for MP, respectively, which were calculated from the onset oxidation potential and the onset reduction potential of the redox curves. Generally, the molecular orbitals such as the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are energies of the individual molecule typically calculated in a vacuum, represent one electron wave functions and, thus, are not experimentally observable. So it is clear that the HOMO (LUMO) energy and IP (EA) can't be used interchangeably. On the other hand, the HOMO (LUMO) energy level can still be very useful for the understanding, and ultimately, the design of new materials for efficient OSCs. A measure of the HOMO and LUMO energies can be given by the oxidation and reduction potentials in solution, respectively, which is a relatively straightforward measurement. Therefore, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of CS-DP and MP were calculated to be −4.96/−3.74 eV and −5.16/−3.70 eV, respectively. In comparison with MP, CS-DP shows a higher HOMO energy level than MP, but a slightly lower LUMO energy level. As a result, CS-DP shows a much smaller bandgap of 1.22 eV than MP (1.46 eV), which is consistent with the optical bandgap of 1.26 eV for CS-DP and 1.55 eV for MP.

The solution-processed BHJ OSCs were fabricated utilizing CS-DP as the electron donor and PC71BM as the electron acceptor with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CS-DP:PC71BM/Ca/Al, and the device performance was measured under simulated solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) are shown in Fig. 2, and the photovoltaic performance parameters are listed in Table 2. The CS-DP/PC71BM mass ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:1.5 were first investigated, and the ratio of the CS-DP/PC71BM was optimized to be 4:5 (w/w, Fig. S1a and Table S1) with pyridine as an additive in chlorobenzene solution. In addition to the initial thermal annealing (TA), THF solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatment was further performed for the film and the best vapor annealing time was found to be 20 s (Fig. S1b and Table S2). The key parameters of photovoltaic performance are listed in Table 2. As the TA and the subsequent SVA have been demonstrated effective in optimizing the thin film morphology, CS-DP/PC71BM based devices showed a similar phenomenon with dramatically enhanced PCEs after the TA and SVA of the thin film. In detail, the as-cast devices gave an average PCE of 1.05%, with a VOC of 0.827 V, a short circuit current (JSC) of 3.84 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 33.1%. Using pyridine as an additive and then TA at 90 °C for 5 min, the PCE value increased to 3.35%, with a VOC of 0.835 V, a JSC of 9.50 mA cm−2, and a FF of 42.2%. And the PCE of the device was further enhanced to 5.86% after SVA of the active layer with THF, corresponding to a JSC of 12.61 mA cm−2 and a FF of 56.3%. It is clear that a synergetic combination of TA and SVA of the film can effectively improve the film morphology and enhance cell performances. In this study, TA at a suitable temperature of 110 °C and THF SVA for 20 s produced the best cell performance with a PCE of 8.23%, corresponding to a JSC of 15.14 mA cm−2, a FF of 69.8%, and a VOC of 0.781 V. The results are consistent with the appropriate thin-film morphology and the high charge carrier mobility of the CS-DP/PC71BM after the TA and THF SVA processes under the optimal conditions (vide infra). However, the TA treatment at a higher temperature of 130 °C led to a decreased PCE of 7.69% with a VOC of 0.765 V, a JSC of 14.75 mA cm−2 and a FF of 68.2%; and TA at 150 °C further lowered the PCE to 6.45%, with a VOC of 0.756 V, a JSC of 14.20 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 60.1%. For direct comparison, the key parameters of solar cells are plotted in Fig. 2aversus film processing conditions of the CS-DP/PC71BM active layer. Although CS-DP has a high lying HOMO energy level of −4.96 eV and a small band gap of −1.26 eV, all devices demonstrated high open circuit voltages (VOC) in a range of 0.75 to 0.83 V. Impressively, the energy losses were calculated to be in the range of 0.43–0.51 eV according to the formula Eloss = Eg − eVOC, in which Eg is the optical bandgap. The small energy loss (Eloss) in this system is related to the very small energy offset of the LUMOs between the CS-DP donor and PC71BM (ΔELUMO = 0.06 eV). The value of ΔELUMO, which is considered as a driving force for the photoinduced charge separation, is much smaller than the empirical threshold of 0.3 eV, but would not be a limiting factor in the charge separation process. For comparison, the champion device of MP is 7.70% with 13.32 mA cm−2, 0.91 V and 63.60% under additive and TA treatment. As compared to the photovoltaic performance of CS-DP based devices, MP shows an enhanced VOC value due to the higher EIP level, and the lower JSC value is ascribed to the narrow absorption spectra and inferior absorption coefficient.

The EQE was measured to explore the spectral response of the optimal devices. As shown in Fig. 2b, the EQEs match well with J–V measurements. The three prominent peaks at 350, 500 and 800 nm correspond to the absorption features of PC71BM, the Soret band and the Q band of CS-DP. It is clear that the CS-DP/PC71BM based devices can convert photons into electrons efficiently in the wavelength region of 300–900 nm, and a lower EQE tail extends to 950 nm, a deep NIR region. To gain insight into the effect of CS-DP incorporation on the exciton dissociation and carrier collection process of the solar cells, we determined the variation of the saturation photocurrent density (Jsat) and charge dissociation probabilities P(E,T) of the CS-DP:PC71BM devices under different treatment methods. The effective photocurrent density Jph (Jph = JL − JD), where JL and JD are the current densities of the devices under illumination and in the dark, respectively, was plotted as a function of effective voltage Veff (Veff = Vbi − Va), where Vbi is the voltage at Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage. Theoretically, Jph,sat was correlated with the maximum exciton generation rate after photons being absorbed. The Jph value of a device reaches a saturation value (Jph,sat) at high effective voltages (Veff > 2 V) which means that all the photo-generated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and an efficient carrier collection process occurs at the electrodes. As shown in Fig. 3, the Jph,sat values of CS-DP/PC71BM based devices vary under different conditions. The OPV cell with additive and TA treatment showed a higher Jph,sat compared to the pristine device, indicating that efficient exciton dissociation occurred between CS-DP and PC71BM, corresponding to the optimized morphology after additive and TA treatment. In addition, the charge collection probabilities P(E,T), which can be assessed by the Jph/Jph,sat ratios under short circuit conditions, are 51.9% and 87.5% based on the saturation photocurrents of CS-DP that are 13.485 mA cm−2 and 16.333 mA cm−2 for the pristine device and the device with additive and TA treatment, respectively. Devices processed by using only the pyridine additive without TA showed a reduced Jph–voltage relationship in the carrier-drifting region. This is because the transport of carriers is quite unbalanced and the build-up of space charges strongly limits photocurrent, and thus the correlated device fill factor is low.
The charge transport properties were further measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with a hole-only device which has a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CS-DP:PC71BM/MoO3/Al (Fig. S4). The sample without TA treatment exhibited a relatively high hole mobility of 7.75 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. After TA treatment, the hole-mobility significantly increased by two-fold to 1.40 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Therefore, the hole-mobility enhancement could be ascribed to increased crystal domains and well-ordered molecular arrangement after thermal annealing, leading to improved charge transport and power conversion efficiency.

Then the morphology of the BHJ thin films prepared under different processing conditions was investigated using tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). The CS-DP:PC71BM films were prepared by spin-coating under the same conditions as the active layers for the solar cell devices. Fig. 4 shows the height images of those blend films as-cast and after thermal and/or solvent annealing. For the pristine film, the whole surface of CS-DP is smooth and uniform with a small root-mean square (RMS) surface roughness of 1.0 nm. As shown in Fig. 4b–f, the films treated with pyridine, pyridine/TA (90 °C)/SVA, pyridine/TA(110 °C)/SVA, pyridine/TA (130 °C)/SVA, and pyridine/TA (150 °C)/SVA show a trend of sequentially increasing RMS values from 0.5, 0.6, and 0.8 to 2.2 nm, respectively. The topography analysis of the films indicates that TA at 110 °C and THF annealing can effectively optimize the surface to a moderate value of 0.8 nm, together with well-ordered and size-increased crystal domains, leading to efficient charge transport, and high JSC and FF. In contrast, the film after TA at 150 °C was observed with much larger domains and roughness, which are unfavourable for exciton diffusion/dissociation and balanced charge transport, leading to relatively lower values of JSC and FF.

Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) were performed to reveal the intrinsic structural order of components in BHJ thin films. As shown in Fig. 5a, CS-DP shows a quite pronounced packing mode in the as-cast film and a weak π–π stacking reflection peak in the in-plane (IP) direction (no additive, no SVA, and no TA), indicating a preferred edge-on crystal orientation. It should be noted that we observed a more complicated structure in the as-cast thin film, with a few diffusive Bragg rods in the in-plane direction. These features should come from the self-assembly of CS-DP molecules that forms a quite thin layer in donor domains. And these diffraction rods are correlated with molecular long axis packing and higher order reflection planes. A strong (100) diffraction peak was observed in the out-of-plane direction at around 0.36 A−1 (1.74 nm). And a sharp π–π stacking was obvious in the in-plane direction at 1.61 A−1 (0.39 nm). When the pyridine additive was used for solution processing, the crystalline nature of CS-DP became less prominent, as seen from both diffraction patterns and line-cuts. The film processed with the pyridine additive and TA@90 but no SVA shows a quite broad (100) diffraction at 0.31 A−1 in all azimuthal angles. Thus there is no preferred crystal orientation in this case. In addition, a broad diffraction from PC71BM was seen at 1.35 A−1, and no obvious π–π stacking at 1.61 A−1 could be found. The results indicate that the pyridine additive disturbed the close molecular packing of CS-DP. However this feature led to an increase in short circuit current but the fill factor remained low. Thus it is suspected that a refined phase separation was generated in the pyridine additive processed film. The donor and acceptor domains were of low purity, and the carrier transport was quite unbalanced, and thus a low device fill factor was produced. For the pyridine-SVA-TA@90 blend film, similar GIWAXS results were observed to those of the no SVA film. However, the (100) diffraction peak shifted to 0.34 A−1, and a narrower full-width-at-half-maximum was observed in comparison to that of the no SVA film. Obviously, the THF vapour in the system can drive CS-DP molecules to pack more tightly in the (100) crystal lattice, but there's still no strong π–π stacking peak which was observed in no additive blend films. The (100) coherence length in the in-plane direction was estimated to be 12.6 nm (12.2 nm in the no SVA sample). Increasing thermal annealing to 110 °C while maintaining the additive and SVA processing conditions led to thin films of similar structural order except for a further enhanced (100) crystal size (14.1 nm). A weak π–π diffraction peak can be seen from this sample in high-q regions, and therefore optimized thermal treatment is critical in molecular self-assembly. These diffraction features can be critical in enhancing device performances. Further TA at 150 °C led to an even larger (100) crystal size of 16.5 nm. Other structural parameters remained similar. The orientation of the donor molecule in BHJ blends under different processing conditions was evaluated by comparing the (100) scattering intensity in the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) directions. IOOP/IIP ratios show that as-cast blend samples without any treatment have the highest OOP molecular orientation, which is consistent with 2-D diffraction patterns as well, with the best edge-on orientation. For additive and SVA treated samples, thermal annealing at elevated temperatures slightly increases the edge-on orientation for CS-DP, with a IOOP/IIP value of 2.25 at 90 °C and 3.96 at 150 °C.
Phase separation of BHJ thin films was probed by RSoXS in transmission mode using 284.2 eV photon energy (Fig. 6). As seen from scattering profiles, no additive processed thin film showed a plateaued scattering peak at 0.004 A−1, corresponding to a distance of 157 nm. Such a large phase separation is not ideal for exciton generation and charge transport, and thus small JSC and power device PCE were recorded. The blend film processed with the pyridine additive and with no SVA but TA@90 showed much lower scattering intensities with a peak located at 0.025 A−1, corresponding to a distance of 25 nm. The reduced length scale of phase separation gave rise to an enhanced JSC in the solar cell device. The low scattering intensity indicated a weak extent of phase separation, and thus a poor device fill factor was recorded. Additive-SVA-TA@90 processing led to enhanced scattering features in the low q region, and a weak scattering peak was observed at 0.024 A−1 (26 nm). Thus SVA is more pronounced in generating larger size features in the blend thin film. Upon TA at 110 °C, the intensity of the RSoXS scattering profile dramatically increased with a well resolved peak at 0.018 A−1 (35 nm). Such a length scale can balance exciton generation and charge purer domains that are more suitable for charge transport. The more balanced transport for carriers gave rise to a high device fill factor, as seen from device studies. Thermal annealing at 150 °C shows similar RSoXS features to those of the TA@110 °C film with a slightly reduced length scale of phase separation. However, this condition led to a reduced device fill factor, which can result from device interfaces or vertical phase segregation issues, which could not be observed in current characterization methods.

In conclusion, we have first constructed a new A–π2–D–π1–D–π2–A dimeric porphyrin small molecule (CS-DP) with light absorption extending to 1100 nm. Notably, this is the first example of well-performed near infrared conjugated molecules that extend light absorption to the 700–1000 nm region. The new architecture and appropriate energy levels give rise to low energy loss features when CS-DP was used in BHJ solar cells. The synergetic combination of TA and SVA under the optimal conditions can effectively improve the charge mobility in solid-state thin films by either lowering the glass transition temperature or thermally enhancing molecular motion. Using the pyridine additive, TA at 110 °C and THF SVA for 20 s, the champion blend CS-DP/PC71BM thin film was produced with a maximum of the short circuit current as well as the fill factor, yielding a power conversion efficiency up to 8.29%. These aspects as well as the detailed reason of the low energy loss feature are currently under investigation in our lab and will be reported in due course. Specifically, this super small bandgap dimeric porphyrin is very promising for use in ternary and multi-junction applications as well as NIR photodetectors.
