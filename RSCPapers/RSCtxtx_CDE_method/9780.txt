All-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are regarded as a promising solution to improve the environmental tolerance of emerging photovoltaics; however, the narrow light response (<550 nm) of cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) perovskites markedly lowers their power conversion efficiency (PCE). We present here the proof-of-concept for mixed light harvester prepared from CsPbBr3 halide and an inorganic SnS:ZnS photoactive layer (PAL) to broaden the spectral absorption from 550 nm to 700 nm. Owing to the reduced surface defects on the perovskite film, improved charge extraction, and broadened light response, the all-inorganic PSC with the structure of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS:ZnS/NiOx/carbon delivered a short-circuit current density of 8.21 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 1.57 V, a fill factor of 79.6%, and a champion PCE as high as 10.26% under one sun illumination. The preliminary results also suggest that these devices are relatively stable under persistent conditions of 80% RH or temperature of 80 °C in air. The proof-of-concept for mixed perovskite/PAL absorber provides new opportunities for a wide-spectral response and therefore markedly increased the PCE outputs.

Inorganic cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) perovskite has attracted extensive interests for perovskite solar cell (PSC) applications due to its excellent stability under ambient atmospheres, remarkably high carrier mobility of ∼4500 cm2 V−1 s−1, and solution-processable preparation. In comparison with organic-inorganic hybrid or CsPb(I + Br)3-based all-inorganic PSCs, the CsPbBr3 solar cells feature excellent long-term stability under persistent moisture, heat or ultraviolet exposure. Over the last three years, all-inorganic PSCs using CsPbBr3 as the light harvester have demonstrated a rapid improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from an initial 5.95% to a maximum of 10.14% through interface modification, crystal boundary passivation, crystal phase purification, and compositional engineering. However, the large bandgap of CsPbBr3 at 2.3 eV leads to a narrow-spectral response within 550 nm, which significantly hinders further PCE and photocurrent improvements in corresponding all-inorganic PSCs. Therefore, a promising solution to this impasse is broadening the light absorption of these inorganic PSCs without sacrificing their environmental tolerances under high humidity, high temperature, and/or ultraviolet-resistance. Although the remarkably reduced bandgaps result in a wide-spectral response by substituting Br− with I− ions in CsPbIBr2, CsPbI2Br or CsPbI3, the long-term stability is significantly attenuated, particularly in moist air through crystal damage. Therefore, a new way of widening the photo-absorption of CsPbBr3-based inorganic PSCs is urgently required to meet the demands for multiple applications ranging from photovoltaic stations to specific-requirement fields.

Organic photoactive layers (PALs), also known as bulk-heterojunctions (BHJ), composed of conjugated small molecules and polymers have widespread applications in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) as light harvesting layers. The intimate contact between the donor and acceptor in PALs facilitates efficient charge generation and the formation of percolation paths for charge extraction to the carrier transport materials. The state-of-the-art PALs can utilize sunlight below 800 nm or even broaden light absorption to the near-infrared spectral region through the rational optimization of the donor/acceptor (D/A) molecular structure. Inspired by previous studies, the proof-of-concept PAL may be applicable to CsPbBr3-based PSCs to harvest solar light beyond 550 nm. However, state-of-the-art PAL materials such as ITIC and DOR3T-TBDT are extremely expensive and involve tedious preparation, which considerably hampers their commercialization in emerging photovoltaics. Another trouble is the poor temperature and/or ultraviolet-tolerance of these organic systems. Therefore, cost-effective, easily realizable and all-inorganic D/A groups (SnS, CuInS, etc.) become fascinating alternatives. An SnS-based solar cell was first made by Reddy et al. in 2006. Since then, many efforts have been devoted to developing efficient photovoltaics with SnS as a light harvester. In 2014, Sinsermsuksakul et al. improved the efficiency of the SnS-based solar cell to 4.36% using an ALD-Zn(O,S):N buffer layer. SnS is a typical p-type electron donor material, exhibiting several attractive properties, including suitable direct band gaps and a large absorption coefficient (α > 104 cm−1), while ZnS is an excellent candidate for a wide bandgap n-type electron acceptor. The conduction band (CB) of SnS is higher than that of ZnS; therefore, the drift of photo-generated electrons from SnS to ZnS dominates the collection in SnS:ZnS BHJ. Moreover, the valence band (VB) offset will generate a hole barrier to prevent the holes in SnS from moving to ZnS. Therefore, the combination of SnS and ZnS can effectively improve the separation of electron–hole pairs and broaden the light absorption range.
Herein, we propose a new method for making a mixed light-harvester for the first time from perovskite and inorganic PAL to realize wide-spectral absorption of all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs. A p–n type SnS:ZnS heterojunction was integrated with Tb3+-doped CsPbBr3 (CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3) for to obtain a mixed CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS:ZnS light-harvester. Unabsorbed light at λ > 550 nm was re-absorbed by the SnS:ZnS layer for further excitation. Similar to the OPV, the general operating mechanism for the all-inorganic SnS:ZnS PAL also involved light absorption, exciton generation and diffusion, exciton dissociation to carriers at the junction interface, and carrier transportation and collection. Arising from the wide-spectral absorption and enhanced hole extraction, the all-inorganic PSC achieved a champion PCE as high as 10.26%, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 8.21 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.57 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 79.6% under one sun illumination.

The all-inorganic PSC reported in this study is shown in Fig. 1a, having a layered structure of glass/FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS:ZnS/NiOx/carbon. p-type SnS and n-type ZnS were utilized for a scattered p–n heterojunction layer that was combined with CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3. Fig. 1b illustrates the cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a PSC device, presenting a layer-by-layer structure with 570 nm and 340 nm thickness for FTO and c-TiO2/m-TiO2, respectively. Notably, the CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3 layer has a thickness of 360 nm and vertical alignment; this extraordinary morphology contributed to the facile charge transport and reduced energy loss at grain boundaries. The perovskite layer is completely covered by a 130 nm-thick SnS:ZnS PAL, which suggests a well-defined multilayer structure for the inorganic PSC device that is free of pinholes.


Fig. 1c and e show the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of ZnS and SnS nanoparticles, suggesting highly crystalline structures with interplanar distances of 0.31 nm and 0.29 nm, which agree well with lattice diffraction of the (111) planes from sphalerite and the (101) planes of orthorhombic SnS, respectively. According to selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns in Fig. 2d and f, ZnS is structurally uniform and polycrystalline with three ring patterns indexed to (111), (220), and (311) planes, while SnS has a sharp set of polycrystalline diffraction rings indexed to (101), (201), (011), (211), (311), (102), and (121) planes. No impurities in the SnS and ZnS powders were observed by the HRTEM characterization and X-ray diffraction (XRD) in Fig. S3. This allowed for the efficient photoexcitation of the SnS:ZnS PAL and charge extraction in the corresponding PSC.

Fig. 2a shows the characteristic J–V curves of all-inorganic PSCs with configurations FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbBr3/NiOx/carbon, FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/NiOx/carbon, FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS/NiOx/carbon or FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS:ZnS/NiOx/carbon under a standard sun (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) illumination, and the photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 1. The pristine CsPbBr3-based PSC achieved a PCE of 7.29% (Voc = 1.40 V, Jsc = 6.84 mA cm−2, FF = 76.1%), and the PCE significantly improved to 9.06% using CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3 as the light harvester; other parameters also elevated. Using SnS and NiOx as mixed hole transport materials (HTMs), FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS/NiOx/carbon achieved a PCE of 9.44%, a Voc of 1.54 V, a Jsc of 7.78 mA cm−2, and a FF of 78.8%. Through integrating SnS:ZnS PAL into the solar cell, FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS:ZnS/NiOx/carbon exhibited higher performances than those of the FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS/NiOx/carbon or other inorganic PSCs due to a significantly increased Jsc output, yielding a champion PCE as high as 10.26% (Voc = 1.57 V, Jsc = 8.21 mA cm−2, FF = 79.6%). This efficiency is till now the highest PCE reported for CsPbBr3-based all-inorganic PSCs. Additionally, steady-state photocurrent output for characterizing the reliability of J–V measurements is provided in Fig. 2b, from which a steady-state current density of 7.69 mA cm−2 and cell efficiency of 10.18% for the optimized PSC can be determined. The small deviation between PCEs obtained from steady-state and dynamic-state characterizations may be attributed to the presence of hysteresis effects on scanning the devices.

Photo-induced electrons jump from VB of perovskite to its CB through the stimulation of photons. These electrons may flow to the electron-collecting layer or recombine with defects or holes in perovskite. Therefore, the limitation of charge recombination in perovskite is a prerequisite for enhanced photovoltaic performances. Rare earth (RE) elements have many unique intermediate energy levels, allowing for long charge carrier lifetimes. Thus, the intermediate energy levels from RE ions provide new routes for charge transfer in CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3 halide, i.e., the excited electrons will transfer from the CB of perovskite to the Tb3+ ion. Therefore, Tb3+ ions played the role of a temporary electron reservoir, which led to an increased local electron density, thereby increasing the Fermi levels of CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3. The elevated Fermi levels could be responsible for the enhanced Voc and PCE outputs.Fig. 2c shows the energy level distribution of various materials as well as charge-transfer processes in the FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS:ZnS/NiOx/carbon device. The energy levels for SnS and perovskite were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the VB spectrum using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) characteristics. According to the absorption measurements in Fig. S1b and S2c, the bandgaps for SnS and CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3 were determined to be 1.9 eV and 2.3 eV, respectively. SnS had a VB onset at 5.1 eV and 5.8 eV for CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3, yielding CB values for SnS and CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3 of 3.2 eV and 3.5 eV, respectively. The matching energy levels of FTO, c-TiO2/m-TiO2, CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS:ZnS, NiOx, and carbon electrode provided facile charge excitation and extraction pathways for high-performance all-inorganic PSCs. Perovskite is an ambipolar material with high electron/hole mobility. Upon stimulation by sunlight at λ > 550 nm, excitons dissociate to charge carriers at the p–n junction interface within the PAL film and the dissociated electron transport through the n-type semiconductor network to the perovskite layer. Moreover, the perovskite can also deliver electrons/holes after absorbing light below 550 nm. These photo-generated electrons from perovskite and PAL layer together flow to FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2, boosting the extraction of holes by the PAL and finally getting collected by the carbon back electrode.
Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was determined to cross-check the spectral response and photoelectric conversion performances, as shown in Fig. 2d. In comparison with state-of-the-art organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs, the pristine CsPbBr3 solar cell exhibited narrow light harvesting due to the large bandgap (2.3 eV) of CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3 halide. Over a wavelength region of 300–550 nm, the maximized IPCE value was ∼87% for the pristine CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3-based device, and it increased to 89% for the solar cell with CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS:ZnS mixed light-harvester. The enhanced IPCE was attributed to the reduction of surface defects and crystal boundary passivation. Notably, the all-inorganic CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS:ZnS PSC showed a photo-response up to 700 nm, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2d. The improved IPCE, expanded light absorption and boosting carrier extraction resulted in an increase in Jsc of the CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS:ZnS-based PSC. The large bandgap of CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3 perovskite contributed to a Voc output as high as 1.57 V, but the limited Jsc arising from the narrow light-response and low photoelectric conversion efficiency was the greatest burden for significantly improving PCEs. The most challenging solution was to broaden the spectral absorption from deep visible-light to near infrared light by material and/or structural innovation for the solar cell devices. The combination of perovskites with PAL was regarded as a promising method for wide-spectral all-inorganic PSCs with high Jsc, Voc, and PCE outputs. A major disadvantage for SnS:ZnS PAL was the low IPCE value in inorganic solar cells, although the light response was widened to nearly 700 nm. The photovoltaic performances of the inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs can possibly be drastically enhanced through the design of more advanced PALs with large absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility, matching energy structure, optimized charge-transportation pathways, etc.
The charge carrier dynamics of so-called wide-spectral inorganic PSCs was investigated to further understand the internal relation between charge transport and device efficiency. Fig. 3a and b plots the Jsc and Voc outputs from various PSC devices as a function of illumination intensity. According to Jsc ∝ Iα (α ≤ 1), where I is light intensity, α is an exponential factor, bimolecular recombination was expected to be ideally minimum for maximum carrier output at short circuit at α value close to 1.α values were measured to be 0.93 and 0.96 for PAL-free CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3- and CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS:ZnS-based PSCs, respectively. Additionally, the light ideality factor (n) was determined by Voc = nkTln(I)/q + constant according to Shockley–Read–Hall recombination mechanism, where k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, the temperature in Kelvin, and the elementary charge, respectively. It has been considered that trap-assisted recombination played a dominant role in determining the characteristics of devices at n ≈ 2. An n value as high as 1.77 was obtained for FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/NiOx/carbon PSC, and it reduced to 1.59 for the FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS:ZnS/NiOx/carbon device. By comparing α and n values, we can make a conclusion that the SnS:ZnS PAL also effectively suppressed charge recombination.
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra for FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbBr3, FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3, FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS, and FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS:ZnS were measured to explore the charge extraction ability of the perovskite at different interfaces. As shown in Fig. 3c, the PL peak intensity of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS film at 540 nm showed significant quenching compared with that of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbBr3 and FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3. This was associated with the reduction of surface defects in the perovskite film and improved carrier extraction at the perovskite/carrier transfer material interface. Notably, the FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS:ZnS film showed the maximum interfacial charge transfer because it had the maximum PL quenching among the three multilayer systems.Fig. 3d presents the time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra measured at an excitation wavelength of 530 nm. The carrier decay lifetime was calculated by the double-exponential decay function I = Ae−(t−t0)/τ1 + Be−(t−t0)/τ2, where I is the PL intensity at time t, A and B are constants, τ1 is the faster component for the exciton spontaneous radiative recombination time, and τ2 is the slower component of the pure dephasing time for nonradiative recombination, such as phonon scattering and Auger recombination losses. Arising from improved charge extraction at interfaces, the τ1 value increased from 1.14 ns for FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbBr3 to 3.41 ns, 4.03 ns, and 4.48 ns for FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3, FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS, and FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS:ZnS, respectively. A longer PL lifetime refers to a reduced charge recombination. Therefore, the SnS:ZnS layer promoted hole extraction from the perovskite, which was in good agreement with the dependence of Jsc and Voc on the illumination intensity.
The golden rule of designing advanced photovoltaics is to increase cell efficiency and bring down costs without sacrificing long-term stability. The successful realization of a wide-spectral response and PCE improvement to 10.26% demonstrated that the mixed perovskite/PAL light-harvester is a good candidate to further increase the PCE output of all-inorganic PSCs, while the absence of noble back-electrodes and organic HTMs significantly brings down fabrication costs. Improved stability is another necessity for promoting commercialization, for which the crystal structure of the perovskite should be stable at high humidity. Fig. 4a shows the photographs of CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3 film upon exposure to persistent humidification by 80% RH in air. The colour of perovskite shows no apparent changes even in such a high-humidity air atmosphere over 40 days. By comparing the photovoltaic data of unencapsulated PSCs, as shown in Fig. 4b, the normalized PCE, Jsc, Voc, and FF maintain 98% of their initial values after storage in 80% RH over 40 days. The hydrophobic carbon electrode protected the PSCs against moisture that destroys the stabilized perovskite structure, and the high UV-resistance of all-inorganic SnS:ZnS PAL and NiOx also contributed to the long-term stability. Even upon thermal exposure at 80 °C and zero humidity, as shown in Fig. 4c, all the normalized PCEs were almost unchanged over 14 days because of the relatively high decomposition temperature of CsPbBr3 (beyond 200 °C).

In summary, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept all-inorganic PAL to combine with a perovskite as a mixed light-harvester for wide-spectral all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs. The FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Tb0.03Br3/SnS:ZnS/NiOx/carbon device had a spectral-response to 700 nm and effective charge extraction, achieving a champion PCE of 10.26%, a Jsc of 8.21 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.57 V, and an FF of 79.6%. The improved efficiency was mainly attributed to an increase in Jsc resulting from a notable extension of the IPCE response, reduced surface defects in the perovskite film and boosted hole extraction at the perovskite/PAL interface. It can be predicted that higher Jsc and PCE is achieved by designing more efficient narrow-bandgap PALs to maximize light harvesting capacity and/or optimizing device structure to minimize the charge recombination. In addition, the all-inorganic PSC exhibited high stability upon persistent exposure to 80% humidity or temperature of 80 °C.
