A new π-conjugated electrolyte bis(dicyanomethylene)-quinacridone with two octyl-pyridium (DCNQA-PyBr) has been synthesized and employed as a solution-processed cathode interlayer (CIL) for polymer solar cells (PSCs). The devices exhibited simultaneously increased open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Overall, the PSCs with PCDTBT (poly[N-9′′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)]) as a donor and PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester) as an acceptor incorporating a 13 nm DCNQA-PyBr interlayer exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.96%, which is 1.3 times of that of the Al-only device. Most importantly, compared to the reference π-conjugated electrolyte QA-PyBr, DCNQA-PyBr shows much improved electron transport ability and conductivity. As a result, the DCNQA-PyBr based devices only show a slight decrease in electron transport upon increasing the thickness of the CIL, thus allowing a high PCE with a wide CIL thickness range from 5 nm to 40 nm. Furthermore, introducing DCNQA-PyBr as a CIL into the devices based on P3HT:PC61BM (P3HT = poly(3-hexylthiophene), PC61BM = [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester) and PTB7:PC71BM (PTB7 = polythieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-co-benzodithiophene) also leads to significantly enhanced device performance, showing high PCEs of 3.91% and 8.23%, respectively. These results confirm DCNQA-PyBr to be a promising CIL material for solution-processed large-area PSCs.

Bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) have drawn tremendous attention due to their unique advantages of low cost, light weight and potential opportunity of fabricating flexible devices by solution processing. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in rational donor/acceptor structural design, active layer morphology optimization and device interfacial engineering. Power conversion efficiencies (PCE) in excess of 10% have been achieved in single-junction PSCs. Alternatively, a great deal of efforts have been invested in solution-processed organic cathode interlayers (CILs) based on π-conjugated polymeric/small-molecular electrolytes. The conventional inorganic CIL materials such as Ca and LiF have already been widely used to achieve superior device efficiencies. However, they are unstable towards oxygen/moisture and are commonly formed by vacuum deposition, which is not suitable for the roll-to-roll process. On the other hand, organic CIL materials can be suitable for simpler device fabrication procedures, affording better device stability and remarkably improved device performance. Organic CIL materials are commonly composed of a π-conjugated skeleton and several polar groups such as pyridinium, ammonium, sulfonate, and phosphonate. These strong polar ionic groups impart them with good solubility in polar solvents, allowing the solution-processed deposition of water/alcohol solutions. More importantly, large interfacial dipoles can be formed between the CIL and the electrode thus efficiently reducing the cathode's work function and facilitating electron extraction and transport at the cathode. As a result, the organic CIL can promote the high-performance of PSCs due to simultaneously enhancing the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Up to now, a number of organic CIL materials have been developed with various π-conjugated skeletons, such as polyfluorene, polythiophene, porphyrin, metallophthalocyanine, quinacridoneetc. Although significantly improved performances have been achieved by incorporating CILs into PSCs, a disadvantage of these CIL materials has been realized, that is, the requirement of ultrathin thickness (commonly less than 10 nm). A thicker CIL leads to charge build-up at the cathode due to the poor electron transport abilities and conductivities of CIL materials, mainly due to the p-type nature of their π-conjugated backbones. Unfortunately, producing such ultrathin films with high coverage and film homogeneity has proven to be difficult by large-area roll-to-roll fabrication, which restricts their applicability in future large-area PSCs. Therefore, developing organic CIL materials with good electron transport ability and conductivity is now an urgent issue. In addition, CIL materials based on small molecules are more attractive compared to their polymeric competitors due to several advantages such as well-defined structures, simple synthesis and purification methods, and good batch-to-batch reproducibility. In this context, we focus on the development of novel CIL materials based on n-type small molecules, which should show much improved electron mobility and conductivity. It is noted that several kinds of these CIL materials have been reported, such as perylene diimide and fullerene derivatives. They can efficiently work in a wider thickness range in PSCs due to their excellent conductivities. Recently, we have developed a class of dicyanomethylenated quinacridone (DCNQA) derivatives that serve as electron acceptors in PSCs. The incorporation of strong electron-withdrawing dicyanomethylene groups to the quinacridone (QA) skeleton endows the resulting DCNQA derivatives with a low-lying LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) level and good electron transport property. The PSCs using P3HT as a donor and C8-DCNQA as an acceptor showed a PCE of 1.57%. In addition, DCNQA derivatives can be easily synthesized from inexpensive industrial QA pigment. The DCNQA skeleton is expected to be further modified at multiple active sites, thereby providing more structural versatility.

In this contribution, we synthesized a novel N,N′-dioctylpyridinium DCNQA derivative, namely DCNQA-PyBr, and a reference electrolyte, N,N′-dioctylpyridinium quinacridone (QA-PyBr) (Fig. 1a). Two flexible alkyl groups were introduced for better solubility in alcohol and improved film-forming property on the active layer. They were employed as CILs in the PSCs based on PCDTBT (poly[N-9′′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)]):PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester) as an active layer (Fig. 1b and c). Inserting DCNQA-PyBr or QA-PyBr as a CIL significantly improved the PCE of the corresponding device due to the simultaneously enhanced Jsc, Voc, and FF. Furthermore, the high performance can be maintained with a wide range of DCNQA-PyBr layer thicknesses (from 5 nm to 40 nm), which can be attributed to the much improved electron transport ability and higher conductivity of DCNQA-PyBr. On the other hand, the PCE of the QA-PyBr based devices dramatically dropped upon increasing thickness of the QA-PyBr layer. In addition, inserting DCNQA-PyBr as the CIL also led to significant performance improvements of the PSCs based on P3HT:PC61BM (P3HT = poly(3-hexylthiophene), PC61BM = [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester) and PTB7:PC71BM (PTB7 = polythieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-co-benzodithiophene), indicating the universality of DCNQA-PyBr as a CIL for PSCs.

The DCNQA-based electrolyte DCNQA-PyBr was conveniently synthesized by two steps on a gram-scale (Scheme 1). The intermediate DCNQA-Br was synthesized by Knoevenagel condensation between QA-Br and malononitrile. The ionization of DCNQA-Br and QA-Br with pyridine was then performed to afford DCNQA-PyBr, and QA-PyBr as a reference molecule. DCNQA-PyBr and QA-PyBr have good solubility in methanol but are insoluble in chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene. This orthogonal solubility with respect to the polymers and fullerenes can be utilized to avoid damage to the underlying layers and give an opportunity for the solution-processed fabrication of a layer-by-layer device. The UV-vis absorption spectra of DCNQA-PyBr and QA-PyBr in solution are similar to their neutral analogues C8-DCNQA and C8-QA (Fig. S1). Based on the onset reduction potentials, the LUMO energy levels were estimated to be −3.45 eV for DCNQA-PyBr and −3.22 eV for QA-PyBr (Fig. S2). The HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) level was −5.26 eV for DCNQA-PyBr and −5.46 eV for QA-PyBr as calculated using LUMO energy levels and optical band gaps Eoptg (Table S1).

To study the effect of introducing DCNQA-PyBr and QA-PyBr as CILs, PSCs were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCDTBT:PC71BM/CIL/Al. The two CILs were deposited onto the active layer by spin-coating from their methanol solutions. For comparison, two control devices were also fabricated, those being the Al-only device without the CIL and the methanol-treated device by spin-coating methanol on the active layer. Fig. 2a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices under the 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G irradiation and the performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. More than 20 devices were measured for each configuration and the efficiencies were averaged. The Al-only device gave a maximum PCE of 5.21% with a Jsc of 10.24 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.88 V, and a FF of 57.8%. Incorporating a DCNQA-PyBr layer with an optimized thickness of 13 nm as the CIL led to simultaneously enhanced Voc (0.91 V), Jsc (11.33 mA cm−2) and FF (67.5%). Overall, the PCE value reached 6.96%, which is 1.3 times of that of the Al-only device. In addition, the device with a 4 nm QA-PyBr CIL also exhibited a PCE of 6.70% with Jsc of 11.19 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.90 V and FF of 66.4%. The methanol-treated device only exhibited a slight increase in Jsc and Voc, leading to a PCE of 5.33%. These results suggest that the enhanced PCE of the devices with the CIL are mainly contributed by the CILs themselves rather than their solvent (methanol). It is noteworthy that the devices incorporating a CIL also have superior performance relative to the conventional LiF/Al based devices (6.96% vs. 5.95%) due to the higher Jsc, Voc and FF, as shown in Table 1. The average PCE values of the Al-only, LiF/Al, methanol-treated, QA-PyBr and DCNQA-PyBr devices are 5.13%, 5.89%, 5.22%, 6.56% and 6.89% respectively. Fig. 2b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the corresponding devices. While the methanol-treated device shows similar EQE spectra, the devices with the CIL show higher EQE values than that of the Al-only device in the range of 400 to 600 nm. The Jsc values integrated from the EQE spectra agree well with the tested values (Table S2), indicating that the Jsc data presented in Fig. 2a are not overvalued.

The increased Voc of the devices with the CIL can be attributed to the lower work functions (WF) of the cathode, which were determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) with monochromatized HeI radiation at 21.2 eV (Fig. 3). The WF is defined by secondary electron cutoff in the UPS spectra. The WF values are 4.18 eV and 3.53 eV for bare Al and methanol-treated Al, respectively. QA-PyBr or DCNQA-PyBr coverage provides a further lower WF of Al at about 3.30 eV. The reduction of cathode WF can increase the built-in potential across the devices, which influences the internal electric field and gives the upper limit of the Voc. This was further supported by the increased turn-on voltage deduced from the dark J–V curves, which were determined to be 0.99 V, 1.03 V, 1.06 V and 1.04 V for the devices with bare Al, methanol-treated Al, QA-PyBr/Al and DCNQA-PyBr/Al cathodes, respectively (Fig. S4). These results suggest that introduction of the CIL increases built-in voltage (here considered as the flat-band condition) of the devices, which is responsible for the increase in Voc.

Table 1 shows the series resistances (Rs) of the devices derived from the slope of the J–V curves at Voc. The devices incorporating QA-PyBr and DCNQA-PyBr show an Rs of 8.4 Ω cm2 and 8.0 Ω cm2, respectively, which are lower than that of the Al-only device (14.4 Ω cm2). The increase of Jsc of the devices with the CIL is attributed to the decrease of resistance.
Compared to the control devices, the devices incorporating a QA-PyBr or DCNQA-PyBr layer show higher FF values, as listed in Table 1. This implies that the introduction of the CIL effectively improved the charge transport ability. In order to confirm that the electron transport of PSCs is enhanced when QA-PyBr or DCNQA-PyBr is incorporated, electron mobility was measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) technique with a device configuration of ITO/Al/PCDTBT:PC71BM/Al or ITO/Al/PCDTBT:PC71BM/CIL/Al. The J1/2–V analyses of the electron-only devices are presented in Fig. S5. The electron mobility in the methanol-treated device (3.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is almost the same as that of the Al-only device (3.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The electron mobilities in the devices with QA-PyBr/Al and DCNQA-PyBr/Al are 9.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Indeed, the incorporation of a CIL increased the electron mobility, which was in agreement with the increasing trend of FF as listed in Table 1.
The effect of the CIL thickness on the performance of the devices based on PCDTBT:PC71BM was then investigated. The thickness of QA-PyBr or DCNQA-PyBr was modulated by changing their concentrations from 0.5 mg mL−1 to 5.0 mg mL−1 (Fig. S6). The J–V curves of the devices with various thicknesses of CIL are shown in Fig. 4 and the device performance parameters are summarized in Table 2. When the QA-PyBr thickness increased from 4 nm to 20 nm, the PCE reduced from 6.70% to 1.71% due to the decrease of Jsc (11.19 mA cm−2vs. 7.93 mA cm−2) and FF (66.5% vs. 23.9%), accompanied by a decline of Rs from 8.4 Ω cm2 to 221.8 Ω cm2. The extremely large Rs and the S-shaped J–V curve indicate the poor charge transport of the device with 20 nm QA-PyBr, as shown in Fig. 4a. However, the performance of the device with DCNQA-PyBr is less dependent on the CIL thickness, as shown in Fig. 4b. The best PCE (6.96%) was achieved with a 13 nm DCNQA-PyBr layer. Further increasing the CIL thickness to 19 nm only leads to a slight drop of Jsc and FF, resulting in a PCE of 6.37%, as listed in Table 1. Even when DCNQA-PyBr thickness reached up to 40 nm, the device still demonstrated a PCE of 5.82%, which is much higher than that of the Al-only device. Meanwhile, the Rs slightly increased from 8.0 Ω cm2 to 11.2 Ω cm2 when the thickness increased from 5 nm to 40 nm.

To understand the big difference of the device performances with DCNQA-PyBr and QA-PyBr based CILs, the electron transport of PSCs with various thicknesses were characterized by J–V measurements of the electron-only devices with a configuration of ITO/Al/PCDTBT:PC71BM/CIL/Al. Fig. 5 presents the J–V characteristics of the electron-only devices with the QA-PyBr (a) and DCNQA-PyBr (b) layer. Upon increasing the thickness of the QA-PyBr layer to 20 nm, the device exhibits one order of magnitude decrease of current density. However the current densities of the devices with DCNQA-PyBr are independent of the CIL thickness. Even when the thickness of the DCNQA-PyBr is 40 nm, the device only shows a slight decline of current density (Fig. 5b). These findings indicate that DCNQA-PyBr has a much better electron transport ability than QA-PyBr. Furthermore, the conductivity measurements (Fig. 6) have demonstrated that DCNQA-PyBr has a higher conductivity (2.25 × 10−6 S cm−1) than that of QA-PyBr (1.23 × 10−7 S cm−1). Therefore, we infer that the high efficiency of the PSCs with a thick DCNQA-PyBr interlayer (10–40 nm) is originated from its improved electron transport ability and higher conductivity.
Good film formation atop the hydrophobic active layer is a fundamental requirement for solution-processed CIL materials. The film morphologies of the DCNQA-PyBr layers on PCDTBT:PC71BM were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The PCDTBT:PC71BM layer has a smooth surface with root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.56 nm (Fig. 7a). The 5 nm DCNQA-PyBr film spin-coated on the active layer is rather rough (RMS = 2.74 nm) due to its self-aggregation (Fig. 7b). The rough morphology of this ultrathin film is unfavourable for the device performance due to non-uniform coverage of the active layer. Surprisingly, much improved morphologies were formed for the thicker DCNQA-PyBr films. They formed smoother films with an RMS smaller than 1 nm (13 nm film: RMS = 0.69 nm, 19 nm film: RMS = 0.71 nm, 28 nm film: RMS = 0.60 nm), though some visible islands still existed (Fig. 7c–e). The 40 nm DCNQA-PyBr film shows a smoother and more homogeneous surface with a low RMS of 0.31 nm (Fig. 7f). Therefore, a uniform DCNQA-PyBr film atop of the active layer can be obtained in a wide range of thicknesses. Furthermore, the QA-PyBr films atop the active layer are smooth and even more uniform than those of DCNQA-PyBr (Fig. S8), indicating that the different device performances stem from the distinct electron transport ability and conductivity of these CIL materials rather than their different film forming abilities.
Inspired by these outstanding properties of DCNQA-PyBr, we further checked its performance in P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7:PC71BM based devices. The CIL with an optimized thickness of 13 nm was employed. The J–V characteristics of the devices under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G irradiation are presented in Fig. 8a and b, and the performance parameters are summarized in Table 3. As we expected, for the P3HT:PC61BM system, the CIL-inserted device shows an enhanced Jsc from 9.12 mA cm−2 (device I) to 10.25 mA cm−2 (device III), Voc from 0.51 V to 0.61 V, FF from 51.8% to 62.5% and PCE from 2.41% to 3.91%. Meanwhile, the Rs of the devices reduced from 14.8 Ω cm2 to 9.1 Ω cm2. Similarly, for the PTB7:PC71BM devices, inserting DCNQA-PyBr as the CIL led to enhanced Jsc from 14.62 mA cm−2 (device IV) to 16.51 mA cm−2 (device VI), Voc from 0.67 V to 0.74 V and FF from 54.0% to 67.3%. Overall, a high PCE of 8.23% was obtained, which is more than 1.5 times higher than that of the Al-only device. The Rs of the devices reduced from 13.2 Ω cm2 to 5.2 Ω cm2. These results demonstrate the universality of DCNQA-PyBr based CILs for PSCs with different photoactive layers. The devices incorporating DCNQA-PyBr also have higher PCE values than those of the conventional LiF/Al cathodes for the P3HT:PC61BM and PTB7:PC71BM systems (Table 3). The EQE spectra of the devices are shown in Fig. 9. The Jsc values integrated from the EQE spectra agree well with the tested values (Tables S3 and S4).

In summary, a novel n-type π-conjugated electrolyte DCNQA-PyBr was developed and employed as a cathode interlayer in PSCs. The incorporation of DCNQA-PyBr as a CIL leads to simultaneously improved Jsc, Voc, and FF. High PCE values of 6.96%, 3.91%, and 8.23% have been achieved for PSCs with PCDTBT:PC71BM, P3HT:PC61BM, and PTB7:PC71BM as the active layer, respectively, which are much higher than those of the corresponding Al-only devices. More importantly, DCNQA-PyBr exhibits excellent electron transport properties and conductivity, allowing the device work well in a wide range of DCNQA-PyBr interlayer thicknesses. For the PCDTBT:PC71BM based device, a PCE of 5.82% was achieved even when the thickness of the DCNQA-PyBr interlayer reached up to 40 nm. On the other hand, the reference CIL material QA-PyBr shows poor electron transport ability and low conductivity. The performance of the QA-PyBr based device is sensitive to the thickness of the CIL. The PCE dropped to 1.71% when the thickness of the QA-PyBr interlayer reached 20 nm. With the good electron transport ability, facile synthesis and purification, and good film formation ability, DCNQA-PyBr has promising application as a low-cost and eco-friendly cathode interlayer in large-area PSCs.



1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded by Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. Elemental analyses were performed on a Vario Micro (Elementar) spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a TAQ500 thermogravimeter at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetries were performed on a BAS 100W instrument with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. A three-electrode configuration was used for the measurement: a platinum electrode as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. A 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF) in DMF was used as the supporting electrolyte.

Dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and pyridine were distilled over CaH2 and KOH, respectively. The other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. and directly used without purification. All reactions were performed under a N2 atmosphere. N,N′-Bis(8-bromooctyl)-quinacridone (QA-Br) was prepared by the alkylation of quinacridone with 1,8-dibromooctane according to our reported procedure. The synthesis and characterization of QA-PyBr and DCNQA-PyBr are presented as follows.

To a 500 mL two-neck flask, QA-Br (1.74 g, 2.50 mmol) and malononitrile (0.33 g, 5.00 mmol) were dissolved in 300 mL dry CH2Cl2. TiCl4 (14.25 g, 75.0 mmol) was slowly added via dropping funnel at 10 °C. After vigorously stirring for 10 minutes, pyridine (31.60 g, 400.0 mmol) was slowly added via a dropping funnel. Then the mixture was stirred for 24 hours at room temperature. The solvent and the residual pyridine were evaporated under reduced pressure.

P3HT was purchased from Rieke Metals (USA). PCDTBT and PTB7 were purchased from 1-material Chemscitech Inc. (Canada). PC71BM and PC61BM were purchased from American Dye Source (USA). The ITO-coated glass was pre-cleaned and treated with plasma for 5 min. A 35 nm PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVP Al 4083) layer was spin coated and baked at 120 °C for 10 min. The device was then transferred to a nitrogen glove box. For PCDTBT:PC71BM devices, a blend of 7 mg PCDTBT and 28 mg PC71BM was dissolved into 1 mL mixed solvent (chlorobenzene:o-dichlorobenzene = 1:3, v/v) and stirred overnight. The solution was spin-coated onto the substrate at 2000 rpm for 40 s and then annealed at 75 °C for 10 min. The thickness of the active layer was ca. 90 nm; for the P3HT:PC61BM device, a blend of 17 mg P3HT and 17 mg PC61BM was dissolved into 1 mL of o-dichlorobenzene and stirred for 2 days. The solution was spin-coated onto the substrate at 600 rpm for 40 s, followed by solvent annealing at room temperature for 2 h, and thermal annealing at 110 °C for 10 min to produce an active layer with a thickness of 180 nm; the PTB7:PC71BM active layer was formed by spin-coating the chlorobenzene: DIO (1,8-diiodoctane) (v:v = 97:3) solution (containing 10 mg mL−1 PTB7 and 15 mg mL−1 PC71BM) at 1000 rpm for 60 s. The residual DIO was removed under vacuum overnight. The thickness of the active layer was ca. 120 nm. The QA-PyBr or DCNQA-PyBr cathode interlayer was subsequently deposited on the active layer from the corresponding methanol solution. The thickness was regulated by varying the concentrations from 0.5 to 5.0 mg mL−1. Finally, 100 nm Al was thermal-deposited under a pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar. The active area of each pixel was 2 × 2 mm2. The control device without interlayer was fabricated under the same conditions. Photovoltaic performance of the device was tested under a 1 sun, AM 1.5 full spectrum solar simulator (Photo Emission Tech. Inc.) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell traced to the National institute of metrology, China. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics under light and in darkness were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured using a Q Test Station 2000 (Crowntech Inc. USA) under ambient conditions. AFM (by Burker Dimension ICON) was carried out directly on the surface of the fabricated devices in the PeakForce QNM mode under ambient conditions. The AFM images and RMS values were drawn and calculated by the software NanoScope Analysis. The thicknesses of the 20 nm QA-PyBr and 40 nm DCNQA-PyBr films were determined by a profilometer (DEKTAK 150). The data were averaged from 5 films. The thicknesses of the other films was estimated by an absorbance–thickness curve (Fig. S6) that assumed the thickness is linear dependent on maximum absorbance.

The electron mobility of the devices was measured by the SCLC (space charge limited current) method. The device structure was ITO/Al/PCDTBT:PC71BM/QA-PyBr (DCNQA-PyBr)/Al. The mobility was calculated by the following equation:
where
J is the current density, εr is the dielectric constant of the material (assumed to be 3.9), εo is the vacuum permittivity (8.8542 × 10−12 F m−1), d is the film thickness and V is the voltage drop across the device, V = Vapp − Vr − Vbi. Vr (the voltage drop due to contact resistance and series resistance across the electrodes) and Vbi (the built-in voltage of the device due to the difference in work function of the electrodes at both sides of the active layer) are subtracted from experimental applied voltage. A straight line going through the origin of J1/2–V curves for the devices signifies that the mobility is field independent at fields up to 2 × 105 V cm−1.

The conductivities of QA-PyBr and DCNQA-PyBr were measured with a device configuration of ITO/QA-PyBr (DCNQA-PyBr)/Al. The film thickness of QA-PyBr and DCNQA-PyBr was ca. 50 nm and the active area was 2 × 2 mm2. The I–V plots were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The conductivities were calculated from Ohm's law at the linear voltage regions.
