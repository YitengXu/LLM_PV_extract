A sensitizer incorporating a heavily alkylated surface blocking indolizine donor exhibits excellent light absorption and diminished recombination rates in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). DSC device efficiencies (up to 8%) using either I−/I3− or Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox shuttles were obtained, which compare favourably to the known excellent surface coverage co-sensitization dye, D35.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC) remain an important, viable solar-to-electric conversion technology with years of critical knowledge gained since their inception in modern form in 1991. n-Type DSCs operate through the photoexcitation of a sensitizer, which transfers an electron to a semiconductor. The electron returns to the oxidized dye by a redox shuttle, which in turn gets an electron from a counter electrode. In these devices the sensitizer plays numerous crucial roles including determining the breadth of the solar spectrum used and inhibiting non-productive electron transfers. Recently organic sensitizers have surpassed ruthenium sensitizers in overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) by reaching over 13% PCE. The ubiquitous and modular donor–π-bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) dye design is driving much of this success as nearly all high-efficiency organic dyes follow this arrangement. When surveying each of these components, tri- and di-aryl amine based donors are common to most high efficiency dyes. While these amine donors are considered “strong” electron donors, the development of groups with increased electron donating strengths and maintained dye stability is desirable for achieving ideal sensitizer bandgaps with many π-bridges and acceptors. A landmark milestone is set for efficient photon conversion up to 1000 nm, and several sensitizers are already demonstrating the viability of utilizing lower energy photons. Narrowing the sensitizer bandgap to near-ideal levels requires the minimization of non-productive, power-diminishing electron transfer events such as recombination of already-injected electrons with the oxidized redox shuttle or dye. Extending electron lifetime in the semiconductor allows for the use of dyes with redox shuttles having the close matched potentials needed to maintain good cell voltages with NIR absorbing dyes.

Dyes successfully reducing recombination pathways often possess non-conjugated extended alkyl substituents on the donor and/or π-bridge of the D–π–A dye subunits, which protect the semiconductor surface from oxidizing redox shuttles. These substituents also effectively control dye-to-dye morphology by spacing dyes apart to diminish non-productive energy transfers. Dyes that successfully control these non-productive pathways within a DSC device are valuable for high efficiency cells as single sensitizers or as co-sensitizers that improve overall cell properties through reducing non-productive electron and energy transfers. Indeed, the two most recent record setting DSC cells have employed low recombination rate co-sensitized dyes. The development of dyes with these properties and extended absorption ranges over those currently used is needed to further improve record DSC cells. To this end, we recently described a series of donor subunits based on indolizine, which was found to be a very strong donor relative to aryl amine donors. The reported indolizine donors (such as AH3) show good performance in model systems especially given the lack of recombination pathway reducing features in the dye designs. Below, we report the synthesis of a heavily alkylated indolizine donor (AH7) with good TiO2 surface blanketing to lower recombination (Fig. 1).
The synthesis of the target indolizine, AH7, proceeds analogous to that of reported AH3 once the donor building block is in hand and is described in detail in the ESI. Briefly, the desired surface-protecting indolizine donor is obtained after C-alkylation of commercially available 4-bromo-2-picoline with 2-ethylhexylbromide, Suzuki coupling to install one alkylated aryl group, indolizine core cyclization, and a second Suzuki coupling to incorporate the second dialkoxybenzene (scheme in ESI). Palladium catalyzed C–H activation of the donor then furnishes the indolizine-thiophene aldehyde, which undergoes Knoevenagel condensation to yield dye AH7 in just 6 steps.
With AH7 in hand, we sought to compare photophysical, electrochemical and ultimately DSC device performance properties with known indolizine dye AH3 and known low recombination rate dye D35 (Fig. 1). The optical and electronic properties of dye AH7 were first analysed through UV-Vis absorption and cyclic voltammetry (Table 1 and Fig. S1, ESI). Compared to the non-alkylated indolizine donor based AH3, the λmax and λonset of AH7 are both red-shifted by 50 nm, and the molar absorptivity has increased. Compared to known dye D35, both λmax and λonset values for dye AH7 are red-shifted by 100 nm. The molar absorptivity for AH7 is diminished relative to D35 (9400 vs. 31000), but is still adequate for high-efficiency devices. The red-shift observed for the AH7 absorption spectrum relative to D35 is significant as D35 and D35 analogues are commonly used as a co-sensitizer in high efficiency devices. AH7 provides an opportunity to further enhance the PCE of devices employing dyes with complementary absorption spectrum in a region of the solar spectrum inaccessible to D35.

Well positioned dye ground-state (E(S+/S)) and excited-state (E(S+/S*)) oxidation potentials are critical to efficient DSC device operation. The E(S+/S) potential for AH7 was observed to be substantially higher in energy (∼150 mV) for AH7 than AH3 or D35, which is attributed to a stronger electron donor group on AH7. The E(S+/S*) potential was calculated to be lowest for AH7 when compared with D35 and AH3, which was attributed to synergistic band-gap narrowing due to competing local aromaticity (proaromaticity) present in the indolizine subunit excited-state as previously reported. All dyes were observed to have suitable oxidation potentials to function as DSC sensitizers with driving forces for electron injection and dye regeneration estimated to be adequate for AH7, which has the lowest driving forces for electron transfers when compared with each dye (∼430 mV for injection and ∼310 mV for regeneration with Co(bpy)3).
Having established AH7 is suitable for DSC devices based on either iodide or cobalt based redox shuttles, dyes AH3, AH7 and D35 were compared in DSCs with a TiO2 semiconductor and I−/I3− or Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox shuttles. The device performances under AM 1.5 irradiation were analyzed based on the equation η = (JscVocFF)/I0, where Jsc is the short-circuit current, Voc is the open-circuit voltage, FF is the fill factor and I0 is the incident light intensity (Table 2 and Fig. 2). With the iodide/triiodide redox shuttle, AH7 gave the highest Jsc value reaching near 15 mA cm−2. This high current is attributed to a substantially broader incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum for AH7 than the other two dyes (Fig. 2). D35 and AH7 had IPCE spectra approaching peak values each near 90%. Overall PCE values show AH7 as obtaining an 8% PCE which is substantially higher than either AH3 or D35.

As mentioned, the motivation behind the design of AH7 was to broaden the IPCE spectrum and reduce redox shuttle-TiO2 electron transfers. A broad, high percent conversion IPCE spectrum has clearly been obtained indicating efficient electron transfers. Analysis of Voc offers a second initial insight into the effect AH7 has on recombination rates. When compared with the generation 1 indolizine dye AH3, which has the same π-bridge and acceptor, the Voc has dramatically improved with AH7 showing a gain of 150 mV. D35, which is known to have exquisite recombination retardation, has a comparable voltage to AH7 (∼50 mV greater).
Given the markedly improved Voc values of AH7 when compared with AH3, devices based on a cobalt redox shuttle were evaluated for all three dyes. A decrease in photocurrent (∼1–2 mA cm−2 decrease for AH7 and D35) was observed for each dye with the Co(bpy)32+/3+ shuttle, however the voltage values were increased (∼60–80 mV) which led to a slight PCE improvement for AH7 to 8.1%. After ∼1 week of continuous light soaking (200 hours), the iodide based cells show no decrease in power conversion efficiency while cobalt cells show a modest ∼20% decrease in power conversion efficiency. Cobalt redox shuttles are known to undergo rapid recombination with electrons in the TiO2 conduction band; however, based on the voltages observed above, AH7 and D35 significantly slow recombination pathways. To evaluate the effects of larger donor groups on dye loading with TiO2, a combined desorption and film absorbance study was carried out (Fig. S2 and Table S1, ESI) which reveals a similar dye loading for D35 and AH7 with a roughly 2 times higher loading for the concise AH3 dye.
In order to better understand donor structure-device performance relationships, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were conducted on each device (Fig. 3). At a fixed potential, the rate of electron recombination was near one order of magnitude less for D35 than AH7, which leads to higher voltages for D35 based devices as observed (Fig. 3). While AH7 has a faster recombination rate than D35, the recombination rate of AH7 has been slowed by nearly two orders of magnitude when compared with AH3, which had the lowest Voc devices. Because Voc is directly tied to the energy of the TiO2 conduction band (CB), we measured the dependence of chemical capacitance on the voltage (ESI). The shift in TiO2 CB energy was found to be minimal for D35 and AH7 based devices, which indicates the changes in voltages observed for these cells can largely be attributed to changes in redox shuttle-semiconductor surface electron recombination resistance. Despite the lower dye loadings, AH7 and D35 show significantly improved recombination rates when compared with AH3.
Improving DSC efficiencies for many π-bridges requires the incorporation of strong donors balanced with strong acceptors. The donor group has the added requirement of providing sufficient TiO2 surface protection to reduce non-productive electron transfer events such as recombination of semiconductor electrons with the redox shuttle. We have synthesized a surface blocking indolizine donor based dye in 6 steps from commercially available starting materials that boosts electron donation strength and rivals the surface protection of ubiquitous arylamine-based dyes. The dye AH7 was observed to absorb a significantly wider range of photons than either comparison dye (AH3 and D35) using the same π-bridge and acceptors. This is attributed to the proaromaticity inherent to the indolizine building block. In evaluating this series of dyes, the highest performing dye in devices based on iodide or cobalt redox shuttles was AH7. In comparing the performance of devices sensitized with either a concise indolizine donor (AH3), a substantially alkylated indolizine donor (AH7), or the well-known Hagfeldt donor (D35), the recombination rate slowed in the order AH3 ≫ AH7 > D35, with AH7 approaching the dramatically low recombination rate of D35. To further build on this indolizine dye design success, broadly absorbing bridges (such as porphyrin or thienopyrazines) and bridges commonly used in high efficiency dyes are being targeted to incorporate this vastly improved donor.
