New π-conjugated alternating copolymers containing thienylene and fluorenone units, namely poly[(5,5‴-dioctyl-[2,2′;5′,2″;5″,2‴]quaterthiophene)-alt-(2,7-fluoren-9-one)] (PQTF8), as well as its analogue without fluorenone groups (PQT8), have been synthesized. Absorption studies carried out both in solution and in thin films indicate that the presence of fluorenone chromophores in PQTF8 leads to a significant extension of the absorption spectrum in the visible range as compared to PQT8. The redox properties of both polymers, in particular their LUMO and HOMO levels, have been characterized by cyclic voltammetry and have been found suitable for potential use of these systems in organic solar cells. Finally, these materials have been tested as donor components in bulk-heterojunction-type photovoltaic cells using PCBM as an electron acceptor. We demonstrate a strong effect of the polymer's molecular weight on crucial cell parameters, such as the short-circuit current density Jsc, and therefore on the overall cell efficiency. This effect is particularly pronounced for PQTF8-based cells leading to power conversion efficiencies up to 1.5% for the highest molecular weights.

The fast (i.e. sub-picosecond) photo-induced charge transfer between π-conjugated polymers and fullerene C60 is considered to be the key step enabling the fabrication of efficient low-cost organic solar cells. This important discovery quickly gave rise to the formulation of the so-called “bulk heterojunction” concept. According to this concept, the efficiency of the excitons' dissociation, which is the limiting factor for the performance of organic photovoltaic cells, can be significantly improved by creating two percolating networks of semiconductors with electron-donating and electron-accepting properties, respectively. Improvements in the solution processability of both semiconductor components led finally to the formation of the desired heterostructure via wet processing from a common solvent and consequently to the fabrication of the first bulk heterojunctions.

Different types of heterojunctions can be distinguished. In the “all polymeric” heterojunction, electron-donating and electron-accepting polymers form a co-continuous binary mixture whose morphology facilitates the photo-induced charge transfer between both components. Such photovoltaic cells based on donor-type and acceptor-type poly(p-phenylene vinylene) derivatives showed power conversion efficiencies of ca. 0.75% under standard test conditions. Better results were obtained for “organic–inorganic” bulk heterojunctions using inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals of A(II)B(VI) type, for example CdSe, as electron acceptors in combination with an electron-donating π-conjugated polymer. In this case, power conversion efficiencies up to 2.6% have been reported. However, the highest power conversion efficiencies to date, reaching 5%, have been obtained for bulk heterojunctions made of electron-donating polythiophenes with fullerene derivatives as acceptors.
The significant progress and optimisation in polymer photovoltaic cell design has also intensified research into new materials capable of improving the photon to electron conversion efficiency. One of the principal requirements for active materials suitable for organic solar cells is that they are strong photon absorbers, in other words that they exhibit a high molar absorption coefficient over a large spectral range. Moreover, these chromophore groups have to be active in the energy conversion process. Regioregular poly(alkylthiophene)s—the most efficient polymeric materials to date for use in bulk-heterojunction solar cells—show rather narrow absorption bands covering only a small fraction of the solar spectrum. This mismatch between the solar emission spectrum and the absorption spectra of commonly used π-conjugated systems has encouraged several research groups to develop the synthesis of low-band gap polymers showing extended spectral absorption domains.
Following this approach, we have recently reported new π-conjugated systems suitable for organic solar cells, which consist of π-conjugated oligomers or regioregular alternating copolymers containing oligothiophene and fluorenone sub-units. The main advantages of this new family of polyconjugated molecules are: i) their highly ordered supramolecular organization originating from the presence of stiff fluorenone sub-units which efficiently block the chain folding processes, and ii) their significantly larger spectral domain of absorption compared to poly(alkylthiophene)s. Bulk heterojunction devices based on these systems in combination with methanofullerene [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) yielded maximum external quantum efficiencies (or electrons collected per incident photon, IPCE) of ∼21% and power efficiencies of 1% under simulated solar light (AM 1.5, 800 W m–2).
Here, we report on the synthesis and detailed characterisation of two new members of this family: 2,7-bis(4-octyl-5,2′-bithien-2-yl)-fluoren-9-one (BTF8) and the product of its polymerization, poly[(5,5‴-dioctyl-[2,2′;5′,2″;5″,2‴]quaterthiophene)-alt-(2,7-fluoren-9-one)] (PQTF8). In order to demonstrate the effect of the presence of the fluorenone sub-units on the resulting photovoltaic properties, we have synthesised regioregular poly(5,5‴-dioctyl-[2,2′;5′,2″;5″,2‴]quaterthiophene) (PQT8), which is the analogue of PQTF8 that does not contain fluorenone sub-units.
It is known that the electrical current densities in photovoltaic devices are mainly limited by incomplete conversion of the incident light and by low charge carrier mobilities in the active layer. In this respect, the incorporation of fluorenone sub-units into the polymer main chain should improve this parameter, because of the better spectral match with the solar spectrum. It is also expected that the high charge carrier mobility achieved for PQT derivatives should not be dramatically perturbed by the incorporation of the fluorenone units, because of the highly ordered films that can be obtained for fluorenone-based polymers. By characterizing test bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic cells, consisting of PQT8, BTF8 or PQTF8, and methanofullerene [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an electron acceptor, we demonstrate that the above outlined simple concept holds and that appropriate molecular engineering results in the improvement of the cell efficiencies up to 1.45% (in the case of PQTF8).

All reagents and chemicals were purchased from Aldrich or Acros and used as received, except for THF which was distilled over sodium–benzophenone prior to use. Thin layer chromatography was performed on silica gel-coated aluminium plates with a particle size of 2–25 µm and a pore size of 60 Å. Merck 60 (70–230 mesh) silica was used for flash chromatography .


All synthesized monomers and undoped polymers were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR and elemental analysis. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AC 200 MHz spectrometer. Chloroform-d (CDCl3) or tetrachloroethane-d2 (C2D2Cl4), containing TMS as an internal standard, were used as solvent. Elemental analyses (C, H, N, and S) were carried out by the Analytical Service of CNRS Vernaison (France).

The undoped polymers were additionally characterized by Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopies. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer paragon500 spectrometer (wavenumber range: 650–4000 cm–1; resolution: 2 cm–1) equipped with a Specac Golden Gate ATR accessory. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded in solution on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 2 spectrometer (wavelength range: 180–820 nm; resolution: 2 nm) or in situ during the size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analyses using a diode array UV-vis spectrometer.
Molecular weights of the polymer fractions (obtained by Soxhlet extraction) were measured using SEC on a 1100HP Chemstation equipped with a 300–7.5 mm PLgel Mixed-D 5 µm/104 Å column. Detection was performed by a diode array UV-vis detector and a refractive index detector. The column temperature and the flow rate were fixed to 313 K and 1 mL min–1, respectively. The calibration curve was built using 10 polystyrene (PS) narrow standards (S-M-10* kit from Polymer Labs) and all molecular weights are therefore given in equivalents of PS (eq. PS). Two runs of 20 µL injection of ca. 2 mg mL–1 polymer in HPLC grade THF solutions were typically analyzed for each sample with UV-vis detection located at 355 nm.
Electrochemical polymerizations of the synthesized macromonomers (QT8 and BTF8) were carried out in a one-compartment, three-electrode electrochemical cell equipped with a flat platinum working electrode (7 mm2), a Pt wire counter electrode, and an Ag/0.01 M Ag+ reference electrode. The electrolyte consisted of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) solution in dichloromethane containing 2 × 10–3 M macromonomer. The electrolytic solution was purged with argon for 10 min before each experiment. In the case of BTF8 a thin film of the corresponding polymer was obtained by consecutive potential cycling in the range from –0.2 to +0.9 V, at a scan rate of 20 mV s–1. The deposited polymer was then reductively dedoped by cycling several times in the potential range of 0.0 to –0.2 V at the same scan rate. The reduced (undoped) polymer was finally washed with acetonitrile, and its voltammetric properties were studied in a monomer-free solution of 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 solution in acetonitrile.
For the characterisation of photovoltaic properties, bulk-heterojunction solar cells were fabricated using a classical device design on a glass substrate covered by a transparent conductive oxide, ITO (indium-tin-oxide), according to the procedure and layout described in ref. 17. The ITO layer was covered with an 80 nm thick interfacial PEDOT/PSS layer (Baytron-P®). For comparison reasons, the ratios between acceptor (PCBM) and donor (PQT8, PQTF8) were kept constant at 1 mg PCBM per mg donor for both systems. The active layer was spin-coated onto the PEDOT layer from chlorobenzene solutions containing the mixture of donor and PCBM. In the case of the highest molecular weight fraction, the chlorobenzene solution as well as the substrate were heated at 110 °C before deposition. Finally, a 1.3 nm thick layer of LiF was evaporated on top of the active layer and covered by the aluminium electrode (100 nm). The active surface of the device was 28 mm2.
Current–voltage characteristics and power conversion efficiencies of the solar cells were measured in inert atmosphere via a computer controlled Keithley® SMU 2400 unit using 1000 W m–2 air-mass (1.5) simulated white light generated by a Steuernagel Solar Constant 575 simulator. It has to be noted that these are simulated conditions, which are however consistent with most published work to date. A monocrystalline silicon solar cell, calibrated at the Fraunhofer Institut Solare Energiesysteme (Freiburg, Germany), was used as a reference cell to confirm stabilisation of the 1000 W m–2 illumination. In addition, the used apparatus was a standard class AAA system which is widely used and gives mismatch factors around 4% in the 300 to 1100 nm range, as described by Risø Laboratory.
The cell was illuminated through the ITO. The temperature of the polymer heterojunction, measured using a thermocouple (Pt100) mounted on the ITO substrate, reached 30 °C at the initial I (V) characterisation.

0.835 mg of N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) (3.71 mmol, 2.2 eq.) were placed in a mixture of 15 mL of chloroform and 15 mL of acetic acid and the resulting solution was stirred for 10 min at room temperature under argon. 0.96 mg of 2,7-bis(4-octylthien-2-yl)-fluoren-9-one (1), prepared according to the procedure described in ref. 16, were dissolved in 20 mL of chloroform and added dropwise to the NIS-containing solution. After complete addition, a red precipitate was obtained and the mixture was stirred for an additional period of 12 h at room temperature. The reaction was then poured into cold water and extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was washed twice with water and dried over magnesium sulfate. After removal of the drying reagent the red solution was concentrated under vacuum and methanol was added. The precipitate formed at this step was filtered off, washed with methanol and dried in an oven to give 1.2 g of the pure product (red-orange powder, yield: 86.6%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 200 MHz, ppm) δ:7.75 (2H, br d, J = 1.5 Hz), 7.55 (2H, dd, J = 7.8 and 1.7 Hz), 7.41 (2H, d, J = 7.8 Hz), 6.99 (2H, s), 2.52 (4H, t, J = 8.05 Hz), 1.65–1.56 (4H, br m), 1.40–1.20 (20H, m), 1.00–0.80 (6H, m). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 200 MHz, ppm) δ: 192.93 (CO), 148.60 (2C), 147.24 (2C), 142.82 (2C), 135.07 (2C), 134.85 (2C), 131.29 (2C), 124.34 (2C), 121.00 (2C), 120.82 (2C), 74.41 (2C), 32.47 (2C), 31.88 (2C), 29.96 (2C), 29.40 (2C), 29.22 (4C), 22.65 (2C), 14.09 (2C).

1.2 g of 2,7-bis(5-iodo-4-octylthien-2-yl)-fluoren-9-one (2) (1.46 mmol) and 0.69 g of 5,5-dimethyl-2-(thien-2-yl)[1,3,2]dioxoborinane (prepared according to ref. 19) (3.51 mmol, 2.4 eq.) were placed in 70 mL of anhydrous DMF and the mixture was stirred under argon for 10 min at 60 °C and then 0.700 g of K3PO4 (3.3 mmol, 2.25 eq.) and 0.18 g of Pd(PPh3)4 (0.15 mmol) were added. The mixture was kept for an additional period of 15 h at 100 °C with constant stirring and then allowed to cool to 25 °C. After usual work-up the crude product was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, pentane–chloroform, 90 : 10) to yield 0.7 g (65.2%) of a deep red waxy product. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 200 MHz, ppm) δ:7.85 (2H, d, J = 1.3 Hz), 7.63 (2H, dd, J = 7.9 and 1.3 Hz), 7.44 (2H, d, J = 7.6 Hz), 7.32 (2H, dd, J = 5.1 and 1.3 Hz), 7.21 (2H, s), 7.15 (2H, dd, J = 3.5 and 1.3 Hz), 7.07 (2H, dd, J = 5.1 and 3.5 Hz), 2.75 (4H, t, J = 7.3 Hz), 1.65 (4H, quint, J = 7.6 Hz), 1.40–1.20 (m, 20H), 0.9–0.8 (m, 6H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 200 MHz, ppm) δ: 193.31 (CO), 142.64 (2C), 140.66 (2C), 140.29 (2C), 135.92 (2C), 135.03 (2C), 134.96 (2C), 131.19 (2C), 130.88 (2C), 127.45 (2C), 126.58 (2C), 125.90 (2C), 125.44 (2C), 120.98 (2C), 120.74 (2C), 31.89 (2C), 30.57 (2C), 29.59 (2C), 29.43 (4C), 29.26 (2C), 22.68 (2C), 14.13 (2C).

Oxidative polymerization was carried out following the experimental procedure described in ref. 15. The crude polymer was fractionated using Soxhlet extraction with the following solvent sequence: acetone (fraction F1), dichloromethane (F2), chloroform (F3) and chlorobenzene (F4). 1H NMR (fraction 3 in C2D2Cl4 at 70 °C, 400 MHz, ppm) δ: 7.78 (s), 7.60 (d, J = 7.30 Hz), 7.41 (d, J = 7.60 Hz), 7.25 (d, J = 5.08 Hz), 7.16 (s), 7.08 (br s), 7.01 (d, J = 3.49 Hz), 2.60–2.78 (m), 1.74–1.07 (m), 0.95–0.75 (m). 13C NMR: not possible because of the poor solubility in C2D2Cl4. IR-ATR ν (cm–1): 688 (medium), 720 (m), 782 (strong), 818 (s), 902 (s), 1026 (s), 1256 (m), 1290 (m), 1372 (m), 1434 (s), 1454 (s), 1464 (s), 1470 (s), 1598 (weak, benzene ring), 1716 (s, CO), 2326 (w), 2356 (w), 2848 (s, CH2 and CH3), 2918 (s, CH2 and CH3), 2946 (m), 3060 (w, CH aromatic). Elemental analysis: Calcd for monomer unit: C, 73.72%; H, 6.60%; S, 17.50%. Found: C, 73.59%; H, 6.49%; S, 15.70%.


This polymer was prepared according to ref. 18 and fractionated using Soxhlet extraction with acetone (fraction F1), dichloromethane (F2), chloroform (F3) and toluene (F4). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 200 MHz, ppm) δ:7.18 (d, J = 5.1 Hz), 7.14 (d, J = 3.8 Hz), 7.13 (d, J = 3.8 Hz), 7.05 (d, J = 3.8 Hz), 7.04 (d, J = 3.8 Hz), 7.01 (s), 6.94 (d, J = 5.2 Hz), 2.78 (t, J = 8.2 Hz), 1.50–1.70 (m), 1.10–1.50 (m, J = 7.3 Hz), 0.75–0.95 (m). All other spectroscopic data were consistent with those reported in ref. 18.


Both PQTF8 and PQT8 were synthesised using tailor-made monomers, which upon polymerisation give regioregular polymers (see Scheme 1). The symmetric macromonomer 2,7-bis(4-octyl-5,2′-bithien-2-yl)-fluoren-9-one (BFT8) was synthesised from 2,7-bis(4-octylthien-2-yl)-fluoren-9-one (1) in a 2-step reaction. 1 can be directly iodinated using two equivalent of N-iodosuccinimide to give 2,7-bis(5-iodo-4-octylthien-2-yl)-fluoren-9-one (2) in gram-scale. The second step involves the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction catalyzed by palladium tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) (Pd[PPh3]4) in which 2 is allowed to react with two equivalents of 5,5-dimethyl-2-(thien-2-yl)[1,3,2]dioxaborinane to give BTF8. The use of the iodine derivative is recommended since the same coupling reaction carried out with 2,7-bis(5-bromo-4-octylthien-2-yl)-fluoren-9-one gives BTF8 in significantly lower yields.

Oxidative polymerization of BTF8 can be carried out either electrochemically or chemically using FeCl3 as an oxidizing/polymerizing agent according to the well-known procedure described in ref. 20. The quaterthiophene QT8 however does not electropolymerize, therefore PQT8 was prepared only by chemical oxidation of QT8 with 80% yield.
One should note that polymers obtained by chemical oxidative polymerization usually show rather large polydispersity coefficients and can be considered as a mixture of oligomeric and polymeric species. For this reason, we have carried out a fractionation, based on sequential solid–liquid Soxhlet extractions, with the goal to obtain polymer fractions of different molecular weights exhibiting reduced polydispersity coefficients. The crude polymers were first extracted with acetone, then with dichloromethane, followed by chloroform and finally with toluene (PQT8) or chlorobenzene (PQTF8). These fractions were analyzed by SEC to obtain their macromolecular parameters, Mn, Mw, and the corresponding polydispersity coefficients (Mw/Mn), which are collected in Table 1.

The SEC data should be treated only as an indicator of the increasing molecular weight, since in the case of polythiophene derivatives the relationship between Mn,sec obtained with polystyrene standards and its real value is complex. Correlation between SEC and mass spectrometry results shows that for Mn,sec < 2 kDa the values of the molecular weight are underestimated, whereas for Mn,sec > 2 kDa they are overestimated. Moreover the correction factors change with the molecular weight. The underestimation can be clearly seen in the case of BTF8 whose molecular weight determined by SEC is 2.5 times lower than the real one (0.280 kDa vs. 0.726 kDa). The Mn,sec values of the highest molecular weight fractions (the toluene fraction for PQT8 and the chlorobenzene one for PQTF8) could not be determined by SEC since they were not soluble in the eluent (THF).

The position and the width of the absorption bands of the synthesized oligomers and polymers are of critical importance in view of their application in photovoltaic devices. The electronic spectrum of the macromonomer BTF8 show two characteristic absorption bands (Fig. 1a); the first one is located at 379 nm (ε = 53700 mol–1 dm3 cm–1, CHCl3) whereas the second one can be found at 489 nm (ε = 7700 mol–1 dm3 cm–1, CHCl3). According to Jaramillo-Isaza and Turner, the first peak can be attributed to the π–π* transition in the conjugated aromatic rings, whereas the lower energy peak originates from an allowed π–π* transition associated with the carbonyl group of the fluorenone unit. The absence of this transition in the spectrum of QT8 confirms this attribution.

The polymerization of BTF8 to PQTF8 leads to an extension of the conjugation length in the system resulting in a bathochromic shift of both absorption bands accompanied by their significant broadening. As a consequence, they merge into a single non-symmetric peak (see Fig. 1b). When comparing the spectra of both polymers, one can note that the maximum of the π–π* transition band in PQTF8 is hypsochromically shifted compared to the corresponding band in PQT8. Two contributions to this effect must be taken into account. First, the highest molecular weight fraction obtained for PQTF8 (i.e. PQTF8-F4) exhibits a significantly lower value of Mn compared to PQT8-F4 (cf. Table 1). It is known that the position of the π–π* transition band in polythiophene derivatives is still dependent on the chain length for the molecular weight range investigated here; it shifts to lower wavelengths with decreasing molecular weight. Second, the introduction of electron-deficient fluorenone sub-units into the polymer main chain can also lower the effective conjugation of the polymer backbone, leading to a hypsochromic shift of the spectrum. However, the presence of the complementary chromophores in the oligothiophene-fluorenone copolymer results in an increase of the absorption band width (FWHM), which is significantly larger for PQTF8 than for PQT8 (174 nm vs. 122 nm). Consequently, PQTF8 shows a low energy absorption edge at ca. 700 nm (compared to <600 nm for PQT8).
The better match of the PQTF8 absorption with the solar spectrum is also manifested in its thin solid film: the spectrum of PQTF8 covers the spectral range between 360 and 750 nm more uniformly than that of PQT8 (see Fig. 1c). In the solid state, the absorption band width (FWHM) is further enlarged: 195 nm for PQTF8 and 160 nm for PQT8. As a result of π-stacking, the maxima of the π–π* transition bands in the solid state spectra are shifted towards lower energies in comparison with those in solution. The maximum of the absorption is red shifted from 445 nm to 463 nm for PQTF8 and from 475 nm to 532 nm for PQT8. In the case of PQTF8, the π-stacking process is also manifested by the appearance of a strong absorption shoulder between 530 nm and 700 nm.

Cyclic voltammetry frequently constitutes an important part during the investigations of conjugated polymers, since it not only provides information concerning the possibility of the electropolymerization of a given monomer (macromonomer) but also, in properly executed experiments, probes the position of the LUMO and HOMO levels and, consequently, allows the estimation of the width of the so-called “electrochemical gap”.

Our attempts to electropolymerize QT8 were unsuccessful. In this case the reaction is stopped, as confirmed by SEC, at the stage of the octamer via oxidative coupling of two tetramers, which is then deposited on the electrode. Its presence is manifested by a sharp reversible peak at a lower potential with respect to the potential of the oxidative coupling peak. BTF8 shows the voltammetric behaviour typical of electropolymerizable macromonomers (Fig. 2a). Upon the first scan a clear irreversible anodic peak appears corresponding to the polymerization process. The resulting thin layer of the polymer deposited on the electrode is electrochemically active and gives rise to a reversible redox couple, at lower potentials, corresponding to the oxidative doping and the reductive dedoping of the formed polymer. Upon consecutive cycles the intensity of the doping/dedoping couple grows indicating that the amount of the polymer deposited on the electrode increases upon each cycle.
The resulting polymer (PQTF8) can be electrochemically oxidized and reduced as seen from its cyclic voltammogram recorded in a monomer-free electrolyte (see Fig. 2b). The oxidation process at positive potentials is associated with p-type doping, i.e. the transformation of the neutral polymer chains into polycarbocations. The p-doping may involve the removal of electrons from the π-systems of both quaterthiophene and fluorenone sub-units.
The reduction of the neutral polymers to polyanions is more complex. Our recent studies carried out for a copolymer consisting of fluorenone and dialkylbithiophene sub-units have shown that n-doping involves two processes: i) reduction of the carbonyl group and ii) injection of electrons into the π-system of the polymer backbone. These two processes generate two clearly resolved cathodic peaks. No such potential separation is observed for PQTF8. Indeed, during the reductive doping only one peak appears at potentials consistent with the transformation of the carbonyl groups of the fluorenone sub-unit into radical anions. Thus, this process may contribute to the observed cathodic peak.
From the onset of the potentials of both n-doping and p-doping it is possible to estimate the so-called “electrochemical energy gap” (Egel) and HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer. The results obtained for PQTF8 and PQT8 are presented in Fig. 3. For cyclic voltammetry investigations of PQT8, a thin layer of the chemically prepared polymer was deposited from a dilute chloroform solution on a platinum working electrode.
The relative positions of the LUMO and HOMO levels clearly indicated that photo-induced charge transfer is allowed between PQTF8 or PQT8, acting as the electron-donor, and PCBM. Therefore composites of PQT8 or PQTF8 and PCBM should be suitable as active layers in bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic cells. The efficiency of the bulk heterojunction created between the polymers and PCBM is also confirmed by the fluorescence quenching observed in solution (see ESI ).

The molecular weight is one of the key parameters determining the charge carriers' mobility (µ), not only in bulk-heterojunction-type photovoltaic cells, but also in other polymer electronic devices such as field effect transistors (FETs). The increase in µ with increasing Mn is related to macromolecular parameters, however other factors must also be considered, such as the crystallinity or peculiar morphology of the processed polymer layers. All these factors strongly influence the principal parameters governing the electrical transport properties of the devices, such as conjugation length, easier interchain charge transfer and better connectivity between areas of enhanced mobility. Scherf and co-workers reported that by increasing Mn of poly(3-hexylthiophene) used in photovoltaic cells, it is possible to reach power conversion efficiencies >2.5%. This finding clearly indicates that the low efficiency of cells fabricated from low molecular weight polymers originates mainly from the reduced charge carriers' mobility in the donor phase of the heterojunction. Consequently, enhancement in the performance of these devices is potentially possible.

Inspired by these findings, we have carried out detailed studies of cells fabricated from PQT8 and PQTF8 fractions differing in their molecular weight. The power conversion efficiency (η) of the photovoltaic cells was calculated using eqn (1) and (2):

where
Pin is the power of the incident light, Voc [V] is the open-circuit voltage, and Jsc [mA cm–2] is the short-circuit current density. FF is the fill factor and Vmax and Jmax represent the voltage and current densities at the maximum power point. The obtained results are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. The thicknesses of the active layers are identical (around 45 nm determined with a Dektac profilometer) for all samples, except of the devices fabricated from BTF8 and PQTF8-F1—the polymer fraction exhibiting the lowest molecular weight. For these fractions the thickness of the active layer was increased to 90 nm, in order to avoid short circuits because of their poor film-forming ability.

For PQTF8/PCBM-based cells, we observed a strong improvement in all crucial parameters of the device with increasing molecular weight of the polymer. The open circuit voltage, Voc, changes only over a rather narrow range. This parameter relates to the difference between the HOMO energy level of the polymer and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor. However it can be also influenced to some extent by the thickness of the active layer. The lower Voc of PQTF8/PCBM cells when compared to those of PQT8/PCBM cells can be correlated to a lower parallel resistivity RP of the device (decreased by two for the PQTF8 based devices as compared to the PQT8 based ones). The decreased shunt is not unexpected, since the parallel resistivity may be influenced by the macromolecular parameters. The shunt is usually reduced in the case of the low molecular weight fraction based devices. This observation is consistent with the results obtained by Brabec and co-workers in ref. 27. In contrast, the parameters which are governed by the charge carrier's mobility such as the short circuit current density, Jsc, and the cell efficiency, η, change drastically with the molecular weight. They increase strongly (by a factor of ca. 25 for PQTF8), when going from the lowest molecular weight fraction to the highest one. A similar trend, although much less pronounced, is observed for PQT8-PCBM based cells. It should also be pointed out that the power conversion efficiencies obtained for PQTF8 are considerably higher than those measured for PQT8, despite its significantly lower molecular weight (cf.Table 1). Moreover, photovoltaic cells based on regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) and PCBM show comparable efficiencies only for much higher Mn. These rather good performances obtained for the PQTF8-based devices can be related to a better phase segregation between this polymer and PCBM as compared to PQT8 based heterojunctions. The organisation of PQTF8 into a peculiar morphology was highlighted by studying the active layer using AFM (see Fig. 4).
As is clearly evidenced by AFM, in PQTF8/PCBM-based heterojunctions, there is the formation of PCBM-rich clusters which may result in an increased diffusional escape probability for mobile charge carriers and hence reduced recombination. This finding is fully consistent with the rather high current densities obtained for the PQTF8-based devices (up to 5.93 mA cm–2). In the case of PQT8-based blends, the PCBM is fully dispersed in the polymer matrix and no PCBM-rich clusters can be seen in the AFM image. The presence of PQT8 layers around the fullerenes might represent in this case a severe loss mechanism of the photocurrent, consistent with the low current densities not exceeding 2 mA cm–2.
Finally, we wanted to probe the effect of varying the thickness of the active layer for PQTF8-F4-based devices (Table 4). Increasing the active layer thickness from 45 to 90 nm does not result in higher power conversion efficiencies, because there is a simultaneous decrease in the FF and the Jsc values. As demonstrated by Blom and co-workers, the decrease in FF, and hence the device efficiency, is caused by the combined influence of charge recombination and space-charge effects. In particular, charge recombination is increased in thicker samples, both by space charge effects and by an increase in the distance which the carriers have to traverse. The best performing cells have been obtained for 30 nm-thick active layers, which reached power conversion efficiencies of 1.45%

In the design of new macromolecules for photovoltaic applications, one must ensure that the chromophores, introduced to extend the absorption spectrum, do also participate efficiently in the conversion of photons into electricity. We have therefore performed incident photons to current efficiency (IPCE) experiments for PQTF8-F4. For monochromatic light the IPCE of PQTF8/PCBM solar cells can be calculated using the formula:
IPCE (%) = 1240Jsc/(λIp)
(3)
where
Jsc [mA cm–2] is the short circuit current density at the wavelength λ [nm], and Ip [mW cm–2] is the incident light intensity at this wavelength.

The results of the IPCE experiments unequivocally confirm that the fluorenone chromophore groups incorporated into the polymer backbone participate in the generation of the photocurrent (see Fig. 5). In particular, the solid-state absorption spectrum of the active layer matches very well the IPCE curve; i.e. due to the incorporation of fluorenone sub-units, PQTF8-F4-based active layers can generate photocurrents up to 700 nm. It should however be underlined that maximum quantum efficiencies are obtained for incident light between 400 nm and 450 nm. Interestingly, the maximum conversion efficiency (31%) does not coincide with the maximum of the π–π* transition band, but rather corresponds to its higher energetic shoulder. The absorption originating from the presence of the fluorenone carbonyl group (located at ca. 600 nm) leads to a conversion efficiency of ca. 15%.

Using the concept of complementary chromophores, we have synthesized a conjugated alternating copolymer of quaterthiophene and fluorenone and tested this new material as a donor component in bulk-heterojunction-type photovoltaic cells. Comparative studies of the polymer containing the fluorenone sub-units PQTF8 and its analogue consisting solely of thienylene units (PQT8) clearly shows that the complementary chromophore plays an active role in the conversion of the radiation into electricity. A strong dependence of the cell efficiency on the molecular weight of the polymer has been observed for the fluorenone-containing copolymer (PQTF8) exhibiting power conversion efficiencies up to 1.5%.
