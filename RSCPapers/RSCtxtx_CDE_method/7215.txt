A set of conjugated polymers based on poly(triphenylamine-phenothiazine) with carboxylic acid side groups have been synthesized and utilized as sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The polymers feature a conjugated side-chain consisting of a thiophene unit (PPAT4), alternating with either 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT, PPAT5) or EDOT–thiophene (PPAT6) as the π-bridge. This methodology constitutes a consolidated step to adjust the molecular HOMO and LUMO energy levels of dyes, hence red-shifting and broadening the absorption spectra of a conjugated polymer. Compared with the model compound (PAT), the polymers exhibit a higher molar extinction coefficient throughout the visible region, and a better photovoltaic performance in DSSCs with I−/I3− electrolyte. Interestingly, depending on the Suzuki coupling reaction, we obtain a fairly high degree of polymerization (DP values are 58, 46, and 38 for PPAT4, PPAT5 and PPAT6, respectively) based on the three polymers. More encouraging is that when using the high DP polymers as sensitizers, photoelectrochemical tests based on the DSSC format demonstrate a power conversion efficiency of 4.7%, 3.7% and 4.1% for PPAT4, PPAT5 and PPAT6, respectively, under the illumination of AM1.5G and 100 mW cm−2. This presented a considerably high photo-to-electric conversion efficiency in polymer dye-sensitized solar cells, outperforming all polymer dye-sensitized solar cells previously reported.

As a critical component in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), sensitizers manage the responsibility of capturing light and thus play a crucial role in determining the performance of solar cells. Photo-sensitizers such as metal complexes and metal-free organic dyes serve as efficient light harvesters for DSSCs. Among the current designs of organic sensitizers for light capture technologies, the donor-π bridge-acceptor (D–π–A) configuration is the mainstream due to its convenient modulation of the intramolecular charge-transfer nature. Moreover, arylamine based sensitizers for DSSCs have received great attention in the last decade because of their high molar absorption coefficient, low cost and structural variety.

Inspired by polymer solar cells (PSCs), conjugated polymers feature the advantages of sufficiently large absorption coefficient, tunable band gaps spanning a broad portion of the visible and near-infrared spectra and excellent structural stability. Given the versatile optical and semiconductor properties of conjugated polymers, it is possible that the properties of DSSCs could be improved by incorporating them into the cells as sensitizers. Liu et al. synthesized a conjugated polymer dye (P2, DP: ∼10) containing an electron donating backbone (triphenylamine) and an electron accepting side chain (cyanoacetic acid) with conjugated thiophene units as the linkers and achieved a power conversion efficiency of 3.39%. The Beak group reported a conjugated polymer (RCP-1) composed of carbazole as an electron donor and a side chain cyanoacetic acid as an electron acceptor connected through conjugated vinylene and terthiophene. Behaving as a photosensitizer in DSSCs, RCP-1 with the well-defined D–π–A structure obtained the power conversion efficiency over 4% as well as good operation stability. Tan et al. reported a series of hyperbranched conjugated polymers with the same conjugated core structure and different functional terminal units. Utilizing such polymers as active layers in DSSCs, a highest power conversion efficiency of 3.93% was demonstrated. Despite continuous progress in polymer dye-sensitized solar cells (PDSSCs) in the past years, there is still an efficiency gap to fill when compared to the non-polymer dye counterpart. This presents an ardent need for an insightful understanding of the structure–property relationship of chromophores in polymer dyes so as to expedite future development of promising sensitizers.
From the experience drawn on small molecular D–π–A dyes, the push–pull structure of D–π–A dyes can induce intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor to the acceptor through the π-bridge when it absorbs light, which is important for light harvesting. The polymer dyes with the so-called ‘D–π–A’ structure (the main chain as donors and the pendent side chain as acceptors connected with π conjugated units) have attracted researcher's interest. Earlier research studies were mainly focused on polythiophene and its derivatives with carboxylic acid units while their overall efficiencies remain low. Recently, most of our interests have evolved around developing high efficiency D–π–A polymer dyes. We synthesized a series of polymer dyes based on triarylated amine, phenothiazine, carbazole and/or fluorine with a short chain length (DP: ∼4), which served as effective sensitizers in DSSCs with relatively high IPCE (>70%) and a power conversion efficiency of 4.4%. The research demonstrated that when using a poly(triphenylamine-carbazole) as the backbone, a higher Jsc was obtained and resulted in a higher conversion efficiency. Those polymers offer several specific advantages when they are applied as sensitizers in DSSCs. For example, the electron donating ability of the donor could be tuned via varying the Dx unit in the D–Dx backbone structure, thus it could be helpful to promote the intramolecular charge transfer. Additionally, varying the π-bridges is an effective strategy to tune the absorption spectra as well as the HOMO and LUMO levels of dyes. However, there has been no report on studies systemically investigating the influence of π moieties in PDSSCs until now. In this work, we attempt to demonstrate the influence of varying the π conjugate moieties of the polymer dyes on the absorption, electrochemistry and photovoltaic properties.
On the other hand, the polymer molecular weight has a significant influence on the performance of PDSSCs. Zhen F. et al. demonstrated an inverse correlation between the polymer chain length and cell performance, by using a series of polymers featuring a π-conjugated backbone consisting of an electron-poor 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole unit, alternating with either a thiophene–fluorene–thiophene triad or a terthiophene segment as the donor and obtained the best power conversion efficiency of ∼3% with Mn ∼ 4000. The S. Ramakrishna group reported three poly(3-hexylthiophene) end-capped with cyanoacetic acid (CA) or a rhodanine-3-acetic acid anchoring groups as an acceptor. These polymer based DSSCs showed that a shorter chain length (approximately 15 thiophene units) linked to the CA binding group resulted in higher performances exceeding 3%.
As part of an ongoing project dealing with the development of high performance PDSSCs, herein we design and synthesize a series of polymer dyes (Scheme 1) based on triphenylamine (TPA). In order to study the relationship between the structure and performance of polymer dyes, we altered the Dx unit (phenothiazine (PTZ)) and changed the bridge by thiophene and/or its derivative EDOT (EDOT is a stronger electron donating unit relative to thiophene), to form three polymer dyes, namely PPAT4, PPAT5 and PPAT6. The long alkyl side chains that are linked to the PTZ units facilitate the polymer solubility. For comparison, the performance of model molecule PAT was given as a reference, which has a similar structure to the polymers. In addition, we used the Suzuki coupling reaction to build a series of high DP polymers. As a result, we successfully synthesized three polymers (Fig. 1) with a number-average molecular weight (Mn) exceeding 30000, and surprisingly found that the DSSCs based on these polymers exhibited a relatively good photovoltaic performance (η > 4%).

Toluene and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were distilled over sodium/benzophenone before use. Phenothiazine was purchased from Inno-Chem Science & Technology Co., Ltd. N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS), cyanoacetic acid, piperidine, 5-formyl-2-thiopheneboronic acid, and 1-bromo-iso-octane were purchased from Energy-Chemical and used as received. Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (Pd(PPh3)4), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (EMITFSI), 1,3-dimethyl imidazole iodine (DMII), guanidine thiocyanate (GNCS) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Other reagents and solvents were purchased commercially as analytical-grade quality and used without further purification unless otherwise stated.


Electronic absorption spectra were measured on an Agilent G1103A spectrometer. Emission spectra were recorded with a Perkin Elmer LS55 luminescence spectrometer. The emitted light was detected with a Hamamatsu R928 red-sensitive photomultiplier. A computer-controlled RST5200 electrochemical workstation was used for cyclic voltammetry measurements with a three-electrode electrochemical cell. Cyclic voltammetry of the oxidation behavior of the dyes was performed in dry DMF containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexaflourophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte (working electrode, glassy carbon; reference electrode, Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) calibrated with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as an internal reference; counter electrode, Pt).


The ground state geometries were optimized by employing the hybrid B3LYP function and a 6-31G** basis set, which have been widely used in the calculation of organic photo-electric materials. Vertical excitation energies were calculated by TD-DFT at MPW1K/6-31G** levels. The effect of the solvent (THF) on the geometries and absorption spectra has been simulated by the C-PCM method. All calculations were carried out with the Gaussian 03 program package.


A screen-printed double layer film of interconnected TiO2 particles was used as the mesoporous negative electrode. A 7 μm thick transparent layer of 20 nm sized titania particles was first printed on the fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) conducting glass electrode and further coated by a 5 μm thick scattering layer of 400 nm sized titania particles. The film thickness was measured with a benchtop Ambios XP-1 stylus profilometer. A cycloidal TiO2 electrode (∼0.28 cm2) was stained by immersing it into a dye solution containing PAT, PPAT4, PPAT5 and PPAT6 and the sensitizer (200 μg mL−1) in THF:AN (v/v, 1/1) for 10 h. After being washed with acetonitrile and dried by air flow, the sensitized titania electrode was assembled with a thermally platinized FTO electrode. The electrodes were separated by a 35 μm thick Bynel (DuPont) hot-melt gasket and sealed up by heating. The internal space was filled with a liquid electrolyte using a vacuum backfilling system. The electrolyte-injecting hole on the counter electrode glass substrate, made with a sand-blasting drill, was sealed with a Bynel sheet and a thin glass covered by heating. Two electrolytes were used for device evaluation. The infiltrated electrolyte is composed of 1.0 M DMII, 0.02 M iodine (I2), TBP, 0.1 M GNCS and 0.05 M LiI in AN.


A Keithley 2400 source meter and a Zolix Omni-λ300 monochromator equipped with a 500 W xenon lamp were used for the measurements of photocurrent action spectra, with a wavelength sampling interval of 10 nm and a current sampling time of 2 s under the full computer control. A Hamamatsu S1337 1010BQ silicon diode used for IPCE measurements was calibrated in National Institute of Metrology, China. During the photocurrent action spectrum measurements, a white light-emitting diode was used to bias a testing cell with ∼1.0 mA cm2 background current. A model LS1000 4S-AM 1.5G-1000-W solar simulator (Solar Light Company, USA) in combination with a metal mesh was employed to provide an irradiance of 100 mW cm2. The light intensity was tested with a PMA2144 pyranometer and a calibrated PMA 2100 dose control system. J–V characteristics were obtained by applying a bias potential to a testing cell and measuring the photocurrent with a Keithley 2602 source meter under the full computer control. The measurements were fully automated using Labview 8.0. A metal mask with an aperture area of 0.158 cm2 was covered on a testing cell during all measurements. An antireflection film (λ < 380 nm, ARKTOP, ASAHI Glass) was adhered to the DSSC photoanode during IPCE and J–V measurements. The short-circuit photocurrent densities were measured under this solar simulator which are well consistent with the integral of IPCEs over the AM1.5G spectrum (ASTMG173 03), within 5% errors.


The molecular weights were measured in CHCl3 (0.1 mg mL−1) by Gel permeation chromatography (WATRES 2414) with three columns in a series, from 1000–1000000, using polystyrene (PS) as a guide sample.


The synthesis routes to the monomers (M1–M4) and the polymers (PPAT4, PPAT5, and PPAT6) are shown in Scheme 1. The preparation details of their intermediates are presented in the literature. Polymer intermediates were carried out through the palladium (0)-catalyzed Suzuki coupling reactions and the dye molecules were prepared as follows, using the conventional Knoevenagel condensation reaction.

The synthesis procedure for precursor 3-bromo-10-(octan-3-yl)-10H-phenothiazine was the same as that of S1. After purification, a colorless viscous oily liquid (68%) was obtained. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz, ppm): 7.35–7.40 (d, 2H), 7.16–7.25 (d, 2H), 6.90–7.10 (m, 3H). MS: m/z = 390.4.

MS: m/z = 437.5.

A mixture of one polymer intermediate (0.5 mmol in a repeat unit), cyanoacetic acid (1.5 mmol), piperidine (0.5 mL) and CHCl3 (20 mL) was refluxed for 12 h under argon. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was washed with 2 M HCl (20 mL) and the organic portion was dried with anhydrous MgSO4. The solvent was removed by evaporation to yield the final product. After purification, a dark red filmy solid (35.7%) was obtained. 1H NMR (DMSO, 500 MHz, ppm): 12.86 (m, 1H), 8.0–6.25 (m, 20H), 1.6–0.8 (m, 17H). GPC: Mn (4.3 kDa).

The synthesis procedure for precursor 5-(4-((4-(10-(octan-3-yl)-10H-phenothiazin-3-yl) phenyl) (phenyl)amino) phenyl) thiophene-2-carbaldehyde was followed using the same procedure as that of PAT. After purification, a red solid (55%) was obtained. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz, ppm): 9.90 (s, 1H), 8.00 (d, 2H), 7.64 (d, 2H), 7.10–7.25 (m, 7H), 6.80–7.00 (m, 4H), 6.60–6.65 (d, 6H), 2.61 (m, 1H), 1.45–1.60 (m, 4H), 0.80 (t, 6H).

GC-MS: m/z = 731.97.

The structures of the polymers and their synthetic routes are outlined in Scheme 1 and detailed synthesis and characterization data are summarized as well. The starting monomers M1 and M3 were synthesized according to the traditional methods: monobromination, then Suzuki-coupling, and finally dibromination. This sequence of reactions guaranteed accurate reaction sites. The synthesis of M4 was achieved according to the procedure in a DMF and n-BuLi system given by Shen et al. To overcome the inconvenience brought by the high boiling point solvent (DMF) and the operation risk of n-BuLi, we developed an easier synthesis procedure for M4 in this work, according to a modified procedure, similar to the synthesis of M2. The synthesis of monomer M2 was well described by Chi et al. They synthesized 7-bromo-2,3-dihydrothieno3,4-b1,4 dioxine-5-carbaldehyde firstly and then treated it with 4-(diphenylamino) phenylboronic acid. To simplify the experimental procedure, we utilized Suzuki coupling and then Vilsmeier reaction to construct –CHO onto the basic structure.

Monomers (M1–M4) were characterized by 1H NMR and mass spectrometry (MS). The three polymer intermediates M1a, M2b and M3c are carried out through the palladium(0)-catalyzed Suzuki coupling reactions between triphenylamine dibromide monomers M1–M3 and diboronic esters of (10-(2-ethylhexyl)-3,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-10H-phenothiazine). The polymerization was carried out for over 3 days using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst in a two-phase mixture of excess toluene and aqueous K2CO3 (2 M). The obtained polymers were further purified by extracting on a Soxhlet apparatus using methanol and hexane for 48 h and later by CH2Cl2, after removing most of the small molecules. And finally, CHCl3 was used to dissolve the polymer, when the residue on the filter paper became colorless after four days, and the filtrates were finally dried under reduced pressure at room temperature. After purification and drying, all polymers were obtained as dark solids in overall good yields (70–76%). Following the polymerization reaction, the polymer dyes were synthesized via the Knoevenagel condensation reaction between aldehyde and cyanoacetic acid in the presence of piperidine. All polymers can fully dissolve in some common organic solvents, such as THF, CHCl3, toluene and chlorobenzene at room temperature after an ultrasonic treatment. The 1H NMR spectra of the polymers feature a strong resonance at 6.9–7.5 ppm with an inconspicuous coupling splitting indicating that macromolecular compounds are successfully obtained. In addition, the spectra of the acid forms of the polymers feature a weak resonance at δ ≈ 12.9 ppm confirming the introduction of –COOH groups.
The molecular weight of the polymers was determined in CHCl3 (0.1 mg mL−1) by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The results of the measurement are presented in Table 1. All the three polymers have relatively high DP. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of PPAT4 is 43 kDa, corresponding to a degree of polymerization (DP) of 58, with a polydispersity index of 1.8. The Mn of PPAT5 and PPAT6 was found to be 37 kDa and 33 kDa, respectively, with the corresponding polydispersity indices (PDI = Mw/Mn) of 2.1 and 2.2. The values of the DP decrease in the order of PPAT4 > PPAT5 > PPAT6, which may be due to the space steric hindrance increase with the increase of monomer molecular weight.

The light-harvesting and fluorescence-emission capacities were probed by recording the UV-visible absorption spectra and fluorescence spectra (Fig. 2 and 3) of PPAT4, PPAT5 and PPAT6 in THF (200 μg mL−1) with a process of ultrasonic concussion for 15 minutes. For comparison, the absorption and emission spectra of the model molecule PAT are also included with a concentration of 200 μg mL−1 in THF. The detailed parameters are listed in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 2, all the dyes have two distinct absorption peaks, where the peaks at ∼350 nm are attributed to the π–π* transitions of their conjugated polymer backbones. The peaks at ∼500 nm correspond to the ICT (intramolecular charge transfer) interactions between the polymer main chains and pendent acceptor groups. The two-band absorption is typical for D–A type conjugated dyes.

Note that the visible transition is red-shifted in PPAT6 as compared to PAT, PPAT4 and PPAT5. This effect may be due to the extended π-bridge by using the EDOT–thiophene unit as compared to thiophene. Such red-shift behaviour for PPAT6 is beneficial from the standpoint of visible light harvesting, as the absorption of these polymers overlaps better with the solar spectrum. In addition, the visible transition has hardly any red-shift in PPAT5 as compared to PPAT4, which is probably due to the two polymers sharing the same length of the π-bridge. The model molecule PAT (repeat unit of PPAT4) exhibits similar π–π* transitions and ICT peaks to the polymers.
The extinction coefficient (ε) at the ICT peaks for the monomer PAT is only 4.3 × 103 (mg mL−1) cm−1, while the values for the polymers are significantly larger. For example, the extinction coefficient values for PPTAT4, PPAT5 and PPAT6 are 9.5 × 103, 5.1 × 103 and 1.31 × 104 (mg mL−1) cm−1, respectively, which demonstrate the superiority of adsorption capacities of polymers when compared to small molecules. Note that the maximum extinction coefficient for PPAT6 is on the ICT absorption peaks, while PPAT4 and PPAT5 are both on π–π* transition absorption peaks. This effect is probably related to the increasing extent of the π-bridge of PPAT6 and consequently increased the HOMO level and ultimately narrowed the band-gap.
As illustrated in Fig. 3, model compound PAT and polymers PPAT4, PPAT5 and PPAT6 exhibit fluorescence in the visible region. The corresponding emission maxima are listed in Table 2. The model compound PAT features a weak red fluorescence with λmax ∼ 629 nm and a Stokes shift (peak to peak) of ca. 172 nm (∼1.0 eV). PPAT6 demonstrates a strong fluorescence with λmax ∼ 638 nm and a Stokes shift of ca. 146 nm (∼1.0 eV), indicating a strong intrachain charge transfer character in the singlet excited state. The fluorescence spectrum of the polymers PPAT4 and PPAT5 blue-shifted considerably relative to that of PPAT6. Specifically, PPAT4 exhibits weak fluorescence with λmax ∼ 586 nm, while PPAT5 also exhibits weak fluorescence with λmax ∼ 584 nm. Both PPAT4 and PPAT5 exhibit Stokes shifts in excess of 200 nm (∼1.0 eV, the excitation wavelength is 334 and 347 nm, respectively). The large Stoke shifts suggest a significant energy loss upon photo-excitation, which is most possibly attributed to the twisted diphenylamine-side chain or triphenylamine-thiophene/EDOT interaction and/or intramolecular charge transfer.
To fabricate an efficient DSSC, the favorite energy-offsets of dye molecules with respect to the titania nanocrystals and redox electrolytes are of great significance. The E0–0 values (zero–zero transition energies) were estimated from the intersection points of normalized absorption and emission spectra (Fig. 4) of 200 μg mL−1 dye solution (THF), being 2.29 eV, 2.37 eV, 2.42 eV and 2.19 eV for PAT, PPAT4, PPAT5 and PPAT6, respectively.
The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the polymers are also important parameters in the design of optoelectronic devices. These values can be estimated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials. The onset oxidation potentials (Eox) are 0.57 for PAT, 0.64 V for PPAT4, 0.63 V for PPAT5 and 0.82 V for PPAT6, and the spectra are collected in Fig. 5. The HOMO energy levels of the polymers were estimated according to the following equation:
EHOMO = −(Eox − E(Fc/Fc+) + 4.8) eV
where the unit of
Eox is V vs. Fc/Fc+. The HOMO levels of PAT, PPAT4, PPAT5 and PPAT6, calculated in this way, are −4.97, −5.04, −5.03 and 5.15 eV, respectively. Since we could not obtain reliable onset reduction potentials for the investigated polymers, the optical band gaps (Eg) of the polymer (which were calculated from the intersection points of normalized absorption and emission spectra) were utilized to estimate the LUMO energy levels based on the relation of E0–0 = ELUMO − EHOMO. The estimated LUMO energy levels of PPAT4, PPAT5 and PPAT6 are 2.68, −2.67 eV, −2.61 eV and −2.96 eV, respectively. The potentials are well exceeding the conduction band level of TiO2. Therefore, electron injections from the single excited state (LUMO) of three polymer dyes into the conduction band of TiO2 are energetically feasible, according to the band bending theory. In addition, their oxidation potentials are sufficiently more positive than the redox potential of the iodine/iodide (I−/I3−) couple. Therefore, the photo-oxidized polymer dyes could be efficiently reduced by iodide ions.


In order to observe the trend of frontier orbital energy and electronic cloud distribution at the theoretical level, the dimers and repeat units of the polymers are optimized by density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed at the B3LYP/6-31G (+d) level with Gaussian 09. Fig. 6 shows the optimized molecular structure and frontier molecular orbitals of the dimers for PPAT4, PPAT5 and PPAT6 and corresponding repeat units. The bulky N-alkyl chain was not included in the calculation to avoid excessive computation demand, since they do not significantly affect the equilibrium geometry and thus the electronic properties. All CC bonds outside the aromatic rings were set to be in trans configuration. Note that the dihedral angle between TPA and PTZ is ∼35°, whereas for TPA and thiophene it is ∼12°, and for TPA and EDOT it is ∼8°. The dihedral angle between TPA and EDOT appears to be much smaller, which is probably due to the hydrogen-bond interaction between the oxygen in EDOT and hydrogen in TPA. For repeat units, the HOMO is delocalized on the PTZ unit and partially localized on the triphenylamine unit. The LUMO is mainly localized on the acceptor part, and partially on the π-bridge and TPA unit. The electron redistribution between the HOMO and LUMO shows a pronounced intramolecular charge separation for this transition. However, the dimers exhibit different electronic cloud distributions with repeat units, of which, the HOMO is almost distributed across the whole backbone (donor), while the LUMO is mainly located in one of the acceptor units. Nevertheless, assuming a similar orbital geometry between the free polymer and the polymer that is anchored to TiO2, the excited electrons can be efficiently injected into the conduction band of TiO2via the carbonyl group adjacent to the cyano group.


Fig. 7 summarizes the calculated HOMO and LUMO levels of the repeat units and dimer for PPAT4, PPAT5 and PPAT6 as well as the energy level of TiO2 and I−/I3−. We note that the repeat units and dimers have similar LUMO values (∼−2.7 eV). This would be reasonable considering that the structures share the same acceptor unit, which determines the LUMO level. We also find that the HOMO level increases with the different π-bridges varying from thiophene to EDOT–thiophene for both repeat units and dimers, which should be attributed to the extended π-bridge for PPAT6. The HOMO levels are more negative for dimers when compared to the repeat units, which indicates that the extended conjugate chain of the donor can improve the electron donating ability of the dye.


Fig. 8 shows the average photocurrent action spectra of DSSCs (7 + 5 μm thick bilayer titania films coated with PAT, PPAT4, PPAT5 and PPAT6 in THF/AN v/v, 1/1, 200 μg mL−1, after a process of ultrasonic concussion for 15 minutes in THF, then AN was added and stirred for over 1 h) for over 12 cells. The average error of the photovoltaic parameters is less than 5%. The incident photon-to-collected electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) performances of three polymer dyes as well as PAT are mainly located in the 300–600 nm regions. In particular, the cells fabricated with PAT have the lowest peak external quantum efficiency of ca. 17.8% whereas the PPAT4 cell has the highest IPCE peak of 63.5%, and those of PPAT5 and PPAT6 are 34.2% and 56.5%, respectively. In addition, the IPCE response extends into the near infrared region for PPAT4 and PPAT6, whereas the photocurrent response for PPAT5 is nil for λ > 630 nm. Importantly, the peak IPCE observed for PPAT4 and PPAT6 is over 55%, indicating that at short-circuit photoinduced charge injection is quite efficient for the polymer sensitizers.

The most significant point with respect to the IPCE data in Fig. 8 is the fact that the maximum IPCE for the PPAT series increases in the order of PAT < PPAT5 < PPAT6 < PPAT4. The lowest maximum IPCE of PAT has been anything short of exceptional, since the lower molar absorption coefficient of PAT leads to lower incident photon-to-collected electron conversion efficiency, which has been identified by many research groups. We find that PPAT5 shows lower maximum IPCE than PPAT4 and PPAT6, which could be attributed to the weaker absorption spectra of PPAT5. Interestingly, the IPCE peak of PPAT4 is higher than the other two polymers, which is inconsistent with the absorption spectra mentioned above. Note that PPAT4 has the largest degree of polymerization, so this result is possibly related to the adsorption capacity of the polymer at the TiO2 interface, but it is difficult to get reliable adsorption data of polymers, due to the complex molecular weight distribution of the polymer, nevertheless, we will add in our next work.
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics under simulated AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm2) are presented in Fig. 9. The performances of the cells in terms of open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and overall power conversion efficiency (η) along with the maximum IPCE values are summarized in Table 3. Note that the short current for the polymers and model molecule is in accordance with the intensity of the IPCE peaks. The photovoltaic parameters (Jsc, Voc, FF and η) of the cells based on PAT (repeat unit of PPAT4) are 6.91 mA cm−2, 660 mV, 0.66 and 3.0%, respectively. However, we find that the cells based on polymer dyes have significantly enhanced the performance, both Voc and Jsc increase considerably, suggesting that there are advantages of using the D–π–A polymer rather than using small molecular dyes, which is largely because of the polymer having a larger absorption coefficient.

In addition, we note that PPAT4 has a better photovoltaic performance than that of PPAT5 and PPAT6. For example, the polymer PPAT4 based DSSC has a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 10.87 mA cm−2, open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 720 mV, fill factor (FF) of 0.60, and an overall solar-to-electric conversion efficiency (η) of 4.7%. While the photovoltaic parameters (Jsc, Voc, FF and η) of the cells based on PPAT5 and PPAT6 are 700 mV, 8.05 mA, 0.65, 3.7% and 650 mV, 9.8 mA, 0.64, 4.1%, respectively. As shown in Table 3, PPAT4 has the highest power conversion efficiency. The reason is that the Voc of PPAT4 is obviously higher than that of the other two polymers. Therefore, we will use electrochemical impedance to make a further analysis. When the EDOT unit is replaced with an EDOT–thiophene unit in the side chain, the PPAT6 based DSSC, in particular, shows a better performance than PPAT5 and we can attribute this increase to the extended side chain, which results in a higher and broadened absorption spectrum.
What is surprising is the incredible device stability of the polymer based DSSCs. After disposal in the natural environment for over 13 months without any other treatment, the cell average photoelectric conversion efficiency of PPAT4, PPAT5 and PPAT6 is still ∼4%, ∼3% and ∼3.2%, respectively, with a decrease less than 20%. But the average photoelectric conversion efficiency for model molecule PAT decreases to below 1% after one month, under the same conditions. However, the cause of this result needs further study.

To further elucidate the photovoltaic results, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was employed to study interface charge transfer processes in DSSCs based on PAT, PPAT4, PPAT5 and PPAT6. The Nyquist plots are displayed in Fig. 10. The small semicircle in the higher frequency range is attributed to the charge transfer resistance (Rce) at the counter electrolyte interface, while the larger semicircle in the lower frequency region reflects the recombination resistance (Rrec) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.Rce values are obtained in the high frequency region as 22.7 Ω cm−2 for PAT, 53.7 Ω cm−2 for PPAT4, 17.6 Ω cm−2 for PPAT5 and 51.2 Ω cm−2 for PPAT6 by using the same counter electrode and electrolyte, while the diverse dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 films cause the difference of Rrec. As shown in Table 4, the values of the large semicircles decrease in the order of PPAT4 (101.7 Ω cm−2) > PPAT5 (64.5 Ω cm−2) > PAT (43.3 Ω cm−2) > PPAT6 (29.1 Ω cm−2). A smaller Rrec indicates a faster charge recombination and a larger dark current. Therefore, the largest Rrec observed in PPAT4 sensitized cells indicates that PPAT4 possesses more effective suppression of the recombination of the injected electron with I−/I3− in the electrolyte. And the charge density of the TiO2 film of PPAT4 based cells is higher than the other two dyes; this phenomenon is reflected in the trend of the Voc. The electron lifetimes calculated by fitting the equation τr = Rrec × CPE2 (CPE2, chemical capacitance) are 18.0, 108.5, 46.8 and 7.4 ms for PAT, PPAT4, PPAT5 and PPAT6, respectively. The trend of electron lifetimes is in the order of PPAT4 > PPAT5 > PAT > PPAT6. The higher charge lifetime of PPAT4 demonstrates a greater charge recombination resistance at the dye/electrolyte interface, indicating that the large DP of PPAT4 can effectively block the contact of the electrolyte and TiO2.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a series of new polymer dyes of triphenylamine (TPA) and phenothiazine (PTZ) with a cyanoacrylic acid acceptor containing different conjugated units thiophene and/or EDOT polymers as efficient sensitizers in DSSCs. By systematically changing the conjugated units as thiophene and/or EDOT, we obtained three polymer dyes (PPAT4, PPAT5 and PPAT6) and several significant results. Firstly, by some synthetic means such as the Suzuki coupling reaction, we obtain three fairly high DP (Mn > 38 kDa) polymers and successfully used them as sensitizers for DSSCs. Secondly, via changing the π-bridge, the electronic properties and energy levels of the resulted copolymers were effectively tuned, which, to a certain extent, affected the absorption spectrum and the photovoltaic characteristics. Thirdly, the polymers exhibit comparable light-absorption properties and photovoltaic performances to the model compound, indicating that the polymers could be candidate sensitizers for DSSCs. Finally, surprisingly, the above studies have illustrated that polymers with large molecular weight can also exhibit high cell performance, with an optimum value reached for samples having Mn > 50 kDa. Although the length and type of the side chain to a certain extent affect the photophysics and photovoltaics characteristics, the effects of molecular weight are clearly seen in photovoltaics properties in solar cell performance. It is likely that in future work, it will be possible to use polymer synthetic methods to control and optimize the structure and chain length of D–π–A type conjugated polymers for applications in the hybrid cell format, however, there are still some issues need to be solved, such as the directional assembly and anchor gesture of polymers on the surface of TiO2, which may be the significant factor affecting the electron injection efficiency.
