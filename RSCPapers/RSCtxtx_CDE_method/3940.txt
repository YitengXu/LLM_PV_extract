Lead-free halide perovskites have great potential as stable and nontoxic optoelectronic materials. As a promising photovoltaic candidate, AgBiI4 has attracted attention due to its eco-friendly properties and strong stability, but the energy conversion efficiency (PCE) is still low and more effort towards improving the film quality is needed for photovoltaic applications. Here, we synthesized AgBiI4 films by antisolvent treatments with chlorobenzene (CB), toluene (TL), and isopropanol (IPA), respectively, and the corresponding solar cells of ITO/SnO2/AgBiI4/PTAA/Au were fabricated. Our data indicate that the IPA-treated AgBiI4 film has better microstructural quality and higher photovoltaic performance than the other-treated films. Furthermore, the PCE of the cells is enhanced from 0.82% to 1.61% upon IPA-treatment. This study suggests that besides a suitable relative polarity, an antisolvent with a lower boiling point and a higher miscibility with the host solvent is preferred in improving the AgBiI4 film quality and enhancing the photovoltaic performance of AgBiI4-based solar cells.

Organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites have outstanding optoelectronic properties, including a suitable energy band gap, high light absorption, and high carrier mobility, but the toxicity of lead (Pb) hampers the commercialization of high-efficiency solar cells. To address this issue, one strategy is to replace Pb2+ with an element in the same group (e.g. Sn2+ or Ge2+) that has a similar valence electronic configuration. Sn-based perovskites have outstanding optoelectronic properties but pose the difficulty of chemical instability because Sn2+ has a significant tendency to form stable oxygenated Sn4+. The other strategy is to replace Pb2+ with Bi3+ or Sb3+ because of the similar ionic radii and the same 6s26p0 electronic configuration. Compared to Sn2+ and Ge2+, Bi3+ is a promising and stable metal ion and Bi-based halide semiconductors are potential candidates for lead-free solar cells.

As a result of element replacement of Pb with Bi in lead halide perovskites, A3Bi2X9 (A = CH3NH3, Cs; X = I, Br) is chemically stable but has low structural and electronic dimensionality, a large energy band gap (>2.1 eV), and large carrier effective mass, which limit the solar cell applications. Previous investigations revealed that the low dimensional materials usually have worse photoelectrical properties than the high dimensional materials. In this system, replacement of the A-site cation with transition metal Ag+ connects the neighboring iodobismuthate units and achieves AgxBiyIx+3y rudorffites (e.g. AgBiI4, AgBi2I7, Ag2BiI5, Ag3BiI6, AgBi3I10), which exhibit the three-dimensional and edge-shared [AgI6] and [BiI6] octahedra structure and have been proven to have good stability and a suitable direct optical band gap for photovoltaic applications (1.63–1.87 eV). Among them, AgBiI4 has attracted attention since it is eco-friendly and shows strong thermal stability, photostability, and long-term air stability.
Recently, AgBiI4 film has been synthesized by a simple spin-coating and subsequent annealing method. The film's crystalline quality and morphology strongly influence the photoelectrical properties. For obtaining high quality films, an antisolvent treatment is usually used during the spin-coating process to control the AgBiI4 crystallization process from the solution. The addition of antisolvent rapidly reduces the solubility of solute and thereby can increase the nucleation sites and form a dense film. According to the similarity-intermiscibility theory, the polar hydrophilic material AgBiI4 is easily dissolved in polar solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dimethylformamide (DMF), but is difficult to dissolve in non-polar solvents. Therefore, solvents with low polarity such as chlorobenzene (CB) and toluene (TL) can be used as antisolvents during the fabrication of AgBiI4 film to control the crystallization process. However, the fabricated AgBiI4 films in previous reports exhibit poor morphology and poor photovoltaic performances that are still far from ideal.
To obtain a high-quality perovskite film through antisolvent engineering, the choice of a suitable antisolvent becomes a key point. Besides the polarity consideration, both the boiling point and proper miscibility with the host solvent are important parameters to be considered for antisolvent selection. It is understood that a lower boiling temperature antisolvent will quickly evaporate out of the precursor solution and hence leave less time for subsequent crystal growth, while a high boiling temperature will hinder the complete solvent evaporation from the perovskite film during the thermal annealing process, which is harmful to the formation of a high-quality perovskite film. Besides, the miscibility of the antisolvent with the host solvent influences the diffusion in the precursor solution and thereafter influences the film quality. Compared with CB and TL, isopropanol (IPA) is eco-friendly and has a more applicable boiling point and higher miscibility with the frequently-used host solvents (DMF and DMSO etc.).
In this work, we intend to synthesize AgBiI4 films using antisolvent treatment with CB, TL, and IPA, respectively, not only for comparison experiments. The AgBiI4 films are used to fabricate solar cells with the ITO/SnO2/AgBiI4/PTAA/Au configuration. The crystallinity and morphology of the as-prepared films and photovoltaic performance of the as-fabricated solar cells demonstrate that the IPA-treated AgBiI4 films have better microstructural quality and higher photovoltaic performance than the other films. This study indicates that the antisolvent treatment strategy is efficient by properly choosing the relative polarity, boiling point, and miscibility with the host solvent, and furthermore suggests the remarkable benefit in improving the photovoltaic performance of AgBiI4 film-based solar cells.


Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD patterns of AgBiI4 films without and with the treatments of CB, TL and IPA as an antisolvent, respectively. The peaks at 12.85°, 24.1°, 29.41° and 39.15°, are assigned to the (111), (311), (400) and (333) lattice plane reflections of the AgBiI4 crystal, respectively, indicating the high crystallinity of all the AgBiI4 films. Both the (111)/(400) and (111)/(311) peak intensity ratios are enhanced after the antisolvent treatment, indicating a preferred orientation along the (111) direction. Besides, Fig. 1(b) indicates that the antisolvent treatment reduces the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (111) peak, with ∼0.212° for no antisolvent, ∼0.195° for TL, ∼0.145° for CB, and ∼0.117° for IPA, respectively, implying the enlargement of the grain size and the improvement of the crystallinity after the antisolvent treatment. Compared with the CB- and TL-treated films, the IPA-treated film has the highest peak intensity ratio and the smallest FWHM, suggesting that IPA as an antisolvent is better than CB and TL in improving the crystal growth of the AgBiI4 film, noting that a tiny peak (marked with #) at 25.87° corresponds to a low-level impurity of the Ag2BiI5 phase, which is shown in all the films.


Fig. 1(c) shows the optical absorption spectra of AgBiI4 films. The antisolvent treatments with CB, TL, and IPA obviously raise the absorption at the low wavelength region. Besides, the corresponding Tauc plot (inset of Fig. 1(c)) indicates that the band-gap is ∼1.71 eV for no antisolvent, ∼1.75 eV for IPA, ∼1.76 eV for TL, and ∼1.86 eV for CB, which are in the earlier reported range (1.63–1.87 eV). It is known that the introduction of defects might possibly lead to the absorption at the band edge in the gap and cause the red-shift of the fitted band-gap. The lower absorption and the lower band-gap of the non-treated film implies that the non-treated film has more defects and a poorer film quality. The higher absorption of the IPA-treated film indicates that IPA is better than TL and CB as the antisolvent in improving the light absorption properties of AgBiI4 films.

Fig. 2(a)–(d) present the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of AgBiI4 films on the ITO/glass substrate without and with the antisolvent treatment. The thin-films fabricated via the antisolvent treatments with CB, TL, and IPA, respectively, exhibit better surface coverage and uniform morphology as compared to the thin film without antisolvent treatment. However, some pinholes are still observed in the films treated with TL and CB, as shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c). In contrast, the IPA-treated film is dense and pinhole-free, as shown in Fig. 2(d). Besides, the grain size distributions obtained from these SEM images indicate that the average grain sizes are 205 nm, 249 nm, 293 nm, and 356 nm for no antisolvent, TL, CB, and IPA, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2(e)–(h). This indicates that the IPA-treated film has the largest average grain size and this is consistent with the change in the FWHM of the (111) peaks.
It is usually believed that the dripping of antisolvent with a lower polarity would give a stronger driving force for generating more nucleation sites from the polar precursor solution and thereafter give a denser perovskite film. In this context, IPA can be used as the antisolvent because of the lower polarity (4.3) than the used solvent mixture [DMF (6.4) and DMSO (7.2), with a volume ratio of 1:1], but is not the best antisolvent for driving the nucleation since IPA has a higher polarity compared with CB and TL, as shown in Table 1. In fact, a recent study revealed that the miscibility of the antisolvent and host solvent also influences the film quality.Table 1 indicates that the solubility parameter of IPA is much closer to those of DMF and DMSO in comparison with CB and TL, which suggests that IPA has a higher miscibility with the solvent mixture than CB and TL. A high miscibility means that the antisolvent molecules can rapidly diffuse into the solution and extract the precursor from the solvent mixture, which promotes the nucleation and growth of the AgBiI4 crystal at more surface sites of the substrate and helps to form a dense and uniform film.

Besides, the evaporation of the host solvent and antisolvent during the spin-coating and heating stages would also influence the film morphology. A higher boiling point of the host solvent and antisolvent will slow down their evaporation and implies that more residual antisolvent and host solvent will remain inside the coated film after the pre-heating stage (110 °C). During the later thermal annealing process (150 °C), some bubbles of liquid mixture (composed by the residual host solvent and antisolvent) might firstly form inside the film because of the quick crystallization of AgBiI4 around them, and then the boiling of the liquid mixture would break these bubbles at the end of the thermal annealing process, thus leaving pinholes in the perovskite film.
To evidence this, we measure the boiling points of the solutions by mixing the solvents with different antisolvents, and the data are shown in Table 1. The boiling points of the CB and TL solutions are ∼154 °C and ∼140 °C, respectively, which are much higher than the pre-heating temperature (110 °C) and close to the thermal annealing temperature (150 °C), so the bubbles possibly appear during the thermal annealing process and the appearance of pin-holes in the film is reasonable. The boiling point of IPA solution is ∼123 °C, which is much lower than those of the CB and TL solutions and is closer to the preheating temperature. Therefore, the IPA solution can be evaporated out of the film more efficiently than the other two solutions during the spin-coating and preheating stages and little IPA is left in the film during the last thermal annealing, which avoids the appearance of pinholes in the film.
In order to reveal the impact of antisolvent treatments on the photovoltaic properties of AgBiI4 films, we fabricate a series of solar cells with ITO/SnO2/AgBiI4/PTAA/Au configuration where the AgBiI4 films are prepared using different antisolvents. The cross-sectional SEM images indicate that the thicknesses of the SnO2, AgBiI4, PTAA, and Au electrode layers are about 30 nm, 210 nm, 80 nm, and 60 nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3(a) and Fig. S2 (ESI). A schematic of the energy-level diagram is shown in Fig. 3(b). The PTAA was selected as the hole transporting layer because of the high ability of hole extraction and small charge recombination. The SnO2 was selected as the electron transporting layer because of the high electron carrier mobility. To better evaluate the photovoltaic performances of the solar cells constructed by the AgBiI4 films without antisolvent treatment (denoted as AgBiI4), with CB treatment (denoted as AgBiI4-CB), TL treatment (denoted as AgBiI4-TL), and IPA treatment (denoted as AgBiI4-IPA), respectively, the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of more than 10 devices of each type were measured under one sun illumination.

Fig. 3(c) shows the J–V curves of the champion efficiencies for the different devices. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) in the device without antisolvent treatment is 0.82%, which is raised to 1.61% in the AgBiI4-IPA device. Besides, the key photovoltaic parameters, including open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE are also listed in Table 2. The devices without antisolvent treatment have poor photovoltaic performance with the PCE of 0.64 ± 0.16%, while the AgBiI4-CB and AgBiI4-TL devices give the PCE of 0.94 ± 0.25% and 1.11 ± 0.14%, respectively, indicating the improvement of performance by the antisolvent treatment. It is evident that the AgBiI4-IPA device has the highest PCE of 1.26 ± 0.14%, which is mostly ascribed to the increases of Voc from 0.47 ± 0.06 to 0.58 ± 0.05 V and Jsc from 2.77 ± 0.66 to 3.89 ± 0.27 mA cm−2. Besides, the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) were measured, which is consistent with the absorption onset of the different films, as shown in Fig. 3(d). In contrast to the device without antisolvent treatment, the EQE is enhanced in the AgBiI4-TL and AgBiI4-CB devices and is largest in the AgBiI4-IPA device, consistent with the variation tendency of Jsc. In addition, we also measured the stability of the devices under continuous white-LED illumination with 100 mW cm−2 in the air (25 °C, 40 ± 10% R.H.). The PCE of the device without antisolvent treatment seriously decays after 22 h, while that of the antisolvent-treated devices does not obviously decay, as shown in Fig. S4 (in the ESI), indicating that the IPA-treated solar cell is more stable than the non-treated device.

The enhancement of the photovoltaic performance in the AgBiI4-IPA device primarily originates from the substantial improvement of the optical absorption and the photocarrier transport. The enhancement of the crystallinity of the AgBiI4 film improves the optical absorption due to the suitable band-gap, and the high quality AgBiI4 film with less defects can reduce the photocarrier recombination and therefore improve the flowing-out of photocarriers through the electron and hole transporting layers. For characterizing the defect density of the different AgBiI4 films, we used the space charge limited current (SCLC) method and measured the dark J–V curves with the device configuration of ITO/AgBiI4/Au, as shown in Fig. 4. In the low bias region, the linear J–V relationship identifies the Ohmic response. At the intermediate region, the current increases rapidly with the voltage due to the trap filling mechanism. The kink point between the two regions defines the trap-filling limit voltage (VTFL). The defect density can be obtained from VTFL by the following formula:
where
ε0 is vacuum permittivity and ε is the relative dielectric constant of AgBiI4. L is the thickness of the film (here L ∼ 210 nm for all different devices), and q is the elementary charge. In contrast to the film without antisolvent treatment, the VTFL decreases from 2.33 to 0.85, 0.80, and 0.66 V for the films treated by TL, CB, and IPA, respectively. This indicates that the antisolvent treatment reduces the defect density and the IPA-treated film contains the least defects. The enhancement of the film quality is responsible for the defect reduction.

The variation of the defect density will influence the photocarrier recombination and the carrier extraction capability. To explore this, we measured the Voc and Jsc decay curves of the devices constructed by the AgBiI4 films without and with the treatments of CB, TL, and IPA, respectively. Fig. 5 shows that the IPA-treated device has a slowest Voc decay and a fastest Jsc decay, indicating a longest charge-recombination decay time and a shortest charge-extraction time among the four different devices. This suggests that the decrease of defects reduces the charge-recombination and enhances the carrier extraction in the IPA-treated device.
According to the above analyses, the enhancement of the photovoltaic performance is ascribed to the quality improvement of AgBiI4 films with good crystallinity, full-coverage, and less defects, which enhances the optical absorption, suppresses the charge recombination, and promotes the charge extraction in the AgBiI4 device. For obtaining the high-quality AgBiI4 film, the antisolvent with low boiling point and suitable polarity in combination with high miscibility with the host solvents is preferred. In contrast to CB and TL, IPA has a suitable polarity, a lower boiling point, and a better miscibility with the host solvents, which provides a better circumstance for the formation of high-quality AgBiI4 films.
To compare the roles played by the boiling point and the miscibility of the antisolvent, we measured the light absorption spectra of AgBiI4 films treated with the antisolvent of TL, n-butanol (BuOH), and m-xylene (Xyl), respectively. The boiling points and solubility parameters of these antisolvents are shown in Table 1. Compared with TL, BuOH has the same boiling point and a higher solubility parameter, while Xyl has a higher boiling point but a similar solubility parameter. The light absorptions of AgBiI4 films treated by them are shown in Fig. S3(a) (ESI). This indicates that the absorption of the TL-treated film is higher than that of the Xyl-treated film but is lower than that of the BuOH-treated film. Besides, we also measured the dark J–V curves of ITO/AgBiI4/Au devices and used the SCLC method to characterize the defect density of the different AgBiI4 films. The VTFL is about 1.26 V for Xyl, 0.85 V for TL, and 0.69 V for BuOH, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4. This indicates that the BuOH-treated film contains the least defects, consistent with the data of absorption spectra. Therefore, a high miscibility with the host solvent is more important than a low boiling point as the antisolvent in improving the AgBiI4 film quality. It needs to be addressed that many parameters concerning the antisolvent engineering, such as antisolvent volume, antisolvent temperature, dripping time and duration, influence the formation of the AgBiI4 film, which deserves to be optimized for further improving the photovoltaic performance of the AgBiI4 device in the near future.

In summary, we synthesized the AgBiI4 films by using the antisolvent treatments with CB, TL, and IPA, respectively, and then used these AgBiI4 films to fabricate the solar cells with a device configuration of ITO/SnO2/AgBiI4/PTAA/Au. The XRD, SEM, light absorption, and photovoltaic performance measurements demonstrate that the IPA-treated AgBiI4 films have a better film quality and a higher photovoltaic performance than the other films. In contrast to the device without antisolvent treatment, the champion PCE of the IPA-treated device is raised from 0.82% to 1.61%, which is mainly attributed to the substantial improvement of the AgBiI4 film quality, including the high crystallinity and the smooth pinhole-free morphology with fewer defects. This study suggests that besides a suitable relative polarity, the antisolvent with a lower boiling point and a higher miscibility with the host solvent is preferred in improving the AgBiI4 film quality and enhancing the photovoltaic performance of AgBiI4 solar cells.


AgI (99.99%), BiI3 (99.99%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.99%), toluene (99%), isopropanol (99%), butyl alcohol (99.8%) and m-xylene (99%) were purchased from Aladdin. Chlorobenzene (99.8%), anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.8%) and SnO2 colloid precursor (tin(IV) oxide, 15% in H2O colloidal dispersion) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) was purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. All these commercially available materials were used as received without any further purification.


An indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate was cleaned with detergent, deionized water, ethanol, acetone and isopropyl alcohol in sequence by ultrasonication for 20 min, then blow dried with N2 and treated with UV–ozone for 30 min. The SnO2 electron transport layer was prepared by spin-coating SnO2 colloid in deionized water (1:4 v/v) at a speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s, then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min and treated with UV–ozone for 30 min. The AgBiI4 perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving AgI (0.2816 g) and BiI3 (0.7076 g) in 1 mL DMSO and 1 mL DMF and stirring at 65 °C for 2 h, and then filtered by a 0.22 μm pore-size filter. After the substrate and the AgBiI4 perovskite precursor solution were pre-heated on a hotplate at 110 °C for 10 min, 80 μL of AgBiI4 perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on the SnO2 film at a speed of 500 rpm for 3 s and then 5000 rpm for 30 s. At the 10 s before the end of the spin-coating process, the antisolvent (300 μL IPA, 1 mL CB, 1 mL TL, 300 μL BuOH, or 1 mL Xyl) was dropped on the substrate center. After aging for 2 min, the sample was annealed at 110 °C for 15 min and then at 150 °C for 15 min on a hot plate. As the sample was cooled to room temperature, 60 μL PTAA in toluene (10 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto the AgBiI4 film with 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, an Au electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask, with an electrode area of 0.0705 cm2.


The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained using a Gemini 500 with a voltage of 5 kV. An X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Co., Ltd) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) was used to characteristic the phase of the AgBiI4 film. The optical absorption spectra were recorded using an integrating sphere and a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Maya 2000 pro) with a wavelength ranging from 400 to 900 nm at room temperature. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was characterized by using a monochromatic xenon lamp light system (Zolix TLS3-X150A) and a lock-in amplifier (SR830), with the monochromatic light intensity calibrated by a reference Silicon cell (QE-F6-D). Current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells were measured by a source-meter (Keithley 2636B, scanned from −0.2 to 1 V at 0.1 V s−1) under AM1.5G solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The used solar simulator (NewPort LCS-100 94011A, class A) was calibrated by an Si photodetector (Zolix QEB1) via transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltaic (TPV) decay measurements, where a function generator (Agilent 33250) drives a LED (the central wavelength: ∼595 nm) to provide light pulses, a current amplifier (SR570) serially connects with the cell, and an oscilloscope (Agilent 54845A) monitors the TPC and TPV signal.
