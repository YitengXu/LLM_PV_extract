Two symmetrical star-shaped hole transporting materials (HTMs), i.e.FA-MeOPh and TPA-MeOPh with a fused triphenylamine or triphenylamine core and diphenylethenyl side arms were synthesized. FA-MeOPh showed a strong molar absorption coefficient and a red-shifted absorption compared with TPA-MeOPh because of its planar configuration. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the perovskite solar cells based on FA-MeOPh and TPA-MeOPh is about 11.86% and 10.79%, in which the efficiency of former is comparable to that (12.75%) of spiro-OMeTAD based cell. The high photocurrent (18.39 mA cm−2) of FA-MeOPh based solar cell relative to TPA-MeOPh based one may be attributable to the enhanced absorption in the near-IR region for mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM based cell. The high mobility and low series resistance of mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/FA-MeOPh based cell led to the high fill factor (0.698) of FA-MeOPh based solar cell relative to TPA-MeOPh based one (0.627). In addition, the FA-MeOPh based cell showed a relative stability under light soaking for 250 h. The high efficiency, relative stability, synthetically simple and inexpensive materials as the HTMs hold promise to replace the expensive spiro-OMeTAD.

The organometal halide perovskite CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) has attracted significant attention as light absorbers because of their direct band gap, large optical absorption, high carrier mobility and good stability. Since the first publication on organolead halide perovskite as light absorber in liquid based solar cells with power conversion efficiency of 3.81% for CH3NH3PbI3 by Miyasaka, the past few years have witnessed unprecedented rapid development in the perovskite based solar cells. In these cells, the hole transporting material (HTM) is the key component. An impressive photovoltaic performance was achieved, over 15% power conversion efficiency with 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as the hole transporting material (HTM) using an one-step precursor deposition, a sequential deposition method, and a dual-source vapor deposition. Alternate small molecule HTMs such as 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene-, pyrene- linear π-conjugated-, butadiene-,spiro-OMeTAD derivative-, and star-shaped based HTMs resulted in high conversion efficiencies of 11–16%. Some polymer HTMs with excellent electrical properties also resulted in high photovoltaic performances. Although the best result has been achieved using spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM, the expensive synthetic cost and low-charge carrier mobility of spiro-OMeTAD limits its potential for application of hybrid perovskite solar cells. Therefore, the development of efficient and inexpensive small molecule HTMs with optimal electronic properties remains an attractive goal. One of the candidates for such HTMs is the star-shaped triphenylamines, which have been known as HTMs for the active layer of OFETs and OLEDs. Recently, Getautis, et. al. have reported the star-shaped charge-transporting materials with a triphenyl core and a number of diphenylethenyl side arms, demonstrating very good hole-transporting mobility. We developed an efficient perovskite solar cell using planar triphenylamine hole conductors.

Herein, we report two types of hole transporting materials incorporated by a planar amine of star-shaped triphenylamine derivative, coded as TPA-MeOPh and FA-MeOPh, and their application in perovskite solar cells. The molecular structure is shown in Fig. 1a.

The synthetic scheme for the preparation of tris{bis(4-methoxyphenylethenyl)-N-phenyl}amine (TPA-MeOPh) and tris{bis(4-methoxyphenylethenyl)-N-phenyl}amine quinolizino acridine (FA-MeOPh) is shown in Fig. 1b. Detailed synthetic procedures are provided in the experimental section. The hole transporting material TPA-MeOPh was synthesized via a one step process using inexpensive tris(4-bromophenyl)amine and diphenylethyl borolane. The Suzuki coupling reaction of tris(4-bromophenyl)amine and tribromo-quinolizino acridine with 2-(2,2-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)ethenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane yielded TPA-MeOPh and FA-MeOPh in ∼50% yield. The analytical and spectroscopic data of both HTMs are consistent with the formulated structures.

The UV-vis spectra of TPA-MeOPh and FA-MeOPh measured in chlorobenzene are shown in the inset of Fig. 2a summarized in Table 1. The absorption spectrum of TPA-MeOPh exhibits an intense peak at 396 nm. The λmax of FA-MeOPh (414 nm) red-shifted (18 nm) relative to that of TPA-MeOPh was attributed to the more planar configuration in FA-MeOPh, as compared with the more twist (48.9°) between the core nitrogen and phenyl unit in TPA-MeOPh. Absorption coefficiency in FA-MeOPh increases quite noticeably compared with that of TPA-MeOPh, indicating that the transition is accompanied by a big change in the electronic charge distribution through the all conjugated system upon excitation. The fluorescence spectrum of FA-MeOPh exhibits a maximum emission at 488 nm with a small Stoke's shift of 74 nm relative to a Stoke's shift of 86 nm, demonstrating that a small structure change in the excited state occurs in FA-MeOPh and TPA-MeOPh because of a rigid configuration. Fig. 2a shows the absorption spectra of the two HTMs processed on the perovskite-coated TiO2 films. Two HTMs-coated films exhibit an enhanced absorption bands because of the superposed absorption characteristics of their constituents.

Fig. 2b shows the energy level diagram of the corresponding components in the device. The energy levels of HTMs were determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and cyclic voltammetry. The HOMO levels of TPA-MeOPh and FA-MeOPh are measured to be −5.29 and −5.15 eV, respectively, which have a suitable energy level with the CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43 eV).

Fig. 2c shows the device structure of the hybrid solar cells where fluorine-doped tin oxide glass was deposited with a thin compact layer, followed by deposition of ∼260 nm thick mesoporous TiO2 layer. Perovskite was spin-coated onto the mesoporous TiO2 film. The HTM was introduced by spin-coating on the m-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 film and a 60 nm thick Au layer was finally evaporated at the back contact. The cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, shown in Fig. 2d, show the formation of a well-defined hybrid structure with clear interfaces. The thickness of TiO2, perovskite and HTM layer is ∼260, 140, and 150 nm, respectively.

Fig. 3a shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves for three devices. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. For a comparative analysis, a reference cell with spiro-OMeTAD as HTM was fabricated. As the perovskite solar cells have exhibited a remarkable enhancement in photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) by increasing the conductivity of HTMs via doping the additives such as 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-Bp) and lithium bis(trifluoromethane-sulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) into the HTM, we fabricated the cells by doping the two additives into TPA-MeOPh or FA-MeOPh hole conductor. The TPA-MeOPh based cell gave a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.33 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.99 V, and a fill factor (ff) of 0.63, leading to a PCE of 10.79%. Under the similar condition, the FA-MeOPh and spiro-OMeTAD based cells gave a Jsc of 18.39 and 19.87 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.92 and 0.89 V and a ff of 0.70 and 0.72, affording a PCE of 11.86% and 12.75%, respectively. From the photovoltaic performances (Table 2), we have observed that the η value (11.86%) of FA-MeOPh based cell is higher than that (10.79%) of TPA-MeOPh due to a high photocurrent and fill factor. However, The Voc in TPA-MeOPh based cell is higher than that of FA-MeOPh or spiro-OMeTAD based one. As the open-circuit voltage (Voc) is determined by the difference between the quasi-Fermi levels of the TiO2 and the HOMO of HTM, the higher open-circuit voltage in TPA-MeOPh based cell is in good agreement with the relative difference in the HOMO levels of two HTMs. The high photo-current density (Jsc) of FA-MeOPh based cell relative to TPA-MeOPh based one is attributable to the enhanced and red-shifted absorption of mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/FA-MeOPh based cell, which is confirmed by the IPCE spectra. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the three devices were recorded (Fig. 3b). The FA-MeOPh and spiro-OMeTAD based devices enhanced the photocurrent in the whole visible region between 400 and 750 nm relative to that of TPA-MeOPh by improving charge collection/extraction. The integrated photocurrent density of FA-MeOPh based cell is 17.98 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with the measured photocurrent density of 18.39 mA cm−2 at the standard solar AM 1.5G. In addition, the fill factor of FA-MeOPh or spiro-OMeTAD based cell is higher than that of TPA-MeOPh based cell.

In solar cells, the series resistance (Rs) and hole mobility are related to the fill factor. The series resistance is measured by the slope of the J–V curve near Voc. The Rs value of FA-MeOPh and TPA-MeOPh, and spiro-OMeTAD based cell are calculated to be 36.48, 68.72, and 28.24 Ω cm−2, respectively, in which the lower value of Rs in the FA-MeOPh results in higher fill factor. We also measured the hole mobility of HTMs from the space charge limitation of current (SCLC) J–V characteristic to check the effect of hole mobility on the fill factor. The hole mobility of FA-MeOPh, TPA-MeOPh, and spiro-OMeTAD, evaluated using the Mott–Gurney law was measured to be 4.92 × 10−4, 1.06 × 10−4, and 5.21 × 10−4 cm2 V s−1, respectively. The high hole mobility of the FA-MeOPh based cell compared with TPA-MeOPh based on led to an improved fill factor. Therefore, the fill factor of the devices followed a trend that is closely related to the value of high mobility and low series resistance.
Because the long-term stability is very critical for sustained cell operation, we carried out long-term aging test. Fig. 4 shows the photovoltaic performance during long-term light soaking tests of FA-MeOPh, TPA-MeOPh, and spiro-OMeTAD based solar cells. After 250 h of aging, the initial efficiency of 11.24% in the FA-MeOPh based cell decreased to 8.42% resulting in a 25.1% reduction. On the other hand, the initial efficiency of 10.12% in the TPA-MeOPh based cell sharply decreased to 5.84% resulting in a 42.3% reduction. During the aging test of both devices, the Voc and ff remains almost constant. However, the Jsc of FA-MeOPh and TPA-MeOPh based cells sharply decreased by 4.08 mA cm−2 and 7.74 mA cm−2, respectively, because of the contamination of water. In addition, the relative stability of the FA-MeOPh based cell compared with the TPA-MeOPh based one may be attributable to the tight packing of the former on the CH3NH3PbI3 layer because of a planar molecular configuration.

Solvents were distilled from appropriate reagents. All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Acros and TCI. Tribromo-triarylamine, and 2-(2,2-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)vinyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane 1 (ref. 22) were prepared according to the literature procedure. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury 300 spectrometer. Chemical shifts δ were calibrated against TMS as an internal standard. Elemental analyses were performed with a Carlo Elba Instruments CHNS-O EA 1108 analyzer. The absorption and photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 2S UV-visible spectrometer and a Perkin LS fluorescence spectrometer, respectively. CV of the FA-MeOPh and TPA-MeOPh was measured in dichloromethane solution with 0.1 M tetrabutyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) as the supporting salt. The platinum working electrode consisted of a platinum wire sealed in a soft glass tube with a surface of 0.785 mm2, which was polished down to 0.5 μm with Buehler polishing paste prior to use in order to obtain reproducible surfaces. The counter electrode consisted of a platinum wire and the reference electrode was an Ag/AgCl secondary electrode.


FTO glass plates (Pilkington, TEC-8) were cleaned in a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, rinsed with water and ethanol. The compact TiO2 layer was deposited on the etched F-doped tin oxide substrate by spray pyrolysis at 450 °C, using titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution. The FTO glass plates were immersed in 40 mM TiCl4 (aqueous) at 70 °C for 30 min and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. Mesoporous TiO2 films was deposited by spin coating of a diluted TiO2 paste (Dyesol 18NR-T, 1:3.5 w/w diluted with ethanol) at 5000 rpm for 30 s. The films were sintered at 500 °C. The PbI2 in DMF solution (1.0 M) was dropped on the TiO2/FTO substrate by spin-coating at 6500 rpm for 30 s, and dried on a hot plate at 70 °C for 30 min. After cooling down, the film was dipped into a CH3NH3I/2-propanol solution (8 mg mL−1) for 25 s, and dried at 70 °C for 15 min. For a deposition of HTM layers, FA-MeOPh/chlorobenzene (35 mM), TPA-MeOPh/chlorobenzene (35 mM) and spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (60 mM) solutions were prepared with two additives. 7.0 μL Li-TFSI (Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide)/acetonitrile (520 mg/1 mL) and 8.0 μL TBP (4-tert-butylpyridine) were added to the HTM/chlorobenzene solutions as additives. The HTMs were spin-cast on the top of the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2/FTO substrate at 3000 rpm. Finally, the device was pumped down to lower than 10−5 Torr and a ∼60 nm thick Au counter electrode was deposited on top.


Solar cells efficiencies were characterized under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G irradiation from a Xe arc lamp with an AM 1.5 global filter. Simulator irradiance was characterized using a calibrated spectrometer and illumination intensity was set using an NREL certified silicon diode with an integrated KG1 optical filter: spectral mismatch factors were calculated for each device in this report to be less than 5%. Short circuit currents were also found to be with 5% of values calculated using the integrated external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and the solar spectrum. The EQE was measured by underfilling the device area using a reflective microscope objective to focus the light output from a 75 Watt Xe lamp, monochromator, and optical chopper; photocurrent was measured using a lock-in amplifier and the absolute photon flux was determined by a calibrated silicon photodiode.


A mixture of boron compound 1 (1.09 g, 2.97 mmol), tris(4-bromophenyl)amine (0.32 g, 0.66 mmol), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (0.10 g, 0.086 mmol) and potassium carbonate solution (0.63 g, 4.56 mmol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (12 mL) and H2O (3 mL) was refluxed overnight. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 50 mL) and the extracts were washed with brine and dried (MgSO4). The solvent was removed in vacuo and the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel eluting with CH2Cl2/hexane (1:4) to give TPA-MeOPh. The analytical data of TPA-MeOPh were consistent with previous literature (ref. 16).


The product FA-MeOPh was prepared using the same procedures for compound TPA-MeOPh except that fused tribromoarylamine (1.79 g, 2.97 mmol) were used instead of tris(4-bromophenyl)amine. 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.45 (s, 6H), 7.28 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 12H), 6.86 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 12H), 5.30 (s, 3H), 3.83 (s, 18H), 1.57 (s, 18H). 13C NMR (75 MHz, CDCl3): δ 159.1, 158.9, 139.9, 136.6, 133.5, 132.1, 131.7, 129.7, 129.4, 128.6, 126.2, 125.4, 114.6, 113.7, 55.5, 55.4, 35.2, 33.2.

We synthesized two efficient transporting materials with a fused triphenylamine or triphenylamine core and diphenylethynyl side arms. The photovoltaic performance is quite sensitive to the structural modification of HTMs. The perovskite based cell using FA-MeOPh as a HTM gave an overall conversion efficiency of 11.86%, showing a competitive photovoltaic performance to the spiro-OMeTAD based cell (12.75%). Moreover, the FA-MeOPh based cell stored for 250 h without any encapsulation showed a relative stability. These novel and high-performing HTMs offer a new design strategy toward developing efficient HTMs comparable to the sprio-OMeTAD for photovoltaic applications and studies directed this goal are now in progress.
