Thick films of active layers (Polymer: PCBM blend) are required to harness the maximum amount of sunlight and to achieve higher efficiencies in polymer solar cells. However, the realization of thick films along with desired morphology of the active layer is very challenging. Herein, thick films with optimum morphologies have been precisely obtained using the hot-casting technique. The superior active layer morphology supports better charge transport. The photovoltaic properties of the polymer solar cells fabricated with PTB7-Th:PC71BM were thoroughly studied by varying the substrate temperatures used for hot-casting. A significant increase in the power conversion efficiency to >9% was observed for the solar cells fabricated at 40 °C compared to those fabricated at room temperature, which displayed an efficiency of ∼8%. The main reason for this improvement was the increased thickness of the active layer that facilitated better light absorption and therefore resulted in the enhancement of the short circuit current density. In addition, the devices fabricated at 40 °C exhibited very low rms roughness enabling better charge transport in the device. The recombination studies and mobility estimation were also performed through the impedance spectroscopy and SCLC technique, which gave a clearer insight into the hot casting method. The outcome of this moderate hot-casting technique to achieve low roughness morphology in the thick active layer was very promising as this would be a possible breakthrough technique in the manufacturing of highly efficient polymer solar cells.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs), involving a polymer donor and a fullerene or non-fullerene acceptor blend, have drawn considerable attention as a possible candidate for future photovoltaics. The flexibility, transparency, lightweight and the ability to be processed through printing or spin coating techniques are the main advantages of PSCs, which led them to attract the attention of various researchers across the world. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has also shown an upward trend since their discovery. Recently, a PCE of 17% has been reported, which is very competitive compared with the available commercial silicon solar cells. However, for the wide utility of PSCs in real-time applications, all the photovoltaic parameters such as the short circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) need improvement. The desired results can be achieved by regulating the morphology of the active layer by varying the parameters such as thickness and annealing temperature. In addition, a few reports mention that both the device performance and stability were improved by the incorporation of various interfacial layers.

One of the restraining factors for attaining high-performance PSCs is the Jsc, which depends on the bandgap of the donor material, the thickness of the active layer and charge transport through the device. For achieving higher Jsc values, extensive research has been carried out to design and develop various low bandgap donor materials. PTB7-Th has become one of the most important discoveries in this field recently with the PCE reaching >10% when it is used as a donor and PC71BM as an acceptor in a single junction PSC. The interaction of PTB7-Th has not only been thoroughly studied with fullerene-based acceptors but also with various non-fullerene acceptors to achieve desirable PCEs. Also, the possibility of using PTB7-Th in ternary and tandem polymer solar cells has been investigated by various groups. The morphology dependence study for improving the PCE in PTB7-Th:PC71BM as an active layer has been performed by modulating the annealing temperature and annealing time. It has also been carried out by different solvent engineering techniques, varying the concentration of PCBM loading and introducing additives like DIO, DPS, etc. In all these cases, it has been very closely observed that annealing the active layer at 70 °C and above deteriorates the morphology and hence hampers charge transport and thereafter, reduces the PCE. Additionally, there is a report which suggests that cooling the active layer blend (referred to as ink) to 40 °C from 80 °C improves the PCE by optimizing the film morphology. A recent study also reports about the effect of PCBM loading on the morphology and charge transport, which proves that the device having a 1:1.5 ratio of PTB7-Th:PC71BM displays the best performance in solar cells. Researchers have also focused on increasing the thickness of the active layer and retaining the overall PCE of the solar cells. Over 10% PCE was obtained for the active layer thicker than 200 nm, making it quite a prospect for commercialization. These reports suggest that the thick films of the active layer with good morphology are prerequisites for high-efficiency polymer solar cells. Attaining a thick film with conventional methods, such as by increasing the solution concentration or by spin coating at reduced speed, results in poor morphology.
Motivated by recent reports on a hot casting method to fabricate perovskite solar cells where a dilute solution was used, we used this technique to achieve a thick active layer with good morphology. The influence of hot-casting on the morphology and thickness of the active layer consisting of PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend and thereby its effect on the device performance has been studied. The 40 °C active-layer-hot-casted solar cell displays the highest PCE of 9.13% with a Jsc of 17.82 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.822 V and FF of 62%. The PCE was improved compared to that of the solar cell fabricated at room temperature (RT, ∼27 °C), which showed the highest PCE of 8.02%. This was achieved by regulating the thickness and morphology of the active layer film during the hot-casting process. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is reported for the first time, revealing the advantages of the hot-casted polymer solar cells.

The UV-vis spectra of the blend films coated using the hot casting technique at various substrate temperatures are illustrated in Fig. 1a. It was observed that the absorbance of the films increased with increasing substrate temperature. Distinguishable change in the absorbance was observed as the substrate temperature increased moderately from RT to 40 °C. However, on increasing the temperature further to 50 °C, 60 °C and 70 °C, the increment in the absorbance was very small. To analyze the reason for this increase in absorbance, thickness profiles were studied (Fig. 1b). It was observed that as the film fabrication temperature was increased from RT, the average thickness of the films also increased. Average thicknesses of 99, 133, 149, 165 and 183 nm were found for films coated at RT, 40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C and 70 °C, respectively. The details of the thickness profile are summarized in Table S1 (ESI). The hot-casted films displayed better uniformity compared to that of the RT films. It is also noteworthy to observe in the UV-Vis spectra of the films that the first peak due to PTB7-Th is slightly blue-shifted from 642 nm for the RT fabricated device to 639 and 635 nm for the 40 °C and 70 °C fabricated devices, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI). This may be due to the decrease in the crystallinity of the hot-casted films. Likewise, the peak intensity at around 475 nm related to PCBM was enhanced compared to that of the PTB7-Th peak, confirming increased domains of PCBM in the hot-casted films as illustrated in Fig. S2 (ESI).

The crystallinity of the films was further verified using the GIWAX 2D plots. The reference plot for RT has been taken from one of our previous works on the PTB7-Th based solar cell, in which the polymer was synthesized thermally. It can be clearly seen in the 2D plots (Fig. S3, ESI) that the concentric rings are not very discrete in any of the cases, but on increasing the hot-casting temperature of the films to 40 °C and 70 °C, the rings become more diffused. This is in accordance with the crystallinity explained using the normalized UV-vis spectra through Fig. S2 (ESI). Also, the lamellar spacing was calculated for the films using the in-plane 1D line cut profile presented in Fig. S4a (ESI). The lamellar spacing was found to be 2.26, 2.32, 2.52 nm for RT, 40 °C and 70 °C films, respectively. It may also be noted from the in-plane line cut profile that the intensity of the peak is similar for RT and 40 °C films, but reduces drastically for 70 °C films, confirming the degree of crystallinity being reduced for films coated at higher temperature. The π–π stacking distance was calculated from the 1D out-of-plane line cut profile (Fig. S4b, ESI) and was found to be ∼0.47 nm for all the three films. The details of the line cut profiles are tabulated in Table S2 (ESI).
To understand the role of hot-casting temperature on the surface morphology of the blend films, AFM study was carried out and the details of the same are given in Fig. 2a–e. The RMS roughness versus hot-casting temperature plot is presented in Fig. 2f. It can be observed from the curve that the RMS roughness reduced from 1.013 nm film coated at RT to 0.657 nm for the film hot-casted at 40 °C. On further increase in the temperature, the RMS roughness increased to 0.748 nm, 1.028 nm and 1.115 nm for films hot-casted at 50 °C, 60 °C and 70 °C, respectively. Thus, it is expected that the solar cell fabricated at 40 °C will have better charge transport.
To verify the effect of the hot-casted films on the performance of the solar cell, devices were fabricated as per the schematic shown in Fig. 3 (the details of device fabrication are presented in the experimental section). The active layer blend was coated on pre-heated substrates at different temperatures between 40 °C and 70 °C at an interval of 10 °C, and RT fabrication was used as control. The device architecture was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Blend/Ca/Al. The J–V graphs were recorded under illumination and are presented in Fig. 4a for the devices fabricated at RT, 40 °C and 70 °C for better visualization of the difference (the J–V graphs including the plots for the devices fabricated at 50 °C and 60 °C are also presented in Fig. S5, ESI). The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The device fabricated at a moderately hot-casted temperature of 40 °C displays an improved PCE compared to the one fabricated at RT. The device fabricated at 40 °C has the highest PCE of 9.13% (average 9.04%) with a Jsc of 17.82 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.822 V and FF of 62%. On the other hand, the device fabricated at RT exhibited the highest PCE of 8.02% (average 7.89%) with a Jsc of 16.78 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.798 V and FF of 60%. On increasing the hot-casting temperature to 70 °C, the device PCE was reduced to 7.86% (average 7.56%) with a Jsc of 15.92 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.811 V and FF of 62%. It is noteworthy that on increasing the temperature from RT to 40 °C, Jsc values increased, but on further increasing the temperature to 70 °C Jsc was reduced. This may be due to better charge transport at reduced roughness and optimum thickness of the active layer. Both Voc and FF were increased slightly for all the hot-casted photovoltaic devices. The EQE spectra shown in Fig. 4b also correlated well with the Jsc values. For reference, a thick active layer (∼134 nm) at 2000 rpm was fabricated at RT and a maximum PCE of 7.81% was obtained (Fig. S6 and Table S3, ESI). This confirms that the thickness obtained through the modulation of spin speed does not achieve improved PCE and it is due to the improved morphology of the hot-casted temperature.

The results listed in Table 1 are the averages for 10 devices. To study the variation of the device parameters across the entire fabricated devices, a box chart was plotted (Fig. S7, ESI). It can be observed that the variation in Jsc is minimum for the device fabricated at 40 °C compared to other device types. It was also noted that the variation in Voc and FF is nearly similar for all device types. Thus, the major reason for the improved PCE is the increase in Jsc of the device fabricated at 40 °C.
To study more details of the loss mechanism of the photo-generated charge carriers, the variation of current density at different light intensities was studied. The log–log plot of Jscversus the light intensity is shown in Fig. 5a. From the graph, the α value was estimated by finding the slope for each device type and is tabulated in Table S1 (ESI). Ideally, α should be equal to 1 for zero bimolecular recombination losses and typically the device should have the α value close to 1 for better performance. In this case, the device fabricated at RT has an α value of 0.909, while the one fabricated at 40 °C has an α value of 0.964. On increasing the temperature, the α value decreased to 0.890 for the device fabricated at 70 °C. This confirms that minimum bimolecular recombination or non-radiative recombination through the trap sites happens for the device fabricated at 40 °C and hence, maximum photo-generated charges are extracted in the device fabricated at 40 °C hot-casting temperature, which can be one of the reasons for its improved PCE.
Similarly, a semi-log plot of Vocversus light intensity is plotted in Fig. 5b. From the fitted curves, the slope nkT/q was calculated, where n is the ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin and q is the electronic charge. The values of n, which give the type of recombination present at open circuit conditions, were computed to be 1.18, 1.10 and 1.41 for devices fabricated at RT, 40 °C and 70 °C, respectively. Both monomolecular and bimolecular recombinations are present in devices fabricated at RT and 40 °C. However, monomolecular recombination is dominant over bimolecular recombination in devices fabricated at RT, and bimolecular recombination is dominant over monomolecular recombination for devices fabricated at 40 °C. On increasing the temperature to 70 °C, such a higher value of ‘n’ confirms the presence of Shockley–Read–Hall mechanism or monomolecular recombination in the device due to the deep trap states.
The impedance spectra (IS) of the devices fabricated at RT, 40 °C and 70 °C are presented in Fig. 5c. The IS was recorded under dark conditions in the frequency range of 100 Hz to 1 MHz. One semi-circle was observed in the spectra; therefore, they were fitted using the equivalent circuit as presented in the inset and the same are represented by the solid lines. The main aim of this study was to determine the series resistance between the cathode and anode (Rs) and the recombination resistance (Rrec) of the fabricated devices. The Rs was observed to decrease to a very small value of 18.89 Ω for the device fabricated at 40 °C from 49.62 Ω for the device fabricated at RT. On increasing the temperature to 70 °C, the Rs was observed to increase slightly to 27.55 Ω. On the other hand, the Rrec was 4419 Ω, maximum for the device fabricated at 40 °C, compared to 3805 Ω and 2509 Ω for the devices fabricated at RT and 70 °C, respectively. This confirms that the device fabricated at 40 °C has the minimum recombination current and hence, improved efficiency. The recombination parameters are tabulated in Table S4 (ESI).
To compare the change in hole mobility due to the hot-casting temperatures, devices with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/Cu were fabricated. Thereafter, the dark J–V curves of the devices were measured and analyzed using the SCLC method and Mott–Gurney relationship. It was observed that the device fabricated at 40 °C had a higher average mobility of 5.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (highest mobility 5.55 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) than that of the device fabricated at RT, which showed an average mobility of 2.77 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (highest mobility: 2.88 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). On increasing the hot-casting temperature further, the hole mobility of the devices was found to decrease with the average mobility for the device fabricated at 70 °C to be 1.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (highest mobility: 1.46 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The J–V graphs of the hole only devices with the highest mobility for the best devices are presented in Fig. 6a. Fig. 6b displays the variation of mobility with the hot-casting temperature including the error bars, and the statistical parameters of three such devices are presented in Table S1 (ESI). Electron only devices were fabricated with the architecture ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/Ca/Al at RT, 40 °C and 70 °C and their J–V plots are presented in Fig. S8 (ESI). Electron mobility for the device fabricated at 40 °C was found to be 3.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 while the one fabricated at RT had an electron mobility of 1.56 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. When the hot-casting temperature was increased to 70 °C, electron mobility dropped to 1.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. This increase in the hole and electron mobility for the device fabricated at 40 °C can be attributed to the least roughness of the film among all the samples as presented in the AFM images and hence, the improved PCE.
A comparison of this work with recent literature where blends of PTB7-Th:PCBM were used as an active layer in polymer solar cells of various thicknesses is tabulated in Table S5 (ESI). Fig. 7 shows the variation of PCE with respect to the thickness of the active layer in three different regions of the conventional architecture. Region I has an active layer below 120 nm, region II has an active layer between 120 and 160 nm and region III has active layers greater than 160 nm. For region I, the results reported in this work are comparable with those from the recent literature. The reasons for the improved efficiencies in some of the reports were due to the modification in the cathode side, where one had magnesium as a cathode on top of aluminum, while the second used PFN as a cathode interfacial layer. In region II, the results of this work are the best compared to those reported in the literature. The reason is the optimized thickness and morphology obtained using the unique hot-casting technique. In region III, the results though seemed to be lower than those reported in the literature, those studies had utilized PFN/PFNBr as a cathode interfacial layer and fabricated devices using vacuum controlled techniques. Fig. S9 (ESI) shows the variation of thickness with the PCE of devices fabricated in the inverted architecture. The results obtained through this work, even in conventional device architecture, are comparable to those from all the best-reported works.

In summary, the influence of the hot-casting technique on the performance of polymer solar cells consisting of PTB7-Th as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor has been thoroughly studied. The PCE was increased by ∼14%, from 8.02% for a device fabricated at RT to 9.13% for a device fabricated at 40 °C. Through these results, it is confirmed that the improvement in PCE was due to the increase in Jsc up to 40 °C, a moderate hot-casting temperature, and thereafter, the PCE was reduced. However, the Voc and FF increased slightly for all the hot-casted devices. The main reason for the best performance of the device fabricated at 40 °C was its optimized thickness (∼133 nm) and lowest rms roughness obtained for the active layer film. These results were well supported by mobility and recombination studies, confirming that higher mobility values were obtained at 40 °C compared to those at RT and higher-temperature fabricated films. Furthermore, these devices were highly reproducible as can be observed in the box chart made from 10 fabricated devices. Moreover, it was observed that a thicker film of ∼183 nm displayed a PCE of 7.86%, which is ∼88% of the highest PCE reported in this work and ∼98% for the photovoltaic device fabricated at RT. This technique can very well lead to polymer solar cell commercialization that requires thick films.


PEDOT:PSS (PVP AI 4083) was obtained from Clevios. ITO substrates (15 Ω □−1) and PC71BM (>99.5%) were obtained from LUMTEC. Chlorobenzene (HPLC, purity 99.9%), calcium (purity >99.99%) and aluminium (purity >99.99%) were procured from Sigma Aldrich. PTB7-Th was synthesized thermally earlier in our laboratory.


A patterned ITO substrate is taken and sequentially cleaned with soap water, DI water, acetone and isopropanol, and thereafter, dried with flowing N2 gas and treated with UV–O3. On the cleaned substrate, PEDOT:PSS is deposited by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 45 s to facilitate proper hole transport in the device. Thereafter, the substrate is annealed at 120 °C for 20 minutes. PTB7-TH and PC71BM were mixed in the weight ratio 1:1.5 in chlorobenzene at a concentration of 25 mg mL−1 to prepare the blend solution. Then, the substrate is brought down to a lower temperature to set the hot-casting temperature. Later, the active layer blend is spin-coated on pre-heated substrates at various temperatures. Methanol treatment was done on the active layer for achieving better morphology. Lastly, calcium and aluminium were thermally evaporated (pressure ∼10−6 mbar) to complete the device.


UV-vis absorption spectroscopy (PerkinElmer Lamda-35) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Agilent 5500-STM) studies were carried out on the active layer. All the current densities versus voltage curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter in an argon atmosphere. The illumination study to calculate the photovoltaic parameters and recombination factor were carried out under a Newport solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A, AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) using a shadow mask of 6 mm2 under an argon atmosphere. For external quantum efficiency measurements, an Oriel IQE-200 instrument was used under ambient conditions. CH Instruments 760D was used in the measurement of impedance spectroscopy. The thickness of the samples were measured using Dektak 150 profilometer. Grazing-incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXRD) measurements were performed at Anton Paar on the SAXSpoint 2.0 instrument with microsource (λ ≈ 0.1542 nm) and a 2D EIGER R 1M hybrid photon counting (HPC) detector with 75 μm2 pixel size. The X-ray incident angle was fixed at 0.18° to maximize the diffracted signal and minimize the background from substrate scattering.
