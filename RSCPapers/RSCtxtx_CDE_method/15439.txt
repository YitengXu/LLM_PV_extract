In the present investigation, nanostructured combinatorial quaternary Cu2Cd(SSe)2 thin films have been successfully synthesized via a self organized arrested precipitation technique (APT). The synthesized quaternary Cu2Cd(SSe)2 thin films show an enhancement in the photocurrent for Cu-poor composition, which signifies that the synthesized quaternary material is commensurate with other Cu-based quaternary and multinary materials for solar cell application. The optostructural study clearly illustrates that the synthesized thin films have optimized band gap energy with mixed crystal structures. The morphological study indicates the formation of hierarchical microstructures. A compositional study confirms the formation of quaternary thin films with the required composition. J–V curves demonstrate that photocurrent enhancement is observed in quaternary Cu2Cd(SSe)2 thin films with an increase in Cu-content. The resultant maximum short circuit current density (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc) are 1.23 mA cm−2 and 437 mV respectively.

Due to quite large global energy utilization and environmental concerns, the development of innovative, high efficiency and low cost solar cell devices has drawn passionate research attention in recent years. Ternary and quaternary based compounds occupy a crucial role in research of novel materials with better optostructural and optoelectronic properties. In recent years, nanostructured semiconductor materials have attracted massive steadily growing interest in various applications. Such nanostructured materials have unique properties and different applications in the construction of various devices. Each of specific material has special properties and limitations. So in order to develop a new multifunctional system, it is crucial to incorporate various independent nanomaterials in a sequential manner. The metal chalcogenides materials have been studied widely due to the favorable band gaps of chalcogenides unlike oxide materials, which cover a maximum visible region of the solar spectrum. However, there are several chalcogenide reports available in the literature based on quaternary thin films due to their improved chemical properties and huge capability of light absorption. Therefore, many research groups are quite engaged in the fabrication of new quaternary materials for different applications.

As an alternative energy source, solar energy has potential for solving the scarcity of available energy sources. Solar power is the world's most profuse and never-ending resource of energy. A year's worth of sunlight provides more than a hundred times the energy of the world's available fossil fuel reserves. Therefore, photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells have gained much attention as a renewable energy source for electricity. Right now, the world is facing problems with the critical synthesis process and the overall high production cost of solar cell devices. Therefore, it is crucial to develop new materials with superior properties demonstrating high conversion efficiencies.
Considering above facts of energy crises and the properties of quaternary material many scientists made great efforts on the synthesis of copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS) and copper zinc tin sulfoselenide (CZTSSe) thin films in the field of solar cell applications. The main features of this material are cost effectiveness, earth abundance and lower toxicity of elements such as Cu, Zn, etc. Also, CZTS thin films show a direct band gap energy of approximately 1.5 eV; as a result, they have a high absorption coefficient of about 104 cm−1. In addition to this, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) thin films reached the highest conversion efficiency for Cu-poor compositions in the laboratory as well as in industrial production. Taking this into account several researchers have spent their time on developing efficient CZTS and CIGS thin film solar cells. Overall a literature survey demonstrated that the best performance of the CZTS and CIGS based solar cell is obtained through Cu-poor compositions. It is well known that Cu-poor thin films are n-type semiconductors. Also, Cu-rich chalcopyrite solar cells experience the problem of interface recombination, unlike the Cu-poor versions.
Nowadays, the IIB–VIA group chalcogenides based ternary and quaternary thin films have attracted great interest because of their unique properties and promising applications, such as PEC solar cells, optoelectronic devices and light emitting diodesetc. The Cd(S0.2Se0.8) thin film shows considerably improved PEC performance. Their observed conversion efficiency is quite promising compared with other reported results. This indicates that the material has huge potential for improvement in PEC performance. Moreover, we have tried to construct a new pathway for development of unique quaternary based thin films for PEC application.
CdSe and CdS are very important semiconductor materials and pseudo binary compounds of Cd(SSe) thin films can be effectively used as good candidates for solar cell applications. Cd(SSe) thin films were synthesized by various techniques such as chemical bath deposition (CBD), sputtering and evaporation techniquesetc. Among these synthesis techniques APT has shown remarkable potential features and cost effectiveness compared to routine aqueous chemical techniques. APT is a self organized, cost effective technique, and suitable for large area deposition. In addition, APT is a hybrid chemical method of the CBD technique in combination with the controlled chemical growth process (CCGP) and has potential for the synthesis of mixed metal chalcogenide (MMC) thin films in a low cost manner.
Taking into consideration key aspects of the IIB–VIA group ternary, quaternary chalcogenide thin films, we have constructed new quaternary mixed metal chalcogenide (QMMC) (Cu2Cd(S0.2Se0.8)2) thin films. In the present investigation, the main aim is to study the effect of copper content in Cd(SSe) and develop the new photoactive QMMC thin films through chemical process. Finally, the deposited QMMC thin films were tested for PEC applications. The possible growth mechanism of QMMC thin film formation via APT and redox reaction mechanism in the PEC cell were discussed in detail with schematic representation.

All chemicals were of analytical reagent (AR) grade and used without further purification. Cupric sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O) (99.5%, S D Fine-Chem), cadmium sulfate monohydrate (CdSO4·H2O) (98%, S D Fine-Chem), thiourea (H2N–CS–NH2) (99%, S D Fine-Chem), selenium metal powder (99.5%, Sigma Aldrich), anhydrous sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) (96%, S D Fine-Chem), liquor ammonia (NH3) (28–30% Thomas Baker), and triethanolamine (N(CH2–CH2–OH)3) (99%, Merck) were used as precursors and complexing agent respectively. For measurement of the PEC cell properties we have used a sulfide/polysulfide redox electrolyte prepared from sodium sulfide (Na2S) (55–58%, Thomas Baker), sodium hydroxide pellets (NaOH) (99%, S D Fine-Chem) and sulfur powder (99%, S D Fine-Chem). Herein, Cu2Cd(SSe)2 thin films were deposited onto bare as well as ITO (indium doped tin oxide) coated glass substrates (sheet resistance 20–25 Ω cm−2) by using simple APT.


Cu2Cd(SSe)2 thin films were synthesized on ultrasonically cleaned glass and ITO coated glass substrates by APT. All the precursor solutions were prepared in double distilled water and the solution preparation procedure is given as follows.


0.1 M Cu–TEA complex was prepared by triturating 2.49 g CuSO4·5H2O with TEA and diluted to 100 mL with double distilled water.


0.05 M Cd–TEA complex was prepared by triturating 1.28 g CdSO4·H2O with TEA and diluted to 100 mL with double distilled water.


0.05 M H2N–CS–NH2 solution was prepared by dissolving 0.38 g of H2N–CS–NH2 in double distilled water and diluted to 100 mL with distilled water.


0.25 M Na2SeSO3 solution was prepared by refluxing 6 g of selenium metal powder (Se) and 30 g anhydrous Na2SO3 in 250 mL distilled water at 90 °C for 8 h in a 500 mL round bottom flask. 0.05 M Na2SeSO3 solution was used as Se2− source, which was prepared by diluting 0.25 M Na2SeSO3 solution using double distilled water.


In our synthesis method, metal ions were arrested using a suitable complexing agent and thin film formation occurs through slow ion by ion condensation of ions via a multinucleation process. In the actual deposition, Cu–TEA, Cd–TEA complexes react with S2− and Se2− ions, which are slowly released by dissociation of H2N–CS–NH2 and Na2SeSO3 at alkaline pH 10.4 ± 0.2 and 50 °C ± 2 temperature. Excessive concentration of Na2SO3 over selenium prevents oxidation of selenide and its reprecipitation as selenium. In the typical bath preparation, an appropriate volume of 0.1 M Cu–TEA, 0.05 M Cd–TEA complexes were placed in a 100 mL beaker with constant stirring for 5 min. Such a mixture of both cations was light blue coloured and pH was adjusted at pH 10.4 ± 0.2 by drop wise addition of NH3. During drop wise addition of NH3 into the above solution the light blue coloured solution turns dark blue. Following this with constant stirring an appropriate volume of H2N–CS–NH2 and Na2SeSO3 solutions was poured into a pH stabilized reaction mixture. Furthermore, mixing of the anionic precursors causes to the formation of a more intense dark coloured solution. After complete preparation of the reaction bath the whole solution was stirred for 5 min to form a homogeneous mixture of solution and the colour gets converted into a light blue. Precleaned glass substrates were immersed in the reaction bath using a substrate holder at an optimized reaction temperature (50 °C ± 2) and substrate rotation 45 ± 5 rpm for 2.3 h deposition time. After 15 minutes of reaction, the light blue coloured reaction mixture became colourless. This means that excess concentration of Na2SO3 over selenium reduces Cu2+(II) into Cu+(I) ions. After a further increase in deposition time Cu+, Cd2+ metal ions release slowly (from Cu–TEA, Cd–TEA metal complexes) and react with S2−, Se2− chalcogen ions (released from dissociation of H2N–CS–NH2 and Na2SeSO3). This was followed by the formation of orange-brown to blackish brown colouring (with increased Cu content) of the solution and the deposition of a well adhering, pinhole free and homogeneous thin film was observed. Photographs of all synthesized thin films as a function of Cu content are shown in Fig. 1.

The release of metal and chalcogen ions with colour variation in a reaction mixture denotes the formation of multinucleation centers on the substrate surface with increase in deposition time. Following this at a specific deposition time (2.30 h) the formation of an adherent, thicker Cu2Cd(SSe)2 thin film occurred. The deposited thin films were washed with double distilled water, dried at room temperature and used for further characterizations. In order to study the effect of copper content on the different properties and synthesis of photoactive Cu2Cd(SSe)2 QMMC thin films, the copper content in reaction mixture was varied as 0.0 mL, 0.5 mL, 1.0 mL, 1.5 mL and 2.0 mL of 0.1 M Cu–TEA complex solution and abbreviated as C0, C1, C2, C3 and C4 (Table 1). Actually, we have varied a lower volume of Cu-content in QMMC thin films, because as per our knowledge and literature survey, low Cu content thin films show enhanced properties and effective power conversion efficiency. Also, low Cu content illustrates the formation of well adherent, pinhole free thin films. In fact, when we have tried to increase Cu content more than the optimal volume this results in the formation of precipitation rather than a proper desired thin film formation. The overall study concludes that the optimized Cu content shows the formation of desired thin films with improved properties. Hence, we have preferred to develop such a promising and challenging quaternary material to study their various properties for the PEC solar cell application.

The thickness of the synthesized thin films was determined by using a surface profiler [AMBIOS XP-1]. The optical absorption study was carried out using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer [Shimadzu, UV-1800]. The structural properties were studied by using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) [Bruker AXS, D8] using Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation. The surface morphology and elemental composition of the synthesized thin films were studied using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyzer [JEOL, JSM-6360A]. Insight into the morphology of the material was carried out by using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) [TECNAI F20 Philips operated at 200 kV] and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The elemental composition was also analyzed by using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Thermo Scientific, Multilab-2000) with a multi-channel detector, which can endure high photon energies from 0.1 eV to 3.0 keV. Electrical conductivity (EC) was measured by using two point probe method. Thermoelectric power (TEP) measurements unit consisting of two brass blocks one of which was heated and the other was kept cold, a chromel allumel thermocouple was used to measure the temperature difference. PEC performance was carried out using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Keithley SCS-4200 Semiconductor) characterization unit in the dark and under illumination using a 500 W tungsten filament lamp (intensity of 30 mW cm−2) in a sulfide/polysulfide redox electrolyte. The PEC cell was fabricated using a standard two-electrode configuration, comprising a glass-ITO/Cu2Cd(SSe)2 (active surface area 1 cm2) photoelectrode, and a graphite rod was used as counter electrode.


The possible reaction mechanism of the Cu2Cd(SSe)2 thin films formation is as follows,

Initially, Cu2+, Cd2+ metal ions are released from bound metal complexes of Cu–TEA, Cd–TEA respectively as follows (reactions (1) and (2)),
(1)
(2)
 Further, at the alkaline pH, H
2N–CS–NH2 dissociates to release S2− ions, as shown in reaction (3),

(3)
 Simultaneously, Na
2SeSO3 dissociate into Na2SO4 and active HSe− species. These active species immediately converted into Se2− ions (reaction (4)) as follows,

(4)
 The excess content of Na
2SO3 oxidizes into Na2SO4 and releases electrons, which are responsible for the reduction of Cu2+ into Cu+ states, and which was confirmed by observing changes in the colour of the solution from blue to colourless after the addition of Na2SeSO3 (eqn (5)),

Cu2+ + e− → Cu+
(5)
 When the ionic product exceeds the solubility product in the reaction solution formation of thin films occurred. The overall reaction of Cu
2Cd(SSe)2 thin films formation is as follows (reaction (6)),

(6)
 In APT, thin film formation occurs on the basis of Ostwald's ripening law. Ostwald's ripening process is nothing but growing big crystals at the expense of little crystals. A large number of small crystals form in a system at a preliminary stage, but disappear excluding a few that are grown larger. Such smaller crystals proceed as a nucleation center for the bigger ones. As the large crystals grow, the area around them is depleted of the smaller crystals. Generally, a nucleation process occurs through the formation of smaller clusters of larger number of atoms in the solution phase reaction.
 Once the nucleation proceeds formation of bigger particles is occurring through a large number of smaller ones.

In the present investigation, it has been observed that formation of QMMC thin films occurred on the basis of the slow release of ions from the dissociation of the complexes. In the typical reaction bath, initially metal ions (Cu+, Cd2+) and chalcogen ions (S2−, Se2−) diffuse and start to nucleate on the substrate surface continuously. Following this initial stage of reaction all ions start to condense rapidly at optimized reaction parameters with an increase in reaction time. So, the desired thin film formation is observed through a slow ion-by-ion condensation via multinucleation of subsequent ions on the substrate surface. During the first 15 min of the reaction time the solution is colourless, which indicates that nucleation does not occur. It means that, the initial time is the induction phase of the formation of nucleation centers.
Later, all ions are starting to release slowly from the dissociation of the respective precursor complexes. Such a slow release of ions and the formation of void free thin films is possible through the APT method as compared to the sophisticated and routine aqueous chemical techniques. The overall growth mechanism for thin film formation via APT is schematically demonstrated in Fig. 2.

The thickness of ternary (C0) and quaternary (C1 to C4) thin films is found to be in the range of 815 nm to 930 nm. The thickness of all thin films is tabulated in Table 2.

Fig. 3(a) shows the optical absorption spectra of quaternary thin films in the 350 nm to 1150 nm wavelength range. With increased Cu content the light absorption edge shifted to a higher wavelength range, which is clearly seen in Fig. 3(a).

The shifting of the absorption edge to the higher wavelength range is indicative of the effective deposition and a corresponding increase in film thickness. Generally, thicker films have well grown large crystals, which absorb large amounts of photon energy. The optical band gap energy values have been determined using the Tauc plot as shown in Fig. 3(b). The optical band gap energy was obtained by extrapolating the straight line portion of the graph (αhν)2vs. photon energy (hν) at α = 0 to the energy axis.
The obtained optical band gap energy was found to be in the range of 1.68 eV to 1.46 eV for Cu containing thin films (C1–C4) and that of without Cu content thin film (C0) shows a band gap at 1.79 eV (Table 2). The ternary and quaternary thin films show the absorption coefficient at 106 cm−1. The decrease in optical band gap energy might be due to the formation of thicker and well defined grains with the increased Cu content in the ternary system. The linear nature of the absorption plots indicates a direct allowed type of transition.

The phase formation and crystal structure were confirmed using XRD patterns in a 2θ range of 20° to 70°. Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the XRD patterns of ternary (C0) and QMMC (C1 to C4) thin films. All XRD patterns indicate intense diffraction peaks confirming the formation of nanocrystalline thin films. The ternary thin film has major intense peaks at (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103) with respective (hkl) planes, which is in good agreement with the standard JCPDS data (49-1459). So, sample C0 shows the formation of thin films through a pure phase hexagonal crystal structure. Further, XRD spectra of the QMMC thin films show peaks of Cd(SSe), Cu2S and Cu2Se phases. The observed (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103) planes correspond to the Cd(SSe) phase (JCPDS Card No. 49-1459), (101), (102), (103), (202) planes corresponds to the Cu2S phase (JCPDS Card No. 84-0206), while (200), (220), (311), (400) planes correspond to the Cu2Se phase (JCPDS Card No. 75-0889). There are no JCPDS data available for synthesized QMMC thin films. Hence, the obtained peak positions are considered by comparing peak positions with Cd(SSe), Cu2S and Cu2Se which are given in standard JCPDS data cards (49-1459), (84-0206) and (75-0889) respectively. The XRD patterns reveal that quaternary thin films possess mixed hexagonal and cubic crystal structures.

Careful observation of XRD patterns (C1 to C4) indicates that some major dominant peaks remain unchanged and some new peaks appear with increased copper content in the ternary system. Additional new peaks in the XRD pattern (Fig. 4(b)) indicate the formation of new phases in QMMC thin films due to the copper content. Such a successive increase in the intensities of the diffraction peaks is attributed to the incorporation of Cu in the crystal lattices of Cd(SSe), the nanosized thin film formation and the good crystalline nature. Also, the ionic radius of Cu+ (0.91 Å) is smaller than the ionic radius of the Cd2+ ion (1.09 Å), suggesting that Cu+ ions were successfully incorporated into the lattice of QMMC thin films.
Calculated interplanner ‘d’ values were compared with the standard values of Cd(SSe), Cu2S, Cu2Se and are given in Table 3. The last column of Table 3 shows the difference between calculated and the standard ‘d’ values. The crystallite size (D) is calculated by using well known Scherrer formula. Crystallite size of C0, C1, C2, C3 and C4 thin films varied from 79, 56, 61, 64 and 65 nm respectively (Table 2). This improvement in crystallite size with minimum interfacial energy is beneficial for effective light absorption. From the calculated crystallite size (D), the dislocation density (δ) and micro strain (ε) for all thin films were calculated using well known equations. The calculated values of δ and ε goes on decreasing with the increase in Cu-content in the QMMC thin films (Table 2). The decrease in δ and ε are attributed to lower defect levels, grain boundaries and an improvement in the crystallite size of the QMMC thin films. So, the formation of high quality thin films occurs through a decrease in lattice imperfections.

Overall the XRD study demonstrates that with an increase in the Cu-content the formation of mixed phases is observed with a crystalline nature. But, as per our literature survey based on other quaternary materials, the obtained XRD patterns do not show highly intense diffraction peaks. This may be due to the low temperature synthesis and lack of post treatments such as vacuum annealing at different atmospheres, or rapid thermal annealing in the presence of a S or Se source.


Fig. 5 shows FESEM micrographs of the synthesized thin films. The FESEM images clearly indicate uniform, pinhole free and well adherent thin film formation. Fig. 5(a) and (b) show FESEM micrographs of the ternary thin film (C0). The aggregated bunch of nanosphere-like morphology was formed by smaller nanospheres, which is clearly seen in the FESEM images of Fig. 5(a) and (b). Fig. 5(c) and (d) show the low and high magnification FESEM images of a QMMC thin film (C1). The low magnification FESEM image indicates the transformation of an aggregated bunch of nanospheres-like morphology into an erratically orientated nanostructured network surface morphology after the addition of copper and the formation of QMMC thin films. Also, erratically orientated nanostructured network surfaces contain a smaller number of spheres, which are interlinked and merged into the erratically grown network (Fig. 5(c) and (d)).


Fig. 5(e) and (f) are the FESEM images of sample C2 at low and high magnification respectively. Fig. 5(e) reveals the formation of a merged surface of an erratically orientated nanostructured network and smaller nanospheres. The high magnification FESEM image shown in Fig. 5(f) indicates the merged morphology containing spheres that were grown comparatively larger in size than the previous sample. It means that with increased Cu content in the QMMC thin films an aggregation of nanostructured networks with an increase in the number and size of the spheres was observed. The FESEM images of sample C3 are shown in Fig. 5(g) and (h). The low magnification FESEM image of Fig. 5(g) illustrates an increased compactness in the nanostructured network morphology with an increase in the number of larger well grown spheres. The high magnification FESEM image (Fig. 5(h)) indicates the spherical growth morphology formed by more compact and tightly interconnected smaller nanospheres compared to sample C2. Fig. 5(i) and (j) show FESEM images of sample C4. As compared to other samples (C1, C2, C3) the FESEM images of sample C4 clearly indicates more compactness and a larger growth well grown larger nanospheres with networked surfaces. The overall observation of the FESEM study concludes that a mixed and merged surface morphology is formed with increased Cu content in the QMMC thin films.
The QMMC sample (C4) was further characterized using HRTEM and SAED patterns at different magnifications for detailed information about the particles growth and surface modifications. Fig. 6 shows HRTEM images and SAED pattern of QMMC thin film i.e. sample C4. Fig. 6(a) and (b) show the formation of compact and well interconnected nanoparticles. Also, such well grown nanoparticles are arranged in a void free manner, which is in good agreement with the FESEM results. Fig. 6(c) and (d) show HRTEM images, which reveal that the formed nanostructured surface morphology has covered the overall substrate surface. Fig. 6(e) indicates the good crystalline nature of thin film with lattice fringes of d(002) = 3.4 Å for Cd(SSe), d(101) = 3.1 Å for Cu2S and d(200) = 2.0 Å for Cu2Se. These lattice fringes are consistent with the obtained XRD results. Further, the SAED pattern (Fig. 6(f)) shows the formation of a distinct ring pattern. Such a bright, distinct ring pattern confirms the nanocrystalline nature of the synthesized materials. From the above discussion, it is clearly demonstrated that the deposited QMMC thin films formed by the APT method were of a nanocrystalline nature, while the obtained SAED pattern results are in good agreement with the XRD as well as FESEM data.

EDS spectra of ternary (C0) and representative quaternary (C4) thin films are given in Fig. 7(a) and (b) respectively. Fig. 7(a) show that peaks at 3.13, 2.50 and 1.38 keV binding energy confirm the presence of Cd, S and Se elements (C0) respectively. Fig. 7(b) shows the peaks at 0.93, 3.13, 2.50 and 1.38 keV binding energy for Cu, Cd, S and Se elements (C4) respectively. The EDS study clearly confirmed the presence of Cd, S, Se elements in the ternary and Cu, Cd, S, Se elements in the quaternary thin films.


Fig. 8(a) displays the XPS survey spectrum of the representative C4 sample. The survey spectrum shows the presence of Cu, Cd, S, Se, C and O elements. Presence of O may be due to extrinsic contaminations, such as adsorption of CO2, O2 and H2O on the film surface from the atmosphere. Binding energies obtained in the XPS analysis were standardized for specimen charging by using C1s as a reference at 285.02 eV. The high resolution core level XPS spectrum of Cu2p is shown in Fig. 8(b). The Cu2p core level XPS spectrum shows two narrow and asymmetric peaks for Cu2p1/2 and Cu2p3/2 at 952.01 eV and 932.18 eV binding energies respectively.
The presence two distinct peaks with splitting energy at 19.83 eV confirm that Cu is in +1 oxidation state. From the spin–orbital coupling interaction in Cd3d two distinct core level peaks were separated as Cd3d5/2 at a binding energy of 404.97 eV and Cd3d3/2 at a binding energy of 411.68 eV (Fig. 8(c)). The high resolution core level XPS spectrum of S2p of Fig. 8(d) indicates a single peak for S2p located at 159.96 eV binding energy, which is consistent with the range expected for the S in the sulfide phase. The core level XPS spectrum of Se3d (Fig. 8(e)) shows a peak at 54.07 eV, which is in good agreement with values reported for the Se (−II) phase and metal bonded Se. The observed binding energies for all elements in their respective oxidation states confirms Cu+, Cd2+, S2− and Se2− ions were present in the deposited thin film (C4).


Fig. 9(a) shows EC plots of lnσ vs. 1000/T for the QMMC thin films (C1, C2, C3 and C4) and the inset shows the plot of the ternary thin film (C0).

From these plots, it was observed that conductivity increases with the increase in temperature demonstrating a semiconducting nature. Furthermore the activation energy was calculated from a known equation. The activation energy values are tabulated in Table 4. The decrease in activation energy illustrates the semiconducting behavior of thin films.

Fig. 9(b) shows plots of thermo EMF vs. temperature of the QMMC thin films (C1, C2, C3 and C4) and the inset shows a plot of thermo EMF vs. temperature of the ternary thin film (C0). The negative polarity of the generated thermo EMF indicates thin films have n-type semiconducting nature. From the TEP plots the carrier concentration (n) and mobility (μ) were calculated and the calculated data of n and μ summarized in Table 4. The n increase and μ decrease for ternary as well as QMMC thin films (Table 4) might be due to the decrease in anti-structural defects.


Fig. 10 illustrates the J–V curves of all thin films studied in order to assess their PEC performance. Table 5 indicates tabulated values of solar cell parameters extracted from J–V curves. PEC cells were formed by deposited thin films as working electrodes and a graphite rod as a counter electrode. PEC cell parameters such as fill factor (FF), conversion efficiency (η), values of series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) of all samples were calculated from well known equations. All values are summarized in Table 5. The PEC performance of all samples was checked by forming the following cell configuration,

From the J–V measurements, values of Jsc for C0, C1, C2, C3 and C4 thin films were found to be 0.630, 1.029, 1.044, 1.046 and 1.235 mA cm−2 and the corresponding values of Voc were found to be 810, 450, 452, 455 and 437 mV respectively. From Table 5 it was observed that the initial QMMC chalcogenides thin film (C1) shows a low conversion efficiency as compared to the ternary sample (C0). But as the Cu content increased the effective power conversion efficiency was found to be enhanced. The morphological study clearly pointed out that the aggregated bunch of nanospheres-like morphology of the ternary sample (C0) has a comparatively large surface for light absorption, while that of sample C1 illustrates an erratically orientated nanostructured network surface morphology. Such a morphology has a low surface area for light absorption, which results in lower conversion efficiency. Furthermore sample C2 contains a merged surface morphology of erratically orientated nanostructured network and smaller spheres.
This merged surface morphology has an increased surface area due to the formation of spherically grown nanostructures and effective scattering through the nanonetworked porous surface morphology. Furthermore samples C3 and C4 have better conversion efficiency due to greater compactness and the larger growth of the spheres with the networked surfaces. In addition to this, the thickness of synthesized thin films increases with the increase in Cu-content. Such an increase in film thickness is beneficial for solar cell applications, because thicker films have well grown large grains having a large surface area and are favorable for absorption of light radiation. Such an improvement in surface area is highly suitable for PEC cell applications. In the present investigation the improvement in conversion efficiency is correlated with the increase in film thickness as well as the formation of the hierarchical microstructures of the quaternary thin films.
Such a morphology is formed by smaller nanospheres to form a well grown spherical morphology, which has a large surface area for effective light absorption like a ‘light trapping’ phenomena. That of the erratically orientated nanostructured network morphology has a better pathway for electron flow based on a ‘light scattering’ phenomenon (as shown schematically in Fig. 11).

QMMC thin films were synthesized by using the arrested precipitation technique. The synthesized thin films show an enhancement in the photocurrent with an increased copper-content. Such an improvement in conversion efficiency is quite comparable with other well known quaternary materials synthesized by sophisticated physical techniques. The optostructural study showed that the synthesized quaternary thin films have a mixed crystal structure and band gap energy lies in the range of 1.79 eV to 1.46 eV. The morphological study clearly indicated that hierarchical microstructures are developed with a nanocrystalline nature. Compositional analysis confirms the synthesized thin films are in the requisite composition. The electrical conductivity study illustrated the n-type semiconducting nature of thin films. The J–V curves demonstrated that QMMC thin films showed an improvement in conversion efficiency with increased copper-content.
