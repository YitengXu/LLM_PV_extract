A new non-fullerene acceptor, namely Y10, based on dithienothiophen[3,2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole (TPBT) as the central core and 2-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-4H-cyclopenta[c]thiophen-4-ylidene)malononitrile (TC) as the electron-deficient end group, has been designed and synthesized. Y10 reveals a narrow optical energy gap (Eoptg) of 1.35 eV with a broad absorption band from 600 to 900 nm. A wide bandgap polymer, J11, as the donor material (Eoptg = 1.96 eV) is used to blend with Y10 for the construction of organic solar cell devices, which achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.46% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.89 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 21.21 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 71.55%, with thermal annealing treatment at 100 °C for 5 min and 0.8 wt% 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as an additive. These results indicate that the incorporation of the TPBT unit as the central core and the TC unit as the electron-deficient end group provides an efficient strategy for the construction of high performance solar cells.

Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) concept have drawn great attention in the past few years because of their unique advantages such as light weight, flexibility and low-cost. Recently, state-of-the-art single junction and tandem OSCs based on non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have surpassed 15% and 17% power conversation efficiencies (PCEs), which are higher than those of fullerene derivative based devices.

The active layer in BHJ OSCs consists of electron donors and electron acceptors. Over the past period of time, fullerene acceptor materials have played a dominant role in OSCs due to their high electron affinity, mobility and isotropic charge transport. However, some intrinsic drawbacks of fullerene acceptors, such as their limitation in terms of energy level adjustment, poor absorption of visible light and inherent tendency of aggregation, pose a challenge to further improve the photovoltaic performance of fullerene-based OSCs. In contrast, NFAs, with advantages like synthetic flexibility, adjustable energy levels and strong absorption in visible and near infrared (NIR) spectra, have great potential to address the above-mentioned drawbacks of fullerene acceptors.
It has been reported that a variety of NFAs derived from perylene diimide (PDI) and naphthalene diimide (NDI) exhibit unique qualities due to their distinctive flat and rigid conjugated structures. So far, some NFA based OSCs have shown better performance than their counterpart devices using fullerene and its derivatives. Among the NFAs, the acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) backbone architecture has been most successful. Zhan's group reported a novel high performance NFA named 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC), which consists of an electron-donating indacenodithiophene (IDT)-based core and two electron-withdrawing end groups of 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC). ITIC boasts a great and broad absorption in the visible and NIR regions, giving rise to a PCE of 6.8% when blended with the low bandgap donor polymer PTB7-Th. Since then, a series of IITC derivatives with an A–D–A structure have been reported with high photovoltaic performances.
It has been revealed that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of those NFAs mainly depend on the conjugated backbone and the end-capping electron deficient unit, respectively. Furthermore, the absorption and molecule packing in solid states could also be adjusted through subtle molecular design. Our group reported a promising NFA (ITTC) (the full name and structure of ITTC are shown in Fig. S8, ESI), composed of IDT as the central core and a new end group, 2-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-4H-cyclopenta[c]thiophen-4-ylidene)malononitrile (TC). It showed an impressive PCE of 10.40% when blended with the donor polymer HFQx-T by thermal annealing (TA) treatment. Besides, Yang's group reported two new NFAs, named ITCPTC-Th and ITCPTC-Se (the full names and structures of ITCPTC-Th and ITCPTC-Se are shown in Fig. S8, ESI), which were designed and synthesized with n-hexylthienyl and n-hexylselenophenyl as the side chains of the central core and TC as the end group. As a result, an OSC based on PBDB-T:ITCPTC-Th (the full name and structure of PBDB-T are shown in Fig. S8, ESI) delivered a PCE of 10.61% with 0.5% 1.8-diiodooctane (DIO) and a PBDB-T:ITCPTC-Se based device demonstrated a PCE of 9.02%. After this, Yang's group reported a small molecule acceptor, ITCPTC, with the TC unit as the end group, affording a PCE of 11.8% when PBT1-EH (the full name and structure of PBT1-EH are shown in Fig. S8, ESI) was used as the electron donor. These results indicate that TC as the end group can achieve better electron delocalization and stronger intermolecular forces through the formation of noncovalent S⋯S bonds, resulting in improved photovoltaic performance. In addition, fused-ring electron acceptors as the central core display some merits, such as adjustable energy levels and greatly improved absorption in the visible and NIR regions. Recently, our group reported a series of NFAs with an acceptor–(donor–acceptor–donor)–acceptor (A–DA′D–A) type structure, which has attracted great attention owing to their marvellous photovoltaic properties. For example, we introduced the benzotriazole unit into the central core to form a weak electron-deficient-core-based fused structure (DA′D) for the sake of adjusting the optoelectronic characteristics of the resulting molecules (Y1 and Y2) (the full names and structures of Y1 and Y2 are shown in Fig. S8, ESI) and achieving high performance OSCs. Based on the above strategy, Y1 and Y2 were designed and synthesized, and blended with donor PBDB-T; the Y1:PBDB-T-based devices achieved a PCE of 13.42% and the Y2:PBDB-T-based devices reached a PCE of 13.40%. After that, we introduced the more electron-deficient 2,1,3-benzothiadiazide (BT) unit into the central core to form a DA′D-type TPBT-core for improving device performance. Moreover, long alkyl side chains were introduced on the flank of the central unit to increase the solubility and reduce configurational isomers. Then, two new NFAs, named Y5 and Y6 (the full names and structures of Y5 and Y6 are shown in Fig. S8, ESI), were designed and synthesized for photovoltaic applications. By blending Y5 with three common donors with different energy gaps (J61, PBDB-T and TTFQx-T1) (the full names and structures of J61, PBDB-T and TTFQx-T1 are shown in Fig. S8, ESI), the PCE reached 11.0%, 13.1% and 14.1%, respectively. Moreover, the Y6 based device achieved a record efficiency of 15.7% when blended with PM6 as a polymer donor.
Based on the above strategies, herein, we report a new NFA, named Y10, which consists of a weak electron accepting unit TPBT-based core and two electron-withdrawing units of TC. Recently, Li's group synthesized and reported a new conjugated polymer, J11, and demonstrated a high PCE of 12.32% when blended with the acceptor m-ITTC with TA treatment at 150 °C for 1 min. The chemical structures of J11, m-ITIC and Y10 are shown in Fig. 1. Here, the devices were fabricated based on the J11 donor and the Y10 acceptor, and demonstrated a PCE of 13.46% with a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 21.21 mA cm−2, and an FF of 71.55% by thermal annealing treatment at 100 °C for 5 min and using 0.8 wt% 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as the additive. The Y10 film exhibits a much redshifted spectrum with a narrow optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.35 eV compared to 1.61 eV of m-ITTC, which is beneficial for obtaining higher Jsc. The results of this work once again prove that high performance acceptor materials can be obtained from BT-based DA′D-type structures.

The synthetic route of Y10 is shown in Fig. 2. The specific synthetic details of compounds TPBT and TC have been described in our previous work. The compound TPBT–CHO was prepared by the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction as an orange-red solid. The target product Y10 was obtained through a Knoevenagel condensation of the compound TPBT–CHO with TC. The experimental details of Y10 are shown in the ESI. The intermediates and target products were characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR. The NMR spectra of the intermediate and Y10 are shown in Fig. S1–S4 (ESI). Y10 shows good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform (CHCl3) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) at room temperature.


The thermal stability of Y10 was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI). The decomposition temperature (Td) of Y10 with 5% weight loss is 317 °C, which indicates its good thermal stability for application in OSCs.


The normalized absorption spectra of Y10 in chloroform solution and the thin film form are shown in Fig. 3a. Compared to the solution absorption spectrum, an obvious red shift of ∼75 nm in the thin film indicates strong aggregation of the molecular backbone and π–π interactions in the solid state. The absorption onset of the Y10 film is located at 916 nm, corresponding to an optical bandgap (Eoptg = 1240/λonset) of 1.35 eV.


Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out to measure the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of Y10. The CV curve is shown in Fig. 3b and the corresponding energy level is shown in Fig. S6 (ESI). The onset potentials for oxidation (φox) and reduction (φred) are 1.20 and −0.60 V, respectively. The ELUMO/EHOMO values of Y10 were calculated from φox/φred to be −3.76 eV and −5.56 eV, according to the equations EHOMO/ELUMO = −e(φox/φred + 4.8 − φFc/Fc+) (eV), where φFc/Fc+ was measured to be 0.44 V vs. Ag/AgCl in this measured system. The corresponding absorption properties and electronic energy levels of Y10 and J11 are summarized in Table 1.

To investigate the photovoltaic properties of Y10 in OSCs, we fabricated OSCs with an ITO (indium tin oxide)/PEDOT:PSS(poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene–sulfonate))/J11:Y10/PDINO (perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide)/Al structure, where PEDOT:PSS and PDINO were used as the hole and electron transport layers, respectively. All the active layers were spin-coated from chloroform solution. The wide bandgap conjugated polymer J11 was chosen as the donor with an absorption onset of 634 nm. The absorption of J11 is complementary to that of the acceptor Y10 which can broaden the absorption profile of J11:Y10-based OSCs. The J11:Y10 weight ratio, additive concentration and annealing temperature were well optimized. The detailed photovoltaic data are summarized in Table S1 (ESI).

The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristic curves of the as-cast and optimized OSCs based on a J11:Y10 weight ratio of 1:1.2 (w/w) under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination are shown in Fig. 4a and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. Devices based on the as-cast J11:Y10 (1:1.2, w/w) achieved a PCE of 11.37% with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 19.76 mA cm−2, and an FF of 62.57%. Then, the high boiling point processing additive CN and TA treatment were used to optimize the morphology of the active layer for higher performance OSCs. The optimized device demonstrated a PCE of 13.46% with a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 21.21 mA cm−2, and an FF of 71.55% by TA treatment at 100 °C for 5 min and the use of 0.8 wt% CN. The results indicated that TA and CN treatments are efficient post-treatments for J11:Y10 blend films. The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices without and with post-processing conditions are shown in Fig. 4b. The high and broad EQEs over the whole range from 300 to 900 nm suggest that J11 and Y10 made a complementary contribution to the Jsc. The EQE values for the device with post-processing treatment were higher than those for the device without post-processing treatment, reaching a maximum value of 73% and over 65% across the range of 430–810 nm. This can explain the higher Jsc with post-processing treatment. The Jsc values of the devices calculated from integration of the EQE spectra were 19.36 mA cm−2 without post-processing treatment and 20.79 mA cm−2 with post-processing treatment, which were consistent with the values obtained from the J–V curves (within 2% mismatch).

To further understand the effects of additives and TA on the device performance, the charge transport properties of J11:Y10 blends were determined by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The hole-only and electron-only devices were measured with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINO/Al device structures, respectively. Fig. 5a and b show the measurement results and the related data are summarized in Table 3. The as-cast J11:Y10 blend film shows a hole mobility (μh) of 1.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility (μe) of 1.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with balanced charge transport (μe/μh = 1.44). After the additive and TA treatment, the blend film shows a higher μe of 4.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1and a higher μh of 3.19 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, with a more balanced charge mobility (μe/μh = 1.31). The high and balanced charge transport is one of the reasons for the high Jsc and FF.

To study the charge recombination behavior in the OSCs, the dependence of Jsc on the light density (Plight) was measured. In general, the relationship between Jsc and Plight can be described by the formula Jsc ∝ Pα. If all the charges are swept out and collected before recombination, α should be equal to 1. As shown in Fig. 5c, the value of α for the J11:Y10 as-cast blend film was 0.96, which suggested that there was still some bimolecular recombination. After post-processing treatment, α for J11:Y10 blend films was 0.98, which indicated weaker bimolecular recombination and more efficient charge transport. These results indicate less bimolecular recombination and more efficient charge collection in the optimized devices, which agrees with the high FF and Jsc of the optimized device.
To explore the processes of exciton generation, dissociation and charge collection, the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) was measured. As shown in Fig. 5d, Jph reaches saturation (Jsat) at 2 V, indicating that the charge recombination reaches the minimum and almost all of the charges are collected by the electrodes. The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) can be calculated from Jph/Jsat. Under short-circuit conditions, the Pdiss in the optimized device is 98.5%, which is higher than that of the as-cast devices (96.9%). The higher value of Pdiss under post-processing conditions indicates that the additives and TA treatment conditions result in higher exciton dissociation and more efficient charge collection efficiency compared to those of the as-cast device. A higher value of Pdiss is beneficial for realizing a higher Jsc and FF.

The morphology plays a very important role in OSCs. Suitable domains and associated intimate mixing are desirable for exciton separation and transport. To evaluate the effects of the microstructures of active layers on device performance, the morphologies were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The root-mean-square roughness (Rq) of 1.47 nm with slightly large aggregation and phase separation is shown in Fig. 6a. As shown in Fig. 6b, after the additive and TA treatment, the blend film exhibited a smooth and more defined nanoscale morphology with a lower Rq of 1.29 nm corresponding to a high PCE of 13.46%. The height images of the surface were observed by AFM for the blend films with different scan sizes (Fig. 6a and b), indicating good miscibility between J11 and Y10. Furthermore, we explored the internal morphology of the J11:Y10 blend film by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 6c, relatively large phase separation and amorphous regions in the as cast J11:Y10 blend films could be observed. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 6d, very homogeneous and interpenetrating networks with small crystalline grains uniformly covering the entire scan area can be seen after post-processing treatment. The results indicate that the more nanoscale morphology of the J11:Y10 blend film after post-treatment is beneficial for efficient charge transport and exciton dissociation characteristics, thus achieving higher photovoltaic performance with an increased FF and Jsc.


In summary, a new A–DA′D–A ladder type acceptor, Y10, using a BT-based fused central unit (TPBT) and a TC end group was designed and synthesized. Y10 exhibited a low Eoptg of 1.35 eV and a broad absorption in the 600–900 nm range. With the CN additives and TA treatment, a homogeneous and nanophase segregated crystalline structure could be observed, contributing to the formation of a favorable interpenetrating network with suitable phase separation in the active layer. Furthermore, higher FF and Jsc values were obtained by post-treatment. In combination with a polymer donor, J11, its optimized device presented a promising PCE of 13.46% with a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 21.21 mA cm−2, and an FF of 71.55%. These results indicate that using a DA′D multifused structure with benzothiadiazole as the electron deficient core and TC as the end-capping group is an efficient strategy to build new and high performance NFAs.
