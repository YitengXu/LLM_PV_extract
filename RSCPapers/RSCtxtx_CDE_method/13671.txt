Recent progress has shown that low-temperature processed tin oxide (SnO2) is an excellent electron selective layer (ESL) material for fabricating highly efficient organic–inorganic metal-halide perovskite solar cells with a planar cell structure. Low-temperature processing and a planar cell structure are desirable characteristics for large-scale device manufacturing due to their associated low costs and processing simplicity. Here, we report that plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) is able to lower the deposition temperature of SnO2 ESLs to below 100 °C and still achieve high device performance. With C60-self-assembled monolayer passivation, our PEALD SnO2 ESLs deposited at ∼100 °C led to average power conversion efficiencies higher than 18% (maximum of 19.03%) and 15% (maximum of 16.80%) under reverse voltage scan for solar cells fabricated on glass and flexible polymer substrates, respectively. Our results thus demonstrate the potential of the low-temperature PEALD process of SnO2 ESLs for large-scale manufacturing of efficient perovskite solar cells.

Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have attracted much attention in the past few years since their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has increased from 3.8% (ref. 1) to over 22%. Such a rapid improvement of efficiency is ascribed to the superior photovoltaic properties of these halide perovskite materials such as high optical absorption coefficients with a broad absorption range, weak exciton binding energy, long carrier lifetime and charge diffusion length, and benign defect properties, as well as ease of fabrication. Additionally, since lead halide perovskites exhibit excellent electron and hole transport properties, efficient PVSCs can be fabricated by simply sandwiching a perovskite absorber between an electron selective layer (ESL) and a hole selective layer (HSL). The record efficiency PVSCs are realized using mesoporous TiO2 ESLs, which require sintering at temperatures above 450 °C. For large-scale roll-to-roll manufacturing, a simple planar cell structure and low-temperature processing are highly preferred. Other transition metal oxides such as ZnO (ref. 26 and 27) and SnO2 (ref. 28–31) have also been explored as potential ESL materials for PVSCs. Both compact ZnO and SnO2 thin films can be deposited by low-temperature processes. The electron mobilities of ZnO (ref. 32) and SnO2 (ref. 33) were reported to be much higher than that of TiO2. Planar PVSCs using ZnO, Zn2SnO4, and SnO2 ESLs have achieved high PCEs. It is worth mentioning that lead halide perovskites deposited on ZnO ESLs are thermally unstable, suffering from fast decomposition to PbI2 when annealed up to 80 °C. Moreover, low-temperature processed SnO2 ESLs have shown some advantages over compact TiO2 ESLs including better cell stability, higher optical transparency, and barrier-free energetic configuration. Furthermore, if a SnO2 layer is grown on the top of thin-film solar cells, it can improve the stability of the cells against moisture.

Low-temperature SnO2 ESLs have been deposited by various methods including spin-coating, dual-fuel combustion, and thermal ozone atomic-layer deposition (ALD), among which ALD is expected to produce the most compact thin films at the lowest deposition temperature. SnO2 ESLs grown by ozone ALD at a temperature close to 120 °C have produced PVSCs with PCEs of over 18%, indicating that ALD is a promising method for obtaining effective ESLs. However, further reduction in the deposition temperature while maintaining high-efficiency device performance could be even more beneficial for large-scale PVSC fabrication, especially for flexible PVSCs. In a thermal ALD process, the reaction of the metal precursor relies on the deposition temperature. Compared with thermal ALD, plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD) has demonstrated the ability to deposit films with equivalent material properties at lower substrate temperatures due to the higher reactivity enhanced by the plasma species. Therefore, PEALD is a method of choice for further lowering the processing temperature of SnO2 ESLs.
In this work, we demonstrate that the deposition temperature of SnO2 ESLs that results in the best device performance can be reduced to ∼100 °C using PEALD. After passivating the surface of SnO2 ESLs with a C60-self-assembled monolayer (C60-SAM), PVSCs fabricated on glass and flexible substrates have achieved average power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) higher than 18% (maximum of 19.03%) and 15% (maximum of 16.80%), respectively. It is worth noting that even the SnO2 ESLs deposited by PEALD at 70 °C are able to generate PVSCs with average PCEs over 17%. Therefore, our results demonstrate the potential of PEALD for synthesizing high-quality SnO2 ESLs at very low temperature to fabricate highly efficient perovskite solar cells.

FTO glass with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω □−1 was cleaned with a chemical detergent, facilitated by ultrasonication, with water, acetone and iso-propanol successively prior to PEALD of SnO2. An ITO/PET (45 Ω □−1) substrate was cleaned by the same procedure. Tetrakis(dimethylamino)-tin(IV) (99%, TDMA-Sn, Strem Chemicals Inc.) was used as the Sn precursor and pure O2 (ultra-high pure, Airgas) was used as the oxidizer. Ar (ultra-high pure, Airgas) was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 15 sccm. PEALD SnO2 was deposited at 100 °C with an Ensure Scientific Group AutoALD-PE V2.0 equipped with a plasma generator. The TDMA-Sn precursor was held at 75 °C. The resulting deposition rate is about 1.7 Å per cycle as determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry.


A 45% by weight precursor solution was prepared with lead iodide (PbI2, Alfa Aesar, 99.9985%) and methylammonium iodide (MAI) (molar ratio = 1:1) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (volume ratio = 9:1). A small amount of lead thiocyanate (Pb(SCN)2, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%) was added into the precursor solution as an additive. It has been shown that the Pb(SCN)2 additive can enlarge the grain size of the resulting perovskite thin films and subsequently improve the cell performance. The solution was stirred for 12 hours on a 60 °C hot plate before deposition.


The C60-SAM was purchased and used without further purification. The C60-SAM at a concentration of 4 mg mL−1 was dissolved in chlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) under vigorous stirring overnight. The C60-SAM was then deposited onto the SnO2 ESL by a spin coating method as previously reported. The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on the C60-SAM/SnO2 ESLs first at 500 rpm for 3 s and then at 4000 rpm for 60 s using an anti-solvent technique. Diethyl ether, as the anti-solvent agent, was then drop-cast on the substrate. After spin coating, the perovskite film was annealed at 65 °C for 2 minutes and then at 100 °C for 5 minutes. All of these processes were carried out in a N2 filled glove box. Spiro-OMeTAD (Shenzhen Feiming Science and Technology Co., Ltd., 99.0%) was used as the HSL and deposited on the perovskite film at 2000 rpm for 60 seconds. The Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg Spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL chlorobenzene with 28 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) (Sigma-Aldrich, 96%) and 18 μL Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.95%) (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile). A layer of 80 nm gold (Au) was then deposited on the top of Spiro-OMeTAD using thermal evaporation. The working area of the devices was 0.08 cm2 as defined by a shadow mask during the Au evaporation.


Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were obtained under standard AM 1.5 G illumination using a solar simulator (PV Measurements, Inc) equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp with an output intensity of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a reference Si cell at the measurement location. The light intensity was later adjusted between 0.5 and 100 mW cm−2 using neutral density filters. EQE measurements were carried out with an EQE system (PV Measurements, Inc) using 100 Hz chopped monochromatic light ranging from 300 nm to 900 nm under otherwise near-dark test conditions. Transmission spectra and ultraviolet-visible absorbance spectra were measured with an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (CARY5000, Varian, Australia). Impedance spectra were recorded on an electrochemical workstation (Voltalab PGZ-301) at 0 mV bias in the dark. The plane view and cross sectional structures of the substrates and PVSCs were characterized with a field emission SEM instrument (Hitachi S-4800). The crystallinity and the crystal structure of the perovskite layer were analyzed with an Ultima III X-ray diffractometer using a Ni-filtered Cu Kα X-ray source (Rigaku Corp.). The film thickness was analyzed via spectroscopic ellipsometry using a single rotating compensator multichannel ellipsometer (Model M2000FI, J. A. Woollam Co., Inc.). AFM was carried out with a Nanoscope V atomic force microscope operating in the tapping-mode (Veeco Metrology Group). The sheet resistance was measured using a four-point probe method resistivity test system (PRO4-440N, Lucas labs).


PL and TRPL measurements were performed at room temperature in ambient air. The samples were excited through the glass side (i.e. ESL side). For steady-state PL, a 532 nm cw laser (intensity = 11 mW cm−2, beam diameter ≈ 140 μm) was used as a source of excitation. The PL signal was detected with a Symphony-II CCD (from Horiba) detector after a 300 g mm−1 grating monochromator (integration time = 0.5 s). Time resolved photoluminescence measurements were performed using a time correlated single photon counting module (Becker & Hickel Simple Tau SPCM 130-E/M module). A 532 nm pulsed laser (0.2 mW cm−2, beam diameter ≈ 100 μm) was used as a source of excitation. The photoluminescence signal was dispersed with a Horiba IHR 320 monochromator (grating 900 g mm−1, 850 nm blaze, and detected with a hybrid APD/PMT module (Hamamatsu R10467U-50)). TRPL measurements were performed (integration time = 1200 s) at a 1 MHz repetition rate. TCSPC decay curves obtained in the TRPL measurements were fit to two-exponential decay by iterative re-convolution with the measured system response function (W). The mean photogenerated carrier life time is calculated by the weighted average as follows:
y(t) = (W × f)(t)

Since an ESL layer plays dual roles, i.e., transferring electrons and blocking holes, a pinhole-free and compact film morphology is highly desirable for suppressing the charge recombination at the interfaces.Fig. 1 shows a top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of PEALD SnO2 deposited at 100 °C with 130 reaction cycles on a fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) coated glass substrate. The top-view SEM images of bare FTO and FTO coated with PEALD SnO2 with various reaction cycles are shown in Fig. S1. The SEM images show that PEALD SnO2 films are uniformly coated on the surface of FTO.

We used spectroscopic ellipsometry to determine the actual thickness of PEALD deposited SnO2 ESLs with various reaction cycles. The thickness–reaction cycle relationship is plotted in Fig. S2. The thickness increases linearly with the number of reaction cycles. The film thickness for the 130 reaction cycle sample at a deposition temperature of 100 °C is about 15 nm. The PEALD SnO2 ESLs were also found to exhibit excellent optical properties. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the PEALD SnO2 ESLs demonstrate antireflection properties, i.e., enhanced transparency across most of the visible spectrum range after PEALD deposition of SnO2 ESLs compared to the bare FTO substrate. The increased transparency is beneficial for light harvesting by the perovskite layer. This improvement in transparency is consistent with that observed by using SnO2 ESLs deposited by low-temperature solution processes. PEALD SnO2 ESLs deposited at temperatures ranging from 50 to 200 °C and reaction cycles ranging from 40 to 190 showed a compact surface morphology and optical transparency, which are suitable properties and necessary requirements for efficient ESLs.
We systematically examined the relationship of the PEALD deposition temperature and the number of reaction cycles with PVSC performance. We used a regular device structure of glass/FTO/PEALD-SnO2/C60-SAM/perovskite/HSL/Au. The HSL is lithium doped 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD). As reported in the literature, applying a very thin fullerene layer, such as C60, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), and C60-SAMs, can passivate the surfaces of metal oxides and effectively promote charge transfer at the metal oxide ESL/perovskite interfaces. Therefore, we applied a thin C60-SAM interlayer via spin-coating for all our PEALD SnO2 ESLs (Fig. S3). As seen in Fig. S4, applying the thin C60-SAM interlayer improves the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) and therefore the over-all performance. Meanwhile, the current density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis is reduced with the use of the C60-SAM, which results in improved agreement between the forward and reverse scan values of VOC, JSC, FF and PCE as shown in Fig. S4. The CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite absorber layers were deposited as described above. The MAPbI3 perovskite layers deposited on C60-SAM/SnO2/FTO substrates exhibited high crystallinity and a smooth surface morphology (Fig. S5 and S6). In Fig. S6(b), the SEM image displays some relatively brighter particles located at the grain boundaries between the larger MAPbI3 crystals, which can be ascribed to excessive PbI2 as we previously reported. The XRD pattern also confirmed the presence of excess PbI2 (Fig. S6(a)).
For better insight into the function of the C60-SAM, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) quenching and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were performed to evaluate the charge carrier extraction properties.Fig. 2(a) shows that the perovskite film deposited on C60-SAM/SnO2/FTO has greater PL quenching as compared to the SnO2/FTO counterpart. Moreover, Fig. 2(b) shows the TRPL of the perovskite films on SnO2/FTO with and without the C60-SAM. The perovskite film on C60-SAM/SnO2/FTO shows a faster PL decay than that on SnO2/FTO. The photogenerated charge carrier lifetimes are estimated to be 22 ns and 57 ns, respectively. This shows that electron extraction can be enhanced by modifying perovskite/SnO2 contact with the C60-SAM. Impedance spectroscopy (IS) was used to investigate interface charge transport and recombination in our PVSCs.Fig. 2(c) shows the Nyquist plots of PVSCs employing C60-SAM/SnO2/FTO and SnO2/FTO as ESLs. The semicircle in the low frequency range can be attributed to the recombination resistance (Rrec) at the interface of the perovskite and ESL. It is obvious that the Rrec is significantly decreased after C60-SAM passivation, indicating reduced recombination. Furthermore, the semicircle in the high frequency range can be attributed to the transfer resistance (Rtr) at the perovskite/ESL interface. A lower Rtr was obtained in the presence of the C60-SAM, manifesting faster charge transfer at the optimized perovskite/ESL interface and favorable transport of photogenerated generated electrons. The larger Rrec and lower Rtr should lead to a higher VOC and FF, which is consistent with our J–V results in Fig. 2(d). The VOC, JSC, FF and PCE of PVSCs based on C60-SAM/SnO2/FTO are 1.126 V, 21.35 mA cm−2, 79.10% and 19.02%, while those of PVSCs based on SnO2/FTO are 1.074 V 21.17 mA cm−2, 75.48% and 17.16%, respectively. The higher VOC and FF are ascribed to efficient electron extraction and hole blocking of the C60-SAM.
We first explored the performance dependence on reaction cycles of 40, 70, 100, 130, 160, and 190; all with the deposition temperature at 100 °C. Their corresponding thicknesses can be found in Fig. S2. The J–V curves of some representative PVSCs using PEALD SnO2 ESLs with various reaction cycles, measured under both reverse and forward voltage scans with a scan speed of 1 V s−1, are shown in Fig. S7. The average device performance parameters including VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE for over 50 cells are summarized in Table S1. The histograms of the performance parameters are shown in Fig. 3. It is noted that even with a 40 reaction cycle PEALD SnO2 ESL (only a few monolayers thickness), the device showed an average VOC higher than 1.0 V. This is ascribed to the complete coverage and the hole-blocking effect of the SnO2 ESL, as well as the passivation effect of the C60-SAM. As the number of reaction cycles increases, all performance parameters first increase and then decrease. The average PCE reaches the maximum with 130 reaction cycles, which is about 15 nm as determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry. This trend may be understood by the trade-off between the electron transport properties and the hole-blocking ability of SnO2 ESLs. For increased hole-blocking, thicker SnO2 ESLs are preferred; however, for improved electron transport, thinner SnO2 ESLs are required. Consequently, we selected PEALD SnO2 with 130 reaction cycles (15 nm) to investigate the effect of deposition temperature.
With the number of reaction cycles fixed at 130, we then varied the deposition temperature for PEALD SnO2 ESLs: 50, 70, 100, 150, and 200 °C. A large number of PVSCs using these SnO2 ESLs were fabricated. The J–V curves of some representative PVSCs measured under reverse and forward voltage scans are shown in Fig. S8. The average device performance parameters of over 40 cells are summarized in Table S2 and their histograms are shown in Fig. 4. It is seen that the average VOC and FF first increase and then decrease as the deposition temperature increases. The JSC appears to increase slightly as the deposition temperature increases, although the change is almost within the order of the statistical variation. The average PCE reaches the maximum value at 100 °C. This is about 20 °C lower than the processing temperature as reported for ozone ALD SnO2 ESLs. It is worth highlighting that even the SnO2 ESL deposited at 70 °C can produce PVSCs with average efficiency close to 16%. If the processing temperature is further decreased to 50 °C, the device performance decreased dramatically. It is likely that such a low temperature cannot allow the metal precursors to fully react to form high-quality SnO2 ESLs, even in the presence of plasma-generated reactive species. However, if the processing temperature is too high, the SnO2 ESLs start to recrystallize, creating pinholes and a rough surface as shown in Fig. S9, leading to decreased performance.
The PVSCs using PEALD SnO2 ESLs deposited at 100 °C with 130 reaction cycles have achieved an averaged efficiency of 18.21 ± 0.59%, with a JSC of 21.08 ± 0.42 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.11 ± 0.02 V and a FF of 77.62 ± 1.34%. Our PVSCs exhibited very small J–V hysteretic behaviour. Fig. 5(a) shows J–V curves of a PVSC using a PEALD SnO2 ESL deposited at 100 °C and with 130 reaction cycles measured under reverse voltage scan with various scan rates. The results indicate that the performance of our devices is relatively independent of the scan rate. The JSC (21.50 mA cm−2) from the J–V curves is very close to the integrated photocurrent (21.20 mA cm−2) from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) as shown in Fig. 5(b). The J–V curves of this PVSC measured under both reverse and forward voltage scan directions are shown in Fig. 5(c), showing almost no hysteresis. The VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE are 1.08 (1.07) V, 21.80 (21.81) mA cm−2, 76.95 (75.48)%, and 18.12 (17.61)%, respectively, when measured under reverse (forward) voltage scan. The corresponding steady-state efficiency is 17.55%, as shown in Fig. 5(d). The current density is 19.12 mA cm−2 and the efficiency is 17.55% under a bias of 0.918 V, which is very close to J–V extracted efficiency. It is encouraging that this PVSC also showed good stability when kept under N2 conditions with relative humidity below 10% and under normal room light. The output power remained unaltered with the storage time, as shown in Fig. 5(e). After being stored for 480 hours, the VOC increased from 1.09 V to 1.11 V, while the FF decreased slightly and the JSC remained unchanged, leading to a negligible change of the PCE. The J–V curves of this PVSC measured under reverse voltage scan after various storage times almost overlapped (Fig. 5(f)). The good stability of PVSCs with the PEALD SnO2 ESL might be attributable to the negligible catalytic character of SnO2 and its relative insensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) light (much lower than PVSCs fabricated with TiO2 (ref. 53 and 54)), which may lead to the negligible degradation of photocurrent observed in our devices.
The low-temperature deposition of efficient SnO2 ESLs enabled by PEALD is particularly beneficial for fabricating flexible PVSCs. We have fabricated flexible PVSCs on indium-doped SnO2 (ITO)/polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates. The PEALD SnO2 ESLs were deposited at 100 °C with 130 reaction cycles. Over 30 flexible PVSCs were fabricated, and their average VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE are 1.07 ± 0.04 (1.03 ± 0.05) V, 20.68 ± 0.22 (20.74 ± 0.28) mA cm−2, 70.33 ± 3.18 (61.70 ± 3.42)%, and 15.57 ± 1.14 (13.18 ± 1.00)%, respectively, when measured under reverse (forward) voltage scan. The J–V curves measured under both reverse and forward voltage scans and the EQE spectra of the best-performing PVSC on FTO/glass and ITO/PET substrates are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), respectively. The best-performing PVSC fabricated on FTO/glass showed a PCE of 19.03 (18.24)% with a VOC of 1.13 (1.10) V, a JSC of 21.56 (21.55) mA cm−2, and a FF of 78.11 (76.93)% under reverse (forward) scan. Meanwhile, the best-performing flexible PVSC showed a PCE of 16.80 (15.48)% with a VOC of 1.11 (1.09) V, a JSC of 20.50 (20.50) mA cm−2, and a FF of 73.82 (69.28)% under reverse (forward) voltage scan. J–V curves of one flexible PVSC measured under reverse and forward voltage scans with various scan rates are shown in Fig. S10. Current densities integrated from the EQE spectra are shown in Fig. 6(b), which are 21.14 and 19.61 mA cm−2 for the best cells fabricated on FTO/glass and flexible ITO/PET substrates, respectively. They are in good agreement with those from the J–V curves. It is noteworthy to point out that the VOC of the best flexible PVSC is 1.11 V, only 20 mV lower than that of the best PVSC on the FTO substrate, implying that a pinhole-free and compact SnO2 ESL also forms on the ITO/PET surface, leading to effective hole-blocking and minimized charge recombination. The absorbance spectra of MAPbI3 deposited on two substrates, shown in Fig. 6(c), reveal the identical onsets at about 778 nm, indicating similar absorption characteristics irrespective of the substrates (XRD and SEM information of perovskite films deposited on the ITO/PET substrates is provided in Fig. S11). The lower FF of the flexible device is likely attributable to the relatively higher sheet resistance of the ITO on flexible PET (∼45 Ω □−1), compared with the high-temperature processed FTO electrode on glass (∼15 Ω □−1). The tapping-mode atomic-force microscopy (AFM) images of FTO and ITO shown in Fig. S12 reveal that the FTO also has much larger grain sizes than the ITO. We have also measured the effect of bending fatigue cycles on the device performance as shown in Fig. 6(d). After 200 times of bending with a minimum radius of curvature of 5 mm, the PCE is still 14.00%, approximately 85% of its initial PCE of 16.50%, indicating good flexibility endurance of our PVSCs with the low-temperature PEALD SnO2 ESL. The significant change of the flexible device performance upon multiple bending originates from the decreased FF, from its initial 71.35 to 61.65% after 200 times of bending. As shown in Fig. 6(d), the FF decreased dramatically with bending cycles, which can also be observed in the J–V curves in Fig. S13(b). This change is likely ascribable to the increase in the sheet resistance of the ITO/PET flexible substrate, and thus the series resistance of the PVSC, as shown in Fig. S13(a) and (c), respectively. The increase in the sheet resistance of the ITO/PET substrate with bending time is one of the main causes for the decreased FF. The inset of Fig. 6(d) shows a photograph of our flexible device after the bending test, which still has a shiny and smooth surface without any observable damage.
To further understand the charge recombination mechanism in the flexible devices, light intensity dependence measurements were carried out under different light intensities ranging from 0.5 to 100 mW cm−2 as shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7(a) shows the corresponding J–V curves under the different illumination intensities. The power law dependence of JSC on light intensity (J–Iα) is shown in Fig. 7(b). A solar device with space charge effects will have a factor α = 0.75 while if α is close to 1, there is no space charge. This flexible device shows a value of α = 0.952, indicating a negligible space charge effect. The VOC has a linear relationship with logarithmic light intensity as shown in Fig. 7(c), indicating the presence of Shockley–Read–Hall recombination in the flexible device. Fig. 7(d) displays the dependence of FF on light intensity. Our device configuration on a flexible substrate produces a marginal FF dependence on light intensity, with a maximum FF of 77.50% obtained under 20 mW cm−2 illumination, indicating minimized charge recombination at relatively lower light intensity. These results suggest that our flexible device has a low charge recombination rate with no obvious interfacial energy barrier.

We have demonstrated that the PEALD technique could reduce the effective deposition temperature of SnO2 ESLs to less than 100 °C without compromising the PVSC performance. After passivating the surface of SnO2 ESLs with a C60-SAM, the best PVSCs fabricated on glass substrates have achieved average PCEs and steady-state efficiencies above 18%. The SnO2 ESLs deposited by PEALD at 70 °C enabled the fabrication of PVSCs with average PCEs higher than 17%. Furthermore, the best flexible PVSCs with PEALD SnO2 ESLs deposited at 100 °C have achieved 16.80% PCE, with an average PCE higher than 15%. Therefore, our results demonstrate the potential of PEALD for synthesizing high quality SnO2 ESLs at very low temperature for fabricating highly efficient perovskite solar cells.
