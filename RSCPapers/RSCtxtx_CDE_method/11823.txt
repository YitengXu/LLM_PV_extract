The orientation of antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) significantly affects the performance of Sb2S3 thin film solar cells owing to its intrinsic quasi-one-dimensional crystal structure. Producing a Sb2S3 film with a [hk1] orientation is theoretically favorable for solar cell performance. However, it is a challenge to prepare a [hk1]-orientated Sb2S3 film, because Sb2S3 is prone to grow parallel to the substrates along the [hk0] orientation according to the minimum energy principle. Herein, guided by grain growth theory, we successfully control the orientation of a Sb2S3 film via modulating the grain growth process. Highly [hk1]-oriented Sb2S3 films on an CdS substrate can be obtained if the grain grows according to the normal grain growth model. Consequently, a solar cell device based on [hk1]-oriented Sb2S3 achieves a power conversion efficiency of 6.82%, performing better than that based on [hk0]-oriented Sb2S3 (6.27%). This research provides a new and effective method for orientation control of Sb2S3 for pursuing high performance Sb2S3 thin film solar cells.

Sb2S3 has been used as an absorber layer in solar cells owing to its outstanding properties, including a suitable bandgap of 1.75 eV, a high absorption coefficient of about 105 cm−1, excellent stability, and low cost. Additionally, the Sb2S3 solar cell has achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.0% recently, bringing more attention to the fundamental understanding of Sb2S3 to further improve the solar cell performance.

The most attractive merit of Sb2S3 for solar cell applications is the quasi one-dimensional (Q1D) crystal structure (Fig. S1a in the ESI). Owing to the asymmetric crystal structure, the carrier mobility and conductivity along the [001] orientation are about two orders of magnitude higher than those along [100] and [010] orientations. Therefore, preparing a [hk1]-oriented Sb2S3 film is preferred for the performance of Sb2S3 solar cells. However, producing a Sb2S3 film with precise control of the [hk1] orientation is a challenge because of the minimum energy principle. In brief, (Sb4S6)n ribbons, which are the constituent unit of Sb2S3, are prone to lying on the substrate to form [hk0]-orientated Sb2S3 to minimize the system energy (Fig. S1b), so most of the reported high efficiency Sb2S3 solar cells are based on [hk0]-oriented films.
Until recently, researchers attempted to prepare a preferred [hk1]-oriented Sb2S3 film via controlling the film deposition parameters. Jin et al. in situ modified the surface structure of CdS via adding CdCl2 to favor the [hk1]-orientated Sb2S3 growth during the hydrothermal deposition process, yielding a PCE of 6.4%, which was 20% higher than that of the device based on a [hk0]-oriented Sb2S3 film. Wang et al. regulated the heterogeneous nucleation and the S2− releasing processes to prepare a Sb2S3 film with the [hk1] orientation in a chemical bath deposition process, achieving a PCE of 8.0%. These results reinforce the importance of crystal orientation to device performance for such Q1D materials.
However, a fact is that those research studies only inferred the reason for the dependence of Sb2S3 orientation on the film deposition parameters from the crystalized film after post-annealing treatment, without paying attention to the influence of the annealing process on the orientation. Post-annealing treatment is a critical technique for a Sb2S3 thin film to enlarge its grain size and lower its defects. In this case, the orientation of the Sb2S3 film after annealing treatment will be probably different from its initial state, because the grain growth can result in changes in the film orientation during the post-annealing process. According to grain growth theory, there are two models of grain growth: normal grain growth and abnormal grain growth. If the grains grow in the normal grain growth model, the orientations of the grains will maintain their original unannealed orientations owing to the continuous increase for each grain. Otherwise, the orientation will be dominated by a specific crystal orientation with low surface energy according to the abnormal grain growth model. Therefore, the orientation of the Sb2S3 film would also be affected by the grain growth during the post-annealing process. However, research focused on the dependence of the Sb2S3 orientation on the grain growth during the annealing process is rare.
Here, we present, for the first time, the underling mechanism of the dependence of orientation on the grain growth. We demonstrated that the grain growth model of the Sb3S3 film can be regulated by controlling the post-annealing process. Normal grain growth occurs when the Sb2S3 film undergoes a low-temperature treatment process, yielding a [hk1]-oriented film. Meanwhile, abnormal grain growth favors the [hk0]-oriented Sb2S3 film growth when the Sb2S3 film is directly annealed at high temperature. Therefore, the structure–property–performance relationship was studied via systematic characterization of the crystal orientation, carrier transport and device performance of Sb2S3. A planar heterojunction solar cell using [hk1]-oriented Sb2S3 achieves a PCE of 6.82%, which is higher than that of devices based on a [hk0]-oriented absorber (6.27%). This study provides a simple methodology for controlling the crystal growth of Sb2S3, which is an important step to improve the photovoltaic performance of this anisotropic material beyond its record efficiency.

The Sb2S3 precursor film was deposited on an FTO/CdS substrate by a simple hydrothermal method according to the reference, as described in the Experimental section. First, X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a scan speed of 10° min−1 was used to characterize the structure of the precursor film. As shown in Fig. 1a, apart from the diffraction peaks of the FTO/CdS substrate, we cannot find any other peaks belonging to Sb2S3, indicating the amorphous feature of the Sb2S3 precursor film at this scan speed (Fig. 1a). The surface morphology characterized by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) in Fig. S2 in the ESI shows that the hydrothermal deposited Sb2S3 film is compact and composed of small spherical structure grains.

To crystalize the Sb2S3 precursor film, the films were placed on a hotplate with a start temperature of 25 °C, 200 °C, 300 °C, and 380 °C, respectively (denoted as S1, S2, S3, and S4). The temperature of the hotplate was then increased from the start temperature to 380 °C and kept for 10 min. After that, the Sb2S3 films were removed from the hotplate to complete the post-annealing process. The temperature profile of the post-annealing process is shown in Fig. 1b. All the observed XRD peaks of S1, S2, S3, and S4 in Fig. 1c can be indexed to pure orthorhombic Sb2S3 with the Pbnm (62) space-group symmetry (JCPDS 42-1393). Interestingly, the orientation of the Sb2S3 film strongly depends on the start temperature of the hotplate. When the start temperature was lower than 300 °C, the intensities of XRD peaks belonging to (211) and (211) planes are higher than that belonging to (120), (220), and (230) planes, indicating that S1 and S2 exhibit a preferred [hk1] orientation. However, the [hk0] orientation becomes dominant in S3 and S4 as the start temperature was higher than 300 °C. For a quantitative description, we calculated the texture coefficient (TC) for each sample (Table S1). The texture coefficient (TC) ratios of all samples for the (221) and (120) crystal planes (TC(221)/TC(120)) was then calculated to evaluate orientation evolution. As shown in Fig. 1d, the TC(221)/TC (120) of S1 was calculated to be 2.24, which is similar to that of S2 (2.21). However, when the start temperature increases to 300 °C, the ratio of TC(221)/TC(120) decreases to 0.99. This ratio further decreases rapidly to 0.46 as the start temperature increases to 380 °C. Additionally, TC(221)/TC (130) also displays the same trend (Fig. 1d). These results indicate that the precursor film that has undergone a low-temperature process is favorable for the preferred [hk1]-orientated grain growth.
Furthermore, the surface morphologies of S1 and S2 show a spherical structure (Fig. 2a and b), which is almost the same as that of the Sb2S3 precursor film (Fig. S2). Additionally, the grain size is also similar to each other, exhibiting monomodal distribution, as the insets shown in Fig. 2a and b. This result means that normal grain growth occurred during this type of post-annealing process. However, as for S3 and S4, many large flat grains along with a few of small grains are distributed on the CdS surface, which shows a huge difference from S1 and S2 (Fig. 2c and d). This kind of bimodal grain size distribution (insets in Fig. 2c and d) indicates that the abnormal grain growth took place when the initial temperature of the hotplate was higher than 300 °C. Therefore, during the post-annealing process, the start temperature alters the grain growth model of the Sb2S3 film.
According to the data and analysis above, we propose a possible reason based on grain growth theory to explain the dependence of crystal orientation on the annealing process, as shown in Fig. 3. The Sb2S3 precursor film will undergo a low-temperature treatment process when the temperature of the hotplate rises from a low temperature (below 300 °C) to 380 °C. This low-temperature treatment stabilizes the different orientated crystallites on the CdS surface, rather than inducing grain growth and crystallization (Fig. 3a and b). This can be confirmed by the fact that there is no obvious change in the surface morphology when the precursor films were removed from the hotplate at a temperature of 150 °C, 200 °C, and 250 °C, respectively (Fig. S3). This stabilization process enables the grains with different orientations to grow according to the normal grain growth model after the temperature reaches 380 °C. In the normal grain growth process, the grain grows roughly at the same rate and the grain structure changes in a rather uniform way process, resulting in the orientation and surface morphology of the Sb2S3 film coinciding with those of the Sb2S3 precursor film (Fig. 3c). Because [hk1] is the preferred orientation of S1 and S2, the Sb2S3 precursor film should also take it as the dominant orientation. Hence, the scan speed of XRD measurement was reduced from 10° min−1 to 1° min−1 to identify the orientation of the Sb2S3 precursor film. As shown in Fig. S4, apart from the diffraction peaks of the FTO/CdS substrate, only a small and broad diffraction peak belonging to the (221) plane of Sb2S3 appeared. Also considering the XRD pattern in Fig. 1a obtained at a scan speed of 10° min−1, we can conclude that the Sb2S3 precursor film is mainly composed of [hk1]-orientated crystallites along with a few [hk0]-orientated crystallites. This can be attributed to the fact that the dangling bonds only exist at the terminals of (Sb4S6)n chains owing to the Q1D properties of Sb2S3 (Fig. S1). Therefore, we reasonably assume that [hk0]-crystallites bond with the substrate through weak vdW forces while the [hk1]-crystallites bond with the substrate by covalent bonds (Fig. S1b). Owing to the thermodynamically favorable growth of Sb2S3 on the CdS substrate by forming two dative bonds S(Sb2S3)–Cd(CdS) and Sb(Sb2S3)–S(CdS), the [hk1]-oriented crystallites more easily deposit on the CdS substrate than the [hk0]-oriented crystallites during the hydrothermal process, leading to the [hk1]-orientated feature of the Sb2S3 precursor film. Therefore, the orientation of the Sb2S3 film exhibits a preferred [hk1] orientation when normal grain growth occurs during post-annealing treatment.
As shown in Fig. S5, when the precursor film was directly annealed at 300 °C in less than 20 s, large flat grains appeared, indicating that the crystallization and grain growth take place instantaneously after placing the precursor film on the hotplate with an initial temperature above 300 °C. The main reason is that planes with lower surface energy will grow fast to minimize surface and interface energies immediately when the sample is directly placed on the hotplate with a high temperature, owing to the anisotropy of the crystal plane in Sb2S3. According to theoretical calculations, the [hk0] planes in Sb2S3 have lower surface energy than the [hk1] planes. Therefore, [hk0]-oriented crystallites grow rapidly, leading to abnormal grain growth after directly putting a sample on the hotplate with a start temperature above 300 °C. During this process, the [hk0]-grains grow fast at the expense of a static matrix of [hk1] grains (Fig. 3d and e), which endows the Sb2S3 film with a [hk0]-orientation. Therefore, the surface morphologies of S3 and S4 present many large flat grains accompanied by some small grains. This process is often referred to as recrystallization. For convenient discussion, in the following discussion, S1 and S4 are used to analyze the dependence of the photoelectric properties on the orientation unless otherwise noted.
To gain insight into the impact of crystal orientation on charge transport, transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) was carried out on the samples with a structure of FTO/CdS/Sb2S3 to probe the carrier transport dynamics. As shown in the pseudocolor 2D color images of TAS (Fig. 4a and b), S1 and S4 show a pronounced photobleaching (PB) feature at 460–500 nm owing to the state filling of the CdS film. The PB signal at around 640 nm can be assigned to the second excitonic peak of Sb2S3. Additionally, one obviously positive transient absorption signal at around 560 nm representing the excited state absorption (ESA) can be determined to originate from a single broad feature. Therefore, the decay characteristics at 560 nm are fitted by using a biexponential model to study carrier decay kinetics (Fig. 4c and Table S2). Obviously, S1 exhibits a shorter average lifetime (τave) than S4. As previously discussed, owing to the Q1D structure of Sb2S3, charge transport along (Sb4S6)n ribbons is more efficient than hopping perpendicular to them, resulting in the rapid extraction of electrons from Sb2S3 to CdS and thus a shorter average lifetime.
Then, the influence of post-annealing treatment on the deep level defect was characterized by deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). As shown in Fig. 4d, only negative peaks are observed in the DLTS spectra, representing the hole traps for n-type Sb2S3. To determine the specific type of each hole trap, the activation energy (Ea), defect density (NT) and capture cross-section (σ) of the hole traps in S1 and S2 can be obtained according to the linear fittings of the Arrhenius plots (Fig. 4b, Note S1 in the ESI). The values of Ea, NT, and σ are summarized in Table S3. Specifically, one hole trap (denoted as H2, Ea = 0.702 eV and NT = 1.42 × 1014 cm−3) was detected in S1. In addition to the H2 trap (Ea = 0.701 eV and NT = 1.08 × 1014 cm−3), S4 possesses another hole trap (denoted as H1, Ea = 0.56 eV, and NT = 6.67 × 1013 cm−3). According to the theoretical calculation of the defect energy level, H1 and H2 traps in this work are assigned to the Sb vacancy defects (VSb) and anti-site defects of SSb, respectively. As previously reported, the energy-level alignment can be depicted as Fig. 4f, where all types of defects are deep level traps which act as the recombination center during carrier transport. Nevertheless, the least defect type and lower defect concentration of S1 compared with S4 will favor the performance of Sb2S3 solar cells.
The dependence of the photovoltaic performance on the crystal orientation of Sb2S3 was investigated based on a device structure of FTO/CdS/Sb2S3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au (Fig. 5a, where FTO is fluorine-doped tin oxide and spiro-OMeTAD is 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene). Specifically, the film thickness of both kinds of Sb2S3 films is about 450 nm (Fig. 5a). The current–voltage (J–V) curves and the corresponding device parameters of the devices based on S1 and S4 films are presented in Fig. 5b. The S1 based device shows an unsurprisingly higher PCE of 6.82%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), and fill factor (FF) of 0.77 V, 58.88% and 15.07 mA cm−2, respectively. Nevertheless, the PCE decreased to 6.27% when the S4 film was used as an absorber. The lower performance is mainly attributed to the decrease in JSC to 14.50 mA cm−2 and partially to the decrease in FF by 2.29%. To examine the reproducibility of device performance, we fabricated ten devices based on S1 and S4, respectively. Fig. S6 shows the statistic VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE. The average PCE of 6.63% with a standard deviation of 0.12 for the devices based on S1 is higher than that based on S4 (6.02% with a standard deviation of 0.15), indicating that the devices fabricated with S1 show better reproducibility than S4 devices. The lower performance of the device based on S4 is caused by the undesired hopping carrier transport in the [hk0]-oriented film and more deep level defects in the S4 film.

Fig. 5c presents the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices based on S1 and S4. The device based on S1 presents a higher quantum yield in the wavelength region of 500–650 nm when compared with the S4 device, which demonstrates that the S1 based device generates high photocurrent, leading to a larger integrated JSC value of 14.96 mA cm−2 than that of the S4 based device (14.01 mA cm−2). After that, dark current measurement was then carried out to study current leakage. The leakage current of the S1 based device is lower than that of the S4 based device in the range of −1 to 1 V (Fig. 5d), indicating improved charge transport and decreased recombination loss in the S1 based device. This is due to the improvement in the crystal orientation and deep-level defect properties.

In conclusion, we demonstrate that the orientation of Sb2S3 films depends on the grain growth model. For Sb2S3 thin films, the [hk1] orientation is preferred for optimal solar cell performance. Stabilizing [hk1]-oriented precursor films is highly favorable for crystalizing the [hk1]-oriented Sb2S3 film during the annealing process. Because the crystallites in the Sb2S3 precursor film prepared by the hydrothermal method show a weak (211) orientation, we chose a low temperature to crystalize these crystallites and thus retained the crystallites with a preferred orientation of the [hk1] plane after high temperature annealing. Through this strategy, we fabricated Sb2S3 films with a preferred [hk1] orientation and a low density of deep level defects. Finally, we obtained a PCE of 6.82% based on the [hk1]-orientated Sb2S3 film, which is higher than that based on the [hk0]-orientated Sb2S3 film. This research provides an idea that the orientation of low-dimensional crystal-structure materials can be controlled by selecting an appropriate annealing process according to the orientation of crystallites in the precursor film.


Methanol (ACS spectrophotometric grade, ≥99.9%) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na, ≥99.0%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate (Na2S2O3·5H2O, AR), aluminium sulfate octadecahydrate (Al2(SO4)3 · 18H2O, AR), and antimony oxide (Sb2O3, AR) were purchased from Sinopharm. FTO-coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 13 ± 1.5 Ω sq−1 and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-dipmethoxyphenylamine)-9, 9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) were purchased from Yingkou Youxuan Trade Co., Ltd. Lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI, 98%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, 96%), acetonitrile (99.9%) and chlorobenzene (99.8%) were purchased from J & K, China. All chemical reagents were used without distillation or purification.


FTO glass (TEC15) was cleaned with DI water, isopropanol, acetone, and ethanol sequentially. Then the FTO substrate was cleaned for 15 min with UV ozone prior to use as well. Next, the FTO substrate was coated with a 60 nm CdS film as the ETL by using the chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. In this process, 0.73 g thiourea and 0.038 g cadmium sulfate 8/3 hydrate were dissolved in a beaker containing 100 mL water. Then, 12 mL ammonium hydroxide (25.0–28.0%) was added into the beaker and the solution was stirred for 1 min. After that, the FTO substrate was put vertically into the beaker, which was then placed into a water bath with a temperature of 66 °C. The deposition time is 12 minutes. After that, the FTO substrate was taken out and dried with N2. After treatment with CdCl2 (20 mg mL−1 in methanol), the FTO/CdS substrate was heated at 400 °C for 10 min in open air.


The Sb2S3 thin film was fabricated by a hydrothermal method with Sb2O3 as the Sb source. Briefly, 0.23 g of Sb2O3, 0.59 g of EDTA-2Na, and 0.16 g of Al2(SO4)3 · 18H2O were added into a glass vial that contained 40 mL of ultrapure water to form a suspension. This suspension was stirred for 10 min. After that, the suspension was filtered with 0.45 μm PES filters to obtain a colorless transparent solution. Then, 0.7936 g Na2S2O3·5H2O was added into the above transparent solution and the solution was further stirred for 2 min. Then the FTO/CdS substrate was placed into the inner wall of a Teflon tank (50 mL). After that, the above solution was added into the Teflon tank containing the substrate which was put into autoclaves. The autoclaves were put into an oven and kept at 150 °C for 120 min. After that, the samples were taken out, followed by washing with DI water and drying with compressed nitrogen. Then the as-deposited films were annealed under different conditions in a glove box filled with N2.


For the deposition of a spiro-OMeTAD HTL, 36.6 mg spiro-OMeTAD was dissolved in a mixed solution containing 1 mL chlorobenzene, 14.5 μL 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 9.5 μL Li-TFSI solution (520 mg mL−1 Li-TFSI in acetonitrile). The as-prepared spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated onto the Sb2S3 films at 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min in air. Finally, an Au electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation to complete the device fabrication. And the effective area of the solar cell is 0.12 cm2.


The crystallinity of samples was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker Advance D8 diffractometer equipped with graphite-monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The surface, cross-sectional morphology and elemental mapping were characterized by field emission SEM (SU8220). For the photovoltaic property measurement, a Keithley 2400 apparatus, along with solar-simulated AM 1.5 G sunlight provided by a standard xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A), was applied to obtain the J–V curves of the devices. Prior to measurement, the solar simulator was calibrated with a conventional reference cell based on monocrystalline silicon (Oriel P/N 91150V, with a KG-5 visible colour filter). The standard reference cell was calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The EQE measurements were carried out on an ORIEL Intelligent Quantum Efficiency (IQE) 200 TM Measurement system established with a tunable light source.

The DLTS measurement was performed via a Phystech FT-1230 HERA-DLTS system equipped with a 10 mW red (635 nm wavelength) laser with a 0.01 cm−2 light spot. The optical pulse was generated from a laser via systematical program control. A modified Boonton 7200 capacitance meter (1–75 kHz) was used to examine the dynamic capacitance. An n-i-p structural device was selected as one sample, and the effective test area is about 0.01 cm−2 because of the light spot area. Then the samples were placed in a liquid-helium cryostat (Lakeshore 335336). Temperature scans were performed between 120 and 400 K, at a heating rate of 2 K min−1. The applied reverse bias voltage was set as −0.4 V during measurement. Then the double pulse of pulse voltage and pulse laser was applied to the sample, and they were exerted and removed simultaneously. In detail, the pulse voltage, pulse width (electric and optical), and period width were set as 0.4 V, 10 ms, and 20 ms, respectively. The activation energy, capture cross-section, and concentration of traps were calculated using an Arrhenius plot as described in Note S1 in the ESI.
