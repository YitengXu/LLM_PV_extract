The ternary organic solar cell is a promising technology towards high power conversion efficiency. Although the efficiency has reached over 14% for ternary organic solar cells, the stability, as well as the degradation mechanism behind the ternary strategy, are still not well investigated. Burn-in photo-degradation, which is caused by continuous light illumination, can result in a significant performance drop at an initial stage for solar cells. COi8DFIC is a newly developed efficient non-fullerene acceptor material that exhibits strong near infrared range (NIR) light absorption. Herein, we present the first systematic research on the burn-in photo-degradation of a COi8DFIC based ternary organic solar cell with the active layer consisting of PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC:PC71BM blend and compared it with its corresponding binary organic solar cells. Both binary and ternary devices were exposed to continuous one-sun illumination for 5 hours. As a result, PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary and ternary organic solar cells exhibit a similar degradation mechanism which is very different from the burn-in photo-degradation mechanism in PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary organic solar cells. The burn-in photo-degradation in PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary organic solar cells is found to be dominated by induced non-radiative carrier recombination, poor energy transfer and low exciton dissociation. However, the burn-in photo-degradation in PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary and ternary organic solar cells is found to be more related to the degradation-induced high shunt possibility.

Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) as an emerging energy technology have attracted intense research attention. Compared to conventional silicon-based solar cells, OSCs possess many advantages such as flexibility, low cost, semi-transparency, lightweight, synthetic variability and applicability to roll-to-roll fabrication, etc. Due to the fast development of novel organic materials as well as the morphology optimisation methodology, binary bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells have achieved power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 14% and tandem organic solar cells have achieved PCE over 17%. However, binary organic solar cells still suffer from many challenges like limited absorption range and inefficient energy transfer in the active layer, etc. Recently, ternary OSCs have been proved as one of the promising strategies to achieve high PCE as they integrate the merits of both tandem solar cells and binary BHJ solar cells. Different from binary OSCs, the active layer of ternary OSCs contains three different components which includes an ascendant donor:acceptor binary system and a third material. Based on the property of the third component added, the active layer of ternary OSCs can be divided into two types – donor:donor:acceptor (D1:D2:A) systems and donor:acceptor:acceptor (D:A1:A2) systems. An appropriate third component usually possesses suitable energy levels, a complementary absorption range and a good miscibility with the binary holding system. It can cause a more efficient charge transfer and transport process and a broader absorption range, and form a better morphology when it has been added into the system. With rationally selecting the third component, ternary OSCs are expected to have simultaneous improvements in short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) which results in a higher PCE. Recently, a novel non-fullerene acceptor material COi8DFIC was developed which possesses a strong NIR light absorption and a small optical bandgap of 1.26 eV. In COi8DFIC, the COi8 as a new carbon–oxygen-bridged unit is used as the D unit where the “i” indicates that the C–O bond points to the molecular core and the “8” represents the number of fused rings. By applying the ternary strategy, Li et al. have demonstrated a world record PCE of 14.62% for a PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC:PC71BM ternary system benefiting from a COi8DFIC-induced broader absorption spectrum, which proved a promising future for ternary organic solar cells.

Besides high PCE, the stability of OSCs is another indispensable property in terms of their future commercialisation. Many different factors can cause degradation of OSCs including the poor chemical stability of organic materials, light-induced degradation, oxidation induced defects, thermally induced morphology changes and even the degradation of the electrodes and interfacial layers. Among these factors, burn-in photo-degradation, which refers to an initial photovoltaic performance loss when devices operate under light illumination, is the most crucial one. To confirm the reliability, most manufacturers also conduct a burn-in degradation measurement for electronic devices to test the fast-initial failure. Similarly, a burn-in degradation test is required for OSCs before future commercialisation. Understanding the mechanism behind the burn-in photo-degradation thus becomes a significant step towards addressing the stability issue of OSCs. To date, for binary BHJ OSCs, many burn-in photo-degradation studies have been conducted. Various degradation mechanisms were found for different materials. For fullerene-based OSCs, the light was found to be able to induce dimerisation which can reduce the charge carrier mobility. For non-fullerene based OSCs, the increased trap mediated charge recombination was found as the major problem in burn-in photo-degradation. Nevertheless, unlike binary OSCs, the photo-stability of ternary OSCs still lacks investigation. With the third component addition, the investigation of changes in the stability of ternary OSCs is necessary. It can help researchers to gain a comprehensive insight into this emerging strategy. Intensive photo-degradation studies of ternary OSCs are needed. Therefore, this study aims to understand the origin of the photo-degradation behind ternary OSCs and distinguish the degradation difference between ternary OSCs and the corresponding binary OSCs.
In this paper, we firstly present a systematic study of the burn-in photo-degradation in ternary organic solar cells. Poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] (PTB7-Th), [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), and COi8DFIC are the three main organic materials used in this study. Both PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC:PC71BM based ternary, and PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC and PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary organic solar cells were fabricated and investigated in terms of burn-in photo-degradation effects. A relatively high PCE loss was observed for all devices and the degradation trend for each type of device was found to be different. To investigate the mechanism behind the photo-degradation, characterisations like electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL were employed. As a result, a similar degradation mechanism was found for PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary and ternary devices and different degradation pathways were identified for PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices and ternary devices. The PCE loss from burn-in photo-degradation in PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices was found to mainly result from the increased non-radiative recombination, degraded energy transfer and suppressed exciton dissociation. While for PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices, the principal degradation reason was found to be the increased shunt probability and degraded charge carrier extraction. The mechanism difference observed in this study is suspected to result from the different defect generating position. The PTB7-Th:PC71BM based devices may suffer from defects generated in the bulk of the active layer, while the PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices may suffer from defects aggregated on the surface of the active layer during the photo-degradation.

In this study, all devices were fabricated with an inverted device structure as shown in Fig. 1(a) by using the spin-coating technique inside an N2 filled glove box. Polymer material PTB7-Th was used as the common electron donor material in both binary and ternary devices. Fullerene material PC71BM and non-fullerene material COi8DFIC were used as two electron acceptors in this work. The chemical structures of these materials are shown in Fig. 1(b). From Fig. 1(c) and (d), PTB7-Th, COi8DFIC and PC71BM are found to possess complementary absorption spectra and can form a cascade energy level alignment with each other. With the aim to explore the effect of burn-in photo-degradation on both binary and ternary devices, binary devices were fabricated by using the active layer consisting of PTB7-Th:PC71BM or PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC in a blend ratio of 1:1.5 and ternary devices were made with the active layer consisting of PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC:PC71BM in an optimized blend ratio of 1:1.05:0.45. The as-fabricated device was characterised immediately after the last fabrication step and labelled as a “Fresh device”. Since burn-in photo-degradation occurs at a very initial stage of the device degradation, usually within a few hours, the degradation test time was selected as 5 hours according to our former studies. The fresh device then was exposed to continuous one-sun illumination with the test period of 5 hours. Measurements with a regular interval of 1 hour were conducted for those devices. Devices after burn-in photo-degradation of 5 hours are called “Photo-degraded devices” in the following content. The current density to voltage (J–V) curves of all devices measured under one-sun test conditions (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), at room temperature, are shown in Fig. 2(a). The corresponding photovoltaic parameters including Jsc, Voc, FF, Rsh, Rs and PCE are listed in Table 1.

Compared to fresh binary devices, fresh ternary devices show an impressive improvement in photovoltaic performance. With the addition of COi8DFIC into a PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary system, the average PCE of the devices is boosted from 7.74% to 12.06%. The largely increased Jsc value with an enhancement by 64.6% is considered as the main contributor. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) and the absorption spectrum of binary and ternary, fresh and photo-degraded devices are shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c). It is obvious to see that ternary devices have a broader absorption and EQE spectrum compared to PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices which can be ascribed to the near-infrared (NIR) absorption of COi8DFIC. It was found that all photo-degraded devices showed reduced external quantum efficiency when compared to fresh devices. On the other hand, the absorption spectrum of devices is very similar before and after the burn-in degradation which indicates that the degradation may be less related to the optical property. From the degradation perspective, after 5 hours of burn-in photo-degradation, the PCE of all devices shows severe reductions, reduced by 31.2% for PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices, 54.8% for PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and 35.1% for ternary devices. Reasonable burn-in photo-degradation losses were observed for all photovoltaic parameters including Voc, Jsc and FF for all devices. It is obvious to see that PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices suffer from the worst stability when compared to PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary devices and ternary devices under the burn-in photo-degradation. The Voc loss in PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices is 13.6%. While for both PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices and ternary devices, the Voc loss is less than 5%. The Jsc and FF losses in PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices are also the largest among the three types of device which are 23.8% and 31.6%, respectively. The PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices both suffer from shunt resistance (Rsh) reduction, and the Rsh shows only a percentage drop for PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices but a significant drop for PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices. Fig. 3(a)–(f) exhibit the evolution of photovoltaic parameters for all devices under one-sun test conditions for 5 hours and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table S1–S3 (ESI). It was found that, for PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices and ternary devices, the Voc, Jsc, FF, Rs and PCE have a similar burn-in photo-degradation trend, while the degradation trend of Rsh is different. Ternary devices show a poor ability to maintain the Rsh value which is similar to PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based devices. As a result, both PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices and PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC:PC71BM based ternary devices are capable of retaining over 65% of their initial PCE which is higher than the well-studied PTB7:PC71BM based fullerene (∼39%) and PBDB-T:ITIC based non-fullerene (∼60%) solar cells. Since the fabrication process and device structure are identical for all devices, the difference in burn-in photo-degradation identified can be only attributed to the different active layers. With the consideration of different degradation trends, the mechanism behind the burn-in degradation for binary and ternary devices may be different.
To verify the hypothesis above, dark J–V measurement was conducted for binary and ternary, fresh and photo-degraded devices. Dark J–V curves are shown in Fig. 4(a). It is clear to see that fresh binary and ternary devices both have a low leakage current under reverse bias. After 5 hours of burn-in photo-degradation, the leakage current of PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices increased dramatically. In contrast, for PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices, the leakage current is almost unchanged. The high leakage current usually indicates a high shunt possibility. The dramatically increased leakage current of photo-degraded PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices explained the largely decreased Rsh value observed from J–V measurements. Moreover, the increase in leakage current is partly responsible for the Voc loss in devices since the Voc value can be directly estimated from the short-circuit current and the dark saturation current by using the ideal diode model. Thus, the Voc loss in photo-degraded PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices may partly result from its largely increased leakage current.
To further investigate the Voc loss and the dynamics of the burn-in photo-degradation, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay measurement was performed for binary and ternary, fresh and photo-degraded films by using the excitation light at a wavelength of 532 nm. A bi-exponential decay model was used to fit the curve and extract the excited state lifetime, as it can accurately describe the decay curves:
(1)
where
A1 and A2 represent the amplitude and τ1 and τ2 represent the fast and slow lifetime for the carrier recombination. The fast lifetime stands for the time needed for the dissociation of 99% of excitons while the slow lifetime is the time for the full dissociation. TRPL decay curves and fitted lines are shown in Fig. 4(b). Obtained lifetime values are presented in Table 2 and full fitting parameters including amplitudes (A1 and A2), and constant (y0) are shown in Table S3 (ESI). After 5 hours of burn-in photo-degradation, it was observed that both fast and slow excited state lifetime for binary and ternary films were increased. However, the increase in lifetime for PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary films was found to be much higher than PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary films and ternary films. The fast and slow excited state lifetime increased by 14.5% and 25.1% for PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary films but increased less than 10% for the PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary films and ternary films. Commonly, a lower excited state lifetime represents a faster exciton dissociation process which is related to the energy transfer between the donor and acceptor and the potential of the heterojunction (see Fig. 1(d)). Since the förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) offers an alternative non-radiative pathway between the donor and acceptor, the excited state lifetime can be used to estimate the energy transfer efficiency between the donor and acceptor in the active layer. The increased excited state lifetime implies an inefficient energy transfer. Thus, after 5 hours of burn-in photo-degradation, the largely increased excited state lifetime for PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary films indicates a largely decreased energy transfer efficiency between the donor and acceptor which can be considered as the major reason for the Voc loss in PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices.

To investigate the Jsc loss, steady-state PL measurement was performed for all blend films. In the steady-state PL measurement, the light beam was controlled at the same intensity and incident on the device with a 90° angle from the ITO glass side for all devices. For comparison between fresh and photo-degraded devices, the steady state PL spectrum was normalized with the peak PL intensity of fresh devices. The obtained normalized PL spectra for all films are shown in Fig. 5(a). Similarly, all photo-degraded films were observed to possess a higher PL intensity when compared to fresh films. The PL intensity is directly related to the Jsc value of the solar cell and the high PL intensity indicates that a large number of exctions exist in the active layer. The decrease in PL intensity, usually called “PL quenching”, occurs when excitons are efficiently dissociated. The higher PL intensity indicates a worse charge dissociation process. In this study, when compared with fresh films, the peak PL intensity of photo-degraded PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary films dramatically increased by around 1.5 times. While for photo-degraded PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary films and ternary films, the increase in PL intensity is very small. This result indicates that the burn-in photo-degradation can cause a poor charge dissociation process for PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices but not for PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices. The decreased exction dissociation ability in photo-degraded PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices may be the main reason for their Jsc loss.
Moreover, C–V measurements were performed for binary and ternary, fresh and photo-degraded devices under dark conditions. Fig. 5(b) shows the obtained Mott Schottky (MS) curves at a frequency of 10 kHz. By extracting the intercept of the curve with the x-axis, the build-in potential (Vbi) value can be estimated. For the same type of device, the decrease in Vbi means an inefficient device operation with lower Voc. If the working voltage is higher than the Vbi, the net field in the device will reverse, which can impede the charge collection. After 5 hours of burn-in photo-degradation, it is clear to see that the Vbi value of all types of devices is unchanged, around 0.8 V for PTB7-Th:PC71BM based devices and around 0.6 V for PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC and ternary devices. From MS measurements at 1 kHz in the dark, the dielectric constant of the devices can be estimated by using the capacitance value lower than 0 V bias, since the active layer is fully depleted. By using the assumption that the capacitance at 1 kHz can represent the geometric capacitance of the device, the dielectric constant can be estimated by using the equation:
(2)
where
A represents the device area which is 0.045 cm2, d represents the active layer thickness which is around 100 nm for both binary and ternary devices, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1) and εr is the relative dielectric constant of the active layer. Regarding the Langevin theory, the recombination of charge carriers is inevitable inside the active layer. A conceptual term Coulomb binding is defined as charges could be bound by the attraction of an opposite charge carrier or a trap. To overcome the attraction, the separation of charges should exceed the Coulomb capture radius. In other words, a short capture radius tends to make the dissociation at the charge transfer state surmountable. The Coulomb capture radius can be estimated from the dielectric constant by using the equation below:

(3)
where
k represents the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and e represent the elementary charge. The estimated dielectric constant and coulomb capture radius are listed in Table 3. The larger coulomb capture radius indicates that the electron–hole pairs are more difficult to escape from their mutual Coulomb interaction which is related to the exciton dissociation process. After the burn-in photo-degradation, the PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices were found to possess a 1.17 times larger coulomb capture radius which revealed a worse exciton dissociation. Conversely, the Coulomb capture radii in PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices were almost unchanged after the burn-in photo-degradation. The result from C–V measurements is consistent with the result from steady-state PL measurements which further demonstrated that the decreased exciton dissociation ability may be the main reason for the Jsc loss in photo-degraded PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices.

On the other hand, charge carrier extraction possibility (P) and saturation current density analysis was conducted for binary and ternary, fresh and photo-degraded devices. Fig. 6 depicts the photo-current density (Jph) to effective voltage (Veff) curves, where the Jph = JL − JD and Veff = V0 − Vbias. JL is the current density under one-sun illumination, JD is the current density under dark conditions, V0 represents the voltage with no photocurrent and Vbias represents the externally applied voltage bias. When Veff reaches a relatively high value (1 V in this case), we can assume that all photogenerated excitons are entirely dissociated and collected without recombination loss. Under this condition, the obtained photo-current density (Jph) can be defined as the saturation current density (Jsat) which is only restricted by the absorption of incident photons. The charge carrier extraction possibility (P) can be represented by the ratio of Jsc/Jsat which can reasonably explain the current loss during the current extraction process.Table 4 presents the obtained Jsat and P for all devices. The charge carrier extraction possibility for both fresh binary and ternary devices is very high (over 90%). However, after 5 hours of photo-degradation, the charge carrier extraction possibility shows a reduction, decreased from 90.03% to 77.37% for PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and 97.70% to 93.65% for ternary devices. While for PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices, the possibility is almost unchanged. Thus, the decreased charge carrier extraction possibility was found as the reason that contributes to the Jsc loss for PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices in burn-in photo-degradation. In comparison with PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices where the Jsc loss mainly results from poor exciton dissociation, the mechanism of Jsc loss for PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices was found to be different.

To investigate the non-radiative recombination of carriers inside the active layer as well as the conductive electronic properties, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was conducted. The origin of the EIS is the response testing of the electronic device under an applied external alternating current (AC) signal. For the impedance Nyquist test in this study, the applied voltages selected for binary devices and ternary devices are 0.7 V and 0.6 V, respectively. The applied test voltage should be slightly lower than the Voc of the device. If the applied test voltage is too low, the trap inside the active layer will get a response to the modulation signal. Moreover, if the applied test voltage is too high, the high voltage bias will suppress the response from the trap state.Fig. 7(a) and (b) display Nyquist-plots for binary and ternary, fresh and photo-degraded devices with the frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz. All plots exhibit a semicircle shape and can be analysed by an equivalent electrical circuit which is shown in Fig. 7(a). The equivalent electrical circuit contains a series resistance and two parallel resistance–capacitance (RC) components. Two RC components represent the two arcs that occur at the low-frequency range and the high-frequency range in the plot which can precisely match the obtained semicircle curves. In the equivalent electrical circuit, the Rs represents the series resistance which indicates the resistance of ohmic components and the contact resistance.Rt represents the charge transport resistance, mainly related to the charge transportation process inside the active layer. Rrec represents the carrier recombination resistance, which indicates the non-radiative recombination in the device, since there are no photon generations under dark conditions.Cg and Cμ are dielectric component capacitance and distributed chemical capacitance, where Cg indicates the dielectric component in the device diode model and Cμ suggests the charge accumulation inside the active layer. The acquired Nyquist data are fitted with this equivalent electrical circuit and shown as points and fitted lines in Fig. 7(a) and (b). Estimated electrical parameters including Rs, Rt, Rrec, Cg and Cμ are presented in Table 5. It is worth mentioning that the value of series resistance Rs obtained in the EIS study is different from the J–V characterisation since the current flow direction under dark conditions is reversed to the direction under light. It is clear to see that both binary and ternary devices showed a reduction in recombination resistance after the burn-in photo-degradation which indicates the increased non-radiative recombination inside the active layer. Nevertheless, this reduction is much higher in PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices, where the recombination resistance decreased by 47%. In comparison, the recombination resistance in PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices only decreased by around 13% and 9%. Hence, it was found that the non-radiative recombination for PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices showed a large increase after the burn-in photo-degradation but it was less increased for PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices. The largely increased non-radiative recombination can further explain the Jsc loss as well as the FF loss for photo-degraded PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices. In contrast, the non-radiative recombination is not the main reason for the Jsc and FF loss for PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices. In addition to the recombination analysis, the charge transport process can be explained with the estimation of the electron diffusivity Dn and the electron mobility μn by using the obtained Rt and Cμ value. The electron diffusion time τd and the electron diffusivity Dn can be calculated with the equations below:
τd = Rt × Cμ
(4)
(5)
where
L is the thickness of the active layer which is around 100 nm. The electron mobility μn in the device can be further estimated from the diffusivity Dn by using the equation below:

(6)
Estimated
Dn and μn values for all devices are shown in Table 6. It was found that the electron mobility for PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices showed a massive decrease by 89% after the burn-in photo-degradation, while it is almost unchanged for PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices. On the other hand, space limited charge current (SCLC) measurements were conducted for verifying estimated mobilities. The results are shown in Fig. S1 and Table S5 in the ESI. A similar degradation trend was observed. The largely decreased electron mobility implies a worse charge transport process in photo-degraded PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary devices which significantly affects its Jsc and FF value. Conversely, the Jsc and FF loss of photo-degraded PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices was found to be less related to changes in charge transport ability.

To investigate morphology changes, AFM and SEM measurements were performed for binary and ternary, fresh and photo-degraded films. AFM images are displayed in Fig. 8, and SEM images are displayed in Fig. S2 (ESI). The average root mean roughness (RMS) values obtained from at least 4 measure points are also shown in each corresponding image. It is easy to see that the RMS value for both binary and ternary films showed an increase after the burn-in photo-degradation. In comparison, the RMS value for PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary films showed a larger increase by 38% and 25%, respectively, while the increase is relatively small for PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices, only increased by 15%. The increased RMS value indicates a rougher surface morphology which can form more traps that negatively affect the fill factor of the device. Moreover, the rough surface of the active layer may create a poor contact between the active layer and the carrier transport layer and cause high shunt probability. Thus, the high shunt probability as well as low shunt resistance in photo-degraded PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices may result from its rougher surface when compared to fresh devices.
In summary, burn-in photo-degradation can cause a significantly reduction in device performance for both binary and ternary devices. Compared to PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices, PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices and ternary devices showed relatively better stability under photo-degradation. The mechanism behind the photo-degradation was investigated for all types of device. The PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices were found to have a similar degradation mechanism which may due to the fact that the COi8DFIC is the dominant acceptor in the ternary blend. Moreover, the degradation mechanism of PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices was found to be very different from the PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices. The burn-in photo-degradation in PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary devices mainly caused negative effects on energy transfer, exciton dissociation and charge recombination processes which may be more related to the bulk of the active layer. In comparison, the burn-in photo-degradation in the PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices mainly caused negative effects on the shunt resistance, leakage current and charge extraction process which may be more related to the surface of the active layer. AFM measurements found that the burn-in photo-degradation can cause larger increase in surface roughness for PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices. The mechanism difference found in this study may result from the different defect generating position. During the photo-degradation, oxygen-induced doping plays a significant role as the oxygen was found to be doped into the fullerene based active layer and cause degradation. It is suspected that the PTB7-Th:PC71BM based devices suffer from oxygen-induced doping in the active layer during the photo-degradation and defects were generated in the bulk of the active layer. Meanwhile, in the PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices, the non-fullerene component COi8DFIC is suspected to resist the oxygen-induced doping in the bulk of the active layer and the oxygen-induced defects aggregated on the surface of the active layer causing high shunt possibility.

In this paper, we have studied and compared the burn-in photo-degradation process between PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC:PC71BM ternary and its two types of binary organic solar cells. A similar degradation mechanism was found for PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary devices and ternary devices and different degradation pathways were identified for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary device and ternary devices. Compared with the PTB7-Th:PC71BM based binary organic solar cell, the PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary and ternary organic solar cells showed a higher resistivity to the burn-in photo-degradation induced non-radiative carrier recombination, poor energy transfer, and low exciton dissociation. However, a more severe degradation-induced high shunt possibility was found in PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC based binary and ternary organic solar cells. The difference in machanism found in this study is suspected to result from the different defect generating positions. As the ternary strategy is attracting more attention, the demonstration of the burn-in photo-degradation mechanism for ternary organic solar cells is essential. The stability issue needs to be correctly understood and addressed for the full application of the ternary strategy in the future.
