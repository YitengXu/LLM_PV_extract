Narrowing the bandgap and promoting the quality of inorganic perovskites are the key points to improve the performance of inorganic perovskite solar cells. Herein, we incorporate Sn2+ into an inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite to simultaneously tune the bandgap and improve the quality of the perovskite film. The density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the incorporation of Sn2+ leads to an obvious shift of the conduction band minimum of the CsPbBr3 perovskite towards the lower energy region. Therefore, the bandgap of CsPb1−xSnxBr3 perovskites is gradually reduced with the increase of the Sn2+ content. Additionally, when Pb2+ is substituted with an appropriate amount of Sn2+, the doped perovskite films display largely promoted quality compared to the undoped one. These advantages lead to the suppression of charge recombination and the enhancement of light harvesting in the as-fabricated perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Consequently, the CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3-based PSC with a structure of FTO/TiO2 layer/perovskite/carbon delivers a greatly promoted power conversion efficiency of 8.04% compared with the efficiency of 5.93% for the controlled device. Moreover, the CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 PSC without any encapsulation preserves over 91% of its initial efficiency after 720 h of storage in ambient air, suggesting an excellent stability.

In the past decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have gained remarkable research interest due to the rocketing increase in the power conversion efficiency and the facile solution-processing fabrication. However, the poor stability of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials under thermal, optical, and moist stresses make hybrid PSCs suffer from serious performance degradation under ambient conditions. The stability of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells has been improved through composition engineering, additive engineering, and interface modification, but is still far from meeting the requirement for practical deployment. All inorganic perovskite materials with a structure of CsPbX3 (X = I, Br) display high thermal stability and excellent optoelectronic properties, and therefore have been considered recently as a promising substitute for organic–inorganic hybrid materials in solar cells.

Among inorganic CsPbX3 perovskite materials, iodine-rich inorganic perovskite materials (CsPbI3 and CsPbI2Br) are sensitive to humidity and could be easily converted into the nonperovskite phase under ambient conditions. The nonperovskite phase is photoinactive because of its wider bandgap (>2.8 eV). In contrast, an all-bromide inorganic perovskite, CsPbBr3, presents excellent structure stability under ambient conditions. The inorganic PSCs based on the CsPbBr3 perovskite film can be fabricated and measured under an ambient atmosphere. In addition, Jin et al. and Tang et al. reported that the power conversion efficiency of carbon-based inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs without any encapsulation exhibited no degradation even after exposing to humid air for 3 months. These favorable features make CsPbBr3 a suitable light absorber for PSC application. However, the wide bandgap of the CsPbBr3 perovskite (2.3 eV) greatly limits the power conversion efficiency of the solar cells. In addition, the quality of the CsPbBr3 perovskite film prepared by the conventional spin-coating method is usually poor, resulting in serious charge recombination within the perovskite film and at the interface of the fabricated PSCs. Therefore, narrowing the bandgap and improving the quality of the CsPbBr3 perovskite film are the key points for enhancing the photovoltaic performance of CsPbBr3 PSCs. Previous reports have shown that partially substituting A-site or B-site cations in CsPbBr3 effectively improved the quality of the CsPbBr3 perovskite film and suppressed the charge recombination within the CsPbBr3 perovskite film. In addition, as we know, the B-site cations have a large effect on the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) of inorganic CsPbX3 perovskites. So, it is expected that partial substitution of Pb2+ by other metal ions can simultaneously tune the bandgap and improve the quality of the CsPbBr3 perovskite.
Sn and Pb belong to the same group and have a similar electronic configuration. In addition, the ionic radius of Sn2+ (0.112 nm) is close to that of Pb2+ (0.119 nm). So, Sn2+ has been considered as the first metal ion to substitute Pb2+ in the inorganic CsPbX3 perovskite. Based on the results of first-principles calculations, Fang et al. reported that minor Sn2+ doping could effectively tune the bandgap and enhance the stability and optical properties of the CsPbI3 perovskite. Jin et al. and Zhu et al. had experimentally prepared and characterized Sn2+-doped CsPbIBr2 perovskites. Their results indicated that partially substituting Pb2+ with Sn2+ could narrow the bandgap and enhance the quality of the CsPbIBr2 perovskite. As a result, the power conversion efficiency and stability of CsPb1−xSnxIBr2 PSCs were remarkably improved. These reports suggest that Sn2+ substitution is an effective strategy to tune the bandgap and improve the quality of inorganic perovskites.
Herein, we have incorporated Sn2+ into the CsPbBr3 perovskite to partially substitute Pb2+, aiming to simultaneously tune the bandgap and improve the quality of the CsPbBr3 perovskite film. Zhang et al. reported that doping SnBr2 into CsPbBr3 improved the morphology and coverage of the perovskite film. However, they did not observe bandgap narrowing in the SnBr2-doped CsPbBr3 perovskite. This could be attributed to the fact that the content of SnBr2 is very small (0.2%). Our results indicate that the bandgap of the as-prepared CsPb1−xSnxBr3 perovskites gradually reduces with the increase of the content of Sn2+. Moreover, the Sn2+-doped inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite film shows a promoted quality and improved morphology compared to the undoped one when a suitable content of Sn2+ was incorporated. We have utilized the Sn2+-doped CsPbBr3 perovskite to fabricate carbon-based inorganic PSCs with a configuration of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/CsPb1−xSnxBr3/carbon, which exhibits much better photovoltaic performance than the pure CsPbBr3-based device and excellent long-term stability under ambient conditions.

SnBr2 (99%), CsI (99%), PbBr2 (99%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (99%), methanol (99.5%), and isopropanol (99.5%) were purchased from J & K Chemical Ltd. Titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Sn powder (99%) was purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Ltd. Carbon paste was purchased from Shanghai New Materials Ltd.


The compact TiO2 layer (c-TiO2) and the mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) film were subsequently deposited onto the pre-cleaned FTO substrates by the spin-coating method as described in our previous reports. As shown in Fig. S1, the CsPb1−xSnxBr3 perovskite films were deposited onto FTO/TiO2 substrates through a combined procedure involving a spin-coating process and a dipping process. Firstly, 1 M PbBr2/SnBr2 mixed solutions with various mole ratios (Pb/Sn: 1/0, 0.975/0.025, 0.95/0.05, and 0.90/0.10) were prepared by dissolving PbBr2 and SnBr2 in DMF. To prevent the oxidation of Sn2+ during the solution preparation, a small amount of Sn metal powder was added into the above solutions. The above solutions were filtered and spin-coated onto the as-prepared FTO/TiO2 substrates at 2500 rpm for 30 s, followed by drying at 90 °C for 15 min. Secondly, the obtained PbBr2/SnBr2 films were immediately dipped into a 0.07 M methanol solution of CsBr for 15 min, followed by washing with isopropanol and drying in air. The above samples were annealed at 250 °C for 10 min. Thirdly, the CsBr methanol solution was further spin-coated onto the above thin films, followed by annealing at 250 °C for 10 min. Finally, CsPb1−xSnxBr3 perovskite films were formed. To prevent the oxidation of Sn2+ during the annealing process, all annealing processes were performed in a glovebox filled with N2. The carbon paste was deposited onto the prepared perovskite film by a doctor-blade method and heated at 90 °C for 15 min to form a carbon electrode of the device.


The geometrical optimization and band-structure simulation were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) on the basis of density functional theory (DFT). Starting from the cubic phase of the perovskite, a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell was constructed. For CsPb1−xSnxBr3, a configuration with Pb/Sn = 7:1 was obtained by replacing one Pb with a Sn, corresponding to an x value of 12.5%. A Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional and a hybrid HSE06 functional were used to optimize the geometric structure and compute the band structure of perovskite crystals, respectively. The energy convergence criterion was set to be 10−4 eV and the atomic positions were relaxed until the forces of each atom were less than 0.04 eV Å−1.


The morphology characteristics and element mapping image of perovskite films were analyzed using an S4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using an Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku) with Cu Kα radiation. Ultraviolet–visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra were recorded using a UV-3600 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using an FLS920 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh). The time-resolved PL measurements were carried out using an FLS980 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of cells were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated AM 1.5 illumination at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The active area of the cell defined by a mask is 0.1 cm2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was recorded using a Zolix-SCS-10 system equipped with a 150 W Xe lamp. All measurements were carried out in air. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed on a Solartron1255/1287 electrochemical system in the dark at an amplitude of 10 mV and a bias of 1 V.


As schematically illustrated in Fig. S1, CsPb1−xSnxBr3 (x = 0, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.10) perovskite films were prepared by coating the perovskite precursor solution onto the substrates via a combined procedure involving spin-coating and dipping processes, followed by heating at 250 °C for 10 min. Fig. 1 shows SEM images of CsPb1−xSnxBr3 perovskite films. The pristine CsPbBr3 perovskite film exhibits a smooth surface and consists of crystal grains with an average size of about 600 nm. However, Fig. 1a shows that several voids are formed in the CsPbBr3 perovskite film, which could result in serious charge recombination in the perovskite film. When the Sn dopant was introduced, the morphology of the CsPbBr3 perovskite film was remarkably improved, the voids decreased and the crystal grain size increased with the increase of the content of Sn2+. As shown in Fig. 1c, the CsPb0.95Sn0.5Br3 perovskite film shows a dense and void-free surface with full coverage and a large grain size. This obvious morphology improvement upon Sn2+ doping may be attributed to the favorable crystal growth of the mixed-metal perovskite. Generally, the dense and void-free perovskite film with large-size grains is propitious to improve the interfacial contact between the perovskite film and the hole-transport layer and decrease the charge recombination, leading to a great performance improvement of PSCs. Nevertheless, when the content of the Sn dopant was further increased, the surface of the perovskite film roughens and a few pinholes appear on the film surface (Fig. 1d). The poor morphology of the CsPb0.90Sn0.10Br3 perovskite film may be attributed to the fast crystallization of the perovskite caused by incorporating a high content of the Sn dopant.Fig. 1e shows energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping images of the CsPb0.95Sn0.5Br3 perovskite film. Clearly, Cs, Pb, Sn, and Br elements are distributed homogeneously throughout the perovskite film.

The crystal structures of the CsPb1−xSnxBr3 perovskite films were characterized by XRD measurements. Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of CsPbBr3, CsPb0.975Sn0.025Br3, CsPb0.095Sn0.05Br3, and CsPb0.90Sn0.10Br3 perovskite films. The XRD pattern of pristine CsPbBr3 displays six remarkable diffraction peaks at around 15.3°, 21.6°, 26.6°, 30.7°, 33.7°, and 37.8°, corresponding to the (100), (110), (111), (200), (210), and (211) planes of the cubic phase perovskite, respectively. The XRD patterns of CsPb0.975Sn0.025Br3, CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3, and CsPb0.90Sn0.10Br3 perovskite films also display six diffraction peaks at the same 2θ values, demonstrating that the incorporation of Sn2+ does not change the crystal structure of the perovskite. The previous literature had reported that substituting Pb with Sn in inorganic CsPbX3 perovskites resulted in the shrinkage of crystal lattice parameters and the cell volume, which was evidenced by the XRD peak shift towards higher diffraction angles with the increase of the Sn content. However, no XRD peak shift was observed in our case. This may be because the content of Sn2+ is small and does not lead to observable variation in the lattice parameter of perovskite. Moreover, there is no diffraction peak associated with the impurity phase in the XRD patterns of CsPb0.975Sn0.025Br3, CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3, and CsPb0.90Sn0.10Br3 perovskite films, indicating that Sn2+ introduction does not lead to the phase segregation and/or the formation of a new heterogeneous phase. This suggests that Pb and Sn are distributed in random arrangements at the B site of the perovskite, as schematically shown in Fig. S2.
The trap density (Nt) of the perovskite films was directly investigated by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method based on an electron-only device with a structure of FTO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/Ag. Fig. 2b shows the dark current–voltage curves of the electron-only devices based on CsPbBr3 and CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 perovskite films. When the applied voltage exceeded the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), the traps of the perovskite were being filled.Fig. 2b clearly indicates that the VTFL value of the CsPbBr3 film (0.408 V) is larger than that of the CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 film (0.214 V), demonstrating a lower Nt value of the CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 perovskite film compared to the pristine CsPbBr3 film. This result confirms that partially substituting Pb2+ with Sn+ in CsPbBr3 largely promotes the quality of the perovskite film.
The photos of CsPb1−xSnxBr3 perovskite films (Fig. S3) show that the color of CsPb1−xSnxBr3 perovskite films changed from yellow to red when the Sn2+ content was increased from 0 to 10%, suggesting that Sn2+ incorporation extends the light absorption range of the perovskite. Fig. 3a shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the CsPb1−xSnxBr3 perovskite films. From Fig. 3a, it is clearly observed that the absorption onset of perovskite films gradually shifted to the longer wavelength with the increase of the Sn2+ content. The pristine CsPbBr3 perovskite film shows an optical absorption edge of 539 nm, which is extended to 555 nm for the CsPb0.975Sn0.025Br3 film, 566 nm for the CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 film, and 586 nm for the CsPb0.90Sn0.10Br3 film. Fig. S4 displays the Tauc plots of CsPb1−xSnxBr3 perovskite films. The CsPb1−xSnxBr3 perovskite films show a gradually tunable bandgap. The bandgaps determined from the Tauc plots are 2.31 eV, 2.26 eV, 2.21 eV, and 2.13 eV for CsPbBr3, CsPb0.975Sn0.025Br3, CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3, CsPb0.90Sn0.10Br3 perovskite films, respectively. This gradually narrowed bandgap with respect to the increase of the Sn content can be assigned to the energy level splitting derived from the orbital overlapping between Pb and Sn. The narrower bandgap of Sn doped CsPbBr3 perovskites than that of the pristine one makes it possible to harvest more light and generate higher photocurrent in the resulting cells.

Fig. 3b shows the steady-state PL spectra of CsPb1−xSnxBr3 perovskite films deposited onto bare glass substrates. The steady-state PL peaks of CsPb1−xSnxBr3 perovskite films display a gradual red shift with the increase of the Sn content, matching well with the variation of absorption onsets as shown in Fig. 3a. This result not only demonstrates that the Sn2+ incorporation reduces the bandgap of the pristine CsPbBr3 perovskite but also rules out the phase separation in the doped perovskite.
To corroborate the effect of Sn doping on the electronic properties of CsPb1−xSnxBr3 perovskites, DFT calculations were performed. In order to decrease the calculation intensity, a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell was built for CsPb1−xSnxBr3 with a Pb:Sn ratio of 7:1, which corresponds to the Sn content of 12.5%. Fig. S5 displays the calculated band structure of CsPbBr3 and CsPb0.875Sn0.125Br3 perovskites. Clearly, the CsPb0.875Sn0.125Br3 perovskite still shows a direct bandgap nature, which is beneficial for photovoltaic application. The calculated bandgap for the pristine CsPbBr3 perovskite is 2.15 eV, which is slightly narrower than the experimental bandgap value. From Fig. S5, it can be observed that the conduction band minimum (CBM) of CsPb0.875Sn0.125Br3 was obviously shifted down and the valence band maximum (VBM) was nearly identical to that of the pristine CsPbBr3, leading to the reduction of the bandgap.

Fig. 3c and d show the total and partial density of states (DOS) of the pristine CsPbBr3 and CsPb0.875Sn0.125Br3 perovskites. For the pristine CsPbBr3 perovskite, the CBM was mainly composed of the Pb 6p orbit, and the VBM was mainly composed of Br 3p and Pb 6s orbits. After partially substituting Pb2+ with Sn2+ in the CsPbBr3 perovskite, the VBM of the doped perovskite is almost similar to that of the undoped perovskite. In contrast, the Sn 5p orbit contributes largely to the CBM of CsPb0.875Sn0.125Br3 perovskites, leading to an obvious shift of the CBM towards the low energy region (Fig. S6). Moreover, the doped Sn2+ can influence the position of the Pb 6p orbit and shift the Pb 6p orbit to a lower energy (Fig. S7). Both the contribution of the Sn 5p orbit and the shift of the Pb 6p orbit result in an obvious narrowing of the bandgap of the CsPb0.875Sn0.125Br3 perovskite.
The as-prepared CsPb1−xSnxBr3 perovskite films were used to fabricate carbon-based inorganic PSCs with a configuration of the FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite film/carbon layer. The cross-sectional SEM image of the CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 PSC (Fig. S8) demonstrated a well-organized multilayer structure. The thickness of the perovskite layer is about 400 nm. The photovoltaic performance of the devices was measured under a simulated AM 1.5 illumination. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of champion devices are presented in Fig. 4a. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The PSC based on the pristine CsPbBr3 perovskite film delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.93% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.31 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 7.42 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.61, which are comparable to previously reported results. The Sn2+ doping obviously improves the photovoltaic performance of the devices. When the CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 perovskite film was used as the light absorber layer, the fabricated device achieved a champion PCE up to 8.04% with a high Jsc of 8.57 mA cm2, a Voc of 1.36, and a FF of 0.69. The remarkably improved PCE was derived mainly from the increase of Jsc and FF. The enhancement of Jsc can be ascribed to the broader absorption region of doped perovskites compared to the undoped one (as shown in Fig. 3a). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra shown in Fig. 4b demonstrate that the photocurrent generation of the devices is consistent with the absorption onset of the CsPb1−xSnxBr3 perovskite films, confirming the broadened photon response of Sn2+ doped perovskites. The integrated Jsc from EQE spectra for PSCs based on the CsPbBr3, CsPb0.975Sn0.025Br3, CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3, and CsPb0.90Sn0.10Br3 perovskite films (Fig. S9) are 6.33 mA cm−2, 7.39 mA cm−2, 8.03 mA cm−1, and 7.18 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in agreement with the Jsc values obtained from J–V curves. The increase of FF can be attributed to the morphology and quality improvement of the perovskite film upon Sn2+ introduction, which suppresses the charge recombination in the devices, as indicated by EIS and dark J–V curves (which is discussed in the later section). However, further increase of the Sn2+ content leads to the drop of photovoltaic performance. The PSC based on the CsPb0.90Sn0.10Br3 perovskite film delivers a PCE of 6.23% with a Voc of 1.32 V, a Jsc of 7.87 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.60.

The stabilized power output (SPO) of the CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 PSC was tested at the maximum power point (1.01 V). As shown in Fig. 4c, the CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 PSC displays a constant current density of 7.26 mA cm−2 as well as a steady PCE of 7.33% during the test. 30 devices for a batch of CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 PSCs were fabricated and tested. Fig. S10 exhibits the statistic histogram of PCE obtained from J–V measurements of 30 devices. Obviously, the PCEs display a narrow distribution with an average value of 7.43%. These results verify good device reproducibility and high-performance stability.
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out to explore the interfacial charge transfer characteristics of the devices. Fig. 5a shows Nyquist plots of pristine CsPbBr3 and CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 PSCs, which were obtained under dark conditions at a bias of 1 V. An equivalent circuit displayed in the inset of Fig. 5a was used to fit these Nyquist plots, in which Rs, Rtr, Ctr, Rrec, and Crec represent the series resistance, transport resistance, transport capacitance, recombination resistance, and chemical capacitance, respectively. The main semicircle of Nyquist plots is assigned to the charge recombination process at the interface of the devices. The CsPbBr3 and CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 PSCs have a similar Rs due to the identical device structures. However, the Rrec value of the CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 PSC (3354 Ω) is much larger than that of the CsPbBr3 device (2262 Ω). This result demonstrates that the charge recombination in the CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 PSC is largely suppressed. This can be attributed to the morphology improvement and quality enhancement of the perovskite film upon Sn2+ incorporation, which enhances the charge extraction and transport in the device. The suppressed charge recombination in the CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 PSC was also confirmed by the dark J–V curves measurements. As shown in Fig. 5b, the leakage current at a low bias voltage and the dark current at a high bias voltage for the CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 PSC are much lower than those for the CsPbBr3 PSC, suggesting a remarkably reduced charge recombination in the CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 device. Furthermore, time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements were also carried out to investigate the charge recombination behavior within bulk perovskite films. Fig. 5c shows the TRPL spectra of CsPbBr3 and CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 perovskite films deposited on the bare glass substrate. Clearly, the CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 perovskite film displays a lower PL decay rate compared to the CsPbBr3 film, indicating that the non-radiative recombination is suppressed within the perovskite film upon Sn2+ doping.
The long-term stability of the PSC based on the CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 perovskite film was also evaluated. The as-fabricated PSCs without any encapsulation were stored under ambient conditions with a temperature of ∼30 °C and a relative humidity of ∼45%. Fig. 6 shows the variation of the photovoltaic parameters of CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 PSC as a function of storage time. Generally, the CsPbBr3 PSC always exhibits superior ambient stability compared to organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs and CsPb(I1−xBrx)3 (0 ≤ x < 1) PSCs. Fig. S11 shows that the PCE of the CsPbBr3 PSC retains over 90% of its initial value after 800 h of storage under ambient conditions. Although Sn2+ is unstable and easily oxidized to stable Sn4+, the CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 perovskite film and CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 PSC show an excellent ambient stability. As shown in Fig. 6, the CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 PSC can preserve over 91% of its initial PCE after 720 h of storage under ambient conditions. These results suggest that the Sn2+ in the CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 perovskite structure is quite stable even under ambient conditions. This can be attributed to that the oxidation mechanism of Sn2+ was changed in the presence of Pb at the B site of the perovskite, which make Pb–Sn alloy perovskites more stable than would be expected. Furthermore, the hydrophobic carbon electrode can protect the perovskite film from moisture damage, which also enhance the stability of the device.

We have demonstrated that partially substituting Pb2+ with an appropriate amount of Sn2+ could simultaneously tune the bandgap and improve the quality and morphology of a CsPbBr3 perovskite film. Therefore, Sn2+ doping not only enhances light absorption but also reduces the charge recombination of CsPbBr3 PSCs. Consequently, the CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 PSC delivers a high PCE of 8.04%, which is increased by 35% compared to the efficiency of the pristine CsPbBr3 cell. In addition, the CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 PSC displays an excellent long-term stability. Without any encapsulation, the CsPb0.95Sn0.05Br3 PSC preserves over 91% of its initial efficiency after 720 h of storage under ambient conditions. These results demonstrate that partially substituting Pb2+ with Sn2+ is a promising strategy for fabricating high-performance inorganic PSCs.
