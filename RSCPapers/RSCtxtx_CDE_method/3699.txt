Two new D–π–A dyes (SK2 & SK3) based on carbazole, and vinylene-phenylene (π-bridge) with rhodanine-3-acetic acid and cyanoacrylic acid as electron withdrawing–injecting as well as anchoring groups were designed and synthesised under conditions that were free from precious metal-catalysts and well characterized for dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications. A high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9% (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) has been achieved using cyanoacrylic acid as an acceptor in D–π–A carbazole dye (SK3) with a cobalt based redox shuttle, while a PCE of 7.1% was exhibited in triiodide based redox mediators. A short-circuit current density, Jsc of ∼18.2 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage, Voc of ∼725 mV, and a fill factor, FF of ∼67% have been afforded by the SK3 based DSSC incorporating the Co2+/Co3+ electrolyte as the one-electron redox mediator. In contrast, SK2 dye based DSSCs with a cobalt based redox mediator have shown a Jsc ≈ 8.4 mA cm−2, a Voc ≈ 587 mV, and a FF ≈ 48%, yielding a PCE of 2.4%. The devices based on SK3 showed outstanding stability performance without significant degradation even after 1000 h of illumination under standard conditions in the Co2+/Co3+ electrolyte.

Organic solar cells have attracted considerable attention over the past decades because of their unique advantages. In particular, after the pioneering work by O'Regan and Grätzel, Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) have received considerable attention as an alternative to conventional silicon solar cells. To date, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼12% has been achieved using ruthenium (Ru) based dyes with a cobalt complex as a redox mediator. However, the relatively high cost and environmental concerns associated with the use of Ru-dyes have prompted researchers to develop Ru-free organic dyes which are highly economical, easier to process and could be modified or functionalized as desired as an alternative choice of photosensitizers. In particular, the design and development of donor–acceptor π-conjugated (D–π–A) dyes with both electron donating (D) and electron-accepting (A) groups linked by π-conjugated bridges, which possess high molar extinction coefficients, are expected to be one of the most promising organic sensitizers.

Due to the excellent hole transporting and facile functionalization possibilities at various positions, carbazole, a fused aromatic heterocyclic molecule has been widely used as a donor in the D–π–A sensitizer architecture for DSSC applications. The substituted carbazole dyes with pyridine as the anchoring group were used in DSSCs but yielded poor PCE (∼1.9%) which implies that pyridine is not acting as a good anchoring group. Among the other D–π–A carbazole based DSSCs reported so far, thiophene derivatives as a bridge have shown a PCE of 6–10%. Wang et al. reported ∼8% PCE with a series of (C2H5)3NH+ salts of carbazole based D–π–A sensitizers, functionalized by the hexyl substituted oligothiophene moiety as a π-conjugated system. A PCE of around 9% has been reported for the device with dye containing triphenyl amine as a donor, a phenylene-vinylene bridge and cyanoacetic acid as acceptors; however, this molecule was synthesized using a Pd-metal assisted synthetic route. In the formal case, the introduction of thiophene derivatives usually required complicated synthetic strategies with the use of a metal assisted coupling reaction route which enhanced the production cost of dye and had an adverse environmental impact that hampered the commercialization of DSSC technology. To overcome the use of metal catalyzed reactions and promote the practical application of Ru-free D–π–A carbazole dyes as a sensitizer in DSSC technology and extend their utility beyond the laboratory, it is highly desirable to have a metal-free synthetic route and at the same time retain the high efficiency of charge separation and collection. In view of this, a bulky tolyl substituted carbazole dye synthesized using a metal free route and showing a PCE of ∼5% using 1-D ZnO nanowires and nanoparticles with the [Co-(bpy)3]3+/2+ complex as the one-electron redox mediator was reported. It has been reported recently that Co-polypyridyl redox mediators are potential competitors of the triiodide based redox mediators as an electrolyte. The redox potential of the cobalt polypyridyl complex is reported to be 0.56 V which is 150 mV higher than that of the iodine based electrolyte and this yields the enhanced photovoltage.
With these multiple motives to have a Ru-free and thiophene free dye architecture as well as a metal-catalyst free synthetic route to prepare the dyes, we have designed and synthesized efficient D–π–A carbazole dyes using a facile metal free synthetic route. We report two D–π–A carbazole dyes, SK2 and SK3, with rhodanine-3-acetic acid and cyanoacrylic acid molecules as electron withdrawing–injecting as well as anchoring groups, respectively, and a vinylene-phenylene unit as a π-bridge. Among these two carbazole dyes, SK3 with the cobalt based redox mediator shows excellent photon to power conversion efficiency (9%) and a high IPCE of 84% along with superior stability.

Carbazole, NaH, 1-hexyl bromide, NaBH4, triphenyl phosphine hydrobromide, cyano acetic acid, LiI, I2, 4-tert-butyl pyridine, guanidiniumthiocynate, 3-methoxy propionitrile, rhodanine-3-acetic acid, CoCl2·6H2O and 2,2′-bipyridyl were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. POCl3, Na metal, piperidine and terephthalaldehyde were purchased from Spectrochem, India. Solvents used for cyclic voltammetry were purified by following the standard protocol and stored under 4A molecular sieves. TCO substrates (7 Ω cm−2), N719 dye and hot melt tape were purchased from Solaronix Inc. Switzerland.


DSSCs were fabricated using the sandwich type configuration of a photoelectrode and counter electrode. A transparent layer of TiO2 with thickness 8 μm, as measured by using a profilometer (Veeco Dektak 150 Stylus surface profiler), was used as a photoelectrode. This electrode was immersed overnight in ethanol solution containing 3 mM organic sensitizer. A platinised FTO was used as a counter electrode. The electrolyte consists of 0.2 M [Co(bpy)3]2+, 0.02 M [Co(bpy)3]3+, 0.1 M LiClO4, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile. The I−/I3− electrolyte composed of 0.5 M lithium iodide (LiI), 0.05 M Iodine (I2), 0.5 M tert-butyl pyridine (TBP), and 0.5 M guanidiumthiocynate in 3-methoxy propionitrile. The electrolyte was inserted through the predrilled holes onto the counter electrode. Holes were sealed using an epoxy adhesive and the DSSCs were stored in the dark at room temperature for 12 h prior to measurements. Active areas of the DSSCs were set to 0.16 cm2 and were maintained constant using the same screen for coating.


NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker 400 MHz NMR instrument. Elemental analysis was done using an EA-3000, Euro Vector Instrument (Italy). Electrochemical Impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out using Solartron 1260 + 1287 interfaces and data were analyzed using CorrView and Zplot software (Scribner's Associates Inc.). Impedance data were collected by sweeping frequency from 120 kHz to 0.1 Hz having an AC amplitude of 10 mV. UV-vis spectra were recorded using a UV-vis spectrophotometer from Shimadzu, Japan. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) was recorded using a Solartron electrochemical analyzer using three electrode systems in acetonitrile/TBAPF6. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the fabricated DSSCs were measured using a Keithley-2400 digital source meter controlled at a computer scan rate of 10 mV s−1. An Oriel 500 W xenon lamp, connected with an AM 1.5 Globe filter (Newport, Oriel Sol3A) to remove ultraviolet and infrared radiation, served as the light source, to give 100 mW cm−2 at the surface of the test cell. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was recorded using a Newport Oriel IQE-200, where a 250 W quartz tungsten halogen (QTH) lamp was used as the light source.


The Co-polypyridyl complex was synthesized according to the published literature procedure. The cobalt(II) and cobalt(III) metal complexes with the 2,2′-bipyridyl (bpy) ligand were synthesized by following the protocol reported earlier by Liu et al. For the typical synthesis of [Co(bpy)3](PF6)2, CoCl2·6H2O (0.25 g) was dissolved in 5.0 mL of distilled water. A solution of 2,2′-bipyridyl (0.55 g) in methanol was then slowly (dropwise) added to the aqueous solution of cobalt under magnetic stirring. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir for another 10 min. An aqueous solution of NH4PF6 (1.02 g) was then added to precipitate the Co(II) complex. The solid product was filtered, washed with water, and dried in a vacuum to isolate the [Co(bpy)3](PF6)2 solid. The complex [Co(bpy)3](PF6)3 was synthesized via slight modification of the above procedure. CoCl2·6H2O (0.25 g) was dissolved in 5.0 mL of distilled water, followed by the dropwise addition of methanolic solution of 2,2′-bipyridyl (0.55 g) under magnetic stirring. After 10 min of stirring, an equivalent molar concentration of Br2 solution in methanol was added slowly, and the reaction mixture was allowed to stir for 10 min. An orange colored precipitate appeared which was then discarded by filtering the reaction mixture to get a clear solution. The solvent was evaporated by distillation under reduced pressure, and the residue was dissolved in methanol (15.0 mL). Finally, an aqueous solution of NH4PF6 (1.02 g) was added under magnetic stirring to precipitate out the Co(III) complex. The product was filtered, washed with water, and dried in a vacuum to yield the [Co(bpy)3](PF6)3 solid.

This above salt 4 (0.8 g, 1.35 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol along with terephthalaldehyde (0.81 g, 1.35 mmol) and was stirred at 5 °C followed by sodium ethoxide solution using Na metal (0.3 g, 13.04 mmol) and ethanol (4.94 mL) and stirred for 2 h. This reaction mass was poured in cold water followed by extraction using chloroform. The solvent was removed under vacuum and residues were dissolved in THF in the presence of a catalytic amount of iodine. This was refluxed for 8 h in the dark and poured into a cold solution of 0.1 N NaOH followed by extraction using dichloromethane.

The main synthetic pathways along with the structure of new carbazole dyes, SK2 and SK3, are depicted in Scheme 1. The convergent synthetic strategy for SK2 and SK3 relies on two simple building blocks, viz. hexyl substituted carbazole (1) and terephthalaldehyde (as a spacer).

Additionally, introduction of a linear hexyl chain into the donor component enhances the solubility as well as avoids dye aggregation. The corresponding intermediate aldehyde (2) was synthesized via the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction followed by reduction, which was subsequently coupled with terephthalaldehyde via an economical and facile Wittig phosphonium salt route and treatment of iodine to achieve the maximum E-type product. The resultant product is condensed with rhodanine-3-acetic acid or cyanoacetic acid by Knoevenagel condensation which resulted in SK2 or SK3 dyes. The preparation of these two D–π–A carbazole dyes with the vinylene-phenylene bridge was accomplished by a metal free low cost route, enabling the development of these dyes in bulk quantity for practical production and large scale DSSC application.

The optical properties of SK2 and SK3 dyes were investigated by UV-vis spectroscopy in ethanol solution (Fig. 1(a)) and their spectral data are summarized in Table 1. The SK2 and SK3 dyes show strong absorption bands at ∼460 nm and ∼435 nm, respectively, which are assigned to the π–π* electron transition. These absorption bands are quite comparable with those reported with efficient hexyl thiophene bridge carbazole dyes. These bands, however, appeared at shorter wavelength with respect to that of N719 but the measured molar extinction coefficients, ε = 34109 M−1 cm−1 (for SK2) and ε = 34166 M−1 cm−1 (for SK3) are twofold higher than the values of N719 (14400 M−1 cm−1). The absorption peaks are red-shifted and broadened in the case of dyes on the titania surface (Fig. 1(b)) compared with those in the solvent (ethanol). This might be due to the interaction of the anchoring group with the surface of the titanium ion, which enhances the conjugation and results in the decrease of the energy level of the π*-orbital of dyes. These characteristics of the interaction enhance the light harvesting capacity of dyes, resulting in higher PCEs. The large red-shift for SK3 (∼60 nm) confirmed a stronger acceptor ability and better intra-molecular charge transfer compared to SK2 (∼10 nm).

The electrochemical properties of these two dyes were determined using cyclic voltammetry (CV, Fig. 2 and Table 1) with the aim to obtain the energy level position of the frontier orbitals. Under the application of positive potential, CV showed two quasi reversible oxidation waves which correspond to an oxidation–reduction process. These two peaks observed at 0.85 V and 1.25 V for SK2 (0.75 V and 1.00 V for SK3) versus ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) are attributed to the oxidation of the π-conjugated backbone and carbazole donor, respectively. The well defined first oxidation peak for SK3 compared to SK2 confirms better charge transfer between D–π–A in the case of cynoacrylic acid compared to rhodanine-3-acetic acid. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these two dyes were determined from the spectral analysis and CV data which are summarized in Table 1. We have also recorded CV curves of the cobalt based redox shuttle in order to find out the electrochemical potentials and energy level of the same (ESI Fig. S1).
The HOMO energy levels of SK2 and SK3 are 1.41 and 1.15 V vs. the NHE (normal hydrogen electrode). These values are larger than the redox potential of the I−/I3− redox couple (0.4 V vs. the NHE) of the electrolyte. This ensures a facile regeneration of the dyes by the I−/I3− electrolyte after electron injection. The LUMO energy levels of SK2 and SK3 are −0.75 and −1.09 V vs. NHE, respectively. As evident, these LUMO levels are higher than the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), which ensures that the two dyes can inject electrons into the TiO2 conduction band. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that the red-shifted band observed for SK2 relative to SK3 is attributed to the destabilization of the HOMO level and stabilization of the LUMO level on replacement of rhodanine-3-acetic acid with cynoacrylic acid resulting in an increase in the band gap. The redox potential of the cobalt based redox shuttle was estimated by CV measurements and found to be 0.5 V which is almost 100 mV higher than that of the iodide/triiodide couple. In the DSSC, Voc originates from the energy level difference between the TiO2 Fermi level and redox potential of the electrolyte. Hence, theoretically it is confirmed that the voltage output of the cobalt based redox couple in DSSCs will be higher than that of the iodine based electrolyte.

The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of DSSCs sensitized with SK2 and SK3 on 8 μM TiO2 films (without the scattering layer) with different redox mediators are shown in Fig. 3 and photovoltaic parameters are depicted in Table 2. SK2I, SK3I, SK2C and SK3C stands for the SK2 dye + iodine based mediator, SK3 dye + iodine based mediator, SK2 dye + cobalt based mediator and SK3 dye + cobalt based mediator, respectively. In a typical SK3 based device, a short-circuit current density, Jsc of 17.2 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage, Voc of 645 mV, and a fill factor, FF of 65% affording an overall PCE of 7.1% have been achieved by employing the I−/I3− redox electrolyte. A similar device with the [Co(bpy)3]III/II electrolyte exhibited a Jsc of 18.3 mA cm−2, Voc of 725 mV, and a FF of 67%, resulting in a PCE of 9.0%. As mentioned, Voc has been remarkably increased by ∼80 mV upon the employment of the cobalt-based redox shuttle over the iodide system. Similar trends are also observed in the performance of the DSSC fabricated with SK2 dye. The performance of the SK3 based device is quite comparable with a similar kind of D–π–A dye, where triphenyl amine has been used instead of carbazole as a donor. However, these dyes were synthesized using a Pd-catalyzed route. Moreover, the SK3 based DSSC possessing n-hexyl chain on TiO2 outperformed the tolyl substituted carbazole dye (SK1) on ZnO due to the higher bulkiness of p-tolyl compared to n-hexyl which likely disrupts the packing. The enhanced adsorption of SK3 over SK1 due to its higher solubility and the lower photostability of ZnO as compared to TiO2 in the presence of the anchoring carboxylic group could possibly be further reasons for higher PCE in SK3. The obtained 9.0% PCE value for the D–π–A carbazole dye (SK3) and Co-polypyridyl complex based redox couple is comparable with those of the best reported DSSC devices using both metal and thiophene (sulfur) free dyes, thereby enabling access to a new dye architecture with economical synthesis and fabrication. The reason for lower Jsc with SK2 may be assigned to the poor charge injection capacity of this dye (−0.75 V) to the CB of TiO2 (−0.50 V) (see Fig. 4). The IPCEs of SK2 and SK3 dyes in DSSCs are shown in Fig. 3(b). SK3 gives a higher IPCE value than the SK2 dye, with the highest value of 84% obtained at ∼500 nm with the cobalt redox shuttle. The higher IPCE value of SK3 dyes indicates that cynoacrylic acid is a very good acceptor or anchoring group in comparison to rhodanine-3-acetic acid. It is also important to note that the SK3 dye with a simple vinylene-phenylene bridge architecture and cyanoacrylic acid as an acceptor gives remarkable solar cell performance compared to other carbazole dyes where multiple thiophene derivatives were used as a bridge.

To recognize the huge difference in the performance of DSSCs based on these two carbazole dyes having different acceptors, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level for geometry optimization. The electronic distribution observed in the frontier molecular orbital of the dyes and their corresponding energies are depicted in Fig. 4. For both the dyes, the HOMO is mainly located on the donor component and spreads up to the vinylene-phenylene bridge. However, the LUMO electron density distribution of the SK3 dye is located on the cynoacrylic acid group, but for the SK2 dye it is mainly concentrated on the rhodanine-3-acetic acid framework, particularly on the carbonyl and thiocarbonyl groups. As a result, the SK2 dye prevents the effective injection of electrons into the conduction band of TiO2via the carboxylic group.
To further understand the electron injection in detail, the EIS analysis was also performed. Impedance spectra of SK2 and SK3 dye sensitized DSSC devices were measured under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G light with a forward bias of −0.7 V and a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 120 kHz. The Nyquist plots (Fig. 5) showed typically two semicircles, the small and large semicircle, respectively, located in high and middle frequency regions, which were assigned to the charge transfer at the Pt/electrolyte and TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, respectively. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the Pt/electrolyte interface is quite comparable for all these devices suggesting that reduction of triiodide and [Co(bpy)3]3+ occurs smoothly. The radius of the large semicircle at intermediate frequency was increased for SK2 compared to SK3 in both electrolytes, indicating that the electron recombination resistance becomes high for SK2 compared to SK3. To support these further, an electron life time (τele) was calculated from the peak frequency (ωmax) of the large semicircle.
The obtained values of τele are depicted in Table 2. The longer electron lifetime in TiO2 films observed with SK3 compared to SK2 dye-sensitized cells indicates that a higher electron density and Fermi level will be ensured, which might further result in higher Voc for the formal comparison with the latter dye. Moreover, we have found that the electron lifetimes of the iodine based devices are a bit higher than that of the cobalt based redox shuttle. Hence, it can be anticipated that the recombination of the injected electron is higher with the one electron redox shuttle (Co2+/Co3+).
From Fig. 6, it is revealed that the cell exhibits excellent stability with no appreciable degradation of the initial performances even after 1000 h of illumination confirming the high photo-stability of the SK3 dye for DSSC applications.

In conclusion, we designed and synthesized new D–π–A carbazole dyes (ruthenium and thiophene free) possessing a vinylene-phenylene group bridge with cynoacrylic acid and rhodanine-3-acetic acid as an acceptor through a facile metal catalyst free route allowing scale up of these dyes economically. A prominent PCE of 9.0% is achieved in combination with the one electron Co-based redox mediator and SK3 dye having cynoacrylic acid as an acceptor. These results also confirm that the dye containing a cynoacrylic acid acceptor group has superior performance than dye containing the rhodanine-3-acetic acid group with both electrolytes i.e. iodine based and cobalt complex based. The lower PCE values of SK2 compared to SK3 are attributed to the poor electron injection of dye to the CB of TiO2 and faster charge recombination between the injected electron from the dye and the oxidized electrolyte. The electronic distribution in the frontier MO of the dyes shows that the LUMO of SK3 dye has a better orbital overlap with the TiO2 conduction band than that of SK2 dye. The DSSC device with SK3 dye and cobalt based electrolyte exhibits good stability under the illumination of AM 1.5G light for 1000 h. We believe that this simple architecture of SK3 dye can be explored further to develop similar structures and utilize them in DSSC devices on a larger scale. We expect that the performance of this device can be further improved by modification in the dye structure such as improving donating capacity of the donor, alkyl chain and optimized bridge structure. The efforts in this direction are in progress in our group.
