Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have garnered considerable attention in recent years. However, improving the fill factor (FF) remains a big challenge. The FF is closely related to the mobilities of the donor. Thus, improving the mobilites of the donor by constructing an enlarged π-conjugated fused ring in polymeric backnones could improve FF and power conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, a fused-ring dithienosilolodithiophene (DTTS)-based low-bandgap polymer of PDTTS with an enlarged π-conjugated system was created and its thermal stability, absorption range, molecular energy, and the corresponding photovoltaic properties were investigated. UV-vis absorption spectra showed that PDTTS with enlarged conjugation on polymeric backbones exhibited a more obvious absorption shoulder peak compared with a similar polymer of PDTS containing a dithienosilole (DTS) unit. Hence, PDTTS had a more planar structure than PDTS and resulted in stronger intermolecular π–π interactions. X-ray diffraction revealed PDTTS to exhibit greater crystallinity than PDTS, which suggested more ordered π–π stacking in PDTTS backbones. The mobility of PDTTS was more than one order of magnitude higher than that of PDTS, and benefited from the more planar conjugated structure of PDTTS. Photovoltaic devices based upon PDTTS/PC71BM blends exhibited efficiencies up to 6.33% with a higher FF of 65% for as-cast films without processing additives. Under optimized processing conditions, PDTS/PC71BM blends exhibited an efficiency of 3.22% with a FF of 53%. These preliminary results suggest that polymers with an enlarged π-conjugated system possess higher mobility and facilitate effective carrier transportation, and boost FF and PCE values.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure have attracted considerable attention due to their great potential in the production of large-area, low-cost, and flexible photovoltaic devices via solution processing. In the last 5 years, scientists worldwide have carried out a considerable number of studies towards realizing the high-power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), and PCEs have reached 11–13% by conversional, invert or tandem device structures. To harvest the maximum photon flux and enable higher short-circuit current (Jsc) for photovoltaic polymers, a low bandgap that absorbs a wide portion of the solar spectrum (in particular photon absorption in the near-infrared region) is needed. By combination of an electron-rich donor (D) unit and an electron-deficient acceptor (A) unit (D–A type) or a combination of an aromatic (Ar) unit and quinoid (Qu) unit (A–Q type), classical narrow bandgap photovoltaic donor polymers such as PCDTBT, PCPDTBT, PBDTTBD, PTB7 and PBDTTT-C-T have been developed. Among these polymers, various good donor moieties (e.g., carbazole, benzodithiophene (BDT), benzodifuran, dithienosilole (DTS)) and acceptor moieties (e.g., benzothiadiazole (BT), thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione, diketopyrrolopyrrole, isoindigo) play important parts in the construction of high-performance polymers. Nevertheless, an improvement in PCE requires not only a high short-circuit current (Jsc) but also a large open-circuit voltage (Voc) and a satisfactory fill factor (FF). Until now, several works have focused on lowering energy levels to achieve high Voc and Jsc, but improving FF remains a considerable challenge. Recently, Marks and co-workers and You et al. showed that FF is closely related to the mobilities of the electron donor. Thus, improving the mobilites of the donor is becoming a new strategy to improve PCE. The mobilities of the donor depend not only on conjugated building blocks but also the degree of π–π stacking of polymeric backbones. Results from our research team and those of other groups have demonstrated that enlarging the degree of conjugation of building blocks can improve (at least in part) the mobilities of the donor. Inspired by those conclusions, in this work, we designed a novel building block based on a good electron-rich unit of DTS. By introducing thienothiophene (Tt) units to the DTS core symmetrically to replace thiophene motifs, a fused-ring of DTTS unit was synthesized and copolymerized with a popular electron-deficient acceptor BT to obtain a low bandgap polymer of PDTTS (see Scheme 1).

In comparison with DTS, design of this DTTS unit is aimed for formation of an enlarged π-conjugated structure to promote overlap of intermolecular orbitals and to improve hole mobilities. Correspondingly, the copolymerization of DTTS and a BT unit to obtain a low bandgap polymer and its favorable optical–electronic properties is expected and potentially applied in PSCs.

2,6-Dibromo-4,4-dioctyl-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (M1), 1-(3,4-dibromothiophen-2-yl)octan-1-one compound (1) and 4,7-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (M2) were prepared according to previous studies. 3,4-Dibromothiophene, Pd(PPh3)4 was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich, ethyl 2-mercaptoacetate and dichlorodioctylsilane were from Acros Chemicals, and they were used as received. Hexane and tetrahytrofuran (THF) were dried over Na/benzophenone ketyl and freshly distilled prior to use. Other materials were purchased from commercial sources and used as received.



1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were measured on an arx-400 spectrometer (Bruker). UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy measurements were carried out using a U-3100 UV-vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was done on a Nanoscope IIIA system (Vecco) on tapping mode. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was done on a JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope (JEOL). The molecular weight of polymers was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) relative to that of polystyrene standards with chloroform as the eluent. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was undertaken on a TG 209 analyzer (Netzsch) under an inert atmosphere with a heating and cooling rate of 20 °C min−1. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was conducted on an IM6e electrochemical workstation (Zahner) with Pt disks, Pt plate, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as a working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively, in a 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution.


Polymer solar cell devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT-PSS/polymers:PC71BM/Ca (10 nm)/Al (80 nm) were fabricated under specific conditions. Briefly, patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass with a sheet resistance of 10–15 ohm per square was cleaned by a surfactant scrub and then underwent a wet-cleaning process inside an ultrasonic bath, beginning with deionized water followed by acetone and isopropanol. After oxygen plasma cleaning for 10 min, a 40 nm-thick poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Bayer Baytron 4083) anode buffer layer was spin-cast onto the ITO substrate and then dried by baking in an oven at 150 °C for 15 min. Then, the active layer (thickness, 100–110 nm) was deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer by casting from a 10 mg mL−1o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) solution. Finally, a layer (10 nm of Ca and 80 nm of Al) was deposited successively in vacuum onto the active layer at 4 × 10−4 Pa. The overlapping area between the cathode and anode defined a pixel size of 4 mm2. The whole thicknesses of the PSCs were measured by an XP-2 surface profilometer (Ambios Technology). Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a 2400 Source Measure Unit (Keithley). Solar cell performance using an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G) solar simulator (class AAA solar simulator, model 94063A; Oriel) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 was measured by a calibrated silicon solar cell and readout meter (model 91150V; Newport). External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured using a QEX10 Solar Cell IPCE measurement system (PV Measurements Incorporated). Except for deposition of the PEDOT:PSS layers, all the fabrication processes were carried out within a controlled atmosphere of a nitrogen dry box containing <10 ppm oxygen and moisture.


First, an acylation reaction was carried out at 0 °C with aluminum chloride as a catalyst and an ester-substituted fused ring of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene was completed by addition of ethyl 2-mercaptoacetate to compound 1 with a moderate yield. Subsequently, in the de-esterification reaction, compound 4 was obtained by two steps. Then, the lithiated 3-alkylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene rendered by lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) began to react under the catalyst copper dichloride to obtain compound 5. Similar to the synthesis of the DTS unit, dichlorodioctylsilane was added to dilithiated bithieno[3,2-b]thiophene slowly in a dilute THF solution. The obtained monomer of M3 was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Ultimately, a Stille coupling reaction was employed to prepare PDTTS (Scheme 2). To evaluate the enlarged π-conjugated effects of PDTTS, a similar polymeric structure of PDTS was prepared under the same reaction conditions. The two polymers obtained were soluble in common organic solvents such as dichlorobenzene and chloroform. The molecular weight is crucial for molecular π–π stacking and the corresponding photovoltaic performance, so the molecular weights of the resulting donor polymers had to be evaluated. GPC showed the weight-average molecular weights (Mw) of PDTTS to be 25.2 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.0, whereas PDTS had an Mw of 27.7 kDa with a PDI of 1.9. The similar values of Mw and PDI between PDTTS and PDS avoided a molecular-weight effect on molecular stacking as well as optical and electronic properties. The thermal stability of the polymers was investigated by TGA, and the plots revealed an onset temperature with 5% weight loss (Td) of PDTS and PDTTS to be 324 °C and 313 °C, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI). These findings suggested that an enlarged conjugation structure in the main chains decreased polymeric thermal stability slightly but both polymers had sufficient thermal stability for applications in optoelectronic devices. The thermal properties of the polymers were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and a cooling rate of −10 °C min−1. However, the polymers did not show noticeable glass transition during DSC from 40 °C to 300 °C (Fig. S2, ESI).

Then, 16 mg of Pd(PPh3)4 was added. After the reaction had been flushed with argon for 20 min, it was heated at reflux temperature for 10 h. Then, the reaction system was cooled to room temperature. The polymer was precipitated by adding 50 mL methanol, filtered through a Soxhlet thimble, and then subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, and chloroform.

UV-vis absorption spectra provided information on the optical properties of the conjugated polymers. Fig. 1 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in dilute chloroform solutions and films cast from chloroform solution on a quartz substrate. The absorption spectra of PDTS and PDTTS showed two broad absorption bands. The short-wavelength absorption bands were at 300–500 nm, which could be ascribed to localized π–π* transitions. The long-wavelength absorption bands of 500–800 nm could be attributed to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the D and A units. In comparison with the main absorption peaks of PDTS and PDTTS in solution, a general red-shifted absorption was observed for both in thin films, which could be attributed to more aggregated configurations in the solid state. The absorption main peaks (λmax) of PDTS were at 620 and 651 nm in solution and thin film, respectively, and those of PDTTS were at 628 and 658 nm in solution and film. There was a slight red shift of the absorption peaks of PDTTS compared with those of PDTS. This finding implied that introduction of an enlarged π-conjugated structure did not lead to an obvious change in electron-richness. PDTTS showed an obvious shoulder peak located at 698 nm in thin films, but PDTS did not show detectable shoulder peaks. These findings suggested that the fused-ring DTTS motif in PDTTS had a more planar structure than the DTS motif in PDTS and that, correspondingly, the former had stronger π–π stacking than the latter. Interestingly, there was no obvious absorption shoulder peak in PDTTS solution in comparison with PDTTS films, which could be attributed to minor twists caused by n-heptyl side chains in solution. Besides the absorption range, the absorption coefficient of solid films is another important parameter in an active layer material in PSCs. The absorbance coefficients of PDTTS film (0.46 × 10−2 nm−1) at the maximum absorption peak was ≈18% higher than that of PDTTS (0.39 × 10−2 nm−1) (Fig. S3, ESI). The enhanced absorption intensity of the PDTTS film could be attributed to the increased interchain interactions induced by a larger planar fused-ring structure and benefited the “sunlight harvesting” of the photoactive layer. From their optical band gaps (Eoptg), PDTS and PDTTS exhibited similar Eoptg values, which were 1.53 eV and 1.52 eV, respectively, suggesting that Eoptg values were seldom affected if the DTS motif was replaced by a DTTS motif.

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was employed to investigate the formation of ordered structures for both polymers. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the powder of the two polymers. PDTTS appeared as an intense lamellar (100) peak at 2θ = 3.97° (corresponding to a d-spacing of 22.2 Å), but PDTS showed a very weak lamellar peak at 2θ = 3.74° (corresponding to a d-spacing of 23.6 Å). The closer lamellar packing distance of PDTTS versus PDTS resulted from soluble alkyl side chains, and showed better intercalation with the extended conjugation in the fused-ring structure. Furthermore, compared with a film of PDTS without a detectable reflection peak at a larger range, the film of PDTTS exhibited a pronounced reflection peak (010) at 24.3° (corresponding to a d-spacing of 3.66 Å), which could be ascribed to a stronger intermolecular π–π stacking interaction. The comparison between the XRD patterns of the two films showed that more ordered interchain structures and higher crystallinity can be formed in PDTTS than in PDTS, due primarily to the extended π-conjugated structure of the DTTS unit compared with the DTS unit. The resulting XRD data were in accordance with the preliminary conclusions drawn from UV-vis absorption spectra.
Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) has been employed widely to investigate the redox behavior and to estimate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of polymers.Fig. 3 shows the CV curves of these two polymers. The onset oxidation potential (Eox) was 0.23 V vs. Ag/Ag+ for PDTS and 0.31 V vs. Ag/Ag+ for PDTTS. The onset reduction potential (Eox) was −1.56 V vs. Ag/Ag+ for PDTS and −1.57 V vs. Ag/Ag+ for PDTTS, respectively. The corresponding HOMO and LUMO levels of PDTS were −4.94 eV and −3.15 eV, and those of PDTTS were −5.02 eV and −3.14 eV, respectively. ELUMO values of PDTS and PDTTS were quite similar, suggesting that the enlarged conjugation structure did not affect the LUMO level significantly. The larger EHOMO value of PDTTS than that of PDTS suggested that PDTTS had a deeper HOMO location, which could lead to a higher Voc. The electrochemical band gap (Eecg), taken as the difference between the onsets of oxidation and reduction potentials, was 1.79 eV for PDTS and 1.88 eV for PDTTS (Table 1).

The charge carrier mobilities of the neat films were measured using the space charge limit current (SCLC) method. The device structures of the hole-only devices were ITO/MoOx/neat film/MoOx/Al. The mobility was determined by fitting the dark current to the model of a single carrier SCLC using the equation:
J = 9ε0εrμV2/8d3
where
J is the current density, d is the film thickness of the polymers, μ is the charge carrier mobility, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, V = Vapp − Vbi (where Vapp is the applied voltage, and Vbi is the offset voltage). The carrier mobility could be calculated from the slope of the J1/2 ∼ V curves. Fig. 4 revealed hole mobilities of 7.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PDTS and PDTTS, respectively. The hole mobility of PDTTS was more than one order of magnitude higher than that of the film of PDTS. Hence, introduction of an extended conjugated structure facilitated charge transport in the polymer, and benefited from the extended conjugated area and enhanced intermolecular π–π interactions.


PSC devices with a typical configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (35 nm)/polymers:PC71BM (≈100 nm)/Ca (10 nm)/Al (80 nm) were fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic properties of these two polymers. The polymer/PC71BM blend was dissolved in o-DCB for spin-coating. At first, different weight ratios of polymer donors to PC71BM (1:1, 1:1.5 and 1:2) were scanned, and we found that 1:1.5 was the optimal D/A ratio for both polymeric devices. All corresponding results are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 5, the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSC devices based on PDTS/PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) under illumination by AM 1.5G at 100 mW cm−2 showed a best PCE of 3.22% with a Voc of 0.59 V, a Jsc of 10.24 mA cm−2, and a FF of 53.19. In comparison with PDTS-based devices, PDTTS-based devices showed a larger Voc (0.65 V), a higher Jsc (15.04 mA cm−2) and an enhanced FF (64.70%), resulting in a much enhanced PCE of 6.33% under the same device-fabrication conditions. To make a clear comparison, six devices based on the two polymers were measured under their optimized weight ratios (1:1), respectively. In the six parallel devices (Fig. S4, ESI), higher Voc and Jsc of PDTTS-based devices than those of PDTS-based devices (six pieces) accounted for the better PCE. In addition, the FF of PDTTS was higher than that of PDTS. From the viewpoint of the material, the domain size, gradated bulk-heterojunction (BHJ), π–π stacking distance/direction, and domain purity affect FF. For a polymer–fullerene system, a several studies have shown that the most important parameter that determines the FF is the charge extraction efficiency, which is limited by the hole mobility. For the higher FF of PDTTS compared with that of PDTS, the enlarged π-conjugated structure on the polymeric backbones of PDTTS could promote interchain interactions compared with the shorter conjugated structure on the polymeric backbones of PDTS, and thus improve the mobilities and subsequently caused its higher FF. In further optimization, there was no significant change in the PCE when the additive diiodooctane (DIO) was added to both blends. Considering that the champion devices for both polymers were obtained under the same optimization conditions, the better device performance of PDTTS over that of PDTS suggested that the DTTS unit having an enlarged π-conjugated structure than the DTS unit possessed greater potential for construction of an efficient photovoltaic polymer donor.

The AFM images of the active layers spin-coated from the blend solutions (1:1.5, w/w) are provided in Fig. 6. There were more amorphous morphologies of PDTS (Fig. 6a) compared with more slim fiber-like morphologies of PDTS (Fig. 6b). From our measurement results, the root-mean square (RMS) of PDTS and PDTTS were 2.1 nm and 2.6 nm for AFM height images, respectively. Hence, the higher roughness of the film gave a higher-efficiency device. One possible reason for this finding could be the increased contact area between the polymer film and metal cathode for films with higher surface roughness, which could result in more efficient charge collection at the interface. A similar phenomenon has been observed in other polymer:PCBM systems. TEM images (Fig. 6c and d) showed that PDTTS with an enlarged π-conjugated structure exhibited more nanoscale fiber-like crystalline structures than PDTS, results that were in accordance with AFM data and device performance. Again, these results suggested that the degree of extended conjugation in PDTTS was an effective strategy to improve polymeric crystalline properties and charge mobility, and led to an increase in device performance.
To verify the difference in Jsc between PDTS- and PDTTS-based devices, the EQE based on PDTS/PC71BM and PDTTS/PC71BM blends were measured (Fig. 7). Both EQE curves covered a broad range from 300–800 nm and exhibited maximal EQE values of 51.4% at ≈591 nm and 34.7% at ≈528 nm for PDTTS- and PDTS-based devices, respectively. PDTTS-based devices showed greater quantum efficiency in the whole response range, which was in accordance with the highest Jsc of the corresponding devices. The integrated Jsc of PDTS- and PDTTS-based solar cells obtained from EQE curves were 10.04 mA cm−2 and 14.77 mA cm−2, respectively, measured under simulated light with a mismatch <2%, which agreed well with the values of 10.24 mA cm−2 and 15.04 mA cm−2 for PDTS- and PDTTS-based devices, respectively.

We synthesized a fused-ring DTTS incorporating two thieno[3,2-b]thiophene units bridged by a dialkylsilole. Copolymerization with 4,7-dithiophenylbenzothiadiazole by the Stille polycondensation afforded a low-bandgap polymer of PDTTS. In comparison with the absorption spectra of the similar polymeric backbone of PDTS, PDTTS showed a distinctly stronger shoulder peak due primarily to introduction of an enlarged π-conjugated planar structure, and resulted in better π–π stacking. XRD measurements of the distinguished aggregated peaks of PDTTS compared with that of PDTS were in accordance with the phenomena observed in UV-vis absorption spectra. More importantly, the mobility of PDTTS was more than one order of magnitude higher than that of PDTS due to the more planar molecular structure of DTTS than DTS. Photovoltaic-devices based upon PDTTS/PC71BM blends exhibited promising efficiency of up to 6.33% with a FF of 65%. However, under the same optimized processing conditions, PDTS/PC71BM blends had an efficiency of 3.22% and a FF of 53%. These preliminary results suggest that polymers containing fused DTTS moieties with an enlarged π-conjugated system possess higher mobility, which benefited carrier transfer efficiency and can account (at least in part) for the higher FF and Jsc values for PDTTS-based devices. Therefore, a strategy of an extended π-conjugated system on donor backbones could be used to design efficient photovoltaic materials.
