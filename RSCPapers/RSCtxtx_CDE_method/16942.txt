Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) present promising cost-effective alternatives to conventional silicon solar cells due to their distinctive properties such as simplicity in fabrication, possibility to realize light absorption in wide solar spectrum regions, and theoretical conversion efficiency up to 44%. This review highlights recent developments in critical materials including quantum dots, photoanodes, counter electrodes (CEs), and electrolytes for QDSC applications. Among them, electron recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte interface limits the evolution of high-efficiency QDSCs, therefore the optimized construction of quantum dots, the various microtopographies of wide bandgap semiconductors (TiO2, ZnO) as well as emerging CEs having good electrocatalytic activity are elaborated in this paper. We argue that these key factors can provide design guidelines for future successful applications and significantly promote the development of QDSCs. Liquid, quasi-solid-state, and solid-state electrolytes for QDSCs are summarized, aiming at enhancing the long-term stability of QDSCs. This review presented below gives a succinct summary of materials for QDSC applications, with a conclusion and future prospects section.

The development of renewable energy sources is an urgent task to solve the emergence of global warming and emission of greenhouse gases. In pursuit of cost-effectiveness, easy fabrication, and environmentally friendly energy, photovoltaic (PV) technology converting solar energy to electricity is a promising strategy as a solution to retard the energy crisis. In 1991, a novel sandwich construction of the so-called dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) containing a dye-sensitized mesoporous photoanode, a liquid electrolyte having I−/I3− redox couples, and a counter electrode (CE) was pioneeringly proposed by O'Regan and Grätzel. This cell structure has attracted considerable attention over the past 24 years because of the advantages of its potential roll-to-roll fabrication procedure, cost-effective materials and manufacturing, and high energy conversion efficiency. Until now, a maximum power conversion efficiency of 13% has been recorded for optimized DSSCs. However, the high cost and fussy synthesis procedures of organic dyes along with limited solar-to-electric conversion efficiency restrict the commercialization of DSSCs. Thus, solar cell devices using quantum dots (QDs) as sensitizers to substitute organic dyes are considered as promising alternatives to DSSCs. As shown in Fig. 1, the rapid growth of the number of research papers over the last 11 years demonstrates that semiconductor QDSCs as a branch of DSSCs are becoming one of the most promising devices on the stage of the PV market.

QDs, a class of narrow bandgap semiconductors, possess several excellent properties such as tunable bandgaps due to the quantum confinement effect, higher absorption coefficients than most organic dyes, and multiple exciton generation (MEG). The scheme of MEG and the relationship between the bandgap and size are shown in Fig. 2. Using PbSe QDs to expound, herein, when irradiating PbSe QDs with photon energies greater than 2 times the QD bandgap, a multiplication of carrier extraction is rather obvious. Meanwhile, the absorption of PbS QDs can be changed from 680 to 1750 nm with the size increasing from 2.6 to 7.2 nm. Based on the above merits, it is possible to realize the light absorption in the whole solar spectrum region via harvesting underutilized ultraviolet and currently unutilized infrared by means of combining several types of QDs. Moreover, a direct bandgap semiconductor offers a stronger absorption coefficient of ∼104 cm−1 and QDs can generate multiple electron–hole pairs from a single incident photon absorption in QDs, which lead to the maximum theoretical conversion efficiency up to 44%.
On the other hand, QDs can be easily deposited on the surface of TiO2 at room temperature by solution processed techniques such as successive ionic layer-by-layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR), chemical bath deposition (CBD), surface attachment through molecular linkers between optimized QDs and TiO2, spin coating, electrodeposition and electrophoretic deposition (Fig. 3). The techniques are facile and can be used in large scale production. This significantly reduces the consumption of energy to manufacture solar cells and gives the opportunity to realize industrialization. In this review, we will primarily summarize the development of QDSCs over the recent five years.

The classical architecture of a QDSC consists of three components: a QD sensitized photoanode, a CE and, a redox electrolyte having S2−/Sn2−couples, as shown in Fig. 4a. The photoanode is fabricated by coating a mesoporous wide bandgap semiconductor layer (TiO2, ZnO) with an optimal thickness of ca. 10 μm and a porosity of 50–60% on the conducting glass. Then, the QD photosensitizers are adsorbed onto the surface of mesoporous semiconductor nanostructures, leading to photon absorption and electron injection. As shown in Fig. 4b, when persistently irradiated by incident light, QDs can absorb photons and excite electrons from the valence band (VB) of QDs to their conduction band (CB). Due to the good match of energy levels, electrons are injected into the CB of TiO2 (see reaction (1)), and then transferred along the percolating network of TiO2 nanocrystallites to transparent conductive oxide (TCO) (see reaction (2)). QDs are subsequently regenerated by reducing species (see reaction (3)) in the electrolyte that acts as a hole-transport medium. Finally, holes are transported to the CE, where the oxidized counterpart of the redox system is reduced (see reaction (4)). A major force that counteracts these favorable processes (see reaction (1)–(4)) is the charge recombination of electrons in the conduction band of QDs and TiO2 at the electrolyte interface (see reaction (5) and (6)).

Several parameters have been employed to estimate the photovoltaic performances of QDSCs. According to photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cell, the conversion efficiency (η) of the cells is obtained as follows:
where
Voc is the open-circuit voltage, Jsc is the short-circuit current density, P is the incident solar power on the device, and FF is the fill factor. Jsc is the photocurrent density derived at zero bias voltage which is dependent on light intensity, light absorption, injection efficiency, and regeneration of QDs, while Voc is the maximum voltage that a solar cell can generate which is determined by the difference between the Fermi level of the wide bandgap semiconductor and the redox potential of the redox system.


With an aim to improve the photovoltaic performances of QDSCs, many researchers have focused their attention on materials selection and materials engineering. According to the above discussion, the energy level of QDs employed in QDSCs must match that of wide bandgap semiconductors. To the best of our knowledge, enormous literature studies have reported the availability of different QDs with an appropriate bandgap (as listed in Table 1) as photosensitizers in QDSCs including CuInS2, PbS, InP, InAs, Bi2S3, Ag2S, Ag2Se, CdS, CdSe, CdTe, ZnSe, graphene, and Si. Among them, Cd chalcogenide QDs are preferred as they are more stable in QDSCs although they may degrade upon visible illumination.

Semiconductor films coated on the surface of wide bandgap semiconductors are key components within QDSC devices. In recent years, several approaches have been explored to improve the performance of QDSCs and some of the significant results are summarized in Table 2 for quick and easy comparison among the QDSCs that have been reported. However, the conversion efficiencies are still lower than those of DSSCs. The major problems limiting the efficiency enhancement are attributed to insufficient light absorption, recombination of photoelectrons with holes in the electrolyte, and the slow charge transfer process between the CE and electrolyte.

A challenging topic for improving the conversion efficiency is to advance Jsc and Voc. In order to increase the light absorption, the combination of different kinds of QDs with different bandgaps, expanding the absorption range within the solar spectrum, has been widely studied, and these integrated QD systems include CdS/CdSe, CdS/PbS, CuInS2/CdS, CuInS2/In2S3, CdSe/CdTe, CdSe/GO,etc. By appropriately matching the energy level of QDs, facile electron transfer is beneficial to the elevation of electron density on the photoanode and therefore Jsc. Among them, core/shell QD sensitizers with advanced structure and superior photoelectric properties are regarded as outstanding building blocks of QDSCs due to the enhanced charge injection efficiency and inhibited charge recombination process. A highly efficient inverted type-I CdS/CdSe core/shell structure (see Fig. 5a) has been explored by Zhong et al. With the narrower bandgap material grown epitaxially around the core of the wider bandgap material, the charge carriers (electrons and holes) are distributed largely in the shell region. Meanwhile, this favors the extraction of photogenerated electrons as well as holes and enhances the electron injection rate. Ideal QD sensitizers should bear the characteristic of a wide absorption range, high CB edge, and free of trap-state defects. To further enhance Voc and cell efficiency, type-II ZnTe/CdSe and CdTe/CdSe core/shell QDs have also been explored, as illustrated in Fig. 5b, yielding conversion efficiencies of 7.17% and 6.67%, respectively. The prominent efficiency is attributed to the enhanced electron injection rate and the retarded charge recombination process because the shell can act as a tunneling barrier for the hole localized in the core. Furthermore, the augmentation of band offset and the stronger photo-induced dipole (PID) effect which brings forward an upward shift of the TiO2 CB edge are other reasons resulting in the enhancement of the resultant cell devices. From Fig. 6, it can be seen that the PID effect can significantly increase the Voc because photogenerated holes in type-II QDs are retained in the core for a relatively long time, allowing for the accumulation of a positively charged layer. Meanwhile, the electron injection to the CB of TiO2 is favorable for the formation of a dipole moment. This novel design strategy has the potential to improve the conversion efficiency of QDSC devices.
The performance of QDSC devices is seriously reduced by the recombination of photoelectrons with holes in the electrolyte as shown in Fig. 4b. How to suppress the loss of photoelectrons in the interface within the photoanode is an urgent requirement to improve the conversion efficiency. It is well known that enormous defect states on the surface of QDs are believed to be the primary reason for unsatisfactory Jsc, in this fashion, optimization of surface states and reduction in photoelectron loss are crucial to further enhance QDSC performances. Passivation of QDs, a high-efficiency strategy, has helped to significantly increase the efficiency of QDSCs by organic and inorganic passivating agents. According to pre-treatment, the original trap states on the surface of the QDs can be reduced, leading to decreased recombination of charge carriers. Iván Mora-Seró's group has found that passivation strongly depends on the passivation agent, obtaining an enhancement of the solar cell efficiency for compounds containing amine and thiol groups, such as dimethylamine (DMA), ethylenediamine (ETDA), and ethanedithiol (EDT), as shown in Fig. 7. In contrast, the performance of devices can be decreased using passivating agents with acid groups such as thioglycolic acid (TGA) and formic acid (FA). The distinction effect could be ascribed to the lower acidity coefficient (pKa) of carboxylic groups on TGA and FA than those of alkylamine-(DMA and ETDA) and alkylthiol-(EDT). The corrosion and deactivation of QDs would be attributed to lower pKa, resulting in partial loss of functionality. Moreover, amines can enhance the luminescence of semiconductor particles by reducing the nonradiative recombination, thus improving electron injection and finally photocurrent. Meanwhile, inorganic passivating agents, such as ZnS, ZnSe and halides, can also improve the performance of QDSC devices. The combined ZnS/SiO2 treatment on the CdSexTe1−x sensitized photoanode can significantly reduce interfacial recombination and increase charge collection efficiency, resulting in a certified record efficiency of 8.21%. Besides, chemical surface treatment with those materials can induce a shift of the TiO2 CB or a change in the recombination properties of electrons in TiO2, producing a solidarity movement of the TiO2 electron quasi-Fermi level which consequently results in a higher Voc. Recently, a hybrid passivation strategy employing mercaptopropionic acid which can significantly increase the loading amount of quantum dots though the interaction between –SH groups with QDs and TiO2, and importing iodide anions through tetrabutylammonium iodide to decrease the recombination loss has been explored, leading to a significant enhancement of the power conversion efficiency of QDSCs by 41%. In short, in pursuit of excellent performance of QDSC devices, Jsc and Voc can be significantly enhanced employing a passivation strategy, which provides a promising method to optimize the surface of QDs and bring QDSCs into the next big breakthrough in photovoltaics.
Additionally, the rapid electron transport along the percolating network from wide bandgap inorganic semiconductors (TiO2, ZnO) has an accelerated effect on high cell performances by construction engineering. It is well understood that the wide bandgap semiconductor acts like a bridge to acquire the photo-inject electron from the sensitizer and transfer the electron to fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO). Thus, expediting the electron flow rate from sensitizers to the substrate can efficiently reduce the backward reaction of electrons with the electrolyte. Based on this theory, great effort has been made on structuring fascinating geometry of wide bandgap semiconductors in recent years. From Fig. 8 and 9, polymorphic semiconductors, such as TiO2 nanotube arrays, nanorod arrays, nanodendrite arrays, nanowire/nanotube composites, ZnO nanorod arrays, nanosheets, nanoflowers, nanotube arrays, forests, and pyramid arrays, have been sensitized with QDs and employed as photoanodes for QDSC devices. In 2007, Sun et al. reported photoanodes from CdS QD sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays, yielding a significant cell efficiency of 4.15% under AM 1.5 G illumination. This enhanced performance is attributed to the crystalline nature of the semiconductors and the film geometry allowing a fast and efficient transfer of the photogenerated electrons from QDs to the substrate, which compares favorably with the traditional mesoporous film electrodes leading to a much reduced electron–hole recombination and much improved photocurrent and efficiency. Furthermore, single wall carbon nanotube/TiO2 nanocomposites, vertical nanosheet-structured ZnO/TiO2, and the vertically aligned hierarchical TiO2 nanowire/ZnO nanorod or TiO2 nanowire/ZnO nanosheet hybrid arrays are also successfully synthesized and employed as photoanodes, yielding a conversion efficiency as high as 4.57% for CdS/CdSe based QDSCs. Besides, the improvement of electron transfer and separation rates along QDs should be also taken into consideration. In this fashion, engineering QD construction is essential to modify the properties of QDs. Considering the purpose to optimize the performance of QDSC devices, quantum rods were also deposited rapidly by electrophoresis onto mesoporous TiO2 electrodes and photovoltaic efficiency values of up to 2.7% were measured for QRSCs.
Apart from the strategies of employing polymorphic TiO2 and ZnO, other approaches have been employed to improve the performance of QDSC devices. Doping optically active transition metal ions is an effective way to modify the electronic and photophysical properties of QDs because of the created electronic states in the midgap region of the QDs, thus altering the photogenerated electron separation and recombination dynamics. For example, Santra et al. succeeded in significantly improving the performance of QDSCs by employing the Mn2+ doping of CdS/CdSe. The high conversion efficiency is mainly attributed to long-lived charge carriers in QD sensitizers introduced by the Mn2+ d–d transition as well as the enhanced ability to capture all incident photons. According to the discussion above, passivation of QDs can significantly advance the performance of QDSC devices. Likely, pre-treating the wide bandgap semiconductor is another approach to reduce electron recombination. A thin TiO2-coating layer deposited onto a nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode by TiCl4 gains an enhanced efficiency by 40% compared with a bare QDSC. Consequently, the main contribution of all the approaches lies in the reduced recombination rate at the interface and the significantly suppressed charge recombination.

The task of a CE is to collect electrons from an external circuit and reduce the oxidized species (such as Sn2− ions) to a reduced state, therefore the properties of the CE must be catalytically active toward the redox electrolyte. In a typical DSSC device, a Pt-based CE has been widely studied because of its high catalytic activity to reduce I3− to I−. However, Pt CEs are unsuitable for polysulfide electrolytes mainly because of their strong chemisorption with S2−/Sn2− couples (so-called poisoning effect), leading to a reduced chemical activity of the CE. Meanwhile, the kinetics of charge transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface significantly affects the FF. Thus, exploration of the new materials with better catalytic activity and electrical conductivity to substitute Pt is an efficient strategy to improve the conversion efficiency of QDSCs, such as metal chalcogenides, carbon materials, and conducting polymers.

Recently, nanostructured metal chalcogenides such as CoS, Co9S8, NiS, CuS, Cu1.8S, Cu2S, CuSe, FeS2, PbS, Cu2SnS3, and Cu2ZnSnSe4 (ref. 120–122) have been found to be cost-effective alternatives to Pt CEs. These compounds have superior catalytic activity towards the reduction of redox electrolytes due to weak inter-layer van der Waals forces. Among them, the Cu2S CE shows the highest electrocatalytic activity toward reduction of Sn2− species in QDSCs. The most simple preparation route is to directly immerse the metal foil substrate into sulfide solution to obtain an interfacial layer of metal sulfides. However, the CEs fabricated by this method can be continually corroded by the S2−/Sn2− electrolyte, resulting in the poisoning of the photocathode and detachment from substrates. In order to solve this problem, ITO or FTO glass as a promising substrate for metal sulfide CEs has been explored. Furthermore, in order to increase the amount of metal sulfide, ITO@Cu2S tunnel junction nanowire arrays as efficient CEs for QDSCs have been explored by Jiang et al., as shown in Fig. 10. The dedicatedly designed and fabricated core/shell nanowire array CEs significantly improve the charge collection and transport abilities as well as avoid the intrinsic issue of copper dissolution in popular and most efficient Cu/Cu2S CEs. The power conversion efficiency of QDSCs with the designed ITO@Cu2S CEs is increased by 33.5% in comparison with Cu/Cu2S CE based solar cells. Meanwhile, the methods of electrochemical deposition, CBD, SILAR, and thermal sulfidation of metal films are also employed to construct the CEs on TCO glass. Zhao et al. prepared a Cu2S film on the FTO glass substrate (Cu2S/FTO) by electrodeposition of the copper film via a multipotential step technique followed by dipping into polysulfide methanol solution, and employed as CEs in CdSe QD sensitized solar cells, exhibiting a power conversion efficiency of 5.21% (see Fig. 11). However, the charge carrier mobility is not significant in these CEs. Therefore, a challenge of optimizing the CE materials is to improve the conducting ability.
Apart from transition metal sulfides, carbonaceous materials have also received growing attention as CEs for QDSCs. However, the relatively slow intrinsic reaction kinetics of carbon with the polysulfide electrolyte leads to the poor performance of QDSCs. By overcoming this problem of carbonaceous materials, some researchers have paid attention to fabricate carbon at an atomic level instead of the structural characteristics. For example, the hollow core-mesoporous shell carbon (HCMSC) CE has been synthesized for QDSC applications, yielding a higher conversion efficiency than that based on conventional Pt. The efficiency enhancement is attributed to the superior structural characteristics such as large specific surface area, high mesoporous volume, and particularly 3D interconnected unique hierarchical nanostructure of HCMSCs. Dong et al. utilized N-doped carbon nanoparticles as effective CE catalysts, and they found an enhanced electrocatalytic activity of N-doped carbon by the additional electrons provided by the nitrogen dopant atoms as well as the active sites. Meanwhile, the combination of carbonaceous materials with metal chalcogenides is also considered as a facile strategy to improve the QDSC performance. Carbonaceous materials with low sheet resistance, high charge carrier mobility and good corrosion resistance can be regarded as a conductive support and catalyst to load CE materials, such as graphene/PbS, graphene/CoS, carbon nanofiber/CuS, multiwall carbon nanotube/Cu2ZnSnSe4, carbon black/PbS, and reduced graphene oxide/Cu2S. Water-soluble multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) nanoparticle composites were successfully synthesized by Zeng et al. and were employed as CEs for QDSCs, producing an efficiency of 4.60%. The enhanced electrocatalytic properties of the composited CE materials arise from the improved charge transport rate to the active catalyst sites in the CE in coordination with carbon, illustrated in Fig. 12. The electrons from the external circuit are delivered to the CZTSe catalyst along the MWCNT and are used to reduce the oxidized polysulfide electrolyte (see Fig. 12a). Within this reaction process, the CZTSe plays a critical role whereas the MWCNT provides an excellent path for electron transfer rapidly due to the outstanding electron conductivity of the MWCNT. Moreover, the combination of carbon nanotubes and graphene provides a greatly enlarged surface area; this allows an increased amount of metal chalcogenide catalysts. With further optimization, carbon derived materials would be promising candidates for CE materials because of their competitive prices and good electrocatalytic properties in comparison to other types of CEs.
Conducting polymers such as polyaniline (PANI), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), and polypyrrole (PPy) have been widely utilized as CEs in DSSCs. Due to their high electron conductivity, low cost-availability, and large electrochemical surface area, the conducting polymers can also be used as CEs in QDSCs. In 2011, Yeh et al. prepared CEs using conducting polymers [PEDOT, PPy and polythiophene (PT)], generating efficiencies of 1.35%, 0.09%, and 0.41% for the solar cells with PEDOT, PT, and PPy CEs, respectively. The authors demonstrated that the promising efficiency of the cell with the PEDOT electrode is attributed to higher electrocatalytic activity, reduced charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface, and the higher porosity and surface roughness of the PEDOT film.
Although the reported efficiencies of QDSCs are still lower than those of other solar cells, breakthroughs in QDSCs will be realized with further studies to improve the electrocatalytic ability of CEs.

The recent research in the utilization of semiconductor QDs for solar energy conversion has provided a promising alternative concept to conventional photovoltaic devices. The common electrolytes used in DSSCs are organic electrolytes containing an I−/I3− redox couple. Unfortunately, the I−/I3− redox couple is corrosive to most quantum dots, leading to degradation of QDSC performance. Thus, exploring an appropriate iodine-free electrolyte is critical for stable QDSCs. The sulfide/polysulfide (S2−/Sn2−) redox couple in the aqueous electrolyte provides a stable environment for QDs. However, the QDSCs employing the S2−/Sn2− redox couple with higher redox potential generate low Voc and very poor FF. Recently, a new electrolyte of the Co2+/Co3+ redox system is used to improve the Voc due to the relative low redox potential in comparison to the S2−/Sn2− redox couple, whereas the photocurrents are still lower than that of the S2−/Sn2− redox couple. Besides, Fe2+/Fe3+ and Fe(CN)65−/Fe(CN)64− redox systems are also investigated in CdS-sensitized solar cells. Until now, the QDSCs employing the S2−/Sn2− redox couple have shown the highest efficiency. The FF and Voc should be further increased by selecting an appropriate electrolyte, such as replacing the S2−/Sn2− redox couple with [(CH3)4N]2S/[(CH3)4N]2Sn in an organic solvent, yielding an impressive Voc of 1.2 V.

Great achievements have been made on QDSCs, but the long-term stability is also important in realizing the commercialization of QDSCs. Volatilization of the liquid electrolyte and permeation of water or oxygen molecules lead to the rapid degradation of performance during the operation of the device. By addressing this issue, an effective approach to solve such a problem is by replacing the volatile liquid electrolyte with quasi-solid-state or solid-state electrolytes.
The quasi-solid-state polymer gel electrolyte shows high ionic conductivity, good thermal stability and favorable penetration ability into nanocrystalline porous TiO2 films, thus it has been widely used in DSSCs. In general, the liquid electrolyte is trapped in the network to form a homogeneous quasi-solid-state electrolyte. Yu et al. first used the chemically crosslinked polyacrylamide-based hydrogel as the polymer matrix to prepare the quasi-solid-state polysulfide electrolyte for CdS/CdSe co-sensitized solar cells and 4.0% of the efficiency was achieved. As we all know, the liquid electrolyte can be easily trapped into a three-dimensional (3D) gel matrix by the osmotic pressure. In our previous work, aiming at accelerating the reduction reaction of redox species, conducting polymers (PANI and PPy) and carbonaceous materials (graphene, graphene oxide) have been incorporated into the gel systems to fabricate conducting gel electrolytes. Conducting polymer gel electrolytes by incorporating graphene into the 3D polyacrylamide matrix was also successfully prepared and employed to assemble CdS sensitized solar cells. The electrocatalytic reaction was expanded from the CE/electrolyte interface to both the interface and the gel electrolyte, resulting in the increased performance. Furthermore, in order to increase the amount of liquid electrolyte loading, the synergistic effect of both osmotic pressure and capillary force is believed to be an effective strategy to further elevate the dosage of the liquid electrolyte in per unit volume of the gel electrolyte. Thus, the dense matrices were freeze-dried after swollen in deionized water. The conversion efficiency of the device was enhanced to 2.34% in comparison to 1.36% for pure polymer gel electrolyte based solar cells. Meanwhile, a low molecular mass gelator, such as dextran, 12-hydroxystearic acid and a natural polysaccharide Konjac glucomannan based highly conductive hydrogel polysulfide electrolyte have been developed, and the enhanced stability was shown in Fig. 13. The good permeation and high conductivity of the gel electrolyte, in which the electron transport is even much faster than the liquid electrolyte, may be the main reason for its excellent photovoltaic performance. At the same time, the good intrinsic stability of the hydrogel electrolyte contributes to the long-term stability.
For further increasing the stability of QDSCs, solid-state electrolytes and hole conductors have been used to replace liquid electrolytes and quasi-solid-state electrolytes in QDSCs. However, the conversion efficiency of QDSCs based on solid-state electrolytes is lower than the solar cell devices with liquid electrolytes. The main reasons for unsatisfactory photovoltaic behavior can be attributed to the weak penetration ability of polymer solid-state electrolytes into mesoporous TiO2 films as well as the relatively inferior electron conductivity, which limits the film thickness of the solid electrolyte and lowers the light harvesting efficiency. Thus, a crucial factor to advance the efficiency is to improve the conductivity and penetration ability of the electrolyte. Recently, solid-state electrolytes based on poly(ethylene oxide)–poly(vinylidene fluoride) polymer blends with a S/tetramethylammonium sulfate (S/TMAS) redox additive were investigated. The study showed that the PEO–PVDF polymer electrolyte with the S/TMAS redox additive could improve the solar cell incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency and stability. A similar discovery was reported by adding sodium sulfide (Na2S) to the solid-state electrolyte. The created polysulfide ions, Sn2−, serving as the electron scavenger at the electrolyte/counter electrode interface and S2− consuming holes at the photoanode/electrolyte interface within the solid electrolyte are the crucial compounds to enhance the properties of the solid electrolyte. Meanwhile, it is confirmed that the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte with additives such as Na2S is significantly modified. In our previous study, we have synthesized a class of solid polymer electrolytes based on polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). An optimized conversion efficiency of 0.55% is measured for the QDSCs employing the PVP/10Na2S–S solid electrolyte. Although the conversion efficiency is still lower than that of liquid electrolyte based QDSCs, the work demonstrated the feasibility of designing cost-effective solid-state electrolytes with polymers and redox species as additives. However, the exploration of solid electrolytes based on polymers for solid-state QDSCs is still limited because of low penetration ability and unsatisfactory conductivity. By addressing this issue, a plastic crystal based solid-state electrolyte composed of plastic crystal succinonitrile and Na2S was creatively synthesized by a simple blending approach. Owing to the significantly enhanced conductivity, an optimal power conversion efficiency of 1.29% is measured. The results demonstrate that exploring a new medium to substitute the polymer gives the possibility to prepare a superior solid-state electrolyte. Another promising approach of fabricating solid-state electrolytes for QDSCs is to employ p-type semiconductors, such as CuSCN, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), and poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT). Although the research on all-solid-state electrolytes for QDSC applications is in a primary stage, the promising peculiarity will trigger researchers to still explore more efficient and stable QDSC materials and devices.

QDSCs have become a promising alternative for DSSCs due to the excellent properties of QD photosensitizers. High power conversion efficiency can be achieved through high-energy photon excitation. However, the relatively low power conversion efficiency is still not comparable to other photovoltaic devices. The factors that limit the efficiency of QDSCs include limited absorption of incident light, recombination at the anode/electrolyte and the low FF arising from unsatisfactory CE performances. By addressing these issues, optimizing the construction of QD sensitizers, CEs with superior catalytic activity and redox couple electrolyte can improve the performance of QDSCs. Combination of diversified inorganic semiconductor QDs and passivation of QDs by organic and inorganic passivating agents can enhance the light absorption and electron excitation and reduce the recombination at the interface. Among them, the type-II core/shell structure can significantly increase the Voc arising from PID effects. On the other hand, highly ordered architectures of wide bandgap semiconductors provide fast and efficient transfer of photogenerated electrons from QDs to the substrate.

Owing to the distinction between QDSCs and DSSCs in redox couples, the electrocatalytic ability of Pt is not satisfactory, leading to a low FF. Metal chalcogenides, carbon materials, conducting polymers, and carbon material/metal chalcogenide composites are explored and employed in QDSCs. Although there have been some efforts to utilize conducting polymers, the resultant PCEs of QDSCs employing these CEs are not high. By combining the advantages of carbon materials (high conductivity) and metal chalcogenides (high catalytic ability), the advanced performance of CEs has been achieved. Apart from improving the conversion efficiency, long-term stability is necessary to be taken into account. Generally, polymer gel electrolytes and solid-state hole conductors as quasi-state and solid-state electrolytes are utilized in QDSCs. However, the properties of these QDSCs employing quasi-state electrolytes and solid-state electrolytes are still poorer than that of those based on liquid electrolytes.
In conclusion, for further development, future studies should focus on improving the QDSC performance. For example, the design of new semiconductor QDs to broaden the absorption spectral region offers a range of new opportunities and challenges to improve the efficiency. Moreover, deeper research on surface treatment provides a new strategy to reduce the recombination. Also, further studies of CEs with high electrocatalytic ability are expected to be the breakthrough in the currently stagnant research field of QDSCs. Much attention might be paid on the stability of QDSCs, in which the weak penetration ability of polymer electrolytes and inferior electron conductivity limit the development. It is expected that exploring highly efficient solid-state solar cells will be a persistent objective in the near future.
