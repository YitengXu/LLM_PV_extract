This report demonstrates that the open circuit voltage (VOC) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer:fullerene (PBDB-T:PC60BM) organic solar cells can be simultaneously enhanced by introducing a molecular π-conjugated donor or acceptor as a third component, thus affording high performance ternary blend devices. The use of a PDI-based acceptor “tPDI2N-hex” or benzothioxanthene-based donor “tBTI-IDT” as a third component leads to VOC increases of 60 to 150 mV without significant loss in power conversion efficiency (PCE). The best solar cell PCE of 8.8% was achieved by doping the PBDB-T:PC60BM system with 10% by weight of tPDI2N-hex.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) are considered as a viable clean energy technology since maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) has reached 14% for single bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs, and 15–17% for tandem OSCs. These impressive performance metrics have been enabled by both device optimization and photoactive materials innovation. The photoactive layer of OSCs indeed plays a key role in light harvesting, exciton separation, and charge transport. While most OSCs utilize a two-component (binary) BHJ, an emerging strategy to improve overall PCE has been to move towards a three-component (ternary) BHJ. Addition of a third photoactive material contributes to improving light-harvesting capabilities via greater solar spectrum coverage and leads to more organized film morphologies for better charge separation and transport. A top performing ternary OSC has reached a PCE of 16%.

Ternary OSCs consist of two donor/one acceptor or one donor/two acceptor blends to improve device metrics (i.e. short-circuit current density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC) and/or fill factor (FF)) relative to the binary structure. The main strategy for improving the efficiency of the ternary OSCs remains the introduction of a third component to expand the absorption profile of the active layer blend and improve photocurrent generation.
The class of copolymers based on benzodithiophene represent some of the best donors for high PCE OSCs. The donor PBDB-T (PCE12) has been established as one of the best materials for fabricating high efficiency OSCs with various acceptors in both binary and ternary systems. For example, Bis70PCBM was added as a second acceptor into a PBDB-T:IT-M blend, resulting in the OSC PCE increasing from 10.8% to 12.1% by improving all photovoltaic parameters (JSC, VOC and FF). Another example showed that adding a second donor polymer, PTB7-Th, into the binary PBDB-T:IEICO blend increased OSC PCE from 10.2% to 11.6%. These examples demonstrated that adding either a donor or acceptor third component to PBDB-T based OSCs can improved photovoltaic performance.
Perylene diimide (PDI) based materials are an excellent choice for use as a second acceptor in ternary OSCs owing to simple synthesis, strong visible light absorption, appropriate electronic energy levels, and high photochemical stability. They are proven acceptors in high performance binary type OSCs. Our group has reported on a series of N-annulated PDI acceptors that can enable the formation of green-solvent, air-processed OSCs with VOC > 1 V and PCEs above 7%. Recently our teams introduced a series of benzothioxanthene compounds and established them as good donor materials with OSCs having high VOC of >1 V. With both classes of compounds yielding high VOC OSCs, we aimed to utilized them as third components to increase VOC and improve device PCE.
In this study, we developed two types of ternary OSCs based on binary system PBDB-T(PCE12):PC60BM by adding either the twisted N-annulated PDI dimer (tPDI2N-Hex) as an acceptor or a benzothioxanthene derivative (tBTI-IDT) as a donor. We show that adding either material into the binary system leads to improved photovoltaic performance via an increase in the OSCs voltage, regardless of their intrinsic properties (acceptor or donor), which provides support for the universality of the ternary BHJ design strategy.

OSCs with an inverted architecture were fabricated and tested in air with the structure: ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoOx/Ag. Full details can be found in the ESI. The chemical structures of the donors and acceptors, normalized optical absorption spectra of the neat PBDB-T (D1), tBTI-IDT (D2), PC60BM (A1) and tPDI2N-Hex (A2) films, and electronic energy levels are shown in Fig. 1. D2 has a slightly deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level than D1, leading to binary OSCs with higher VOC values using A1 as the acceptor (Fig. 1b and Table S1, ESI). A2 has a slightly shallower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level than A1, leading to binary OSCs with higher VOC when using D1 as the donor (Fig. 1b and Table S1, ESI).

The second acceptor tPDI2N-Hex (A2) displays two absorption bands at 500 nm and 540 nm and the second donor tBTI-IDT (D2) shows absorption from 350 to 540 nm, which are both complementary with the absorption spectra of the PBDB-T:PC60BM system (Fig. 1c). The weight ratio of first donor PBDB-T (D1) to first acceptor PC60BM (A1) was kept at 1:1 in the active layer processing solutions and the weight ratio of D2 or A2 was changed from 0.2 to 0.8 in the processing solutions. Active layer films were processed using chlorobenzene solutions (10 mg mL−1) with 3% v/v diiodoctance (DIO) used as an additive as per literature conditions.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of optimized binary and ternary OSCs are shown in Fig. 2a. Complete J–V curves of all OSCs are shown in Fig. S1–S6 (ESI) and corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The optimized binary OSCs made from D1:A1 exhibit a PCE of ∼8% with a JSC of 14.5 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.80 V and a FF of 0.69 (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI) which agrees well with the previous/reported results. When a third component is added, the VOC values are systematically improved with increasing concentration of A2 or D2 from 0.80 V to 0.95 V (D1:A1:A2/D2 ratio of 1:1:0.8). Optimized ternary blends consisted of a D1:A1:A2/D2 ratio of 1:1:0.2 (PBDB-T:PC60BM:tPDI-Hex/tBTI-IDT) affording a maximum PCE of 8.8% with a JSC of 14.27 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.87 V, a FF of 0.71 and PCE of 8.4% with a JSC of 13.53 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.86 V and a FF of 0.72, respectively. Note, the binary OSCs D2:A1 or D1:A2 (presented in Fig. S6 and Table S1, ESI) shows modest PCE of ∼2 and ∼4%, respectively, with a high VOC of ∼1 V but and a low FF of 0.3–0.5. The large FF values of the ternary blend OSCs implies that balanced charge transport and collection is maintained. The evolution of the VOC, following the increasing concentration of D2 or A2, indicates that the ternary system is likely working as a series connection of OSCs. The highest PCE is achieved with ratio 1:1:0.2 of the D1:A1 and third compound (D2 or A2) in ternary OSCs. All OSCs were found to retain their PCE after 300 hours being stored in the dark and in the dry air of Calgary, Alberta.

Fig. 2b and c show binary (1:1, D1:A1) and ternary (1:0.2:1, D1:D2:A1 and 1:1:0.2, D1:A1:A2) film optical absorption and solar cell external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra. The lowest energy absorption maxima (λ ≈ 650 nm) and the high photocurrent generation at longer wavelengths (λ ≈ 550–650 nm) are attributed to the PBDB-T polymer. The addition of D2 to the blends slightly increases optical absorption from 400–450 nm but this is not reflected in the EQE spectrum indicating minimal photocurrent contribution from D2. The addition of A2 to the blends leads to increased optical absorption from 500–600 nm which is reflected in the EQE spectrum indicating that the addition of A2, even in small amounts, contributes to photocurrent generation. This is reflected in the difference plot (Fig. 2d) where subtracting the binary from the ternary EQE spectra leaves a contribution to photocurrent generation from 400–600 nm, correlating to the A2 absorption profile.


Photoluminescence (PL) quenching measurements were used to evaluate the exciton-dissociation efficiency in our OSCs. The PL spectra of the pristine materials and donor/acceptor blend films prepared from chlorobenzene (CB):1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) (97:3 v/v) are presented in Fig. 3. Following selective excitation of D1 at 590 nm, binary and ternary blend films exhibit reasonably strong polymer PL quenching relative to the neat D1 film, by 97% in the binary blend with A1 and 97% and 96% in the ternary blend with D2 and A2, respectively. The high value of the PL quenching of the ternary blend films indicates a well-mixed blend structure with a small domain size of D1.

In contrast, excitation at the absorption maximum of D2 at 430 nm resulted in a PL quenching efficiency of 85% in the binary blend D2:A1 and almost complete quenching (98%) in the ternary blend films, which indicates improved dissociation of excitons in the ternary systems (Fig. 3b and e). For the ternary system (D1:D2:A1) the excitons generated on D2 have two possible pathways to generate charge, direct electron transfer to A1 or energy transfer to D1 (Förster resonance energy transfer, FRET) followed by electron transfer to A1.
Selective excitation of A2 at 490 nm showed strong PL quenching (97%) both in the binary D1:A2 and the ternary D1:A1:A2 films. Furthermore, the optical absorption of D1 strongly overlaps with the PL spectra of both D2 and A2, indicating that these materials can form a good FRET pair (Fig. 1c).

To better understand the nature of the active layer we evaluated photocurrent generation as a function of effective voltage, measured the charge carrier mobilities of the active layers, and studied the performance of the OSC devices as a function of light intensity (see ESI for completed details). We calculated that the charge collection probability under maximal power output condition are 79%, 83% and 79%, respectively, for the OSCs based on the D1:A1 (1:1), D1:D2:A1 (1:0.2:1), and D1:A1:A2 (1:1:0.2) blends. In all devices charge collection is efficient, while the incorporation of A2 enhances charge collection in the ternary blend system. All blended films exhibited balanced hole and electron mobilities on the order of 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table S2, ESI). Light intensity dependant studies suggested losses in the ternary blend devices may arise from bimolecular recombination, but Shockley-Read-Hall charge recombination is also present.


To investigate influence of D2 or A2 additives during film formation on the morphology of the blend films, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4a, the AFM height image of binary system D1:A1 exhibits low root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.7 nm which suggests the formation of small aggregates. Addition of 10% of D2 does not lead to significant structural changes in the film (RMS of 1.7 nm). An increase in the D2 content from 10% to 40% in ternary blend lead to increased surface roughness (RMS of 2.4 nm) and the formation of large fibrous aggregates (Fig. S7, ESI). Addition of 10% of A2 into the binary system lead to an increase in surface roughness (RMS of 2.0 nm) with the surface becoming spottier with more well-defined features. An increased concentration of A2 from 10% to 40% lead to significant roughening of the film (RMS of 4.6 nm) and the surface showed large fibrous features (Fig. S8, ESI). This evolution of the surface morphology to larger features is correlated to a decrease in OSC PCE, suggesting large phase separation. Overall the BHJ surface mapping reveals that best performing OSCs exhibit smooth, near featureless surfaces.


In this contribution we have investigated the impact of including acceptor and donor molecular materials based on PDI and BTI as third components in PBDB-T:PC60BM based solar cells. The two different structures used were a twisted N-annulated PDI dimer (tPDI2N-Hex) as the acceptor or a benzothioxanthene (tBTI-IDT) as donor. It was found that addition of either of these molecular materials to the active layer lead to PCE increases (ca. from 8% to 8.4–8.8%) because of increased device VOC. Adding the third component to the bulk-heterojunction did not significantly alter the film morphology. Moreover, the use of the second acceptor, A2, improved charge collection and lead to enhancement of the second channel for photocurrent generation which was reflected in the EQE spectra from 500–600 nm. The combination of excellent PCE, high VOC nearing 1 V, and enhanced light absorption in the visible region make this bulk heterojunction suitable for indoor photovoltaic applications. Finally, this work highlights the utility of the ternary bulk-heterojunction design for high performance photovoltaics.
