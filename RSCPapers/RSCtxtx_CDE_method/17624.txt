The electronic and material properties of graphene have been explored in a number of electronic and optoelectronic devices including organic and metal halide perovskite solar cells have been explored. At present, graphene-based technology is considered to have many potential applications. Moreover, graphene-related materials offer graphene-like characteristics and the tunability of chemical, electrical and physical properties through doping and functionalization. Metal halide perovskite solar cells form the most advanced photovoltaic technology, showing an exponential increase in their certified power conversion efficiency. The most pronounced challenge is the stability of these devices, which has limited their practical applications and commercialization. The synergy between the properties of metal halide perovskite semiconductors and GRMs has recently been revealed and has contributed towards the realization of highly efficient perovskite solar cells with impressive operational stability. In this work, we review the progress made in the specific field of graphene-based metal halide perovskite solar cells since 2013. The impact of exploitation of graphene and GRMs on this photovoltaic technology is multi-fold, since it has resulted in the development of high-quality perovskite crystals for the fabrication of more stable and flexible devices exhibiting high performance.

Since the discovery of graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, graphene-related materials (GRMs) have been widely investigated over a wide range of optoelectronic applications due to their unusual properties such as good heat and electrical conductivity and transparency. Recent developments in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), have generated broad interest including the exploitation of GRMs for efficient, low-cost and stable PVs, leading to metal halide perovskite semiconductors becoming one of the most promising materials in the field of photovoltaics. GRMs excel in adaptability and tenability. The doping of heteroatoms on GRM sheets can tune their physical, optical, and electrical properties, thus allowing their adoption for PSCs and their exploitation as dopants inside the absorber and as electron- or hole-transporting layers depending on their energy band alignment with the absorber. Additionally, highly conductive GRMs have been utilized as transparent and flexible bottom and top electrodes in PSCs. Moreover, GRMs greatly enhance the long-term stability of PSCs, functioning as a shield against humidity ingression and contributing to the commercialization of this new generation of solar cells.


Increasing energy consumption is an inevitable consequence of global economic development. The need for renewable clean energy sources such as sunlight, wind, rain, waves and geothermal has increased. Almost 27% of the total global electricity capacity is generated using renewable energy sources. Sustainability and green energy are two of the most important keywords of modern society when referring to energy sources. The requirement for sustainable and renewable energy resources is redirecting our energy suppliers towards more efficient and low-cost production and conversion technologies. In line with this priority, the need for efficient, high-performance solar cells is becoming vital since they represent the fastest growing renewable energy technology and the cheapest and easiest way to generate clean energy. The latest report by the International Energy Agency's Photovoltaic Power System Programme found that solar panels providing energy equivalent to 75 gigawatts were installed globally in 2016, bringing the total global installed photovoltaic capacity to approximately 303 gigawatts. That equates to producing 375 billion kilowatt hours of solar power each year, which represents 1.8% of the electricity needs of the planet. Cost efficiency is the dominant driving force for the establishment of solar cells as the main renewable electricity generator. Photovoltaic (PV) module pricing demonstrates a Moore law tendency. Solar module pricing has made radical progress, moving from $300 per watt in 1956, to $10 per watt in the 1990s, and to $0.40 per watt today. The dominance of solar cells as the principal renewable energy source has necessitated implementation of abundant, solution-processed, environmentally benign and rapidly scalable technologies. Organic and organic–inorganic nanomaterial-based solar cells are expected to be among them.

Among the different photovoltaic technologies reported to date, third-generation cells have recently experienced a major breakthrough with the introduction of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Hybrid metal halide PSCs have become a very popular research field in materials science. Recently, organic–inorganic PSCs have rapidly emerged as the most promising photovoltaic technology and have made great progress due to hybrid perovskite materials’ intriguing physical and electrical properties such as direct and tunable band gap, relatively low exciton energy (∼20 meV) at room temperature, high bipolar conductivity (10−2–10−3 S cm−1), high absorption coefficient (104 cm−1), low trap state density and large diffusion lengths (in the micrometer to tens of micrometer range). Lead or tin halide PSCs are considered state-of-the-art technology and have attracted the scientific community's attention because they can be processed from solution and yet demonstrate properties observed in solid-state physics. The high degree of freedom during the synthesis of hybrid perovskite crystals offers a variation in materials and crystal structures, resulting in 3D, 2D or 1D materials with tunable energy band gaps, thus providing good potential for solar cell applications. PSCs have reported impressive leaps: within a few years, their PCEs have exceeded 22% and PSCs are already considered as an effective alternative photovoltaic technology. For efficient PSCs with internal quantum efficiency close to 100% over a wide absorption spectrum under standard testing conditions, the reported short current density (Jsc) has almost reached (22–23 mA cm−2) the theoretical limit (23.8 mA cm−2) for perovskite compounds. More research must be conducted for the theoretical limit of open circuit voltage (Voc) (1.32 eV) to be reached. Therefore, one of the hot topics for the PSC research community is how to further push the device photovoltage and thus the device performance. Semiconducting halide perovskites are based on the ABX3 perovskite crystal structure, (see Fig. 1) where A is an organic cation such as methylammonium (CH3NH3, MA) or formamidinium (NH2CH = NH2, FA), B is a metal (mainly Pb or Sn), and X is a halogen atom (mainly I, Cl, or Br).
The characteristics and properties of this structure (chemical composition and orientation) are vital parameters that define the overall photovoltaic performance of the solar cell. The MA ion is placed in a cage surrounded by four PbX6 octahedra. In this setup, the position and orientation of the organic amino cations determine the spacing between the inorganic layers. The organic part is interchangeable; thus, the MA part can be replaced by FA. This substitution tunes the energy bandgap between 1.56 and 1.48 eV and leads to more stable cells. On the other hand, the PCE of FAPbI3 is lower than that of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) cells. MA and FA phases can be combined, (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x. The PCEs of the order of 18% is reported in cells that demonstrate the advantages of both phases. Tin-based perovskites such as CH3NH3SnI3 have attracted attention because they are lead free and hence are less toxic. Despite their more environment friendly character, these devices demonstrate lower PCEs. PSCs are solid-state hybrid organic–inorganic devices have an architecture similar to that of dye sensitized solar cells (mesoscopic architecture), and by removing the mesoscopic layer, they can be considered as thin-film solar cells (which shows an n-i-p structure for the normal planar architecture and a p-i-n structure is observed for the inverted planar architecture) (see Fig. 2).
In general, a transparent rigid or flexible substrate functions as an electron-selective (mesoscopic or n-i-p configuration) or as a hole-selective (p-i-n configuration) electrode is deposited, followed by the electron transport layer (ETL) (mesoscopic or n-i-p) or hole transport layer (HTL) (p-i-n) interlayers. The metal halide perovskite semiconductor is placed between the interlayers. For efficient collection of photo-generated carriers, the conduction band (CB) of the perovskite should be energy paired with the CB of the ETL, whereas the valence (VB) of the perovskite should be energetically matched with the VB of the HTL. Moreover, for efficient collection of the photo-generated carriers, the work function (WF) of the anode should be matched with the CB of the ETL and the WF of the cathode should be energetically aligned with the VB of the HTL.
The PV performance of PSCs is very much regulated by the electrical and physical properties of the light harvester and the HTL and ETL material. The desired properties from these building blocks include a high absorption coefficient, fast extraction rates from the light harvester into the HTLs and ETLs, fast transportation towards the respective electrodes from the HTL and ETL and finally electron and hole blocking capabilities by the HTL and ETL. The most widely used transparent conductive electrode (TCE) in mesoscopic PSCs is fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), while that in both planar normal and planar-inverted architectures is indium tin oxide (ITO). Despite the low sheet resistance (Rs) (few tens of Ω sq−1) and high transparency (90% in visible) of both TCEs, they exhibit poor bending capability, are expensive, and have low abundance. These drawbacks prevent the use of ITO and FTO TCEs in flexible electronic applications. In the mesoscopic architecture, the titanium dioxide blocking layer (bl-TiO2) and the mesoporous titanium dioxide layer (mp-TiO2) are the most common combination for the ETL material. However, bl-TiO2/mp-TiO2 requires high processing temperatures, which prevents its application in flexible substrates. However, to date, the highest recorded PCEs have been achieved using this approach. On the other hand, in the planar configuration, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is preferred ETL material for most researchers. This organic material requires low processing temperatures and is of low cost. However, its low conductivity and stability issues prevent its further exploitation in PSCs. The perovskite/HTL interface plays an important and diverse role in the performance and stability of PSCs. The HTL materials strongly affect the crystallization of the perovskite semiconductor (in the planar inverted architecture) and the kinetic dynamics of the photogenerated carriers. The most studied HTLs in PSCs are 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-ethoxyphenylamino)-9-9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), poly(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT), poly(triarlyamine) (PTAA) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). Apart from their attractive characteristics, these HTL materials exhibit some drawbacks, low hole mobility (spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA), low PCEs (∼10% in P3HT-based systems), and hygroscopic and acidic nature (PEDOT:PSS), which are detrimental to device performance and must be tackled for their wide use as HTL materials. The thermal properties of the selected HTL also very much affect the thermal stability of PSCs. Thermal degradation of the HTL is a critical challenge that needs to be addressed. Another challenge is the shielding capabilities of the HTL against moisture, water molecules (mesoscopic and n-i-p) and UV radiation to reach the light-harvesting material (p-i-n). Further improvements, mainly regarding the mitigation of hysteresis, prevention of light soaking, and more understanding of hybrid perovskite crystallization, are necessary for PSC commercialization. Reproducibility issues during the fabrication of these cells still exist and must also be overcome. Other challenges include long-term stability and sustainability issues.
Since graphene was first discovered in 2004, graphene-related materials (GRMs) have undergone substantial progress in both fundamental and applied physics, making them the rising stars due to their extraordinary properties. GRMs are low-cost abundant materials that can be easily processed at low temperatures, and their exceptional electrical and physical properties can be easily tuned through functionalization/doping with heteroatoms. Further, GRMs are compatible with flexible substrates and printed electronic applications. Until now, a number of GRMs have been studied and have been applied in organic solar cells, such as chemical vapor deposited (CVD), isolated/free-standing, single-layer, multi-layer, nanoflake, nanoribbon, and nanoplatelet graphene. Recent developments in PSCs have generated broad interest, including the use of GRMs (using spin coating, vacuum filtration, chemical vapor deposition, electrophoretic deposition, spray-coating, Langmuir horizontal deposition and hot pressing) in PSCs as a promising low cost solar cell technology. GRM – based lead or tin halide PSCs experience continuous progress (see Fig. 3, number of published papers reporting the use of graphene in the field of perovskite solar cells).
The last extended reviews on GRM-based PSCs were published in the beginning of 2016. Based on the progress in the field and the challenges faced regarding the performance, stability and scalability of GRM-based PSCs, a new extended review article, which focuses on graphene and device engineering and performance, is necessary to update the scientific community with new developments. The main focus is on the applications of modified graphene oxide (GO) in various building blocks of PSCs such as HTL or ETL or as an interlayer facilitating charge extraction and fast transfer from the active layer to HTL or ETL or from the interlayers to the respective electrodes. The electrical, physical and mechanical properties of GO derivatives are fully controlled through its functionalization with different electronegative heteroatoms. GO demonstrates relatively low sheet resistance (102–103) Ω sq−1 and high transparency in visible light (more than 80% at 550 nm) and is solution processed and can be deposited on various rigid and flexible substrates using facile spin coating techniques. The main disadvantage of GO is its insulating properties, which can be by using reduction processes, leading to electrically conductive reduced graphene oxide (rGO). rGO has been demonstrated as highly capable in the field of organic photovoltaics and has found to be an excellent option as a TCE in the field of PSCs. Following this research, rGO has been applied in other solar cell technologies: pure rGO and heteroatom-functionalized rGO have been applied in PSCs in their pure forms and have been used as a composite with a polymer or other two-dimensional (2D) materials.
In this review article, we present all the developments from studies that have been conducted in the emerging field of graphene- and GRM-based PSCs since 2013. In part I, the application of GRMs as both top and bottom electrodes in PSCs is presented. In part II, the utilization of GRMs as ETLs or as interlayers between the perovskite and the selected ETL is discussed in mesoscopic and planar PSC configurations. In part III, published works related to the application of GRMs as HTLs or interlayers between the perovskite semiconductor and the HTL are discussed. In part IV, the exploitation of GRM–perovskite hybrid composites as active layers for PSCs is summarized. Finally, in part V, the challenges and perspectives of PSCs that must be addressed by GRMs are presented.

The synergy of the unique properties of lead halide perovskite semiconductors with low-temperature, solution-processed, flexible, and transparent bottom or top electrodes is a priority in the field of flexible PSCs. The scientific community has focused on introducing electrode materials that demonstrate high bending tolerance while having generate PCEs (>17%) comparable to those of ITO (a brittle transparent conductive oxide) as the bottom electrode and gold (Au) or aluminum (Al) or silver (Ag) as the top electrode of PSCs. Table 1 summarizes the reported results regarding the utilization of GRMs as electrodes in both mesoscopic and planar PSCs.

Batmunkh et al. exploited the low cost, chemical stability and unique mechanical, electrical and optical properties of solution-processed graphene, demonstrating its potential as the TCE in flexible PSCs. Furthermore, they tested the feasibility of the fabricated transparent conductive graphene films (TCGFs) for application within semiconducting oxide scaffolds and compact layers in metal halide PSCs. After chemical processing, thermal annealing and decoration with Au NPs, the TCGFs showed Rs as low as 1.96 kΩ sq−1 and transmittance (Tr) of 42.3% (see Fig. 4a and b). Since there is a tradeoff between high Tr and low Rs (see Fig. 4c), by controlling the adopted deposition and doping processes, the TCEs demonstrated a Tr of 86.6% and Rs of 15.7 kΩ sq−1. The Au-NP decorated TCGFs were employed as TCEs in mesoscopic MAPbI3−xClx PSCs. The photovoltaic parameters changed differently as a function of Rs and Tr of the TCGF electrode. More particularly, the Voc was not affected by the thickness of the TCE, whereas the fill factor (FF) increased with decreasing sheet resistance. However, the short circuit current density (Jsc) was not optimized in the same way as the FF values. The Jsc value increased with the thickness of the TCE up to a point, beyond which its values decreased due to decreasing Tr. The record PCEs were achieved for TCEs having Rs of 3.08 kΩ sq−1 at 55% transmittance, yielding values of 0.62%.


The long electron and hole diffusion lengths of the perovskite semiconductors has facilitated the development of PSCs without the ETL and HTL. The degradation of the noble metals employed as top electrodes in PSCs should be also tackled. Yan et al., motivated by the instabilities caused by the doped spiro-OMeTAD and metal electrode materials, realized an HTL-free mesoscopic PSC that employed a GRM-based top electrode. The authors studied the impact of the utilization of single-layer graphene (SG) and multilayer graphene (MG) top electrodes on the performance of MAPbI3-based PSCs (see Fig. 5A and B). The main findings were the higher and fastest hole extraction the MG cathode secured compared to the SG cells. This was attributed to the Schottky rectifying characteristics of the perovskite/MG graphene electrode interface, which simultaneously facilitated hole extraction and electron blocking. As a result, the PCE reached values higher than 11% (∼11.5%) and FF value obtained was 70%, which was comparable to HTM-based PSCs (see Fig. 5C–F).


Sung et al. exploited CVD single-layered graphene combined with a thin layer (∼2 nm) of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) as a flexible transparent bottom electrode instead of the state-of-the-art ITO. The necessity to employ a thin layer of MoO3 on top of the CVD graphene was necessary to enhance the wettability (and thus to achieve better formation of PEDOT:PSS HTL onto the graphene's surface) and engineer the energy levels of graphene. The hole doping induced by the MoO3 film to graphene resulted in the tuning of the latter's work function from 4.23 to 4.72 eV. This facilitated the hole transport and collection by the graphene bottom electrode. For reference, the authors utilized ITO/MoO3-based PSC. The introduction of a MoO3 layer of optimal thickness (∼2 nm) (see Fig. 6a and b) contributed to the decreased glass/graphene/MoO3/PEDOT:PSS roughness (∼0.29 nm) compared to the glass/ITO/MoO3/PEDOT:PSS roughness (∼1.95 nm). The lower the surface roughness of the glass/graphene/MoO3/PEDOT:PSS film, the greater the hole transportation and collection by the bottom electrode (see Fig. 6e and f). Additionally, the use of graphene/MoO3/PEDOT:PSS combination resulted in better crystallization of the MAPbI3 semiconductor. XRD measurements revealed larger and more oriented crystal grain sizes, resulting in graphene/MoO3/PEDOT:PSS systems in respect to ITO/MoO3/PEDOT:PSS based substrates. The highest PCE achieved was 17.1%, which was comparable to that of the ITO/MoO3 systems (see Fig. 6c and d).

Considerable effort has been taken to replace ITO with a new conductive and transparent material in the visible-infrared (IR) region of the solar spectrum, which demonstrates high mechanical flexibility and high chemical stability and can be uniformly deposited without forming pinholes onto the selected substrate. Heo et al. proposed the use of AuCl3-doped (p-doped) single-layer graphene as the TCE in planar inverted PSCs. Through the doping process, the WF and the conductivity of the p-doped graphene electrode were tuned to optimize the performance of the PSCs. The Rs of the p-type doped graphene electrode decreased, and its Tr decreased as a function of the molar concentration of AuCl3. The PCE of the MAPbI3 planar inverted PSCs was increased up to a maximum concentration of AuCl3 (10 mM). Beyond this concentration, the decrease in Tr of the electrode overruled the decrease in its Rs and the PCE started decreasing. The highest PCE was 17.9% (42.6% increase compared to that of the un-doped graphene electrode-based reference MAPbI3 inverted PSCs) when the Rs and Tr of the p-doped graphene electrode was 70 Ω cm−2 and ∼85%, respectively. In addition, the AuCl3-doped graphene TCE-based MAPbI3 PSCs exhibited good stability under continuous light soaking at 1 sun in ambient conditions.
The high demand for portable, high-performance, low-cost and flexible energy sources for optoelectronic devices are continuously growing. One of the key issues of high-performance flexible PSCs is the performance of its photovoltaic parameters as a function of the bending conditions impended to the transparent electrode. GRM-based electrodes have been reported as a very promising solution for flexible PV applications. Heo et al. proposed the introduction of a 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) adhesion promoter between the GRM-based electrode and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates in order to promote their chemical bonding. As a result, the PSCs fabricated on top of GRM-based electrode/APTES/PET TCE substrates exhibited excellent bending stability, maintaining their initial PCE of >90% after 100 bending cycles for a bending radius R ≥ 4 mm. In contrast, when ITO/PET or AuCl3–GR/PET TCE-based PSCs experienced similar bending stress tests, their PCEs deteriorated to 30% and ∼20% of their initial PCE values. This high mechanical strength under severe bending conditions of AuCl3–GR/APTES/PET TCE was attributed to the strong bonding between the PET and the GRM-based electrode, which did not permit the de-attachment of the latter from the flexible substrate. Moreover, to further lower the Rs of the GRM-based electrode, such that it approaches the value of ITO-based electrodes, graphene electrodes were chemically n-doped with AuCl3. Finally, the authors reported that high-performance and high mechanical strength (ultra-flexible) planar inverted MAPbI3 and FAPbI3−xBrx GRM-based TCE PSCs demonstrated the highest PCE of 16.1% and 17.9%, respectively, at 1 sun.
Yoon et al. proposed the transfer of single-layer CVD graphene, doped with a few-nanometers-thick MoO3 layer on a thin polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrate. The p-type graphene doping induced by the MoO3 layer not only increased the graphene's conductivity but also improved its wettability, which allowed uniform deposition of HTL upon it. Even though the PCE of the graphene-based PSC (with MAPbI3 absorber) decreased (due to higher Rs of the MoO3/graphene/PEN PSC than of the ITO/PEN PSC) from 17.3% to 16.8%, the flexibility improved. The bending stability of the graphene-based PSCs was impressive since after 1000 bending cycles with a bending radius of 4 mm, the PCE remained >90% of its initial value. In contrast, for the ITO/PEN-based PSCs, the PCE degraded faster and more severely and reduced to 25% of its initial value under similar bending tests (see Fig. 6g–j).

The fabrication of transparent, conductive CVD graphene top electrode in perovskite (large band gap)/silicon (low band gap) tandem solar cells demonstrate advantages over other reported top electrodes (metal electrodes, silver nanowire meshes, carbon nanotubes, PEDOT:PSS composite layers) with similar configurations: high Tr, high conductance, deposition on perovskite without degradation of the organic HTL deposited below. Lang et al. utilized graphene-based TCEs in tandem perovskite/silicon solar cells in order to boost their performance (see Fig. 7a). The authors managed to demonstrate that CVD graphene top electrode demonstrated similar charge collection performance and light management, even at long wavelengths, as gold electrodes in planar perovskite solar cells and lower FFs due to the higher graphene electrode Rs compared to the corresponding Au ones. The graphene/perovskite solar cells transmitted 64.3% of the incident light at 860 nm (see Fig. 7b). The graphene/perovskite solar cell (top cell, large band gap semiconductor) operated as an optical filter with a four-terminal tandem configuration and absorbed all the radiation with λ < 775 nm. The radiation of λ > 775 nm was harvested by the bottom heterojunction amorphous/crystalline silicon solar cell (low band gap). The efficiency of the tandem solar cell was 13.2%. These results were similar to those obtained for other four-terminal tandem devices that used ITO as the top electrode.

Tandem solar cells consisting of a combination of a high and a low band gap absorber result in higher PCEs than those of respective state-of-the-art single-junction PSCs. Recently, PCE of 28% has been reported. An essential part of tandem solar cells is the deposition of a top electrode that exhibits high transparency in VIS and NIR regimes. Ideal properties of such an electrode apart of its Tr, are its low Rs and its compatibility with the organic HTL deposited below. Lang et al. proposed the utilization of a transparent, flexible and highly conductive electrode, a single-layer CVD graphene film in combination with a metal grid to realize high-performance perovskite tandem solar cells. The graphene electrode Rs decreased as an effect induced by spiro-OMeTAD (interface passivation, hole selectivity and graphene doping) and the incorporation of the metal grid (optimization of grid spacing as a function of the graphene layers stacked should be performed to increase FF values). These combined actions reduced the graphene Rs by 24% compared to that of bare CVD graphene samples. The impact of the selected electrode configuration (graphene or Au) was reflected by the overall MAPbI3-based single-junction solar cell performance. Particularly, the glass/FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/graphene/metal grid/polymer stack-based PSCs demonstrated PCEs of the order of 6.02% compared to 2.3% demonstrated by glass/FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3/Au-based PSCs.
The most intelligent way to deal with produced CO2 is its conversion into novel solid-state materials such as carbon nitride, lithium cyanamide and GRMs. Wei et al. reacted potassium, a very important metal for soil health and animal nutrition, with CO2 to form a new type of 3D graphene sheet. The authors tuned the time of reaction in order mainly to improve the electrical properties of the fabricated carbon-based sheets. Rs decreased with increasing reaction time. The 3D honeycomb structured graphene (3DHG) was 2.8 nm thick and consisted of 10 or less graphene sheets. The Raman and XPS measurements indicated that the fabricated 3DHG was rich with defects (strong D peak at 1580 cm−1) and the main component was sp2-bonded carbon (81.4%). The high conductivity (Rs as low as 3.97 kΩ sq−1) and the Tr of the potassium-assisted fabricated 3DHG challenged the authors to exploit them as the top electrode in HTM-free planar normal MAPbI3 PSCs. To improve the interface, 3DHG was introduced into the solution of perovskite precursors. The highest PCE (10.06%) was recorded for a reaction duration of 48 h. This was mainly attributed to the lowest Rs and the increase in the synthesis time of the 3DHG electrode film.
In summary, graphene-based electrodes have demonstrated their use and potential as replacements for ITO or gold/aluminum electrodes. GRM electrode-based PSCs have properties not observed in state-of-the-art materials such as flexibility and ability to tune their electrical properties.

To further increase the PCE and lifetime of PSCs, the flow of photo-generated electrons through the ETL should be precisely controlled and stabilized. One way to achieve this objective is to insert interlayers between the metal halide perovskite semiconductor and the ETL. Graphene is an ideal material to fabricate such interlayers due to its exceptional electrical, optical and mechanical properties. Table 2 summarizes the reported results regarding the utilization of GRMs as ETLs, interlayer or dopants in mesoscopic and planar PSCs.

The introduction of low-temperature processing techniques compatible with flexible, low cost, solution-processed electronics standards (processing at temperatures below 150 °C) is of high priority in order to boost the competitiveness of PSCs. The most commonly used ETL, TiO2 metal oxide, requires high temperatures (∼500 °C) for its sintering/crystallization. These temperatures are impossible for flexible deposition substrates (such as PET or malleable metal foils) required for specific applications or within available budgets. Wang et al. proposed the incorporation of graphene/TiO2 composites as the ETL in mesostructured Al2O3-based mixed halide (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) solution-processable PSCs. The nanocomposites of graphene with anchored TiO2 NPs (diameter size of the order of 25 nm) require low temperature processing (<150 °C) in order to reach high charge mobilities, making them compatible for flexible substrates. The use of liquid phase exfoliated (LPE) graphene nanoflakes (size distribution from 0.1 to 1 μm, consisting of five graphene layers)/TiO2 within the ETL provided superior electron collection, which led to PCEs up to 15.6%. This PCE was higher than the corresponding values of PSCs using high-temperature processed TiO2 ETL. This improvement was attributed to the superior electrical properties of the graphene/TiO2 composite. The best performance with an optimal GO nanoflake concentration within the blend of GO/TiO2 (0.6 wt%, above which graphene might directly touch the perovskite and degrades the PSCs performance due to creation of excess recombination centers) was 15.7%. The better performance of the cells incorporating nanocomposites of graphene/TiO2 was primary attributed to the lower energy barrier for electrons along the interface during their transfer from the active layer to the ETL. Second, the higher conductivity of the graphene platform created lower charge accumulation on the interfaces (the series resistance after the incorporation of graphene flakes was lowered from 10.1 to 4.3 Ohm cm−2), thus leading to less recombination and enhanced photovoltaic characteristics.

In PSCs, the charge extraction time and recombination and thermalization times are competitive parameters. Considerable research has been undertaken in order to improve the electron extremely slow extraction time of PSCs (0.4–0.6 ns) compared to their hot carrier thermalization time (0.4 ps). Obviously, a large amount of the absorbed photon energy is wasted and a significant amount of charge gets recombined. This relation between the extraction and thermalization times is one of the obstacles for the further enhancement of PSC PCEs, since the relation generates high recombination rates (limiting the maximum possible Jsc and FF values) and lowers the achieved Voc (since a lot of energy is lost due to electron thermalization). Zhu et al. introduced graphene quantum dots (GQDs) as an interlayer between the perovskite and the ETL, demonstrating the potential of GQDs as a superfast electron tunnel that enhances the PCE of PSCs. The deposition of a GQD (few layers of graphene of a small size of only 5–10 nm in diameter) interlayer between the perovskite and the employed ETL (mp-TiO2) decreased the electron extraction time (from GQD to TiO2) from 260–307 ps to 90–106 ps. As a result, the PCE of the GQD-based interlayer PSCs increased over those without GQDs, from 8.81% to 10.15% (∼15% enhancement). The faster extraction times increased the probability of low-energy photo-generated electrons (generated by the utilization of visible photons) getting injected into the ETL due to the lower charge trapping probability. The concentration of GQD dispersed into the mp-TiO2 affected the overall device performance and the best results were obtained for 0.5 mg L−1 inside the mp-TiO2 layer. These findings showed the superior role of graphene as a bridging link for the photo-generated electrons compared to other reported materials.
Mesoporous TiO2 is the most commonly used ETL in PSCs demonstrating high PCEs. Despite its excellent performance as an ETL, its relative low electron mobility (0.1–4 cm2 V s−1) has triggered the research for alternative anode materials with superior electron mobility. One of the materials that has been investigated is the ternary oxide SrTiO3, which has an electron mobility of 5–8 cm2 V s−1. Although the energy band gap of the SrTiO3 is similar to that of TiO2, the higher conduction band of the former provides a better energy level alignment with the MAPbI3 semiconductor. Low recombination rates are also reported when SrTiO3 is employed instead of TiO2 due to the former's higher dielectric constant. Despite the high Voc values obtained (>1 V) when mp-SrTiO3 is used, the reported Jsc values are inferior to those of the respective mp-TiO2 ETL-based cells. Following the work done in the graphene/mp-TiO2 nanocomposites, Wang et al. proposed an effective way to improve the Jsc in the mp-SrTiO3 MAPbI3-based PSCs, proposing the use of SrTiO3/graphene nanocomposites as an ETL. The reported PCE of the graphene/mp-SrTiO3 ETL-based PSCs was 10%. The use of the proposed nanocomposite instead of mp-SrTiO3 produced a much higher Jsc (enhanced from 12.42 to 18.08 mA cm−2). According to the SEM images, the SrTiO3 NPs (of various diameters from 5 to 65 nm) adhered to the graphene flakes. This strong bonding was exploited to use graphene flakes as a highway for electron transportation and collection. The concentration of graphene within the SrTiO3 very much affected the performance of the ETL within the device. The optimal results were obtained for 25 mg of graphene within the nanocomposite with SrTiO3. Above this concentration, the PSC PCE degraded due to (1) the formation of recombination centers because of the direct contact of graphene with perovskite and (2) the lowering of the Tr of graphene/mp-SrTiO3 with increasing graphene concentration, which resulted in a decrease in absorbance of CH3NH3PbI3 and eventually reducing the amount of photogenerated carriers. The PCE enhancement after the incorporation of graphene within the mp-SrTiO3 was attributed to the faster electron transfer, lower charge recombination rates, and better MAPbI3 crystallinity (larger perovskite crystal grains and thus fewer trapping states) on top of graphene/mp-SrTiO3 compared to those on mp-SrTiO3 and to the enhanced absorption of the nanocomposite ETL PSCs in the visible-light region.
As previously discussed, TiO2 requires thermal annealing to properly operate as an ETL. As a result of this thermal annealing, boundary regions that degrade the demonstrated ETL conductivity due to scattering effects across these boundary regions are formed. New ETL materials with improved electron transport properties are under investigation in order to lower the charge recombination rates due to charge accumulation and improve the charge collection due to higher electron conductivities. Han et al. proposed the incorporation of an rGO/mp-TiO2 nanocomposite ETL (∼400 nm thickness) that exhibited superior electron transport properties than the bare mp-TiO2 ETL. The improved PCE (higher Jsc and Voc in the FTO/c-TiO2/rGO-mp TiO2/MAPbI3/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag system) was attributed to the lower perovskite/HTL interfacial resistance, which improved the electron charge collection as a result of the superb electrical conductivity of the rGO. The improvements were achieved due to changes in the rGO concentration within the mp-TiO2 film. The maximum PCE improvement (18%) was reported for an optimal rGO concentration of 0.4 vol%. The optimal doping level of the mp-TiO2 ETL with rGO resulted in the enhancement of all the photovoltaic parameters: the Jsc enhanced from 19.6 to 21.0 mA cm−2, the Voc increased from 0.86 to 0.91 mV and the FF jumped from 66.8 to 70.8%. The overall PCE improved from 11.5% to 13.5%. Further doping (with concentrations higher than 0.4%) of mp-TiO2 with rGO led to PCE degradation due to the enhanced absorption induced by high rGO concentration (the rGO absorbs in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm) and thus lower light harvesting. The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) for the composite ETL system was ∼7% higher than that for mp-TiO2-based PSCs. This was a clear indication of the improved collection efficiency of the nanocomposite-based PSCs. According to the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the rGO/mp-TiO2 nanocomposite films demonstrated smaller resistivity, higher electron transport (twice longer diffusion lengths) and reduced charge recombination (slightly longer recombination times) compared with that of mp-TiO2 NPs. UPS measurements confirmed the better energy alignment provided by the introduction of rGO in mp-TiO2 (lower energy level of rGO compared to the conduction band of mp-TiO2) used as the HTL, and this facilitated the charge transfer from perovskite and mp-TiO2 to rGO.
The low conductivity of the TiO2 layers (compact and mesoporous) employed in the MAPbI3-based mesoscopic PSCs has forced the scientific community to introduce strategies to improve their electrical properties. Umeyama et al. proposed the utilization of rGO in bl- and mp-TiO2 layers of PSCs. As a result of the improved conductivity achieved after the addition of rGO, the PCE of the MAPbI3-based PSCs increased by 40%, from 6.61% to 9.3%. This PCE enhancement was attributed to the lower sheet resistance of the perovskite/mp-TiO2 and cp-TiO2/FTO interfaces after the introduction of rGO (EIS measurements). The more balanced electron to hole mobilities, lower series resistances and more favorable energy alignment of the introduced graphene-based TiO2 layers facilitated the electron transfer and collection. As a result, after the optimization of the rGO concentrations in bl-TiO2 (0.15 wt%) and mp-TiO2 (0.018 wt%), the Jsc was increased from 14.5 to 16.5 mA cm−2 and FF value from 0.583 to 0.674.
A key issue that PSCs technology needs to address is the transportation time of the photo-generated carriers from the active layer to the ETL substrate. These times (0.4 ns for electrons) are much longer than the hot carrier cooling time (∼0.4 ps). As a consequence, a large amount of the converted photon energy is wasted in the thermalization process and during carrier trapping. Agresti et al. demonstrated the incorporation of lithium-neutralized graphene oxide (GO-Li) as an interlayer between the perovskite semiconductor and the ETL in mesocopic PSCs. The presented results underline how the WF tuning of the graphene-based material can provide optimal efficiency and improve the life of the PSC. The PCE of the GO-Li-based PSCs (11.1%) was enhanced by 12% compared to that the mp-TiO2 reference device mainly due to (1) better energy alignment between GO-Li and the mp-TiO2 ETL, which led to more efficient electron transfer in terms of energy, (2) higher electron extraction rate, and (3) lower electron trapping because mp-TiO2 electron traps passivation from the GO-Li. All these improvements were reflected on the higher Jsc (increased by 10.5%) and FF (7.5%) values. Moreover, the GO-Li-based PSCs demonstrated longer operational stability due to the mp-TiO2 oxygen vacancies (electron trapping sites) passivation induced by the GO-Li interlayer. Finally, GO-Li inclusion contributed to the reduction in the hysteresis factor by 50% due to the improved interface properties (e.g., less electron trapping, faster electron transportation toward the ETL) of the GO-Li cells compared to the reference cells.
The development of new low-temperature processed, highly conductive and ultra-stable ETL materials is among the current research priorities for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells. The most commonly employed ETL materials, TiO2 and ZnO, are disadvantageous due to their high temperature processing (500 °C) and low temperature instability, respectively. The aforementioned drawbacks motivated the work implemented by Tong et al. The authors proposed the use of a low-processed mesoporous graphene/polymer (mp-GP) composites as an ETL in high-performance MAPbI3 PSCs. The authors reported an impressive enhancement in PCE of 48% compared to that of reference graphene-based devices: the PCE skyrocketed from 9.3% to 13.8%. The mp-GP ETL demonstrated high conductivity (due to the graphene network, two orders of magnitude higher than that of the mp-TiO2 ETL in the reference PSCs) and facilitated (1) uniform MAPbI3 deposition (through large porous mp-GP, 100–400 nm); (2) the excellent crystallization of top-spin deposited MAPbI3 semiconductor (the wider pores in the mp-GP scaffold allow larger perovskite crystals); and (3) the thermal stability of the mp-GP-based PSCs (the performance of the mp-GP-based device after thermal annealing at 150 °C for 30 min degraded by only 12%, whereas the performance of graphene-based PSCs degraded by 81%). The higher thermal stability of the mp-GP cells was attributed to (1) the moisture shielding effect of mp-GP on the MAPbI3 crystal and (2) the high heat transmission of graphene and its low isoelectric point. The authors demonstrated the importance of the mp-GP thickness on the overall device performance (the thinner the mp-GP scaffold, the higher the perovskite absorption). The record photovoltaic performance achieved for 265 nm thick mp-GP. To achieve a PCE value higher than 13%, further mp-GP/MAPbI3 interface engineering is needed. The authors modified the energy levels of the mp-GP ETL by the insertion of ultrathin Cs2CO3 coating at the mp-GP/perovskite interface; as a result, the WF of the mp-GP reduced from 4.4 to 4.13 eV and led to easier transportation of the photogenerated electrons to the ETL (lower recombination rate), facilitated by the MAPbI3, due to lower energy barrier at the interface. Moreover, the deposition of the Cs2CO3 thin film not only affected the WF of the mp-GP but also lowered the contact resistance and increased the recombination resistance at the Cs2CO3/mp-GP interface.
Another candidate ETL for PSCs is the Zn2SnO4 (ZSO) ternary metal oxide (TMO), since it demonstrates some features that make it quite attractive. These characteristics are similar to those of the most commonly used ETL materials, anatase TiO2, but are accompanied with a higher energy band gap (3.7 eV). Moreover, the charge injection and electron diffusion efficiency of this material is much higher than those of TiO2-based ETLs. Porous ZSO exhibited excellent chemical stability for acid/base and organic solvents, making it compatible with a wide range of other materials used in different building blocks of PSCs. Moreover, its synergy with rGO further improves its optoelectronic properties. Mali et al. reported the application of the rGO-grafted ZSO scaffold as an ETL for highly efficient PSCs. The authors fabricated rGO-ZSO ETL-based MAPbI3 and MAPb(I1−xBrx)3(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 PSCs that demonstrated an improved PCE than the reference devices. The optimized device, MAPb(I1−xBrx)3(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, exhibited a PCE higher than 17%, which was 142% higher than the PCE of the reference (MAPI3, ZSO) cells (7.38%). The rGO had a dual role: (1) a bridge for the electron transfer between the perovskite and ZSO nanofibers, which facilitates fast electron extraction (extraction time decreased from 6 ns to 1.39 ns), and (2) an excellent electron acceptor. Moreover, the authors studied the impact of rGO grafting on ZSO nanofibers with respect to the stability of the corresponding PSCs under operational conditions. The rGO/ZSO-based hybrid MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 and double cation (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 PSCs demonstrated an improved stability up to 500 minutes. This stability enhancement was attributed to low sensitivity of the mixed halide perovskite towards exposure to humidity, characteristic of their compact and stable structure.
Despite the impressive PCE improvement in PSCs, further improvements are necessary to advance their performance and enhance their operational stability. Cho et al. studied the impact of the introduction of rGO flakes in various building blocks of mesoscopic mixed (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 PSCs. Depending on the rGO mixing layer, the impact of the rGO on the PSC characteristics varied drastically. The introduction of rGO flakes in the lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonimidate (Li-TFSI)-treated mp-TiO2 ETL improved its PCE compared to that of the control PSCs, free of rGO flakes,. More specifically, both Voc and FF values increased. These improvements were attributed to the passivation of traps due to lithium treatment of the ETL and fast electron extraction, within 1 ns, due to the rGO pathways. The rGO-based ETL device demonstrated a maximum PCE of 19.5%, compared to 18.8% of the reference device.
Despite the low cost, simple production processes and tremendous increase in the PCE, there is a lot of work required to improve the air and thermal stability of the PSCs. The limited lifetime of PSCs under ambient conditions is mainly attributed to the hydrophilicity of the most commonly employed HTL, i.e. spiro-OMeTAD, and the metal halide perovskite active layer itself. These issues should be tackled for this type of photovoltaic cells to meet the demanded stress standards set at the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability. Agresti et al. demonstrated the beneficial dual role of GRMs in improving the PSC PCE and stability. The authors suggested the simultaneous utilization of graphene flakes to mp-TiO2 and GO as a buffer layer between the active medium and the HTL. This strategy resulted in improved PCE, reaching values of 18.2%, owing to a significant improvement in the average values of Jsc by 11.7% and in the average values of FF by 4.3% with respect to GRM-free reference PSCs. These improvements were attributed to the facilitation of electron extraction from the perovskite semiconductor into the mp-TiO2 due to the dispersion of graphene flakes into the ETL. Moreover, the addition of the GRMs is beneficial for the long-term stability of the PSCs, i.e. the mp-TiO2/graphene flake-based cells retained more than 88% of their initial PCE after 16 h of prolonged operation at 1 sun illumination as the maximum power point (MPP). The mp-TiO2/graphene flake and GO interlayer-based cells also exhibited improved thermal stability than the mp-TiO2/graphene flake-based cells at 60 °C.
The success of PSCs is directly linked with the successful efforts of the scientific community to improve the morphology of the perovskite crystals, to simplify their fabrication process, to lower their costs and to optimize the interface engineering between the constituent building blocks. In particular, the interface engineering is a decisive parameter that determines the losses and thus the achieved PCE due to charge recombination at the interface between the perovskite and the transporting layers. A fine tuning of the interface and interlayer properties is mandatory to enhance charge transport and extraction. Graphene and GRMs have shown their potential as ideal elements to tune the interface properties between the perovskite and transporting layers. Agresti et al. showed that graphene and GRMs can play a pivotal role in tuning the interface engineering of perovskite solar modules (see Fig. 8a). The authors reported improved photovoltaic performance and stability when the mp-TiO2 ETL was doped with graphene flakes and the spin coated GO-Li flakes interlayer was inserted between the ETL and the perovskite (see Fig. 8b). The doping of mp-TiO2 resulted in faster electron extraction rates from the perovskite active layer to the ETL mainly due to excellent electrical properties of graphene flakes. On the other hand, the better energy alignment induced by the introduction of the GO-Li flake interlayer between the perovskite and the ETL contributed to more efficient photo-generated electron collection. All these improvements resulted in the realization of GRM-based PSC modules with a PCE of ∼12.6% over an active area of more than 50 cm2 at 1 sun illumination. The achieved PCE was 9% higher than that of the graphene-free reference PSC module. This enhancement was mainly a result of the improved FF values (by 8.8%). Notably, prolonged aging tests have shown the long-term (1630 h until the reference devices show a 20% drop in PCE) stability of the PSC modules. In fact, the graphene-based PSC module retained 82% of its PCE at the end of the shelf life test (see Fig. 8c–f). These results revealed that the dispersion of graphene flakes in mp-TiO2 enhanced the stability of highly efficient GO-Li-based PSC modules.

Tavakoli et al. proposed the incorporation of an rGO scaffold (rGS), on top of which the MAPbI3 semiconductor was deposited. The 3D rGS was deposited using electrophoresis and its impact on the MAPbI3 PSC's performance was significant. The rGS-based PSCs demonstrated superior PCE compared to the TiO2/perovskite cell, inducing a PCE improvement of 38% (the average PCE jumped from 11.7 to 16.2%). This PCE enhancement was due to the substantial enhancement of Jsc (by 19%) and FF (by 6%) values, whereas the Voc was not affected by the incorporation of the rGS. The PCE enhancement upon the utilization of rGS was mainly attributed to the higher crystalline quality of MAPbI3 (longer grain sizes), enhanced light trapping (higher EQE), and facilitation of photogenerated carrier transport (as shown by TRPL and static PL measurements). Moreover, the devices incorporating the rGS showed almost no hysteresis effects and higher stability under ambient conditions.

High sensitivity to ambient conditions and significant photo-charging effect remain as bottlenecks for further commercialization of metal halide perovskite solar cells. Recently, the successful incorporation of solution-processed GRMs in the device configuration has been reported to tackle the aforementioned challenges. Kakavelakis et al. studied the advantages of the addition of rGO into the PCBM ETL of planar inverted PSCs. Particularly, the authors proposed the utilization of rGO as an additive for PCBM for both hybrid mixed halide CH3NH3PbI3−xClx and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite absorber-based PSCs. It was first shown that the addition of rGO enhanced the electron conductivity of the PCBM by fivefold, causing faster electron extraction (see Fig. 9n–p) from the perovskite absorber toward the ETL and leading to higher Jsc (increased from 20.65 to 22.92 mA cm−2) and FF values (from 65.3 to 65.8). Moreover, rGO reduced the surface traps and passivated the perovskite surface, resulting in (1) Voc enhancement (836 mV to 850 mV) and (2) reduction in the light-soaking effect by a factor of three. The photovoltaic performance of the rGO:PCBM PSCs was superior to that of PCBM ETL-based PSCs and the maximum PCE measured was of the order of 14.5% for the hysteresis-free MAPbI3 absorber (an increase of 12.5% with respect to the reference devices). The positive impact of the rGO addition to the PCBM was not only limited to these improvements but also included prolonged device stability at an optimal rGO concentration under illumination (for 120 h) in ambient conditions (>50% RH). The improved stability was attributed to the enhanced fracture resistance of the composite rGO:PCBM compared to that of bare PCBM ETL. Also, the passivation of the top surface of the perovskite by rGO slowed down the photo-degradation of the overall PSC.
E. Bi et al. engineered a nanostructured ETL that suppressed the diffusion of iodine while facilitating faster photo-generated electron extraction from the perovskite layer. The suggested nanostructured ETL was placed between the perovskite and the metal electrode containing N-doped graphene, PCBM and carbon quantum dots (CQDs). The demonstrated ETL presented three times better capability of blocking ion/molecule migration than conventional ETLs of the same thickness. The tested nanostructured ETL also slowed down the migration of Ag atoms from the electrode to the perovskite, which is another source of degradation process. The nanostructured ETL-based MAPbI3 PSCs presented improved thermal and light stability (see Fig. 9j–m). The sealed G-PCBM/CQDs ETL-based planar inverted PSCs exhibited a stabilized PCE greater than 15% during thermal aging at 85 °C for 500 h or light soaking under 1.5G illumination for 1000 h. The highest PCE of these PSCs was 17.0%.
The ideal ETL material should demonstrate some specific characteristics in order to further improve the PCE of the planar inverted PSC, such as high electron mobility, suitable energy level matching of the ETLs’ conduction band (CB) with the CB of the perovskite semiconductor, suitable hole blocking capacity and chemical compatibility with the perovskite. Nouri et al. demonstrated the use of low-cost and abundant GRMs in planar inverted MAPbI3 PSCs. The authors showed the successful and simultaneous application of GO and GO-Li as HTL and ETL interlayers, respectively. The performance of the demonstrated devices was further improved with the addition of a thin layer of a Ti-based sol, which further improved the energy level alignment between perovskite and the Al electrode. All the layers of the demonstrated devices were spin coated (apart from the deposition of the Al electrode). The best performance was observed when both GO and GO-Li/Ti-sol HTL and ETL were employed. The PCE enhanced by 131% compared to those of similar reference devices, reaching values of more than 10% (10.2%). This noticeable enhancement was mainly attributed to the better morphology of the top perovskite film (homogeneous deposition, free of pin holes, limited degradation of the perovskite by diffusion of Al atoms into the perovskite) and more efficient energy level alignment with the LUMO of perovskite induced by the GO-Li/Ti-sol ETL.
Nouri et al. suggested the utilization of ultra-stable and high-performance carbon-based materials instead of organic materials PEDOT:PSS/PCBM. The authors demonstrated the use of GO in combination with NiO as the HTL and Li-modified GO (GO-Li) combined with TiOx as the ETL in planar inverted PSCs (FTO/NiO/GO/perovskite/GO-Li/TiOx/Al). Despite the lower photovoltaic performance of the GO/Li-GO cells compared to PEDOT:PSS/PCBM devices (10.4% vs. 13.1%), the former exhibited a much longer operational stability. Particularly, due to the shielding against the moisture and oxygen molecules provided by the GRM-based ETL and HTL materials to perovskite active layer, the GO/Li-GO PSCs retained 70% of their initial PCE, whereas the organic material-based cells lost more than 90% of their initial PCE after 15 days of operation. These results encourage the use of GRM-based charge transporters to prepare stable PSCs.
GQDs are nanofeatures with very interesting properties such as excellent electron mobility and chemical stability. Ryu et al. coated the surface of the TiO2 ETL of planar normal PSCs with a 2 nm-thick film of GQDs and studied the impact of GQD size on the enhancement of PSC PCE. The optimization of the GQD size (their LUMO increased as their size decreased and higher efficiencies were measured for the GQDs with a diameter of 14 nm) maximized and accelerated (the transition time was reduced from 4.7 ns to 3.4 ns) the electron charge extraction from the MAPbI3 absorber into the ETL. This approach engineered a better interface between the perovskite layer and the ETL (the roughness was reduced as the GQD size decreased) and resulted in an average 10% PCE enhancement compared to the PCE of the reference device. The maximum PCE achieved was 19.11%. Parameters responsible for this enhancement were (1) lower interfacial resistance between the perovskite layer and the ETL, (2) lower recombination rate, (3) better perovskite crystallization induced, and (4) proper energy alignment of the 14 nm-diameter GQDs between MAPbI3 and TiO2 compared to those of reference devices (no use of GQD TiO2 coating). Furthermore, the exploitation of GQDs for the ETL contributed to the reduction of current–voltage hysteresis, which could be attributed to the planar structure (better balance between the hole and electron mobilities). Non-encapsulated devices that incorporated 14 nm-diameter GQDs exhibited better durability under sunlight and moisture than reference cells. This was attributed to the carbon character of the GQDs on the TiO2 layer.
ZnO has been proposed as an alternative ETL that tackles the main disadvantage of the TiO2 ETL (the mandatory sintering at high temperatures), since it does not request a heating/sintering step to achieve the appropriate form. In addition, ZnO demonstrates better electron mobility than TiO2 and thus is a suitable n-type semiconductor for PSCs. However, it faces some stability issues, which induce decomposition of the perovskite active layer during annealing. The introduction of GRMs, e.g. rGO, within ZnO, further improves its electron conductivity and thus helps fast charge extraction from the perovskite. Moreover, the rGO passivates the ZnO and prevents the latter's decomposition, increasing the rGO/ZnO-based PSC stability. Chandrasechar et al. studied the impact of rGO concentration (varied between 0 and 1%) on the PCE of planar normal PSCs based on the rGO/ZnO ETL. Optimization of the rGO concentration (0.75%) led to a PCE higher than 10% (10.34%). This performance corresponds to a PCE increase of 47% compared to those of reference PSCs based on pristine ZnO. This PCE enhancement was attributed to the superior growth of the perovskite thin film (the crystal grain size increased from 10 nm to 250 nm when the perovskite was deposited onto the rGO/ZnO nanocomposite), the smoother morphology the perovskite film (the RMS reduced from 114 nm to 61 nm) and enhanced electron transportation/extraction (as confirmed from the PL signal quenching) on using the graphene network in the ETL nanocomposite. The use of higher or lower rGO concentrations negatively affected the PCE of the PSCs due to graphene's parasitic absorption (e.g. when 1% was employed) or non-uniform deposition of the perovskite film onto the ETL (e.g. when less than 0.75% rGO was used).
Organic ETLs such as PCBM have attracted considerable interest mainly due to their low processing temperatures and low-cost fabrication. However, they have low electron mobility and low conductivity. A number of metal oxide-based ETLs that can overcome these obstacles have been proposed, but these exhibited other disadvantages when utilized in PSCs, such as hysteresis and low stability. Yang et al. proposed the dispersion of GQDs within PCBM ETL-based normal planar MAPbI3 PSCs. The inclusion of low concentration GQDs (of 5 nm in diameter; 0.5 wt%) enhanced the conductivity of the PCBM and facilitated photo-generated electron extraction from the active layer to the ETL. Moreover, as a result of the faster extraction rate, the accumulation of charges at the interface of perovskite with the ETL was reduced and the PCE of the PSCs increased by 20% (from 14.68% to 17.56%). Improved stabilities under continuous solar illumination in the glove box were observed; the PCE was maintained at values greater than 80%, with the UV component included, after 300 h, while the PCE of the reference cells decreased to less than 50%.
To date, primary research and commercial efforts in the field of hybrid PSCs have been focused on the enhancement of their PCE. However, the stability issues are still unsolved and there are no protocols for stability. In particular, the planar inverted configuration exhibits low stability mainly related with the easy oxidation of metal electrodes (Al) with a low work function. Kim et al. used fluorine-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets (EFGnPs-F) to achieve higher stabilities in planar inverted PSCs. After 30 days of exposure in ambient conditions without encapsulation, 82% of the initial PCE was maintained. This high stability mainly stemmed from the super hydrophobic character (stems from the carbon-fluorine bond) and the chemical stability of the EFGnPs-F moieties (see Fig. 9a–i). The latter shielded the perovskite layer deposited below from air-induced degradation. Particularly, when a water droplet was deposited on the EFGnPs-F layer on top of the MAPbI3/PCBM film, the contact angle was 65.5°. Furthermore, after 60 s, the contact angle of EFGnPs-F remained relatively high at 58.6°. This clearly showed that the hydrophobic property of EFGnPs-F could protect the active layer from water ingress, thus improving device stability. The superior stability under 50% humidity was measured as a function of the absorption properties of the EFGnPs-F/MAPbI3 films compared to those of the MAPbI3 reference films. Due to the low concentration of the EFGnPs-F, the absorption spectrum of the EFGnPs-F/MAPbI3 films was not different from that of the MAPbI3 film. After 10 days of storage at room temperature and 50% humidity, the pristine MAPbI3 films started to degrade (decomposition). This was confirmed from the disappearance of the characteristic IR absorption shoulder (∼780 nm). In contrast, this was not observed in the case of EFGnPs-F-coated MAPbI3 films. After 30 days of storage, the absorption onset of pristine MAPbI3 and EFGnPs-F/MAPbI3 films have become indistinguishable. The employment of the EFGnPs-F interlayer between PCBM (ETL) and the metal electrode not only improved the humidity stability but also kept the photovoltaic performance unchanged compared to those of the reference devices.
In summary, graphene-based ETLs have a striking impact on the PSC PCEs and allowed (1) the fabrication of complete devices at temperatures no higher than 150 °C (in comparison, TiO2-based ETLs had higher processing temperatures), which made the PSCs versatile for application as OPVs; (2) offered superior charge collection (due to higher conductivity and lower series resistances at the interfaces of the GRM-based ETLs); (3) did not induce any parasitic absorption losses (as CdS does), that might lower PSC performance; (4) did not contribute to the enhancement of the Jsc value due to complementary absorption spectrum of the perovskite semiconductor; and (5) operated as a super-fast bridge for electron transfer from the perovskite absorber to the ETL. Further modification of the rGO/mp-TiO2 nanocomposite ETL with surface passivation by atomic layer deposition (ALD) could further improve the electrical properties of the composite ETL and thus further boost the PCE.

A large amount of energy is lost in PSCs at the interfaces of the perovskite absorber with the interlayers due to charge recombination. Aforementioned process results from the imperfect crystallization passivation and interfacial behavior. Moreover, the enhancement in the long-term stability of PSCs is one of the most important challenges for their commercialization. GRMs have been investigated quiet intensively as efficient and stable HTL materials for PSCs under ambient and illumination conditions. Table 3 summarizes the reported results regarding the utilization of GRMs into the HTL or as an interlayer between the perovskite and the HTL in mesoscopic and planar PSCs.

Cao et al. used nanographene perthiolated tri-sulfur-annulated hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (TSHBC) as the HTM in mesoscopic MAPbI3-based PSCs. The employment of nanographene provided considerable flexibility with respect to their physical and chemical nature defined by their size. In general, nanographene (nano-sized graphene flakes) are typical p-type semiconductors and its energy levels can be tuned easily through functionalization. This renders nanographene as one of the most promising candidates for HTLs in PSCs. The utilization of nanographene–TSHBC nanocomposites in PSCs (thickness of the order of 20 nm, with an optimal TSHBC/graphene weight ratio of 5:1) as the HTM enhanced their efficiency mainly due to rapid hole extraction through TSHBC, their fast transportation to the respective electrode and their long-term stability due to the hydrophobic nature of nanographene. This resulted in PCEs of 14%, which corresponded to an ∼15% PCE enhancement compared to that of bare TSHBC HTM-based PSCs. Moreover, the non-encapsulated TSHBC/graphene-based devices retained more than 95% of their operational stability at 45% humidity for 10 days. On the other hand, the spiro-OMeTAD-based PSC performance decreased to 25% of its initial value within 60 minutes under AM 1.5G illumination.

Li et al. demonstrated the importance of the interface quality between perovskite and the HTL (spiro-MeOTAD) for the PCE of mesoscopic PSCs. This interface quality was mainly defined by how widely and homogeneously the HTL has been deposited onto the perovskite film surface. The most commonly used surfactant that assists the reduction of the contact angle (CA) between the HTL and the perovskite is TBP. It has been reported that introduction of TBP into HTL causes perovskite fading and corrosion. Motivated by the need of higher quality interfaces that will generate higher Jsc, FF and Voc values, the authors proposed a GO-based interlayer as an alternative surfactant to improve the interface between the perovskite and the HTL. The impact of the proposed GO interlayer is impressive since it (1) decreased the contact angle between the HTL and the perovskite layer (from 13.4° to 0°); and (2) it functioned as an electron blocking layer (it is an insulator), reducing the recombination rate of the device. As a result, the performance of the GO-based PSC was improved by 45.5% mainly due to the enhancement of the short-circuit current density Jsc and FF values, providing PSCs with PCEs up to 14.5% (maximum value of 15.1%). The best results were obtained for an optimal GO concentration of 85 mg L−1 (enough for GO to cover the perovskite film as a buffer layer).
The most widely used solid-state HTL in PSCs is p-type organic small-molecule spiro-OMeTAD. Due to its nitrogen sp3 hybridization, large intermolecular distances are obtained, which result in poor conductivities. This is detrimental to the performance of PSCs. Intense research has been conducted to dope the existing p-type materials (e.g. use of Li-TFSI) or to improve the contact between perovskite and HTM (e.g. use of pyridine derivatives). Although these methods improve the HTL conductivity, they introduce either perovskite absorption degradation (due to the hydroscopic nature of Li TFSI) or are corrosive to perovskite (pyridine derivatives). These side effects are harmful to device stability and new strategies should be employed to introduce new HTLs with a higher conductance without using Li-TFSI and pyridine dopants. Luo et al. proposed the employment of RGO as a stable additive combined with dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD as an efficient HTM for PSCs. The use of the proposed bilayer showed a PCE of 10.6%, which was more than 70% higher than that of dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD HTL-based cells. Moreover, the stability of the bilayer-based HTL device was superior than that of the dopant free spiro-OMeTAD cells; the bilayer device maintained over 85% of its initial PCE value after 500 h in air under dark conditions (the corresponding stability of the dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD cells decreased to 35% of its initial PCE value in the same time). This enhanced stability was attributed to the absence of either Li-TSFI or corrosive pyridine additives. The enhanced performance of the bilayer-based cells were attributed to (1) the higher conductivity of the rGO layer added to the HTL material; rGO conductivity was enhanced not only by the reduction process but also by the iodine ((p-dopant)) doping during the reduction (rGO conductivities as high as 2600 S m−1 were obtained); (2) the high hole quenching ability of the rGO/dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD HTL bilayer when interfaced with the perovskite active layer (MAPbI3); (3) the rGO layer provided better interfaces between the perovskite layer and the HTL and thus better charge extraction; and (4) the introduction of three interfaces through which holes can be extracted and collected in the metallic back electrode: perovskite/rGO, perovskite/dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD and spiro-OMeTAD/rGO interface.
Despite the advantages of spiro-OMeTAD (solution processable, tunability of its energy levels, good energy matching with most commonly used perovskite semiconductors) compared to other inorganic and organic HTMs employed, it suffers from specific drawbacks such as high cost, low hole mobility, and low stability when it is doped in complete cells. All these drawbacks have encouraged the scientific community to search for new potential candidates as low-cost doping-free HTLs for long-term stable operation of PSCs. Palma et al. addressed the challenges of spiro-OMeTAD using rGO as the HTL in mesoscopic PSCs. The built rGO-based devices demonstrated superior long-term stability compared to the doped spiro-OMeTAD reference cells. Specifically, the as-prepared rGO cells exhibited an increase in PCE by more than 30% (from 4.9% to 6.6%) after 1987 h of operation, whereas the PCE of the spiro-OMeTAD cells degraded from its initial value of 11.1% to 6.5%. The stability of all devices tested under the ISOS-D-1 self-life ageing protocol for 138 h (unsealed cells in air under dark conditions and ambient temperature at RH of 50%). The endurance tests showed a PCE degradation of 56% in the reference devices. In contrast, the rGO spray-coated PSCs demonstrated superior stability behavior. The rGO and reference cells were also tested under the ISOS-L-2 stress protocol under light-soaking conditions at 65 °C. In this case, during the first 138 h, the PCE of the reference device dropped over 55%, whereas that of the rGO-based PSCs was degraded by less than 11%. Moreover, under for a total stress time of 1987 h and under light-soaking conditions, the rGO cells showed a PCE enhancement from 4.9% to 6.6%, which was higher than that exhibited by the reference devices during the same test period (PCE ∼ 6.6%). The increase in PCE of the rGO-based cells under light-soaking conditions was attributed to the passivation of the charge traps. In the case of the spiro-OMeTAD cells, the degradation induced by the additives had a stronger impact on the final performance of the PSCs. These results clearly indicated the better lifetime of the rGO-based PSCs than the spiro-OMeTAD-based devices. The authors linked the long-term stability of the rGO-based cells to the following parameters: (1) GO reduction method employed; (2) rGO solvent physico-chemical properties (which might corrode the perovskite layer); (3) rGO deposition technique (spray coating was preferred over spin coating); and (4) presence of additives in the rGO HTL, which are necessary for the doping of spiro-OMeTAD and led to cell degradation.
Many of the instabilities issues in mesoscopic PSCs originate from the organic transport layer sensitivity in atmospheric conditions (moisture and oxygen). Wang et al. suggested the utilization of a combination of single-walled carbon nanotube/graphene oxide (SWCNT/GO) as an efficient and stable HTL/electron blocking layer in glass/FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2/MAPbI3/HTL/PMMA/Au PSCs. The combination of SWCNT/GO resulted in high conductivity (due to the presence of SWCNTs), low hysteresis, fast hole transportation, and efficient electron blocking (due to the presence of the GO), which led to lower charge recombination rates due to better energy level alignment between the perovskite layer and the HTL, achieving a PCE of 13.3%. This performance represented a PCE enhancement of 303% compared to that observed in free HTL-based reference devices. The spin-coated deposition of the PMAA (thickness of 100 nm) on top of the SWCNT/GO HTL, resulted in a substantial increase in the device lifetime in air (humidity: 70–80%, at room temperature). Particularly, the PCE of the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD-based devices dropped under the aforementioned conditions from 10.5% to 5.8% within ten days. In contrast, the SWCNT/GO/PMMA cells maintained almost constant PCE, from 10.5% (within 5% variation) to 10.0%.
P3HT doped with TBP and Li-TSFI has been recently proposed as an inexpensive HTL alternative for spiro-OMeTAD for PSCs. However, doped P3HT devices contributes to lower PCEs than doped spiro-OMeTAD-based devices. Moreover, the doped P3HT layer acts as a shield for the perovskite active layer by protecting it against moisture and thus fast degradation. At the same time, GRM-based HTLs in PSCs have a dual role of PCE and the thermal stability enhancement. Gatti et al. proposed the utilization of rGO chemically functionalized with p-methoxyphenyl (PhOMe) dispersed into the P3HT matrix in solution. The chemical functionalization of the rGO with PhOMe is conducted such that rGO does not aggregate and is uniformly and stably dispersed within the polymer matrix. The best results were achieved for an optimal rGO–PhOMe concentration within the polymer matrix (4%), above which the aggregation of the rGO degraded the performance of the overall device. The PCE of the rGO-PhOMe/P3HT HTL-based MAPbI3 mesoscopic devices increased by more than 15% (PCE increased from 6.5% to almost 10%) compared to that of the reference bare P3HT HTL-based PSCs mainly due to hole transfer facilitation induced to the HTL by the perovskite layer. Moreover, the exploitation of the rGO-PhOMe/P3HT HTL in PSCs is beneficial for PSC stability, since this HTL slows down device degradation due to exposure to environmental factors such as moisture or oxygen. Endurance tests carried out for 3240 h in the dark have shown that the average PCE of the graphene-based HTL cells is 4.7%. In comparison, the bare P3HT HTL-based cells have PCEs almost equal to 0 for the same test period. This improvement was attributed to the fact that rGO–PhOMe provided a more hydrophobic protective layer with the respect of the pristine polymer.
Ye et al. proposed a composite of P3HT:F-graphene (functional graphene) (4% graphene) as a high-performance HTL for mesoscopic PSCs based on the advantages of P3HT over spiro-OMeTAD (low cost, easier processing) and disadvantages (low hole mobility). Under storage in ambient conditions (25 °C, humidity 20–40%) for eight weeks, the P3HT:F-graphene-based PSCs demonstrated 18% higher PCE (8.05% vs. 13.57%) and superior stability (35% vs. 70% of the pristine polymer) than P3HT-based devices. This prolonged stability under moisture exposure was attributed to the hydrophobicity of the graphene. Moreover, thanks to the higher hole conductivity and better energy level alignment between the VB of P3HT and the VB of the MAPbI3 obtained due to the presence of an optimal concentration (4%) of F-graphene, more efficient charge extraction occurred from the MAPbI3 to the HTL.
In pursuit of higher efficiencies for PSCs, scientists should deal with a deficiency that characterizes all ionic crystals: the defects on their surface and along the grain boundaries due to under-coordinated ions such as I− and Pb2+. The latter operate as recombination centers for photo-generated carriers and thus limit the maximum PCE that can be obtained. Wen et al. proposed a passivation technique that involves balancing the under-coordinated Pb+ with molecules of the opposite charge. More particularly, they showed that the incorporation of amino-functionalized rGO (NGs) as an interlayer between the MAPbI3 absorber and the spiro-OMeTAD HTL could passivate the under-coordinated Pb2+. As a result of the passivation effect by the amino group (the N atoms interact with the under-coordinated Pb2+ atoms) and the high hole mobilities of the rGO, mesoscopic NG-based PSCs exhibited higher photovoltaic performance (ΔPCE: 36%) compared to the reference (without NG interlayer) devices. The PCE advancement, from 10.7% to 14.6%, was mainly attributed to Jsc and FF enhancements. Moreover, EIS and PL measurements indicated the lower recombination rates and the better hole extraction kinetics for the NG-based cells was in agreement with their superior photovoltaic performance.
One of the most recently proposed HTL materials that tackles the limitations spiro-OMeTAD is solution-processed copper phthalocyanine (CuBuPc). CuBuPc-based PSCs do not exhibit higher photovoltaic performances but demonstrated higher stability and are have a lower cost than spiro-OMeTAD cells. Nouri et al. studied the exploitation of CuBuPc and GO as the HTL/buffer-layer system for mesoscopic PSCs. These PSCs showed enhanced PCEs than reference devices (7.3%, spiro-OMeTAD), of the order of 14.4%. This enhancement was mainly attributed to the higher values of Voc and FF, which were a clear indication of blocking of (the presence of the buffer layer) shunt paths (due to aggregation of CuBuPc) across the cell. EIS and PL measurements showed that the GO buffer layer also facilitated the transportation of photo-generated holes from perovskite to the HTL and thus reduced the charge carrier recombination. The stability of the device also improved due to the hydrophobicity and water repelling capacity of GO.
The fabrication of PSCs with efficiencies higher than 20% using inorganic and thermally and chemically stable low-cost HTL materials remains a key goal to foster the large-scale deployment of this 3rd-generation solar cell technology. Among the proposals reported, the one using CuSCN looks to be the most promising since this material has very attractive features such as (1) low cost; (2) p-type conductivity; and (3) well-aligned VB with a majority of perovskite semiconductors employed in solar cells nowadays. However, a critical issue associated with the use of this material is that its solvents degrade the perovskite layer quickly. This issue has been moderately tackled using inverted planar architecture. Arora et al. used mesoscopic TiO2-based devices with planar normal architecture and drop casted them uniformly on thin and pinhole-free CuSCN layer (thickness of ∼60 nm) that fully covered the below CsFAMAPbI3−xBrx perovskite layer without degrading the latter's quality (because of the dynamic deposition approach selected). Initially, the thin layer of CuSCN was between the perovskite and the gold electrode. The higher hole extraction rates achieved using the CuSCN HTL than using the HTL-free perovskite cells revealed the occurrence of PL quenching in the CuSCN-based PSCs. Moreover, time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) spectroscopy allowed the calculation of the dynamics of the charge carriers. In agreement with steady-state PL, the hole transfer was faster across the perovskite–CuSCN interface than that observed across the perovskite–spiro-OMeTAD junction. The device with the CuSCN HTL and the rGO as the interlayer yielded a Jsc of 23.24 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.11 V and FF of 0.78. These photovoltaic parameters resulted in a PCE of 20.4% (see Fig. 10a–e). The long-term thermal stability at high temperatures is an imperative feature. The CuSCN-based devices showed poor photo-stability, losing >50% of their initial PCE within merely 24 hours due to an electrical reaction between gold and thiocyanate anions forming an undesired barrier. The incorporation of the rGO interlayer between the CuSCN and the gold electrodes substantially improved the photo-stability of the PSCs. The resulting PSCs retained >95% of their initial efficiency after aging for 1000 h (see Fig. 10f).

GRMs tackle some of problematic characteristics of PEDOT:PSS, the most commonly used HTL material, such as hydrophilicity that permits the infiltration of water into the active layer of the cells and thus the photovoltaic performance degradation of the cell. Kim et al. proposed the use of solution-processed nitrogen-doped graphene oxide nanoribbons (NGONRs) as an alternative to PEDOT:PSS as an HTL in planar inverted PSCs (FTO/NGONR/MAPbI3/ZnO NPs/Al). The NGONR-based cells demonstrated a 19% higher PCE than PEDOT:PSS cells (from 10.86 to 12.94%). This higher efficiency was attributed to higher Jsc and Voc values and higher transparency of the NGONR devices compared to the PEDOT:PSS devices. The impact of using NGONRs was multi-fold since they provided a better and more uniform MAPbI3 film, better energy level matching between the VB and the CB of the MAPbI3 semiconductor (NGONR energy level tuning was controlled by the doping level), efficient and fast transportation of holes from the active layer to the HTL (average PL decay rate was reduced from 83 ns to 22 ns), low hysteresis and prolonged cell stability under room temperature and humidity conditions.

Wu et al. investigated the application of GO as the HTL in planar inverted PSCs and studied its impact on the various photovoltaic characteristics, such as performance and stability, of PSCs when GO replaced PEDOT:PSS. GO was utilized as the HTL in mixed halide perovskite solar cells due to its ideal characteristics: (1) suitable work function (−4.9 eV) that formulates ideal energy level alignment with the energy levels of the mixed halide perovskite semiconductor; (2) acceptable vertical resistivity; and (3) surface doping effect on the active layer. All these GO characteristics facilitated superior charge transfer and charge collection of the PSCs (ITO/GO/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PCBM/ZnO/Al) incorporated with graphene-based HTLs compared to that of the PEDOT:PSS reference devices. The authors showed that the thickness of the spin-coated GO layer on ITO strongly affected the charge transfer (as revealed by PL measurements) from the active layer to the HTL. Their study concluded that the thicker the GO HTL (2 nm-, 6 nm- and 20 nm-thick HTLs were tested), the stronger was the steady PL quenching observed. The 2 nm-thick GO layer displayed similar quenching to the TiO2 layer (∼48%), whereas the 20 nm-thick GO layer displayed a slightly superior quenching (∼98%) than PEDOT:PSS-based cells. The higher charge extraction between GO and perovskite with thicker GO HTLs was attributed to the larger coverage ratio and higher roughness between perovskite and GO. Motivated by the high charge extraction demonstrated between the GO layer and perovskite semiconductor, a number of complete PSCs were fabricated. The best results were achieved for the cell using the thinnest GO layer (∼2 nm thickness). The PCE was enhanced (from 9.26% to 12.4%) by almost 20% compared to that of the control device based on the PEDOT:PSS HTL. Despite the higher quenching, the thicker GO layer lowered the absorption of the active layer and thus reduced the device PCE. Moreover, the thicker GO layer increased the series resistance of the device. The superior performance of the cells incorporated with ultrathin GO HTLs was also attributed to the more balanced charge mobilities provided between electrons and holes, which prohibited the charge accumulation and contributed to the enhancement of the device PCE (higher FF values). GO also induced the fast growth of large grain domain size and of higher orientation order, perovskite crystals (of micron sized) that also contributed to the obtained promising results. The less porosity of the perovskite film when spin coated on the GO HTL instead of PEDOT:PSS was the primary reason for the lower dark currents of the GO devices exhibited and its superior performance compared to the PEDOT:PSS devices. Also, the higher roughness of the perovskite film on the GO HTL compared to the PEDOT:PSS HTL layer provided more efficient light trapping in a complete device employing the GO HTL as an active layer.
Unlike the intense research used to find new ETL materials with superior properties (conductivity, rapid electron transportation from the perovskite layer, easy deposition techniques, low temperature processing, and thickness controllability) for PSCs, less effort has been devoted for the development of new and innovative HTL materials. The most popular HTL is PEDOT:PSS, which is accompanied with well-known disadvantages: hygroscopicity and acidity. These disadvantages are detrimental for the long-term stability of PSCs. Other alternative HTL materials have been proposed (e.g. nickel oxides, GO) but most demonstrate high-temperature processing, which nullifies the solution processing. Yeo et al. presented the application of solution-processed rGO as an ultrathin (3 nm) HTL in planar PSCs employing MAPbI3 as the absorber. rGO demonstrate all characteristics of an ideal HTL: low-temperature processing, conductivity, abundance, stability and higher work function than conventional PEDOT:PSS. The PSCs employing rGO HTLs exhibited a higher PCE (PCE ∼ 10.8%, Voc = 0.95 V, Jsc = 14.81 mA cm−2, FF = 71.13%) and superior stability than similar reference devices employing PEDOT:PSS (PCE ∼ 9.14%, Voc = 0.92 V, Jsc = 13.65 mA cm−2, FF = 69.97%) or GO (PCE ∼ 4.04%, Voc = 0.89 V, Jsc = 10.70 mA cm−2, FF = 37.61%) as the HTL. The better energy level matching between rGO and MAPbI3 compared to that between PEDOT:PSS and MAPbI3 was one of reasons for the better PCE. This more suitable energy level matching generated fewer losses and facilitated charge transfer across the interface of perovskite layer/HTL, generating a higher PCE. The steady-state PL quenching was also a figure of merit to demonstrate the better charge transfer from the MAPbI3 absorber through the selected HTL; a higher quenching was reported when rGO was used as the HTL. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements also suggested that using rGO led to faster charge extraction and reduced recombination compared to using PEDOT:PSS. The better ability of rGO to convert the incoming photons to current than that of PEDOT:PSS was confirmed by the higher EQE and IQE curves of the former. To further show the impact of rGO on MAPbI3 morphology, the SEM images sizes were obtained; these images showed that longer perovskite grains were observed using rGO devices (100–200 nm) than that achieved using PEDOT:PSS (<100 nm). Also, the XRD spectra revealed better crystallinity of MAPbI3 when processed on rGO than on PEDOT:PSS (narrower FWHM of the 110 XRD peak). To further emphasize the advantages of selecting rGO over PEDOT:PSS the PSC stability was evaluated under ambient operational conditions. The rGO-based PSCs retained 62% of their initial PCE even after 140 h of continuous illumination, whereas the PEDOT:PSS cells fully degraded within this duration. This was because the rGO shielded the perovskite absorber against oxygen and moisture due to its passivation ability against these elements.
Recently, there has been an increased focus on flexible perovskite solar cells. In line with this effort, researchers are looking for new, low-temperature (below 120 °C), and solution-processed materials to be employed as HTLs, ETLs, electrodes and deposition substrates in flexible PSCs. Until recently, the main drawback of existing efforts was the poor performance of these flexible cells mainly due to charge recombination and structural or chemical defects in the perovskite films. Liu et al. reported the application of a new composite low-temperature processed HTL, PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO, in flexible PSCs by exploiting the exceptional electronic, optical, thermal and mechanical properties of graphene oxide (GO) and the facile tuning of GO WF using silver trifluoromethanesulfonate (AgOTf) dopants to achieve GO p-doping. The dopant concentration in GO fully controlled the electrical (Rs, conductivity), physical (WF, transmittance), and morphological (roughness, thickness) properties of the low-temperature processed HTL. The incorporation of the PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO HTL allowed the device to be fabricated at temperatures less than 120 °C. The devices were deposited on a rigid (glass/ITO) or on flexible substrates (PET/ITO or PET/AZO/Ag/AZO) and exhibited competitive PCEs: 11.9%, 9.67% and 7.97%, respectively. The high performance of the PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO-based PSCs was attributed to (1) the better energy level alignment between the HTL (WF ∼ −4.6 eV) and the perovskite absorber (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, VB ∼ −5.3 eV), which allowed easy hole transportation and greater electron blocking and (2) the lower Rs of the HTL compared to that of PEDOT:PSS due to GO p-doping, from 228 Ω sq−1 (before GO doping) to 118 Ω sq−1 (after GO doping). This lowering of Rs facilitated faster transportation of holes through the HTL, lower charge recombination and thus more efficient charge collection. The ITO-free PSCs, especially the device on PET/AZO/Ag/AZO, demonstrated exceptional mechanical properties: the PCE degraded by only 1.26% after 2000 bending cycles. This small degradation in PCE was mainly due to reduced FF.
Pristine PEDOT:PSS suffers from micromorphological inhomogeneities and chemical instability and demonstrates electrical conductivity gradients moving from the exterior to the interior. All these issues should be tackled since PEDOT:PSS is one of the most commonly used HTL in PSCs with planar inverted architecture. Huang et al. proposed the addition of a thermally reduced single-layer rGO on PEDOT:PSS. The employment of the proposed composite led to devices based on MAPbI3 absorber to show a 22.1% superior PCE compared to the reference PEDOT:PSS planar inverted PSCs. The performance of the rGO/PEDOT:PSS HTL devices was optimized as a function of rGO concentration used in the HTL. The best results were obtained when 1:1 v/v rGO to PEDOT:PSS was dispersed (the PCE jumped from 8.7 to 10.6%). The higher PCEs were attributed to the lower dark currents and higher shunt resistance of the rGO/PEDOT:PSS-based devices. These improved electrical characteristics increased the Voc and FF values compared to those of the reference device. According to UV/visible absorption, AFM and XRD measurements, the addition of rGO did not impact the transmission, roughness and crystallization of ITO/PEDOT:PSS and MAPbI3.
The planar architecture PSCs are free of the complexities of the mesoscopic design, for example, the high processing temperatures requested for the crystallization of TiO2 or the low temperature instabilities of the Al2O3 scaffolds. One strategy to improve the planar PSC PCE is the engineering of the electronic, morphological and stability properties of the charge transfer layers. To tackle this issue, engineering innovative interlayers is an intelligent solution for high-efficiency PSCs. Even though the incorporation of GO films as an interlayer between the perovskite absorber and the HTL contribute to the enhancement of the planar architecture PSCs’ PCE, the difficulty of homogeneously depositing them onto the ITO should be overcome. Feng et al. demonstrated the introduction of a spin-coated ammonia-modified graphene oxide (GO:NH3) interlayer between the HTL (PEDOT:PSS) and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx in a planar inverted PSC. The incorporation of the GO:NH3 interlayer (the best results were achieved for a GO:NH3 ratio of 1:0.3) enhanced the PCE compared to that of the reference devices (without GO:NH3) from 12.11% to 16.1%. The authors’ proposal combined the high conductivity of PEDOT:PSS and GO and the stability provided by GO:NH3 against moisture. The PCE improved by 33% (all photovoltaic parameters increased) and was attributed partially to the improved crystallization (longer grain size) and preferred in-plane orientation of the perovskite crystals, partially to the nearly coverage of PEDOT:PSS, partially to the improved absorption (in the range of 360 to 640 nm) due to the inclusion of the GO:NH3 interlayer, partially to the improved stability under ambient conditions (after 96 h of testing, the PEDOT:PSS–GO:NH3 cell PCE degraded by 28%, whereas the PEDOT:PSS control device PCE reduced to 65.6% of its initial value) and partially to the better energy alignment between PEDOT:PSS and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (the WF of PEDOT:PSS–GO:NH3 increased from 5.1 to 5.37 eV due to the adsorption of N on GO, and the VB energy of the perovskite absorber was 5.4 eV). The GO–NH3-based devices exhibited the lower hysteresis than the control devices. This was related to the improved perovskite crystallization, preferred orientation, morphological changes and better energy alignment at the perovskite interface.
Despite the impressive physical and electrical properties and PCEs of PSCs, there are still some issues mainly related to their stability that limit their commercialization. Scientific reports and publications have revealed that the interface between the perovskite layer and the transport layers can define the stability and performance of PSCs. Giuri et al. proposed an alternative HTL obtained from a nanocomposite of PEDOT:PSS and UV-reduced GO. The proposed buffer layer employed in planar inverted MAPbI3 PSCs was responsible for a high PCE improvement of 240%; the PCE increased from 2.17% to 7.39%. Moreover, the thermal stability of the HTL at temperatures above 250 °C, the wettability of the perovskite precursor on the PEDOT:PSS/rGO HTL, the morphology of MAPbI3, and the charge transfer through the interface of the perovskite layer and HTL improved compared to those of the PEDOT:PSS reference devices. The PCE enhancement was attributed to these improvements and is reflected in higher Voc and FF values compared to those of the PEDOT:PSS cells. The only PV parameter that decreased was Jsc due to the higher Rs of the PEDOT:PSS/rGO HTL compared to PEDOT:PSS; after the addition of the GO, the Rs of PEDOT:PSS increased from 100 Ω sq−1 to 5 kΩ sq−1. However, this ‘side’ effect did not affect the enhancement of the overall PCE of the PEDOT:PSS/rGO cells.
Lee et al. proposed the use of a composite of GO/PEDOT:PSS as the HTL in planar inverted PSCs. The suggested composite could overcome the drawbacks of a single-layer GO and conventional PEDOT:PSS. The GO/PEDOT:PSS HTL-based MAPbI3 PSCs demonstrated higher EQE than PEDOT:PSS-based MAPbI3 cells. This enhancement was attributed to several parameters such as (1) better alignment of energy levels of the HTL and the perovskite active layer, which led to superior electron blocking capabilities; (2) to the planarization and pinhole-free HTLs; and (3) to the lower and higher sheet and shunt resistance. As a result, the PCE of the GO/PEDOT:PSS HTL-based MAPbI3 cells increased by 18.34% (from 8.23% to 9.74%), mainly due to the enhancement in Jsc. Moreover, the addition of GO on the HTL prevents the diffusion of ITO with highly acidic PEDOT:PSS. As a result, under atmospheric conditions, (temperature of 21–24 °C and humidity of 38–55%), the stability of the GO/PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs was further increased compared to those of the PEDOT:PSS based cells.
PEDOT:PSS is the main HTL material used in planar inverted PSCs due to its good film forming property, excellent transparency in the visible and near-infrared regions and good conductivity. The drawbacks of PEDOT:PSS when employed in PSCs is well documented, such as its acidic character and inefficient electron blocking capability. To overcome these disadvantages, some reports have introduced new materials (such as V2O5, NiOx, CuSCN) to replace PEDOT:PSS. Other publications have proposed the use of composite as HTL materials combining PEDOT:PSS with innovative materials such as GRMs. Li et al. studied the performance of GO/PEDOT:PSS hybrid bilayer as an HTL for MAPbI3-based planar inverted PSCs. The GO modification strategy took advantage of the high conductivity of PEDOT:PSS and electron-blocking (due to its high LUMO level, −1.6 eV, compared to the CB of MAPbI3 at −3.9 eV) and hole transfer facilitator capabilities of GO. The suppression of the leakage current, reduced recombination rate due to the improved hole extraction, higher absorption at around 750–790 nm, and better MAPbI3 morphology resulted in 30% improvement in PCE (from 10% to 13.1%) compared to that of the control device. One of the main findings of this research was that as the GO thickness increased, the solar cell PCE decreased. This was attributed to the lower transparency and conductivity provided by thicker GO layers. The best PCE results were obtained for an ultrathin film of GO (∼2 nm). The major contribution to the enhancement of PCE was attributed to the increased Voc and FF values compared to those of the reference device.
GRMs have started been investigated quiet intensively as efficient and stable HTLs in PSCs under ambient and illumination conditions. Particularly, GRMs overcome some of issues of the most commonly used HTLs, such as hydrophilicity that allows infiltration of water into the perovskite active layer of the devices, thus causing fast degradation of the PSCs. Chen et al. justified that the water diffusion into PSCs can be overcome using advanced interface engineering. The authors proposed the use of solution processed oxo-functionalized graphene (oxo-G1) instead of hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS as the HTL for PSCs. The resulting planar inverted PSCs exhibited PCEs up to 15.2% and an enhanced operational lifetime under dark and light-soaking conditions. Unsealed PSCs retained 80% of their initial PCE after 500 h of white-light illumination and approximately 60% of the initial PCE after ∼1000 h operation under ambient conditions. On the contrary, PEDOT:PSS cells retained only 5% of their initial PCE after 50 h of white-light illumination. Additionally, the oxo-G1 HTL-based PSCs retained 92% of their initial PCE after 1900 h operation under dark conditions at ambient conditions. The superior lifetime of the oxo-G1 HTL-based PSCs compared to PEDOT:PSS PSCs was attributed to its hydrophobic character and potential better moisture barrier properties.
Giuri et al. demonstrated the synergistic effect of GO and glucose in improving the surface and electrical properties of PEDOT:PSS. The improved photovoltaic performance of the graphene-based device was attributed to (a) the insulating properties of glucose, which change the surface wettability and induce the homogeneous deposition of the upper PEDOT:PSS layer, and (b) the presence of reduced GO sheets, which restores and improves the electrical conductivity of the film. The hybrid GGO–PEDOT nanocomposite resulted in outstanding Voc values, minimizing recombination losses, increased hole selectivity, and reduced trap density for the PEDOT:PSS along with optimal MAPbI3 coverage. All the improvements were reflected by the higher PCE of the graphene-based device than the reference (37% higher PCE).
Planar PSCs demonstrated several advantages compared to mesoscopic ones: simpler architecture, low-temperature processing (below 150 °C), solution processability and compatibility with printing electronics protocols. The primary characteristics of the HTL should be (1) high hole mobility; (2) compatible HOMO energy alignment with the VB of the perovskite active layer; (3) sufficient solubility and film formation properties; (4) high transparency; and (5) low cost. Jokar et al. proposed testing rGO nanosheets as candidate HTLs in planar inverted PSCs (ITO/rGO/MAPbI3/PCBM/Ag) using three different reagents (hydrazine (rGO-NH), sodium borohydrine (rGO-BH) and hydrazine benzenesulfonic (rGO-HBS)). The proposed HTL did not show the drawbacks of PEDOT:PSS drawbacks (electrical inhomogeneity, high acidity and hygroscopic properties). This work clearly demonstrated the importance of the reduction reagent to the overall performance of the PSCs. The authors very clearly demonstrated that the reduction reagent strongly affected (1) the charge transfer from the perovskite layer to the HTL; (2) the stability of the device; and (3) the homogeneity of the HTL coverage on the ITO. The device showing the best performance was the rGO-HBS-based one with a PCE close to 16.4% (ΔPCE ∼ 11% compared to PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs) when deposited on ITO (see Fig. 11a) and a PCE close to 13.8% when deposited on a flexible PEN substrate (see Fig. 11c and d) using rGO-NH-based cells that retained 70% of the original device performance after continuous bending for more than 150 cycles (see Fig. 11e and f). The superior performance of the rGO-based devices was reflected by the greater Jsc and Voc values compared with those of the PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs. The rGO-HBS based unencapsulated PSCs demonstrated the higher enduring stability under operating conditions and under 30% humidity and 25 °C; the rGO-HBS-based PSCs retained half of their initial performance after 1000 h of operation, whereas the PEDOT:PSS cells degraded rapidly after 650 h (see Fig. 11b).
The HTL building block in p-i-n PSCs (planar inverted) (1) crucially affects the morphology and crystallization of the top-deposited perovskite film; (2) regulates the transmission of the solar irradiation incident on the active layer; (3) determines the electronic properties (i.e. hole charge extraction from the perovskite layer to the HTL) at the HTL/perovskite interface; and (4) affects the stability of the device (i.e. can filter the harmful for the perovskites UV light and operate as a shielding against the moisture for perovskite). Yang et al. proposed thermally rGO as one of the most promising materials for planar inverted PSCs. rGO is simply fabricated, is highly transparent and is hydrophobic, has high electron and hole mobilities, and adopts low cost fabrication and deposition techniques. Key elements for the success of rGO are the optimization of its thickness in order to balance the WF and its conductivity properties. The application of rGO as the HTL results in high performance, PCEs > 16%, and ultra-stable planar inverted PSCs. The higher PCE is attributed to the higher charge extraction rate from the perovskite active layer to the HTL (PL, TRPL measurements). Further, the higher long-term stability and reduced light-soaking effects compared to PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs are attributed to the improved morphology and crystallization induced by GO to the top-deposited perovskite active layer. Particularly encapsulated cells under steady-state operation in ambient conditions are characterized to examine their PCE. The PCE of the PEDOT:PSS cells decreased by 40% after 1400 h. In comparison, the performance of the rGO cells remained intact (a 10% drop) even after 2000 h.
However, there are still few obstacles to be overcome for the commercialization of PSCs: (1) lower the cost of the overall device by moving from metal electrodes to carbon tape electrodes and (2) enhance the stability of these devices under operational conditions in ambient atmosphere. Ahmad et al. addressed the aforementioned priorities by using GO as the HTL in order to prolong the stability of PSCs and by employing low cost and facilely deposited carbon-based tape as the cathode electrode instead of high-cost metal contacts (Ag/Au) or (ZnO/Au). The authors applied their ideas to planar inverted PSCs (ITO/GO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3/PCBM/carbon tape) and concluded that the incorporation of the GO layer induced a photovoltaic performance enhancement of 147% in the device compared to that of the pristine device (GO free) (the PCE enhanced from 2.1% to 5.2%). This enhancement was attributed to several factors: (1) better energy alignment between the active layer and the HTL; (2) higher hole mobility and higher electron blocking characteristics of the HTL; (3) superior morphology (homogeneous deposition, lower roughness) induced to the top-deposited MAPbI3 layer; and (4) better perovskite crystallization that resulted in larger perovskite crystal grain size. Moreover, the use of GO of optimal thickness prolonged the stability of the device mainly due to the isolation of the MAPbI3 crystal from the acidic and hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS. XRD measurements revealed that the optimization of the GO thickness was due to the interaction between the MAPbI3 and the PEDOT:PSS. This interaction led to MAPbI3 decomposition after 96 h of storage under atmospheric conditions.
The PSCs are facing air and thermal stability issues, which degrade their performance and limit their commercialization despite their outstanding physical, optical and mechanical characteristics. This makes the stability issues of the PSCs an open challenge that needs to be addressed urgently. Hu et al. showed the possibility of using 2D materials as effective blocking layers for the manufacturing of ultra-stable PSCs. Particularly, the authors proposed the insertion of a single-layer CVD graphene film between the HTL and the top metal electrode in order to slow down the degradation of a normal planar PSCs due to thermal stress (resulting from perovskite active layer decomposition or the migration of metal atoms from the top electrode to the perovskite layer) and moisture ingress (see Fig. 11g). The CVD graphene layer contributed to the enhancement of the air and thermal stability of PSCs due to its hydrophobic nature, high impermeability even to the smallest molecules, metal blocking capabilities and excellent electrical properties. The insertion of the graphene layer between the top metal electrode and the HTL had a much stronger impact on the air and thermal stability of the PSCs than on its PCE. The latter remained almost unchanged (graphene-based PSCs demonstrated a PCE of ∼15.7%, whereas graphene-free cells exhibited a PCE of ∼16.6%) (see Fig. 11h) after its exposure to ambient environment with 45% humidity; in contrast, the air and thermal stability of the graphene-based cells increased substantially compared to the corresponding figures of the graphene-free cells. The air stability of non-encapsulated graphene-based PSCs remained almost intact under ambient conditions (45% humidity) since they retained 95% of their initial PCE after 96 h of exposure. On the other hand, similar graphene-free PSCs degraded to 57% of their initial PCE values during the same period (see Fig. 11i). This evident degradation was due to CH3NH3PbI3 decomposition due to moisture filtration. Moreover, the thermal stability of the graphene-based devices was superior than that of the reference cells. The former retained 96% of its initial PCE after annealing at 80 °C in a glovebox for 12 h, whereas the latter showed a PCE degradation of 54% under the same thermal treatment. This degradation was mainly attributed to Au metal diffusion into the perovskite from the top electrode. This diffusion formulated shunts across the device, reducing all of its photovoltaic parameters after annealing (see Fig. 11j and k).
Guo et al. demonstrated the use of a composite HTL fabricated by PEDOT:PSS and solution-processed sulphonated GO (sGO). The fabricated planar inverted MAPbI3 PSCs exhibited superior efficiencies than PEDOT:PSS cells (improvement of more than 20%; the PCE improved from 11.5% to 13.9%). The observed enhancement was attributed to many parameters: (1) lower Rs of sGO compared to that of the insulating GO films; (2) higher hole extraction from the perovskite active layer; (3) higher transmittance of the sGO/PEDOT:PSS composite characterized by 1:1 concentration ratio; (4) improved wettability of PEDOT:PSS due to incorporation of sGO, which allowed a more uniform deposition onto ITO-coated glass; (5) more uniform deposition and thus better electrical contact of the perovskite layer and the HTL; and (6) larger perovskite grain sizes. Moreover, the improved PCE by employing the sGO/PEDOT:PSS composite at optimal volume concentration reduced hysteresis in these devices, from 17.4% to 6.5% deviation (reverse scan compared to the forward scan).
One of the objectives of research on hybrid PSCs is to achieve the theoretical limit values of open-circuit voltage (1.32 V). Until now, most output voltages have remained lesser than ∼1.2 V. Improvement in the interfaces between the perovskite active layer and the charge transporting layers is a key strategy to achieve this objective. It has been reported that the main contributor to energy loss in metal halide PSCs is the recombination of charge carriers due to trap states at grain boundaries and surfaces as well as point defects such as interstitial defects or vacancies in the perovskite crystal lattice. To reduce the charge carrier recombination, surface modification has become one of the most powerful tools to minimize the losses and thus increase the Voc without sacrificing Jsc and FF in PSCs. Li et al. utilized a functionalized rGO with a small molecule, 4-fluorophenyl-hydrazine hydrochloride (4FPH), as the interfacial layer in order to passivate the traps (e.g. under-coordinated Pb ions and Pb clusters) on the surface and at the boundaries of MAPbI3−xClx. Their findings pointed out that the Voc losses could be considerably reduced via passivation of the under-coordinated Pb-ion traps. The addition of the 4FPH molecule had no effect on the formation of perovskite and the following HTLs (spiro-OMeTAD). The trap passivation benefited faster charge extraction from the perovskite to the HTL. This clear indication of the rGO-4FPH better-induced interface engineering was reflected by the substantial enhancement in Voc (increased from 1.03 to 1.11 V) compared to that of rGO-4FPH-free PSCs. A PCE enhancement of 20.34% for the rGO-4FPH-based cells compare to the PCE of the control devices (the highest PCE is 18.75%) was mainly attributed to the higher Voc values (by 7.76% mainly due to trap passivation), higher Jsc values (increase by 6.9%, mainly due to faster extraction rates) and higher FF values (increase by 4.7%, more efficient collection). Moreover, the inclusion of the rGO-4FPH interlayer showed that the trap passivation could also slow down the light-activated degradation; the rGO-4FPH-based cells showed higher stability when stored under constant 1 sun illumination in a N2 filled glove box.
The significant improvements in the PCEs of PSCs should be accompanied by an additional achievement with respect to the environmental stability of these devices. One way to meet this objective is through the construction of charge transport layers (otherwise known as interfacial layers) that minimize charge recombination rates and facilitate their collection in the respective electrodes. These materials should have high transparency, high conductivity, charge selectivity, well-matched energy levels with perovskite and chemical stability. Jung et al. explored the advantages of GO and reduced rGO, such as (1) suitable work function (GO, 4.7–4.9 eV); (2) high hole conductivity (rGO) and at the same time tackled their disadvantages such as (1) low charge transport capability (GO); (2) low dispersibility (rGO); and (3) smaller WF (from 4.5 to 4.7 eV). The authors proposed the utilization of a polyacrylonitride (PAN)-grafted rGO hybrid as a stable HTL in high-performance planar MAPbI3 PSCs. The qualities of the proposed HTL such as solution processability, formation of uniform and smoother thin film morphology, good conductivity (0.87 S cm−1), and high WF (4.87 eV) made it more attractive than other interfacial materials (e.g. PEDOT:PSS, chemically converted graphene nanoflakes) and led to higher PCEs (∼9.7%) and lifetimes. Better weather stability of the PRGO HTL-based device than of hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS-based devices was ascribed to its high resistance to moisture.
Zhou et al. proposed the incorporation of a bilayer made of rGO and PTAA as the HTL in planar inverted MAPbI3 PSCs. The tested HTL demonstrated the advantages of both rGO and PTAA: (1) long-term light-soaking stability (rGO); (2) UV filtering ability (rGO); (3) film forming ability (PTAA); (4) hydrophobicity (PTAA); and (5) appropriate energy alignment between the VB of the HTL and the VB of the MAPbI3 absorber. As a result of the aforementioned HTL bilayer characteristics, faster hole extraction rates from the perovskite active layer to the bilayer HTL, superior quality MAPbI3 crystals and better interfacial morphologies were achieved. PSCs fabricated on glass/ITO showed PCEs of 17.2%. Moreover, sealed PSCs exhibited high stability, retaining ∼90% of their initial PCE after 500 h of operation under light-soaking conditions.
Zhang et al. utilized graphene sheet-functional carbon nanotube (graphene:f-CNT) composites as low cost, solution-processed HTLs for planar inverted MAPbI3-based PSCs. As a result of the better MAPbI3 absorber crystallization, the improved interface engineering between the perovskite active layer and the HTL, and the higher hole conductivity caused by the addition of the f-CNTs and the hydrophobic nature of graphene:f-CNTs compared to the PEDOT:PSS-based reference HTL, a 16.5% enhancement in PCE (from 12.7% to 14.8%) and prolonged lifetime were achieved. More precisely, the unencapsulated PSCs with graphene:f-CNTs as the HTL, maintained 80% of their initial PCE, whereas the PEDOT:PSS devices completely degraded after 48 h of storage at 35 °C and 20% humidity.
Yu et al. showed a highly efficient and stable inverted PSC by introducing a PEDOT:GO composite film as the HTL. The inverted PSCs with an optimal PEDOT:GO composite film exhibited a maximum PCE of 18.09%, which is by 21% higher than that of the pristine PEDOT:PSS-based device. The high PCE of the graphene-based device was attributed to (a) the superior properties of the PEDOT:GO composite film; (b) higher optical transmittance; (c) superior electrical conductivity and higher work function; (d) longer perovskite grain size and (e) suppressed leakage current. The higher PCE was also due to the improved carrier extraction and Voc of the device. The authors highlighted the enhanced long-term stability of the PEDOT:GO PSCs compared to the reference devices.
In summary, the incorporation of graphene-based HTLs vastly contributed to the improvement in the performance of mesoscopic and planar PSCs. In particular, controlling the graphene HTL's thickness can balance (1) the electron and hole mobilities within the device, thus boosting the device performance (by reducing the recombination rate) and (2) the hole transfer from the perovskite active layer to the HTL (revealed by the level of PL quenching). Also, in the case of planar inverted architecture, the graphene-based HTLs facilitated faster and better crystallization of the perovskite crystals (larger crystal domains and more uniform and larger coverage ratio of the perovskite film) compared to that obtained using PEDOT:PSS HTLs. In addition, when the graphene-based HTL is employed, the enhanced roughness of the perovskite film on GO resulted in more efficient light trapping than that achieved by employing PEDOT:PSS HTLs. Furthermore, GO or rGO could be utilized as an interlayer between the perovskite semiconductor and the HTL or the HTL and the metal electrode, improving the interfaces and leading to higher PCEs and prolonged operational lifetime for these PSCs due to the protection against moisture and water molecules provided by graphene to the perovskite active layer.

Morphology, grain size and thickness of the employed perovskite semiconductor films are key factors that contribute to high PCEs. The control of the nucleation and crystallization rates and the passivation of the charge trap states of the perovskites and corresponding grain boundaries are strategies for achieving high PCEs. Table 4 summarizes the reported results regarding the utilization of GRMs into the perovskite layer of mesoscopic and planar PSCs.

Hadadian et al. suggested the incorporation of a few layers of transparent nitrogen-doped graphene oxide (N-RGO) into mixed metal-halide perovskite absorbers. As a result, the authors reported the increase of the perovskite grain size (due to the slowing down of the crystallization rate by a factor of two, leading to an increase in Jsc and FF) by 150% (see Fig. 12a–e) and the passivation of the perovskite boundary interfaces by the N-RGO (leading to higher Voc, see Fig. 12g–i). The SEM images showed that the longer MAPbI3 grain sizes obtained due to mixing with N-RGO resulted in thinner films (which enhanced the light harvesting compared of that of the reference devices). The resulting PSCs exhibited null hysteresis PCE of 18.7% compared to 17.3% of control device (see Fig. 12f); this increase was caused by the larger grain size of perovskite/N-RGO and hence less grain boundaries.

Minimizing the charge recombination at the surface and in the bulk perovskites’ grain boundaries is the most effective strategy to further increase the PCE of the PSCs. The grain boundary modification at the surface of perovskite can be accomplished by their passivation and by neutralization of dangling bonds at the grain boundaries between perovskite crystals using graphene or fullerene materials between the ETL and the perovskite absorber. Few studies have reported the passivation of the grain boundaries into the bulk of the perovskite. Fang et al. reported the use of GQDs, with diameters of the order of 20 nm, in order to deal with recombination occurring at the grain boundaries of the bulk of perovskites (MAPbI3). The authors not only observed reduction of the recombination rates but also reported facilitation of electron transfer (the extraction time was lowered from 1.09 ns to 0.93 ns) from the perovskite layer to the ETL for GQD-based PSCs. The GQDs dispersed within the perovskite and formed a composite. TEM images revealed that QDs mainly decorated the perovskite crystal's surface. The observed facilitation of electron transfer from the perovskite to the ETL was mainly attributed to the excellent optoelectronic properties of the GQDs (long electron diffusion lengths, fluorescence quantum effect) and the hydrogen bonds established between the GQDs and the MAPbI3 crystal. The maximum efficiency of 17.62% was achieved with 7% GQDs, which corresponds to an 8.2% enhancement with respect to a pure perovskite-based device. Further increase in the concentration of GQDs to the MAPbI3 network degraded the PCE because of GQD agglomeration that operated as charge recombination centers.

Chung et al. proposed the adoption of bulk heterojunction architecture to address the unbalanced mobility of photo-generated carriers within MAPbI3-based PSCs. More specifically, the authors presented a bulk heterojunction setup between MAPbI3 and GO that acted as a hole donor and hole acceptor, respectively. The impact of the mixing of GO with MAPbI3 was multi-fold and advantageous since it (1) enhanced charge mobility; (2) enhanced charge separation; and (3) retarded charge recombination within the perovskite active layer. In summary, the addition of GO within the perovskite layer facilitated the hole extraction rate since it led to more interfaces of MAPbI3/GO under an optimal GO concentration (0.05 mg mL−1). As a result, an approximately 24% increased PCE was reported, with the PCE reaching values higher than 15% (15.2%) in planar inverted PSCs (ITO/GO/MAPbI3:GO/PCBM/Ag) (see Fig. 13a). In the same study, the authors replaced the problematic PEDOT:PSS with GO as the HTL, leading to higher stability (see Fig. 13b and c).

In summary, the incorporation of GRMs in the perovskite active layer have mainly impacted the perovskite crystal size and have more efficiently passivated the interior boundary regions within the perovskite crystal, resulting in faster extraction rates and efficiencies higher than 18%.

Metal halide PSCs have become the latest trend for PV devices and the most promising new technology in academia and industry. Their evolution within just a few years is impressive and faster than that of witnessed for any other solar technology so far. Due to their physical and electrical properties and astounding technical advantages, such as solution processability, compatibility with flexible substrates and abundance of ingredients, they have been considered for applications beyond solar cells, such as sensing and lighting. Despite PSCs’ impressively high efficiencies, they face challenges mainly with respect to their stability and scalability that must be overcome in order to elevate market realization and become an alternative to silicon-based solar cells.

The major challenges PSCs should address in the near future in order to become a mass produced commercial product include (1) further enhancement of their photovoltaic performance and stability; (2) controllable thin film growth and deposition; (3) scalability; (4) toxicity; and (5) cost. Since 2015, most PSCs have exhibited PCEs of the order of slightly higher than 22%. To surpass this value, more efforts need to be taken to improve Voc and FF. One way to achieve this goal is to improve the kinetic dynamics of the transport of the photo-generated carriers by improving the interface structures of various layers in PSCs. In most cases, the reported high PCE refer to lab-scale devices (∼0.1 cm2). The first issue to be emphasized is the need to develop fabrication methods than enable high performance in large-scale perovskite solar modules. The highest reported PCE on this scale (∼100 cm2) is 4.3%. The scientific community should be focused on identifying internal and external degradation mechanisms in this kind of solar cells. The full control and understanding of the crystallization process and of physical parameters affecting this process should be realized in order to build more efficient and reproducible devices. The role of grain boundaries in recombination is still debatable. The development of other deposition techniques such as spray coating should be optimized to build large-area cells with PCEs similar to those of small-area devices. Stability issues originating from water molecule interaction with perovskite, thermal loading management, light soaking and hysteresis should also be tackled. The performance of ITO- or FTO-free PSCs should be optimized. Flexible PSCs should exhibit performances similar to those of rigid substrate-based PSCs. The charge carrier recombination should be tailored. The PCEs of lead-free PSCs should be enhanced so that they are comparable to the PCEs of lead-based PSCs.
Many strategies have been suggested to address these challenges such as the incorporation of hybrid PSCs with metals and up conversion nanoparticles, with other 2D materials and graphene and GRM; the development of dual source evaporation or sequential deposition processes, the selection of appropriate solvents; concentrations and processing additives; and the introduction of anti-solvent approaches.
The inclusion of graphene and GRMs within different building blocks of PSCs is a very promising approach, as revealed by the number and impact of publications and recently published results. This incorporation is one of the most successful approaches to tackle many of the aforementioned PSC challenges. Graphene-based PSCs seem to address all the challenges with respect to the enhancement of their potential for commercialization of this technology. GRMs have played various roles, such as electron/hole transport layers, top contacts and interlayers, within PSC setups. The incorporation of graphene and GRMs, e.g. GO, rGO or functionalized GO, has significant advantages: (1) improves the PSC stability under dark and operational conditions, contributing to the achievement of degradation rates of the order of 0.25–0.5% losses per year; (2) encourages better crystallization, thus leading to preferred orientations, longer crystal grain sizes, and few pinholes on the perovskite crystal at low temperatures; (3) supports more uniform deposition of perovskite films onto graphene-based transport layers (the latter play the role of a deposition substrate for the perovskite absorber); (4) induces sufficient surface coverage of the perovskite film; (5) improves the morphology (less roughness) of the top-deposited perovskite film; (6) enhances the wettability of the materials deposited on the graphene films, either are hole transport or electron transport materials; (7) facilitates charge extraction from the perovskite active layer towards the HTL and ETL building blocks; (8) facilitates faster transfer of holes and electrons when graphene-based interlayers are inserted between the ETL and HTL and the corresponding electrodes, respectively; (9) promotes the charge blocking abilities of the interlayer in which it is incorporated; (10) builds highly conductive, transparent and flexible TCEs; (11) retards or prevents considerable extrinsic degradation elated to metal intrusion into the perovskite at high temperatures, thus contributing to improved stability performance; (12) shields the perovskite from harmful UV or moisture/water; and (13) produces less pronounced hysteresis.
Attaining synergy of graphene and perovskite is challenging but provides highly significant results because it combines the superb properties of the two materials: abundance, low cost, compatibility with low-temperature solution processing and printing techniques, excellent electrical, mechanical and optical properties and large-scale production potential. However, the incorporation of GRMs as a TCE or within the interlayers of PSCs faces some challenges. Many mechanisms are still unclear and thus there is no state-of-the-art PSC designs that meet commercial application standards. The first challenge is to further reduce the extraction times from the perovskite active layer to the ETL compared to the reported hot carrier thermalization extraction times. This is expected to enhance the PSC PCE by reducing recombination rates. A key parameter in this effort may be the enhancement of the demonstrated conductivity of the incorporated GRMs (mainly through its functionalization with atoms of higher electronegativity or with its doping with oxide-coated metal nanoparticles). At the same time, restoring the GO conductivity or its n-doping requires high temperatures that can degrade the perovskite deposited below in the case of inverted PSCs. This means that controlled experiments are necessary in order to address some innovative process protocols. Another important issue to be investigated further is the lowering of the FF value when graphene builds nanocomposites using SrTiO3 as the ETL. The most likely reason for this is the formation of recombination centers but further studies need to be conducted. Since the PCEs of the rGO/TiO2 layer devices are much lower than the highest reported values, further research in needed for the optimization of the atomic layer deposited bl-TiO2 and mp-TiO2 thickness. Future work related to with the impact of GO-based HTLs could be the further study of the HTL thickness regarding hysteresis and light soaking effects. Also, even though all the photovoltaic characteristics of the PSCs were very much affected by the thickness of the employed GO HTL, the Voc remained close to 1 V. The reasoning behind this stable behavior needs to be elaborated further. Another important task that needs more investigation is to identify the physical and chemical properties of the graphene-based HTL that significantly affect the crystallization of the top-deposited perovskite films (particularly in the planar inverted configuration). This is a very crucial task since the morphology and possible interfacial chemical changes of perovskite films and the HTL determine the performance of the PSC. The lower performance of the graphene-based HTLs compared to spiro-OMeTAD and ITO/FTO-free PSCs should motivate future studies towards building efficient top/bottom graphene-based electrode and HTL PSCs. Even though there are reports that state that hysteresis is less obvious in planar inverted graphene-based PSCs (mainly due to the faster charge extraction rates and more balanced mobilities between electrons and holes in graphene-based cells), the physics behind these findings is still unclear and not well supported. More theoretical and experimental work has to be devoted to confirm these findings. Another challenge is the fabrication of large-scale solution-processed graphene-based PSC solar modules with optimal photovoltaic PCE. The fabrication and deposition of solution-processed graphene on a large scale is yet to be achieved. Most previous studies reported the use of GRM-based PSCs MAPbI3 absorber. Almost no research has been conducted on GRM involvement in perovskite semiconductors with energy band gaps between 1.1 and 1.4 eV, which are ideal for harvesting more solar energy. These systems are built by mixing halides or using Sn–Pb compounds and have not reached their Shockley–Queisser limit. This provides considerable scope for graphene and GRMs to be employed and studied. Moreover, little research on GRM-based FAPbI3 systems is available. The latter perovskite absorber have become a major avenue for research because of their high thermal stability and narrow bandgap. One of the most significant issues concerning investors and fabricators is the toxicity of lead used in PSCs. This represents a huge pollution source in the manufacturing and disposal phases. It is expected that considerable emphasis will be placed on lead-free PSCs. This is another opportunity for GRMs to be involved and researched and how the PCEs of this family of PSCs can be improved as a result of their synergy with GRMs. In future, GRM HTLs affect phase stabilization and if they degrade the segregation of perovskites in PSCs should be studied. The contribution of GRMs to the more efficient thermal management of PSCs during testing or operation at temperatures above 60 °C should be studied further. The excellent thermal properties of graphene and its incorporation in the perovskite active layer (e.g. in the form of GQDs) or as transport layers are expected to retard their extrinsic degradation factor. The use of graphene-based electrodes should also eliminate the degradation effect induced at high temperatures with the migration of metal electrode ions into the perovskite active layer. Moreover, the impact of GRMs on the dynamics of lattice deformation and hence halide migration during PSC aging and thermalization has not been extensively studied. It is must be noted that hysteresis and reversible losses contribute to fast and slow device degradation, respectively. A comprehensive study of the impact of GRM-based electrodes on the reversible losses and the accumulation of ions at interfaces of PSCs with different architectures is still lacking.
Universal fabrication protocols for PCE optimization as a function of the thickness of GRM layers are still absent. The processing protocols should be synchronized with in situ characterization techniques such as X-ray scattering and spectroscopy in order to optimize the processes within a PSC, e.g., the kinetic dynamics of the photo-generated carriers as a function of the GRM layer thickness.
The promising prospects of flexible PSCs in high-profile applications such as flexible optoelectronic devices and integrated PVs (BIPVs) have led to a high demand for fabrication of low-temperature semitransparent PSCs. In order to promote the competitiveness of these flexible solar cells, efforts to enhance their PCE should be intensified. New high-performance substrates and low-temperature processed interlayers should be introduced, which will elevate flexible PSC PCE above 15% of the performances that are reported nowadays. Moreover, the performance of large-area (in case of BIPV) PSCs is very much dependent on whether perovskite and the incorporated GRM (in case of GRM-based PSCs) deposition techniques enable controlled growth and deposition of high-quality layers over large areas at a low cost. Regarding graphene, the lowest-cost deposition method, spin coating, is not characterized by the best graphene quality for even small deposition areas. Considerable research is required for improving the low-cost deposition of GRMs over large areas.
GRM-based metal halide PSCs exhibit high efficiencies (>20%), even though there are no certified results yet, low cost (solution processability), reproducibility (hysteresis is less pronounced), and stability (for several days under operational conditions), which are paramount for a new technology to be established. The aforementioned challenges and future perspectives should be addressed with the introduction of more well-defined processing and stability protocols that have a more universal appeal.
