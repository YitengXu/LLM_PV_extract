TiO2 photoelectrodes with channels (or pores) are prepared by using an inorganic salt (NaHCO3) as a template. NaHCO3 doped TiO2 slurries deposited on a compacted TiO2 film are heated at 150 °C, which releases CO2 gas and water vapour, thus forming channels (or pores) inside a TiO2 light-scattering photoelectrode. These channels (pores) improve the penetration degree of solid-state electrolytes into the TiO2 photoelectrode and enhance the photovoltaic efficiency of resulting DSSCs (dye sensitized solar cells). With a channel (pore) size of ∼500 nm diameter, an ionic liquid plastic crystal, 5-azoniaspiro[4.4]nonane bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (N44TFSI), shows power conversion efficiencies of 6.1% and 5.4% under 1.5 solar spectrum illuminations at 50 and 100 mW cm−2, respectively.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted both academic and industrial attention in the past decade due to their high-efficiency, easy fabrication, and relatively low production cost. A typical DSSC is generally composed of a dye-coated mesoporous TiO2 film supported on transparent conducting glass, and a counter electrode separated by an electrolyte. Although a new record in power conversion efficiency of 13% has recently been achieved based on liquid electrolyte, the leakage and volatilization of organic liquid electrolyte still needs to be overcome for the practical application of DSSCs. In order to solve the problems caused by the use of organic liquid electrolytes, alternative electrolytes, including solid-state electrolytes, organic and inorganic hole conductors, polymer gel electrolytes, and p-type semiconductors, have been extensively studied.

Recently, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeded 10% for solid-state DSSCs has been reported. However, efforts to further improve the photovoltaic performance are still necessary. It has been recognized that the complete filling of porous TiO2 films with solid-state electrolyte is a key feature in efforts to enhance the efficiency of such devices. It has been realized that a light-scattering TiO2 film may reduce the light transmittance and enhance the reflectance of TiO2 photoanodes. Therefore, modification of TiO2 photoelectrodes, such as single crystal structures, composite photoelectrodes, etc., have been considered as feasible methods to improve the photoelectrode/electrolyte interfacial properties, and thus increase the photovoltaic performances of DSSCs.
Organic plastic crystals are materials composed of molecules with long-range molecular order and with short-range rotational disorder, which endues these materials with plasticity and high diffusivity properties. Therefore, organic plastic crystals are usually soft and can be easily deformed under an applied force without fracture. These unique properties endow organic plastic crystals with good electrode/electrolyte interfacial contact when they are applied for solid-state electrolytes electrochemical devices.
In order to improve filling of the light-scattering TiO2 film with solid-state electrolyte, herein we report a facile and effective method for the preparation of light-scattering TiO2 film with porous channels (or pores) using a salt template method. An inorganic salt, NaHCO3, was chosen as template salt in this work. Thermal decomposition of NaHCO3 inside the TiO2 light-scattering film generates porous channels (or pores), which boost the penetration of electrolyte (especially solid-state electrolyte) into the porous TiO2 photoelectrode and, therefore, improve the photovoltaic efficiency of the solar cells due to enhanced interfacial contact at the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface. An ionic liquid plastic crystal, 5-azoniaspiro[4.4]nonane bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (N44TFSI) based solid electrolyte interdigitated in a porous TiO2 photoelectrode was used to fabricate solid-state DSSCs, which exhibited power conversion efficiencies of 6.1% and 5.4% under 1.5 solar spectrum illuminations at 50 and 100 mW cm−2, respectively.

Iodine (I2), N-butylbenzimidazole (NBB), tetrahydropyrrole, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and 1,4-dibromobutane were purchased from Alfa Aesar. TiCl4 and H2PtCl6 were bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) was kindly provided by Rhodia. cis-Bis(isothiocyanato)-bis(2,20-bipyridyl-4,40-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) ([RuL2(NCS)2]) was purchased from Solaronix SA (Switzerland) and used as received. Slurries containing 20 nm-sized mesoporous and 200 nm-diameter light-scattering TiO2 colloid and fluorine-doped tin oxide overlayer (FTO) glass (7 Ω sq−1) were obtained from Dalian Hepat Chroma Solar Tech. Co., Ltd.


5-Azoniaspiro[4.4]nonane bromine (N44Br) was synthesized as follows: a mixture containing 4.40 g (6.2 mmol) tetrahydro pyrrole and 13.11 g (12.4 mmol) potassium carbonate was dissolved in 40 mL acetonitrile, in which 13.36 g (6.2 mmol) 1,4-dibromobutane was added dropwise and stirred at 70 °C for 24 h. The precipitate was removed by filtration (see Scheme 1). The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the solid compound was washed with diethyl ether and dry ethyl acetate. The obtained compound was dried at 50 °C under vacuum to give a white solid: N44Br (8.7 g, 68% yield). 1H NMR (D2O): 2.2 (s, 4H), 3.6 (m, 4H).

5-Azoniaspiro[4.4]nonane bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (N44TFSI) was synthesized by stirring a mixture of 1.5 g (5.2 mmol) LiTFSI and 1.07 g (5.2 mmol) N44Br in 50 mL water at room temperature for 4 h. The precipitate was washed by water and then dried at 70 °C under vacuum to give a white solid: N44TFSI (1.91 g, 90% yield). 1H NMR (d6-DMSO): 1.9 (s, 4H), 3.4 (m, 4H).

Plastic crystal solid-state electrolyte was prepared by stirring a mixture containing 20 wt% 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.5 M N-butylbenzimidazole (NBB), 5 wt% lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), and 0.05 M iodine (I2) in N44TFSI at 70 °C for 24 h.


To a slurry (0.4 g) containing 200 nm-diameter TiO2 colloid, 0.012 g, 0.02 g, 0.04 g NaHCO3, respectively, were added. Then 4 mL isopropanol was added to the respective mixtures, and they were stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The isopropanol was removed under vacuum at 35 °C.


A DSC-Q200 was used to characterize the thermal properties of the prepared electrolytes at a scan rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of fabricated devices were conducted on a CHI660c electrochemical workstation in the dark. A bias voltage of −0.80 V was used for the impedance measurement, and the frequency was varied from 0.01 to 105 Hz. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy measurements were performed with the spectrometer attached to the Hitachi Model S-4700 field-emission SEM system.

Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) of the fabricated DSSCs (shielded with an aluminum foil mask with an area of 0.1 cm2) was characterized by a digital source meter (Keithley, model 2612) under simulated air mass (AM) illumination of 1.5 solar spectrum at 100, 50, 15 and mW cm−2, respectively. A source meter (Keithley 1612) was applied to measure the voltage dynamics. The electrolyte conductivities were characterized in a Teflon tube with two identical stainless steel (diameter of 1 cm) as the electrodes. The conductivity was recorded on a CHI660c electrochemical work-station, and calculated by the following equation:
where
R is the ohmic resistance of the electrolyte, σ is the conductivity in S cm−1, S is the area of the electrodes and l is the distance between the two electrodes.


FTO glasses were cleaned with acetone, isopropanol, and deionized water sequentially, and then dried under vacuum at 90 °C. A 10 μm thick film of 20 nm-sized TiO2 particles was firstly coated onto the cleaned FTO glass by the doctor-blade technique. After the coated TiO2 film was annealed at 125 °C, a second 200 nm light-scattering TiO2 particles (10 μm thick) were coated onto the previous TiO2 layer in the same way. The fabricated TiO2 films were annealed at 500 °C. The fabricated photoanodes were immersed in a 0.5 mM Z-907 dye solution in ethanol for 16 h at room temperature. The electrode was then rinsed with anhydrous ethanol and dried. Pt counter electrode was prepared by annealing of 5 mM H2PtCl6 ethanol solution at 400 °C. The working and counter electrodes were assembled by a 25 μm thick hot melt ring (Surlyn, Dupont) and sealed by heating. A methanol solution containing 20 wt% PMII and 80 wt% N44TFSI was injected into the cell using a vacuum backfilling system. Then the methanol was removed under vacuum at 80 °C.


Fig. 1 shows the schematic of representation for light-scattering TiO2 film with porous channels (or pores). Inorganic salt, NaHCO3, was stirred and dispersed in a TiO2 (200 nm in diameter) isopropanol solution. A NaHCO3/TiO2 mixture was deposited on the compacted TiO2 film by the doctor-blade technique. The isopropanol was removed under vacuum at 35 °C and then heated at 150 °C for 2 h. Upon heating, NaHCO3 decomposes with the release of carbon dioxide gas and water vapour. Therefore, the channels were opened inside the TiO2 light-scattering film by escaping carbon dioxide and water bubbles. It is anticipated that the formed channels could improve the penetration degree of the solid-state electrolyte, which therefore enhance the photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs.

The formation of the light-scattering TiO2 film with channels (pores) was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a shows SEM images of the TiO2 film prepared without the addition of NaHCO3. Pores with a diameter of ∼60 nm could be observed from the top surface of the TiO2 film (Fig. 3a). While the channels (pores) with larger size (∼500 nm in diameter) and higher density were observed upon the addition of 5 wt% of NaHCO3 (Fig. 3b), due to the release of carbon dioxide gas and water vapour generated from the decomposition of NaHCO3. Further addition of NaHCO3 (10 wt%) would increase the channels (pores) sizes formed in the light-scattering TiO2 film (∼5 um in diameter, Fig. 3c). The formed pores and channels may increase the filling of the solid-state electrolyte. The elemental mapping of the cross section of the solar cell were further characterized by the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy (Fig. 2). The appearance of N, S elements confirmed the successful penetration of solid-state electrolyte into TiO2 film.

Organic plastic crystals are compounds composed of rotationally disordered organic molecules. They are considered to be one of the best solid-state electrolytes for electrochemical devices, because they could eliminate these leakage problems, provide a good electrolyte/electrode interfacial contact, and provide high ionic conductivity. The ionic liquid plastic crystal, N44TFSI, with two exothermic solid–solid phases at 1.2 °C and 70.2 °C, and a melting point around 115.3 °C (Fig. 4), was synthesized and used for the preparation of solid-state electrolyte. Under the outdoor applications, the temperature might reach 60 °C under full sunlight; such relatively high melting point makes it possible for N44TFSI to be used as a solid-state electrolyte. Previous studies have revealed that proper dopant can drastically increase the conductivity of ionic plastic crystals. Therefore, in this work, PMII was used to dope N44TFSI to form high conductive solid-state electrolytes. The typical thermal analysis traces (Fig. 4a) showed that a second solid–solid phase transition temperature and melting point of N44TFSI were slightly lowered from 71.5 °C to 65.8 °C, and from 115.3 °C to 81.8 °C, respectively, upon addition of 20 wt% PMII. This result suggests that a solid solution of PMII and N44TFSI has been successfully prepared. However, the first solid–solid phase transition temperature of N44TFSI doped with 30 wt% PMII disappeared, indicating that the N44TFSI plastic crystal bulk matrix was completely disrupted, resulting in the absence of a bulk N44TFSI phase. Fig. 4b shows the ionic conductivity over 30–80 °C of N44TFSI doped with 20 wt% PMII electrolytes. It can be seen that the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte increases with the temperature rise. For instance, the conductivity of 20 wt% PMII doped N44TFSI electrolyte at 70 °C (∼3.1 × 10−3 S cm−1) is higher than that at 30 °C (∼3.2 × 10−4 S cm−1). Such a change in conductivity may be due to the free volume changes in the plastic crystal. The doping of PMII has increased the vacancy concentration or volume fraction of the plastic crystal electrolyte. Herein, the TiO2 photoelectrodes with channels (pores) were used for ionic liquid plastic crystal electrolyte DSSCs. The prepared solid-state electrolyte composed of 20 wt% PMII, 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M NBB, 5 wt% LiTFSI in N44TFSI was characterized and used for devices.


The J–V curves of DSSCs based on the TiO2 photoanodes with and without channels (pores) were shown in Fig. 4. The detailed photovoltaic parameters, including short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), open circuit voltage (Voc), as well as power conversion efficiency (PCE) for the fabricated devices are summarized and listed in Table 1. As can be seen that the average efficiency of cell A (control device, without the channels (pores)) is about 4.23%. The efficiency of the (cells B and C). For instance, the overall power conversion efficiency was increased from 4.23% to 4.47% and 5.43% for cells B and C, respectively. The enhancement of the photovoltaic efficiency is perhaps due to the increased penetration degree of the electrolytes into the porous TiO2 photoelectrode. However, cell D with a channel (pore) size of ∼5 μm could not improve the photovoltaic performances of the cells, because the larger size channels (pores) may weaken the light scattering intensity (see Fig. 3C).

Fig. 5 shows the IPCE values of the cells based on solid-state electrolyte. It can be seen that the maximum IPCE values are 49.7%, 54.2%, 60.1%, and 37.5% for cells A–D at 530 nm, respectively. The results of the IPCE values are consistent with the Jsc values. The PCE values of the device under various light intensities are listed in Table 2. The best performance devices were achieved at low levels of simulated sunlight, might due to the inefficient electron transport within the TiO2 layer. A maximum PCE value of 6.08% was obtained under AM 1.5 irradiance at 50 mW cm−2.

However, it is noteworthy that the light-scattering TiO2 film with channels (pores) could slightly increase the Voc values of the devices if compared with the control device (cell A). It has already been demonstrated that the enhanced Voc is due to the suppression of the dark current at electrolyte/TiO2 photoelectrode interface. Fig. 4d shows that the onset of dark current shifted about 14 and 23 mV from cell A to cells C and D, respectively. The lowered onset of dark current value indicates a lower I3− reduction rate, which leads to an increase of Voc. Here, our understanding is that the channels (pores) could inhibit the dark current which originated from the I3− reduction.

EIS measurements were further performed to understand the influence of the channels (pores) on the dye-coated TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interfacial properties (see Fig. 6). The EIS spectra comprises three semicircles, which represent the resistances of electrolyte/counter electrode interface (R1), electrolyte/TiO2 layer interface (R2), and the Nernst diffusion in electrolyte (R3), respectively. The smaller the semicircle in the 12.72, and 9.67 Ω (see Table 3), respectively, indicating that the generated channels (pores) of the light-scattering film can increase the resistance of the charge-transfer elements at the recombination. This result agrees with the dark current and Voc measurements. To calculate effective lifetime of electrons (τe) before the recombination in a TiO2 photoelectrode. Fig. 6b shows the Bode phase plots of EIS spectra of all the fabricated devices. The effective lifetime of electrons (τe) before the recombination in TiO2 photoelectrodes can be determined follow the equation:
where
fmax is the maximum frequency of the low-frequency peak. Here, the τe values extracted from the fmax are determined to be 7.02, 22.02, 30.92 and 17.91 ms for cells A, B, C and D, respectively (see Table 3), indicating that the electron lifetimes are enhanced after increasing the penetration degree of the solid-state electrolytes into the TiO2 photoelectrode. Here, the cell C shows the longest τe and yields the highest efficiency of 5.43%.

The long-term stability of the fabricated solid-state cells was studied by an accelerating test. The PCE values of all the cells were measured every seven days. The efficiencies are normalized to those determined on the first day. The fabricated devices were stored in air (humidity below 10%) at room temperature and 60 °C in the dark (Fig. 7). During the first seven days, the photovoltaic efficiency of the cells was increased due to the enhanced dye regeneration rate, which resulted in an increased Jsc value. The cell A (control device, light-scattering TiO2 film without porous channels) maintained about 91% of the initial PCE value after 42 days. A similar result was observed for cell C (TiO2 light-scattering film with ∼500 nm porous channels), indicating that reasonably sized channels (pores) in a light-scattering TiO2 film can keep the stability of the devices. The enhancement of the efficiency at the first few days for cell B and cell C is perhaps due to the increased penetration degree of the electrolytes into the porous TiO2 photoelectrode. The stability of the cell is in the order of A > B > C. However, the efficiency of cell D decreases gradually after 12 days probably due to the larger channels (pores) formed which destroy the light-scattering TiO2 film and decreases long-term stability.

In conclusion, we reported an effective method for the performance enhancement of solid-state electrolyte DSSCs. TiO2 photoelectrodes with channels (or pores) were prepared via a salt templating method. The channels (or pores) enhance the penetration degree of solid-state and quasi-solid-state electrolytes into the TiO2 photoelectrodes and improve the photovoltaic performances of DSSCs. This method could also be applied for plastic crystal type solid-state electrolytes with low melting points, and provides a feasible and practical method for fabricating solid-state DSSCs.
