Ladder-type non-fullerene acceptors have developed very rapidly since 2015 as they have tunable structure, a broad absorption region and good morphology control. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of non-fullerene organic solar cells (NF-OSC) increased from below 6% to over 13% and, in this review, we analyze the fundamental concepts of organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells and different building blocks of non-fullerene acceptors to have an overview of high-performance photovoltaic materials. Meanwhile, we also discuss several design guidelines for chemical construction and modification, which primarily focus on backbone variations, side-chain engineering, and end-cap group substitution. The PCE of several backbones, such as IDT, IDTT, BDCPDT, etc. have successfully exceeded 10% PCE, which demonstrates great potential for future optimization. Side-chains can affect intermolecular packing by forming a 3-D conformation along with the rigid backbones. End-cap groups can regulate electronic properties of the acceptors directly and provide the main electron-transport channels which influence frontier orbital properties. Although design principles and mechanistic understanding of ladder-type acceptors have been explored, there are also many opportunities and challenges of device mechanisms and molecular optimization which need to have deep study and investigation. We hope this review will assist readers to better understand the design principles of high-performance photovoltaic materials, molecular design, and structure–property relationships.

We cannot escape hearing the news about energy crisis, climate change, and global warming, which are viewed as the big challenges for sustainable development for human beings. To prevent global warming by using renewable energy sources is promising and significant for preserving the ozone layer from harmful emissions of burning fossil fuels. The amount of sunlight that falls on the surface of the earth ranges in amounts of 89000 terawatts per year. Thus, solar energy is a green, safe, and sustainable energy source without worrying about a shortage of supply from sunlight.

Although currently silicon-based solar cells are practical in people's daily life, their high cost and fragile features may be problematic for further wide applications. An organic solar cell (OSC) which uses organic molecules or polymers to form an active layer could be an important alternative for future renewable energy because the organic compounds are inexpensive and rollable on flexible substrates, which is quite different from a silicon solar cell. One major requirement for commercializing organic solar cells is to enhance power conversion efficiency (PCE) of them. In 1986, the first organic solar cell was invented by C. W. Tang with barely 1% PCE. During the past two decades, the discoveries of new organic molecular systems, including materials in the active layer and the interfacial layer coordinated together, have boosted PCEs to over 13%. The device fabrication process also changed from vacuum deposition to solution spin-coating; the latter, which is well-known as the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) developed by groups at Cambridge and at Santa Barbara, contains a blend of a donor and an acceptor to produce a single active layer. This technique allows the formation of a phase-separated interpenetrating donor/acceptor network which offers a continuous pathway for charge carrier transport and wide range for exciton dissociation.
Nowadays, the rising-star of materials in the active layer of an OSC is the non-fullerene acceptor, as shown in Fig. 1. The term “non-fullerene” refers to acceptor molecules that do not belong to fullerene derivatives, such as PC61BM and PC71BM, which dominated this field for a long time because of their superior electron transport ability. After being matched with narrow-bandgap donor materials, the best fullerene-based single junction OSC can exceed 11% PCE. Despite this performance, poor absorption, limited variation in energy levels, and relatively high cost are some major drawbacks that deter further improvements in fullerene acceptors. Thus, research of non-fullerene acceptors has been experiencing very rapid growth and many effective molecular systems have been developed. At the beginning, an imide-based material is the pioneer of non-fullerene acceptors and many useful units have been developed, such as perylene diimide (PDI) and naphthalene diimides (NDI) blocks. Currently, electron acceptors with ladder-type backbones bearing an Acceptor–Donor–Acceptor (A–D–A) motif draw great attention because of their easier synthesis and higher efficiency (>13%).
Thus far, several reviews have partially summarized development of some non-fullerene acceptors for OSC applications. The target of this review will mainly focus on the design and synthesis of ladder-type acceptors with aspects of backbone modulation, side chain engineering, end group modification, and other effective ways to tune and optimize this new material system. Hopefully, this review will assist readers to better understand the molecular design and structure–property relationship towards future rational designs of high-performance photovoltaic materials. As for non-fullerene acceptors without the ladder-type backbone or other related areas in OSC, we refer the readers to several more comprehensive reviews. In this review, we first introduce the fundamental concepts of organic BHJ solar cells and their function with a non-fullerene acceptor (Section 2). And then we sort out materials according to the backbone of the ladder-type core (Section 3). Additionally, we give detailed analyses on chemical modification methods on molecular structures (Section 4). Finally, we define the ongoing challenges and opportunities in this rising area to move the field forward (Section 5).

Generally, there are three steps in the process of the conversion of photon energy to electrical energy in non-fullerene acceptors based organic cells: (a) donor and/or acceptor materials in the active layer absorbs photons and then generates excitons; (b) excitons migrate to the donor/acceptor interface and dissociate to form free charge carriers (electron and hole); (c) free charge carriers transport to and are collected at their respective electrodes, as shown in Fig. 2. Due to the short diffusion lengths of excitons, typically ∼10–20 nm in OSC active blend films, donor and acceptor should have a larger interfacial area to produce more photocurrent.

The PCE of an organic solar cell can be calculated by the following equation, where Voc is the open-circuit voltage, Jsc is the short-circuit current density, FF is the fill factor, and Pin is the energy of incident light:

Jmax and Vmax are the current and voltage at the maximum power point on J–V curves, respectively. For an ideal cell, the J–V curve should have a rectangular shape, and therefore, the FF approaches unity.


V
oc generally follows the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor material and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor material. It is also affected by the rates of carrier generation and recombination, presence of energetic tail states or trap states, and some other factors that can influence the donor ionization potential or acceptor electron affinity such as the film morphology, surface composition, or the alignment of interfacial dipole moments. Thus, Voc depends on the donor or acceptor materials used, while the other factors also play important roles. Generally, a Voc loss can be observed in an OSC due to the need of driving force to separate the excitons and recombination energy loss.

J
sc is closed relevant to the process of charge generation, which depends on the generation of excitons after light absorption and the process of excitons transfer to the interface of donor/acceptor then separating to free carriers. Thus, other factors that can change the charge generation, charge transportation, charge recombination and charge collection can also influence the Jsc. Materials with increased mobilities can reduce charge accumulation and recombination and could result in enhanced Jsc. Thermal annealing, solvent annealing, and introducing an interfacial layer are also found to be effective for Jsc improvement.
FF depends on efficient extraction of photo-generated carriers from the device. Besides, FF is least understood among OSC performance parameters and it is also challenging to achieve a high FF. It is found that higher charge mobility, better active layer morphology, and less charge recombination are of significance to increase FF.
In the following Section 2.2–2.4, relationships between these several performance parameters of OSCs and energy level, charge mobility, or energy loss will be discussed.

Energy level tuning of non-fullerene acceptors is an efficient method to improve non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) based organic solar cells because the Voc is dependent on the difference of energy level between LUMO of the acceptor (LUMOA) and HOMO of the donor (HOMOD) and Jsc is associated with the band gap (Eg) of donor or acceptor. To get a larger Voc, usually a shallower LUMOA or deeper HOMOD are required so lower band gap of donor-materials (or acceptor-materials) are designed to increase absorption of the solar irradiation spectrum. However, there is a contradiction existing in Voc and Jsc as shown in Fig. 3. If we elevate LUMOA or reduce HOMOD to get larger Voc, then a larger band gap will be formed corresponding to lower Jsc, and vice versa.

Therefore, it is of significance to explore how to effectively tune the energy levels of non-fullerene acceptors while balancing Voc and Jsc. In A–D–A type non-fullerene acceptors with a ladder-type backbone, we can modify either the D or A part to tailor the energy levels. For example, incorporating F at the typical A moiety dicycanovinylindan-1-one (IC) would improve intramolecular interaction due to the electron-withdrawing effect of F, and downshift the LUMO energy levels and reduce the bandgap, which is beneficial for light harvesting and enhancing Jsc. However, the downshifted LUMO will cause a smaller Voc. But, if the weak electron-donating methyl group is appended to the IC, it can slightly elevate the LUMO level and hence improved Voc in PSCs. Adding electron-donating side-chains – such as alkoxyl groups – to the D moiety is also an effective way to increase the HOMO of an acceptor for a narrow bandgap, but a caution should be taken in case the HOMO of the acceptor could surpass the HOMO of the donor and lead to destructive exciton recombination.

High charge mobility can improve charge transport while reducing recombination and then achieving a higher FF, thus increasing PCE. High-performance non-fullerene acceptor-based OSCs with enhanced charge mobility can be achieved by side-chain engineering, conjugation length extension, fluorination, heavy atom effect (e.g., a selenium atom) and better film processing control. For example, ITIC-Th exhibits a higher electron mobility than its counterpart ITIC with phenyl side chains because the easy polarization of a sulfur atom and sulfur–sulfur interaction can enhance the intermolecular interaction. By incorporating another group (e.g., by extending the conjugation length of an indacenodithiophene (IDT) unit or introducing a Se atom into an IDT unit), Liao et al. designed and synthesized two NFA-based fused 10-heterocyclic ring IDTIDT-IC and IDSe-T-IC, respectively, which has a higher charge mobility than the referent IDT-based NFAs, thus producing a higher PCE.

A thienyl-fused indanone end-group, ITCC, was also rationally designed and synthesized by Hou's group, which shows a closer π–π stacking distance and a higher electron mobility compared to that of ITIC, which contains phenyl-fused indanone end-groups. Therefore, to improve the electron mobilities of ITIC, it is also imperative to finely tune the terminal acceptor unit to increase the local intermolecular p–p interaction and LUMO distribution on the acceptor unit. Finally, through controlling blend ratios, film thicknesses, thermal annealing times, solvents and times for solvent vapor annealing, and additive concentrations, an optimal morphology can be produced which is beneficial for a higher charge mobility and higher fill factor, and thus higher PCE.

Another terminology associated with device performance is energy loss (Eloss). It will be introduced briefly next and more information can be found in a ref. 68. Usually, Eloss can be defined as Eloss = Eg − eVoc, where Eg is the lowest optical bandgap of the donor or acceptor as shown in Fig. 4. Therefore, to increase the PCE, the Eloss should be decreased by reducing the driving force through simultaneously increasing charge transfer energy and decreasing the recombination as much as possible.

For example, a record PCE of 13.1% was achieved for a state-of-the-art non-fullerene OSC by Hou and co-workers, which was fabricated using a fluorinated donor (PBDB-T-SF) and acceptor (IT-4F). An interesting fact for ladder-type acceptors in devices is that they seem to have Eloss below 0.6 eV which is smaller than the traditional PCBM-based BHJ OSCs. Usually, HOMO–HOMO and LUMO–LUMO offsets should be above 0.3 eV to have an effective exciton separation. However, some systems having a smaller offset than 0.3 eV (even a near zero HOMO or LUMO offset) have been reported recently. For example, Liao et al. reported IDTIDSe-IC which enabled a PCE of 8.02% with a Voc of 0.91 V when combined with polymer J51 as donor. What's more, the HOMO difference between J51 and IDTIDSe-IC is as small as 0.1 eV and the hole transfer from IDTIDSe-IC to J51 can still be efficient. Another work is reported by Yan et al. which has a high PCE of 9.5% and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of nearly 90% in OSCs when the LUMO difference is negligible.

A ladder-type backbone is the core to constructing new acceptors and we can classify the reported molecules in this aspect. A tricyclic backbone is perhaps the smallest unit in this family. A free rotated biphenyl unit, for example, can be fused by carbon, silicon, or nitrogen to form corresponding fluorene, silafluorene, and carbazole blocks which showed obviously better planarity than the parent biphenyl unit. In 2015, S. V. Bhosale et al. reported a non-fullerene electron acceptor N5 as shown in Scheme 1. The core of the N5 is a fused dibenzosilole and two 2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-1,3-dione groups acted as electron withdrawing groups (EWGs). It is should be noted that two thiophene groups were inserted between the donor part and acceptors; these thiophene units can be viewed as bridges between D–A, and surely, they could also minimize the energy gap for their electron-rich features. The thermal stability of N5 was excellent decomposition temperature ca. 393 °C from DSC analysis, and the authors used it to match with a classical donor polymer, P3HT. The blended film of P3HT:N5 was a good nanoscale interpenetrating network with a broad spectrum IPCE over the visible range and PCE was 2.76%, which represented the highest value reported at that time for solution-processable BHJ devices using DBS-based non-fullerene acceptors.

As compared to silafluorene, the fluorene unit is more accessible in organic synthesis. Wan and Chen et al. reported a non-fullerene acceptor, DTBTF, whose core was an alkylated fluorene. This DTBTF adopted two thiobarbituric acids as terminal groups and thiophene, the same as N5, as the electron-rich bridge. An all-small-molecule organic solar cell based on DR3TSBDT:DTBTF blended film showed a PCE of 3.84%. Additionally, a Voc as high as 1.15 V with a low energy loss of only 0.59 eV was obtained. Based on the fluorene core, Zhang and Chen et al. also reported other DICTiF and DCF-2HT, in which the latter molecule had additional hexyl side chains on the thiophene bridge. With the same donor polymer PBDB-T, DICTiF can achieve higher PCE of 7.11% than that of DCF-2HT, which was mainly due to the higher FF of the DICTiF-based device, but the authors did not give further analysis on this difference. Two fluorene units can be arranged to be a 9,9′-spirobifluorene to form a 3D conformation. Based on this new unit, a series of molecules have been developed. Zhan et al. systematically synthesized two isomers, SBF1 and SBF2, but both exhibited very low performance (PCE < 1%). The linear conjugated SBF2 has a little higher Jsc, which could be ascribed to its wider absorption. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) shows that SBF2 neat film has strong (100) and (010) diffraction peaks because of its high crystallization while SBF1 is amorphous, and the electron mobility of SBF2 (7.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is higher than that of amorphous SBF1 (6.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). That is mainly because the coplanar molecular structure of SBF2 makes it easy to be crystalline due to π–π stacking among molecules. Yan and Peng also adopted this linear conjugated backbone, but they changed the bridge and EWG. The authors believed that the bulky 3D spirobifluorene unit can suppress molecular aggregation of SFBRCN. This acceptor exhibited a relatively wide optical bandgap of 2.03 eV, which provided a complementary absorption to commonly used low bandgap donor polymers, such as PTB7-Th. As a result, a high PCE of 10.26% was achieved. Cho and Choi et al. utilized an unconventional block indenothiophene with asymmetrical conformation to construct the acceptor PhITBD. The asymmetric structure was employed to enhance the internal morphology and efficient tuning of the energy levels. Another symmetrical acceptor, IDT-2BM, was also synthesized for comparison. Under optimized conditions the PhITBD blend exhibited a high PCE of 6.57% with a Jsc of 14.07 mA cm−2, whereas the IDT-2BM blend showed a PCE of 3.97% and a Jsc of 9.29 mA cm−2.
After further enlarging the fused ring system to five-cycle ladder-type acceptors, the device performance exhibited big progress. The reason why the four-cycle ladder backbone is absent in this design is probably due to a synthetic difficulty to balance the arrangement of soluble side-chains and mobility from the planar backbone. Herein, the most reported and effective backbone in ladder-type acceptors with five-cyclic rings is indaceno[2,1-b:6,5-b′]dithiophene (IDT). In 2015, Zhan et al. reported a novel acceptor DC-IDT2T based on this IDT backbone, in which they pointed out that the resulting material by appending a 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (DC) group could have strong electron-withdrawing ability and seemed appropriate for electron acceptor application, which is shown in Scheme 2. Finally, BHJ OSCs based on the PBDTTT-C-T:DC-IDT2T blend yielded a PCE as high as 3.93%. This work demonstrated the great potential of the IDT and DC moieties for use as building blocks for constructing novel non-fullerene acceptors. Afterwards, Zhan and Krebs collaborated on using this system in roll-coating fullerene-free OSCs. The best PCE of 1.02% was achieved on a large device area (1 cm2), flexible substrates, ITO free, vacuum-free, and ambient conditions. As compared to the fullerene control devices, the polymer/non-fullerene device showed much better stability (maintained 85% PCE > 50% PCE after 180 h). These preliminary results demonstrated that non-fullerene small molecule acceptors could be promising for industrial manufacture of high-performance OSCs. Then, since they used similar technology but a different material system (PTB7-Th & IEIC), they improved the PCE up to 1.79% on an ITO-free substrate, indicating the potential for large scale production of high performance OSCs. Here, a new acceptor IEIC was also previously reported by Zhan et al., which differed DC-IDT2T from the two alkyl side-chains on the bridge thiophenes and kept the central ladder-type IDT backbone and end-cap groups constant. IEIC exhibited good thermal stability, strong absorption in the 500–750 nm region with an extinction coefficient of 1.1 × 10−5 M−1 cm−1 at 672 nm, deep LUMO energy level (−3.82 eV) close to those of fullerenes, and a relatively high electron mobility of 2.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. As a result, a maximum PCE of 6.31% was achieved without any post-treatments, which was the highest PCE then for PSCs based on small molecule non-fullerene electron acceptors. It should be noted that this performance was obtained under a low FF of 0.48, implying there was room for IEIC to improve performance. This IEIC acceptor was further investigated by Yan et al.; they used the polymer PffT2-FTAZ-2DT developed in their group as donor and demonstrated a high efficiency of 7.3%. To be specific, they obtained a FF of 0.59, obviously larger than that in Zhan's work, indicating a relatively good morphology and charge collection ability of the solar cell device. And the IEIC was also suitable for other polymer systems like diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units and tandem solar cells. Around the side-chain on the bridge thiophene a systematic study was carried out by Zhan et al. involving different lengths of the straight chains. Via a steric hindrance effect, an increase in carbon number of the side chains slightly downshifted HOMO energy levels, upshifted LUMO energy levels, and thereby gradually increased Voc from 0.84 to 0.95 V. Zhan et al. also developed another similar acceptor, DC-IDT2F, by replacing the thiophene bridge with a furan unit, but its performance was inferior to its thiophene analogues, which is shown in Scheme 2. Hou et al. reported IEICO by introducing alkoxy side chains on the bridge thiophene; because of the strong electron-donating property of the alkoxy groups, IEICO exhibited a very narrow optical bandgap of 1.34 eV with a high-lying LUMO level of −3.95 eV. By adopting PBDTTT-E-T as the donor material, the IEICO-based fullerene-free PSC device showed a maximum PCE of 8.4% with a relatively high Voc of 0.82 V, and a high EQE of 66% was recorded at 810 nm. Furthermore, a PCE of 10.7% was recorded in a tandem PSC based on PBDTTT-ET:IEICO as a rear cell. As demonstrated in this work, the introduction of strong electron-donating groups (EDG) like alkoxyl chains provided great opportunities for molecular design of low bandgap non-fullerene acceptors without sacrificing Voc, as shown in Fig. 5. Following this work, they adopted the PC71BM in tandem OSC device with an active layer of PBDD4T-2F:PC71BM (front cell) & PBDTTT-ET:IEICO (rear cell), thus producing an outstanding PCE of 12.80%, with a Voc of 1.71 V, a Jsc of 11.51 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.65, which was achieved under optimized conditions. The intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) can be further enhanced in a fluorinated acceptor IEICO-4F, and this new acceptor had an ultra-narrow bandgap, as low as 1.24 eV. Use of six different polymer donors in the OSC devices all yielded impressive Jsc values over 20 mA cm−2 despite low energy losses of approximately 0.5 eV. The optimal ternary OSC device gave a high PCE of 10.9%, demonstrating the great potential of near-infrared (NIR) acceptors with such narrow bandgaps.
Liu and Zhu et al. also focused on NIR acceptors; they developed new, deep-absorbing, small-bandgap electron-acceptor materials ATT-1 and ATT-2 and used them in semitransparent OSCs applications. It is known that the maximum photopic (vision in bright light) human eye sensitivity is 555 nm and the maximum scotopic (vision in dim light) sensitivity is 507 nm. Thus, the key to designing this series of materials is the introduction of a thieno[3,4-b]thiophene group, which was previously prevalent in constructing low bandgap polymers. Both materials when combined with PTB7-Th and the ATT-1/ATT-2 achieved peak PCEs of 10.07%/9.58% respectively. The idea of a conformational lock also worked for designing IDT-based acceptors. Xu and Bo et al. developed a material, IDT-BOC6, in which the bridge is a phenyl ring. The relative work was always a thiophene bridge because the phenyl group was considered as a twisted factor that would undermine the planarity. However, in this work, a supramolecular interaction can lock the flat conformation of an IDT-BOC6 acceptor, which can significantly extend the effective conjugation and broaden the absorption spectrum because of the existence of O⋯S and O⋯H interactions. These phenomena were also proved by comparison with the referenced molecule IDT-BC6 without alkoxy chains. As shown in Fig. 6, polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on IDT-BOC6 afforded a PCE of 9.6%. In contrast, PSCs based on similar acceptor IDT-BC6, which cannot form a flat conformation, only exhibited a low PCE of 2.3%.
Using an IDT unit as a core and 5-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-ylmethylene)-3-ethyl-2-thioxothiazo-lidin-4-one (BR) units as end-capping EWGs, a new non fullerene acceptor, IDT-2BR, was designed and synthesized by Zhan et al. This acceptor was combined with the classic donor P3HT and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) was adopted as an additive in the solution to adjust the morphology of a blended film. As shown in Fig. 7, addition of 1–5% (v/v) CN improved the Jsc from 6.38 to 7.53–8.91 mA cm−2 with little change of Voc and FF. An FF of 68.1% and PCE of 5.12% were the highest values reported in 2015 for P3HT-based fullerene-free solar cells. An important discussion of this ladder-type system was that they believed the hexylphenyl groups on the IDT moiety exhibited a dihedral angle of ca. 115° to the backbone plane, which was beneficial for forming favorable interpenetrating networks without severe self-aggregation when mixing with P3HT. This becomes a critical design principle in the following acceptors' design.
By changing the aryl side-chains to alkyl side-chains, Holliday and McCulloch et al. reported O-IDTBR and EH-IDTBR; the difference was that the former had straight n-octyl chains and the latter had branched 2-ethylhexyl chains. As shown in X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for both materials, the increased planarity of the backbone promoted crystallization and the formation of pure acceptor domains. GIXRD was used to study their crystal packing with P3HT in films, respectively. It was found that the linear (O-IDTBR) chains could promote stronger intermolecular packing, which was particularly enhanced by thermal annealing, relative to branched (EH-IDTBR) chains. One effect of this was to further red-shift the absorption of O-IDTBR relative to the branched counterpart, which resulted in a broader EQE profile, higher Jsc, and an increase in PCE from 6.0% to 6.4% in P3HT-based OSCs. Zhan et al. also reported a similar work by using shorter hexyl side-chains; the inverted OSCs based on PTB7-Th:IDT-2BR1 yielded a high PCE of 8.7% which was higher than the previous IDT-2BR performance. The authors found that the IDT-2BR1 had a narrower bandgap, higher HOMO and LUMO, and exhibited a more self-organized film. This might be related to the nearly flat backbone and perpendicular hexyl chains of IDT-2BR1 while the IDT-2BR had increased steric hindrance and weaker molecular packing. Ying and Huang et al. modified the IDT-2BR by introducing a fluorine atom. They aimed to promote intermolecular interactions that can lead to appropriate phase separation that was beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport, potentially leading to enhanced overall photovoltaic performances. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels were calculated as −5.31/−2.89 eV and −5.69/−3.64 eV for PBTA-BO, the donor material in this system and IFBR, respectively. Thus, there will be a desired cascade energy level alignment from the diagram of PBTA-BO, IFBR, and PC61BM, so a ternary device could be achieved. The binary devices exhibited only 5.7% (with IFBR) and 3.85% (with PC61BM) PCEs, and the subsequent ternary devices can easily exceed 8% PCE, indicating IFBR played a bridging role and provided an additional pathway for charge transfer in the bulk-heterojunction films. Zhou et al. end capped the IDT backbone with thiazolidine-2,4-dione, and the resulting BTA2 was matched with P3HT. The fullerene-free organic solar cells based on P3HT:BTA2 realized a doubled Voc of 1.22 V compared to that of the P3HT:PC61BM system. In addition, P3HT:BTA2 (0.6:1, w/w) blend film demonstrated high and balanced electron mobility (3.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and hole mobility (4.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) by thermal annealing and solvent additive, which resulted in a relatively high PCE of 4.5%.
Yip and Xu et al. reported a new acceptor, IDT-BT-R-CN, by tailor engineering in which the 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-3-ethyl-rhodanine (R-CN) replaced the rhodanine end group from the IDT-BT-R acceptor. They found that by pairing with PTB7-Th, both IDT-BT-R and IDT-BT-R-CN resulted in highly efficient charge separation despite small energy offsets between the donor and acceptors. The PTB7-Th:IDT-BT-R based OSCs showed a high PCE of 8.3% with high Voc of 1.02 V, indicating a low energy loss of 0.59 eV. It was reported that one way to increase the Voc was to lower the energy loss which resulted in better device performance. Without the a double-bond between the central ladder-type backbone and the end-capped acceptor, it is still also possible to prepare non-fullerene acceptors. Zhan et al. made a try by using the IDT to append directly to the “half-perylene diimide (PDI)” blocks and, although the maximum PCE of C1–3 was just 2.36%, they still proved that the ladder-type backbone played a critical role in improving the performance of non-fullerene acceptors while other reference materials with a simple thiophene core presented PCE as low as 0.58%. Sun and Zhan collaborated together to refresh the record of these IDT-based materials by designing IC-C6IDT-IC in which the bridged π-unit was removed. This material was synthesized by a one-step facile reaction of two commercial available starting materials in a high yield. IC-C6IDT-IC possessed strong and complementary absorption in a 500–800 nm range and matched energy levels with the PDBT-T1 donor as well as high electron mobility. The as-cast PDBT-T1: ICC6IDT-IC blended film showed a very smooth surface, strong “face-on” π–π ordering, appropriate phase separation scale, and relatively good charge transport. The as-cast PSC based on the PDBT-T1:IC-C6IDT-IC blend showed efficient exciton dissociation and negligible bimolecular recombination. The as-cast PSCs yield PCEs of up to 8.71%, which was the highest value for fullerene-free PSCs then. This acceptor can make great success in small molecule OSCs and over 9% PCEs were achieved by several groups. Afterwards, Zhan et al. systematically studied IDT oligomers. As the number of IDT units increase, the LUMO energy level stayed similar (around −3.8 eV), while the HOMO level increased from −5.91 to −5.29 eV, and the absorption spectrum red shifted. Relative to IC-2IDT-IC and IC-3IDT-IC, IC-1IDT-IC had more planar main-chain, strong crystallization and π–π stacking, and relatively high electron mobility. The IC-1IDT-IC with just one IDT unit exhibited the best D/A harmony and the best PCE of 7.39%. They also collectively studied the acceptor IDIC with five polymers showing distinct chemical structures to prove its superiority and versatility as a non-fullerene acceptor, and the PCE of PDBT-T1:IDIC and PTFBDT-BZS:IDIC devices reached 10.3–11% after using additive DIO to improve crystallinity and phase purity and optimize phase separation of blended films. According to resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) measurements, PDBT-T1:IDIC as cast film showed peak q = 0.01 nm−1 which is generated from mass variation; thus, the domain could be calculated, which was 15 nm. After processing with 0.25% DIO, the PDBT-T1:IDIC film showed two peaks about q = 0.04 and 0.13 nm−1 and domain sizes were 80 and 20 nm or so. As for PTFBDT-BZS:IDIC as a cast film, the domain size was about 50 nm and it decreased to 40 nm after 0.25% DIO treatment. Besides, PDBT-T1:IDIC blended film showed 0.93 relative domain purity without DIO and it increased to 1 with DIO. PTFBDT-BZS:IDIC blended film showed 0.74 relative domain purity without DIO and it increased to 1 with DIO as well. These results prove that DIO treatment can improve crystallinity, enhance phase purity, and optimize phase separation of blended films, thus increasing the performance of devices.
Jiang and Liao et al. reported a non-fullerene electron acceptor bearing a fused five-cyclic ring containing selenium atoms for the first time in this system, denoted as IDSe-T-IC. A solar cell based on J51:IDSe-T-IC gave a maximum PCE of 8.6%, with a high Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 15.20 mA cm−2, and a FF of 62.0%. The trade-off features of Jsc and Voc existing in PSCs with fullerene acceptors had been minimized in the fullerene-free PSCs based on IDSe-T-IC and J51. In the active layer, J51:IDSe-T-IC blended film had a smooth morphology with a small root-mean-square 1.09 nm, which was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Moreover, a fibrous structure was observed in the film cast from CF solution, which was beneficial for an increase of Jsc and FF. These results demonstrated that fine-tuning the absorption and electronic energy levels of non-fullerene acceptors, and properly selecting a polymer donor to achieve complementary absorption, was a promising way to further improve the performance of PSCs. An efficient wide bandgap small molecular electron acceptor IFTIC based on indenofluorene was developed by Gao et al. With strong and broad absorption in the shortwave region (470–690 nm) and suitable energy levels (HOMO = −5.42 eV, LUMO = −3.85 eV) of IFTIC, the devices based on PTB7-Th and IFTIC blended films exhibited a PCE of 6.56% and relatively high Voc of 0.92 V without any post-treatment. This work can provide an option to utilize narrow bandgap polymers by studying wide-bandgap acceptors.
A fused hexacyclic electron acceptor, IHIC, which is shown in Scheme 3, was designed by Zhan et al.; IHIC exhibited strong near-infrared absorption with extinction coefficients of up to 1.6 × 105 m−1 cm−1, a narrow optical bandgap of 1.38 eV, and a high electron mobility of 2.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The semitransparent OSCs based on PTB7-Th and IHIC exhibited a champion power conversion efficiency of 9.77% with an average visible transmittance of 36% and excellent device stability. Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements showed that PTB7-Th:IHIC film has strong crystallinity and preferential face-on oriented domains (q ≈ 1.79 Å−1), which is beneficial to an increase of mobility. The blended film exhibits a hole mobility (μh) of 6.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, a higher electron mobility (μe) of 1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the μh/μe ratio is 0.57 after optimization. According to grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) measurements, the fitted pure phase domain sizes of PTB7-Th:IHIC blended film are 12.3 nm or so. Results showed that the film has suitable domain sizes for exciton dissociation, which can enhance Jsc. The high efficiency, good transparency, and excellent stability of the ST-OSCs rendered them promising for commercial applications in building-integrated photovoltaics.
Going through the acceptors having 5–6 fused cycles, we can discuss the most prevalent ladder-type system with seven fused units. The story should be started from ITIC, the star material first reported by Zhan et al. in 2015, which is shown in Scheme 4. This molecule had a bulky seven-ring fused core of indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT), end-capped with 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN). The push–pull structure in ITIC can induce intramolecular charge transfer and extend absorption. Furthermore, the four rigid 4-hexylphenyl substituents out of the IT main plane can restrict molecular planarity, aggregation, and large phase separation in BHJ blend films. The ITIC film exhibited electron mobility of up to 3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and an average value for five devices was 2.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. This electron mobility was close to those of fullerene derivatives and guaranteed effective charge carrier transport to the electrodes. ITIC in dichloromethane solution (10−6 M) gave strong absorption in the 500–750 nm region with a maximum extinction coefficient of 1.3 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 664 nm. Relative to its solution, absorption of an ITIC film showed a significant bathochromic-shift of 38 nm and a strong shoulder peak, suggesting that there was some molecular self-organization in the film. The ITIC had a bandgap of 1.59 eV and HOMO/LUMO of −5.48/−3.83 eV. Using the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-TH:ITIC/PDIN/Al, the blend at a D/A weight ratio of 1:1.3 gave the best performance: Voc of 0.81 V, Jsc of 14.21 mA cm−2, FF of 0.591, and PCE of 6.80%. ITIC-Th with thienyl side-chains was also developed by Zhan et al., which was a representative work on side-chain engineering for this type of IDTT-based acceptors. They tried this ITIC-Th with two polymer donors, PTB7-Th and PDBT-T1; the former was a narrow bandgap donor and the latter was a wide bandgap donor. And in these two systems, the additive CN improved Jsc, FF and PCE. In the end, compared with the PTB7-Th:ITIC-Th system, PDBT-T1:ITIC-Th-based devices with 1% CN presented a better PCE of 9.6% and a certified PCE of 8.85%. Both ITIC and ITIC-Th developed in Zhan's group were further exploited by searching for various donors to match them; for example, Zhang and Li et al. designed and proposed a new series of wide bandgap polymers: J51, J61, and J71. Soon, the ITIC-based OSCs exceed 11% PCE. Chen, Woo, and Hou et al. also successfully demonstrated a highly efficient fullerene-free PSC based on the poly thiophene derivative, which achieved an impressive efficiency as high as 10.16%, indicating this IDTT-based acceptor had good versatility in different polymer systems. Besides these reports, there were other relative works about the development of polymer donors for ITIC and they really triggered a hot research interest on materials and device optimizations. These new IDTT-based acceptors were also suitable for more complicated device techniques, such as ternary and tandem OSCs to enlarge the absorption range.
These side-chain modifications did not stop; by side-chain isomerism engineering on the alkyl-phenyl substituents of ITIC, a new low bandgap n-OS m-ITIC with meta-alkyl-phenyl substituents was synthesized and characterized by Zhang and Li et al. m-ITIC demonstrated a more crystalline and stronger film absorption coefficient as shown in Fig. 8, slightly (ca. 0.02 eV) upshifted LUMO and HOMO energy levels, and greater electron motility in comparison with its isomer ITIC with a para-alkyl-phenyl substituent. As is shown in the AFM image, the RMS roughness of an ITIC-based as-cast film is 1.06 nm while that of m-ITIC based as-cast film is 0.92 nm, indicating that the connection position of side chains make a difference to film morphology. Non-fullerene PSCs with m-ITIC as acceptor and a medium bandgap conjugated polymer J61 as donor demonstrated a high PCE of 11.77% with a Voc of 0.912 V, a Jsc of 18.31 mA cm−2, and a FF of 70.55%, which was significantly improved over a PCE of 10.57% for the corresponding ITIC-based device under the same experimental conditions. An end-cap modification was another effective way to modulate the IDTT-based acceptors. To this end, two new acceptors, IT-M and IT-DM, were rationally designed to modify the electronic structure and were synthesized by incorporating methyl-modified end groups. Ade and Hou found that the weak electron-donating property of a methyl group can elevate the LUMO by 0.04 eV (IT-M) and 0.09 eV (IT-DM) in energy, respectively. As compared to ITIC, higher Voc values of 0.94 and 0.97 V were obtained from optimized PBDB-T:IT-M and PBDB-T:IT-DM-based PSCs, respectively as shown in Fig. 9. Finally, from the PBDB-T:IT-M devices, a high PCE of 12.05% was obtained for hero devices by internal testing, and a certified PCE of 11.6% was further recorded.
Relative works of ITIC-M on the design of polymers and device engineering were also studied by Hou's group and improved performance was achieved. It is known that an alkoxyl group has stronger electron-donating ability than a methyl group. By increasing the length of the alkoxyl side chain successively on the end groups, Hou et al. designed and synthesized a new class of ITIC-based small molecule acceptors, IT-O1 to IT-O4, for application in NF-PSCs. They found the modulation of end group side chains had a great impact on the morphology of blended films in SMA-based PSCs and thus this provides a guideline for the molecular design of SMAs. As observed by AFM and transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurements, blended films based on PBDBT:IT-O1 and PBDB-T:IT-O2 demonstrated rather fine and evenly distributed domains with sizes of tens of nanometers and continuous interpenetrating networks, leading to a higher Jsc and FF and thus better PCEs. However, blended films based on PBDB-T:IT-O3 and PBDB-T:IT-O4 showed distinctly larger domains with sizes over 100 nm, which was detrimental to accomplishing efficient exciton diffusion and dissociation, resulting in a significantly lower Jsc and FF.
Very recently, Hou et al. supplied a new record with binary OSCs; they reported a new acceptor, IT-4F, in which fluorination was used to modify the end phenyl groups. With the newly developed polymer, PBDB-T-SF, a device with PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F as active materials showed down-shifted molecular energy levels relative to their nonfluorinated counterparts. Because of the broad optical absorption range and enhanced absorption coefficient of the active layer, the corresponding OSC device exhibited an obvious improvement in Jsc. AFM showed that the RMS surface roughness of a PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F blended film is 1.76 nm, which proved that the film had a smooth surface and good morphology. The best device fabricated from PBDBT-SF:IT-4F yielded a remarkable PCE of 13%, which is shown in Fig. 10. Zhan et al. also designed and synthesized a fluorinated acceptor, ITIC-Th1. Compared with its nonfluorinated counterpart, ITIC-Th, ITIC-Th1 presented a slightly deeper LUMO, redshifted absorption, and a smaller bandgap. FTAZ:ITIC-Th1 BHJ films exhibited stronger molecular packing and longer coherence length, leading to higher electron and hole, yet balanced mobilities. As a result, non-fullerene OSCs based on FTAZ:ITIC-Th1 gave a PCE as high as 12.1%, significantly higher than those of BHJ devices based on FTAZ:nonfluorinated ITIC-Th (8.88%) and FTAZ:PC71BM (5.22%).
Besides the modification on the substitution on the end phenyl rings, to totally replace the end phenyl rings by another aromatic unit, such as thiophene, was proved to be a viable way to design new acceptors. Woo, Ade, and Hou et al. reported that a small molecular acceptor, ITCC, showed a closer π–π stacking distance and a higher electron mobility compared to ITIC, which contained phenyl-fused indanone end-groups, as shown in Fig. 11. In addition, ITCC possessed a higher lying LUMO level of −3.76 eV and thus yields a Voc of greater than 1 V in photovoltaic devices. A PCE of 11.4% demonstrated that the high Voc non-fullerene OSC had a great potential for further improving efficiency. GIWAXS patterns showed that PBDB-T:ITCC blended film had a smaller (010) stacking distance (3.83 Å) compared to PBDB-T:ITIC film (3.93 Å), which is caused by enhanced intermolecular interactions of ITCC molecules. Moreover, R-SoXS measurements showed that PBDB-T:ITCC film had a purer domain with an average composition variation (ACV) of 1.00 while ITIC film had ACV of 0.86. However, due to the blue-shifted optical absorption of ITCC, the Jsc of ITCC-based OSC device is not very high. Predictably, if both of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of a non-fullerene acceptor can be up-shifted simultaneously, improved Voc along with high Jsc and thus further improvement of PCE can be expected. Based on ITCC, the methylation method was also carried out on the end-thiophene group to form a newly designed ITCC-M. By adopting an interconnection layer with an optimized thickness to achieve efficient charge collection and recombination and high light transmittance, they were able to fabricate tandem cells with PCEs of 13–14% under an illumination of 0.02–1 sun, which is shown in Fig. 12.
Zou and Yang separately synthesized an isomer of ITCC in which the C3–C4 positions, not the C2–C3 positions, were fused to the EWGs. This new acceptor was named as ITTC (Zou et al.) and ITCPTC (Yang et al.), with different polymer donors of HFQx-T and PBT1-EH, maximum PCEs of 10.4% and 11.8% were achieved. Unlike the direct A–D–A structure on an IDTT core, Li and Chen et al. used a thiophene as the bridge to link the D/A moieties, which were normal in IDT-based materials as discussed above. This resulting ITTIC with polymer PBDB-T1:ITTIC exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 9.12% with an increased Voc and broader photo response compared with PBDB-T1:ITIC based devices. Interestingly, it was shown that the charge transfer remained effective at a diminished HOMO difference of 0.02 eV between PBDB-T1 and ITTIC, leading to a mitigated energy loss of 0.54 eV in PBDB-T1:ITTIC based devices. Zhan et al. synthesized two acceptors, IDT-2BM and IDTT-2BM, for comparison. By optimizing the morphologies, PSCs based on PBDTTT-C-T:IDT-2BM or IDTT-2BM afforded promising PCEs of 4.26% and 4.81%, respectively. The higher PCE of IDTT-2BM-based devices was attributed to higher mobility and more suitable morphology.
Besides the popular IDTT backbone, there are several other 7-fused-ring ladder-type systems that can be utilized to construct A–D–A non-fullerene acceptors. Lu and Chen et al. designed a new rigid backbone named fluorenedicyclopentathiophene (FT) by fusing the fluorene core as shown in Scheme 5. With this planar backbone, the FDICTF film showed strong absorption in the wavelength region from 500 to 770 nm, and absorption onset of 760 nm corresponds to an optical bandgap of 1.63 eV. Devices with PBDB-T and FDICTF gave a high PCE of 10.06%, a high Jsc of 15.81 mA cm−2, and a high Voc of 0.94 V. From a comparison to DICTF (PCE = 5.93%), an unfused acceptor, the improvement in efficiency was obvious. For morphology control in the active layer, the out-of-plane chains on the fused core of FDICTF can effectively prevent overaggregation in the acceptor phases, contributing to the formation of a favorable interpenetrating donor/acceptor network with a suitable degree of phase separation in the active layers. Xu and Bo systematically studied the effect of side chains, and three planar non-fullerene acceptors (FTIC-C8C6, FTIC-C6C6, and FTIC-C6C8) were designed and synthesized. The backbone FT was planar and had six flexible alkyl side chains, which guaranteed a simultaneous enhancement of the π–π interaction (for better charge transport) and solubility (for better microphase separation) of these compounds. Organic solar cells using the acceptor with two n-hexyl and four n-octyl side chains (FTIC-C6C8) demonstrated a higher device performance than those using the other two acceptors which bear shorter side chains (FTIC-C6C6 with six n-hexyl groups) and less long side chains (FTIC-C8C6 with four n-hexyl and two n-octyl groups). The optimized PBDB-T:FTIC-C6C8 blended film had a high PCE of 11.12%, a large Voc of 0.93 V, a high Jsc of 18.55 mA cm−2, and a good FF of 0.65. This result provided an appropriate molecular design strategy for building high-performance non-fullerene acceptors and shows that optimizing alkyl-side chains is a very effective way to further improve the photovoltaic performance of devices.
Chen and Sun et al. reported the first dithienocyclopentacarbazole (DTCC)-based n-type organic semiconductor DTCC-IC for acceptor application and it possessed highly extended π-conjugated backbones and versatile modular structures for derivatization. For the first time, a high electron mobility of 2.17 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 has been tested and the device with DTCC-IC and PTB7-Th exhibits a PCE of up to 6% and a rational high Voc of 0.95 V. Zheng et al. also studied the DTCC-based acceptor CDTCN with a longer conjugation length of the backbone. The device with CDTCN and PBDB-T gave a high PCE of 6.23% with a Voc high of 0.96 V, a Jsc of 11.26 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.58. By changing the alignment of the classic fused system of the IDTT core, a new seven-ring ladder-type backbone dithienyl[1,2-b:4,5-b′]benzodithiophene (BDCPDT) can be formed. It is noticeable that these two units are structural isomers. To study the isomeric effects of these two units in the use of ladder-type non-fullerene electron acceptors, Jiang, Liao and Forrest et al. designed two isomeric non-fullerene acceptors, BDT-IC and IT-IC, for direct comparison. The isomer BDT-IC showed a smaller energy gap (1.53 eV), stronger intermolecular interactions, and more crystallinity than IT-IC. Specifically, BDT-IC exhibited five times higher electron mobility (0.46 ± 0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1), which lead to a reduced charge recombination. Moreover, as-cast OSCs without additional treatments or additives employing BDT-IC paired with the J71 donor exhibited PCE of 10.5 ± 0.4%. Significant impacts of isomeric effects on electronic structure and crystal properties of the IT-IC and BDT-IC isomers were revealed. There was a (100) diffraction peak in J71:BDT-IC blended thin films according to GIXD measurements, which came from BDT-IC as BDT-IC had a (100) diffraction peak located at 0.32 Å−1, indicating that BDT-IC guides the blend morphology. Compared to J71:IT-IC, J71:BDT-IC blended thin film preferred the tight π-stacking in the perpendicular direction with the (010) diffraction peak at 1.76 Å−1, which reduced the recombination of excitons and improved charge transport, thus building high-performance OSCs. These studies help to elucidate the structure–property relationships of high performance NFAs, providing insights into future rational designs of improved non-fullerene acceptor materials. But, this is not the first report on a BDT-based acceptor. Before this comparative study, the BDT-IC was named as NFBDT with the same structure and disclosed by Chen et al.; their new acceptor NFBDT exhibited a low optical bandgap of 1.56 eV, resulting in wide and efficient absorption that covered the range from 600 to 800 nm. An optimized PCE of 10.42% was obtained for the PBDBT:NFBDT-based device with an outstanding Jsc of 17.85 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). All of these demonstrated that this modified BDCPDT unit could also be applied for designing other high performance NF-acceptors, and the fused-ring benzodi-(cyclopentadithiophene) unit is a promising block for that. Then, a new A–D–A-type small-molecule acceptor NCBDT was designed by modification of the D and A units of NFBDT, which is shown in Scheme 5; the PBDB-T:NCBDT devices demonstrated an impressive PCE over 12%.
This identical material was also studied by Zhan et al. with the name of ITIC1, and they also synthesized another material, ITIC2, with a conjugated side-chain appended on the BDT core, which is shown in Fig. 13. ITIC2 exhibited an absorption peak at 714 nm, which redshifts 12 nm relative to ITIC1. The absorption extinction coefficient of ITIC2 was 2.7 × 105 m−1 cm−1, higher than that of ITIC1 (1.5 × 105 m−1 cm−1). ITIC2 exhibited a slightly higher HOMO of −5.43 eV and LUMO of −3.80 eV relative to ITIC1 (HOMO = −5.48 eV; LUMO = −3.84 eV), and higher electron mobility (1.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) than that of ITIC1 (9.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). In a device test, the PCE of ITIC2-based organic solar cells was 11.0%. These results demonstrated that side-chain conjugation was an effective strategy for the design of high-performance non-fullerene acceptors. However, it should be noted that this modification way is absent in designing IDTT-based acceptors so far.
Jiang and Liao et al. reported a new NIR non-fullerene acceptor, BT-IC, with a low-bandgap (1.43 eV), showing a high PCE of 10.5% along with simultaneously high Voc of 0.90 eV and Jsc of 17.5 mA cm−2 when blending with a medium bandgap polymer donor (J71). This molecule first introduced the side-chains on the BDT core, but different from the conjugated side-chains adopted by Zhan et al.; here, they utilized the electron-donating alkoxyl side-chains to strengthen the intramolecular charge transfer. That is why the BT-IC can extend the absorption edge to nearly 900 nm and other results are shown in Fig. 14. Those results demonstrated that the BT-IC acceptor was a unique NIR non-fullerene acceptor with potential applications in tandem/multi junction, semitransparent (or visibly transparent), and ternary blend solar cells, thus deserving further attention.
A new non-fullerene acceptor, COi8DFIC, which is shown in Scheme 6, was designed and synthesized by Xiao and Ding et al. who used a CO-bridged ladder-type unit (COi8) as electron-donating core. It can absorb 600–1000 nm sunlight with a narrow optical bandgap of 1.26 eV. The OSCs based on COi8DFIC and PTB7-Th achieved a Jsc of 26.12 mA cm−2 and a high PCE of 12.16%. Moreover, by adding PC71BM into COi8DFIC:PTB7-Th film, the highest PCE of the ternary OSCs was increased to be 14.08%. Jen et al. report a new acceptor 6TIC with a new core terthieno[3,2-b]thiophene (6T) as EDG. 6TIC had a narrow optical bandgap of 1.37 eV and its absorption edge reached 905 nm due to the electron-rich conjugated core and reduced resonance stabilization energy. As compared with PTB7-Th, the OSCs achieved a high PCE of 11.07%, a high Jsc of 20.11 mA cm−2, and a high Voc of 0.83 V. What's more, the semitransparent solar cell based on the PTB7-Th:6TIC exhibited a high PCE of 7.62%. Soon after, Zhan et al. reported another acceptor FOIC with the same core and stronger end-cap, EWG 2-(5/6-fluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile (FIC). The introduction of fluorine can enhance intermolecular interactions and charge transport; thus, FOIC showed strong NIR absorption with extinction coefficient of 2 × 105 m−1 cm−1, small bandgap of 1.32 eV, and high electron mobility of 1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The RMS roughness of PTB7-Th:FOIC blended film was 0.862 nm, which is smaller than that of PTB7-Th:ITIC3 (0.898 nm), indicating a smoother surface. OSCs based on PTB7-Th:FOIC exhibited a PCE of 12.0% and it only decreased 30% after 30 d in air. These results demonstrated that a 6T core has a great potential to build narrow bandgap non-fullerene acceptors with high performance in devices.
Four new fused-ring electron acceptors with a 9-fused system, INIC, INIC1, INIC2, and INIC3, based on a fused-nonacyclic IBDT core end-capped with nonfluorinated or fluorinated IC were designed and synthesized by Zhan et al. These four molecules had strong absorptions in the visible and even near-infrared region which are shown in Fig. 15 with high extinction coefficients of 2.1–2.5 × 105 M−1 cm−1. The devices based on FTAZ/INIC series blends exhibited a small energy loss of 0.61–0.63 eV, yet efficient charge dissociation and collection, negligible bimolecular charge recombination, and finally, high PCEs of 7.7–11.5%. Fluorination of INIC significantly enhanced the PCE from 7.7% to >10%, in particular, the OSCs based on difluorinated INIC3 show the best PCE of 11.5%. To understand the morphology of the active layer, AFM was used to obtain surface images of active layers, which are smooth with a root-mean square roughness of 0.54–0.9 nm. Then, a GIWAXS measurement was used, indicating that the blended film of FTAZ and INIC3 exhibit highest crystallinity and maintain both FTAZ and INIC3 semi-crystalline packing at the same time, which is beneficial for film mobility. GISAXS measurements were also used to reveal that the suitable crystallinity of these four materials does no harm to film phase separation and exciton dissociation. These results provided a great potential of the new IBDT and fluorinated IC building blocks for constructing high-performance non-fullerene acceptors.
A non-fullerene electron acceptor bearing a fused 10-heterocyclic ring with a band gap of 1.5 eV was designed and synthesized by Jiang and Liao et al., as shown in Scheme 6. When using IDTIDT-IC and PTB7-Th, a low energy loss (<0.6 eV), a high EQE (>60%) value, and a superior PCE of up to 6.5% were achieved. Without any additives, the Voc of the devices reached 0.94 V, which was surprisingly high compared to the often reported 0.76 V for devices based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM. The high Voc can be attributed to the very low energy loss of the donor/acceptor pair. To further increase absorption and improve performance of the device, a new acceptor material, IDTIDSe-IC, with a fused 10-heterocyclic ring backbone was reported by Jiang and Liao et al. IDTIDSe-IC exhibited a band gap of 1.52 eV and strong absorption in the 600–850 nm region. Combined with a large band gap polymer, J51 (Eg = 1.91 eV) as donor, broad absorption coverage from 300 nm to 800 nm was obtained due to complementary absorption of J51 and IDTIDSe-IC, which enabled a PCE of 8.02% in the corresponding PSCs. Moreover, an EQE of 50–65% was achieved in the absorption range of IDTIDSe-IC with only about 0.1 eV HOMO difference between J51 and IDTIDSe-IC.
A new electron acceptor, IUIC with an 11-heterocyclic ring, was designed and synthesized by Zhan et al. It existed as a larger extended π-conjugation with a stronger electron-donating ability, which was beneficial for its absorption and electron mobility. Thus, the absorption edge of IUIC was longer than 900 nm. The OSCs based on PTB7-Th and IUIC achieved a high PCE of 10.2% with an average visible transmittance (AVT) of 31% which was higher than the device based on PTB7-Th and ITIC4 (PCE = 6.42%, AVT = 28%). The AFM results showed that the blended film of PTB7-Th:IUIC with RMS roughness of 1.0 nm was slightly smoother than PTB7-Th:ITIC4 film (RMS roughness was 1.2 nm). GIWAXS revealed that the molecular packing of PTB7-Th is less compact in PTB7-Th:IUIC film. Besides, R-SoXS showed that PTB7-Th:IUIC film has a higher domain purity of 1 than that of PTB7-Th:ITIC4 film (0.87), which would promote charge transport and minimize the possibility of bimolecular recombination. So, the as-cast devices based on PTB7-Th:IUIC exhibited higher EQE, Jsc, and PCE than that of PTB7-Th:ITIC4.
A new acceptor material, FITP with a fully fused backbone, prepared by fusing two PDI units with an indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) core, was designed by Chen et al. By blending with PTB7-Th, FITP exhibited a good performance as an electron acceptor with a high PCE of 7.33% and high Voc of 0.99 V.
This is just an overview of the typical backbones used in constructing effective ladder-type acceptors. During the preparation of this review, we have noted with great pleasure the publications of many valuable papers in different journals. As compensation to this loss, we herein provide a list of representative papers recently published by different groups in the reference section for interested readers to retrieve.

According to the aforementioned progress based on ladder-type acceptors, we now can summarize the modification techniques used in tuning structure–property relationships. The first efficient ladder-type electron acceptor ITIC, it is a good example for structural analysis (but not limited in this structure), which is shown in Scheme 7.

We can carefully disassemble an ITIC molecule into the following units: (1) the conjugated fused backbone; (2) the end-cap EWG; (3) the sp3 hybridized side-chains at the cyclopentane part; (4) the substituents at the middle phenyl position of the backbone, where it should be noted that there is no report on this kind of modification for ITIC series; and (5) the β-position of the end thiophene, but only one work has been reported so far. From these five viewpoints, we will continue to discuss the construction ways in current and next molecular designs.

Multifused arenes play a key role in modulating properties and variations on the backbone, which is the most conspicuous change. Because a thiophene has less steric hindrance than benzene, it is indispensable in designing planar backbones for highly efficient acceptor molecules. To replace the thiophene with benzene at the backbone, it was found the resulting molecule has an increased bandgap; thus, we can conclude that the introduction of benzene is critical to tune energy levels. Benzene is also important to provide suitable fused positions with side-chain derivations. Normally, fused ring backbones are accomplished by a Friedel–Crafts reaction under acidic conditions, and generally the remaining C–H bonds on the benzene are far enough away from neighboring bonds to avoid any planar torsion. In Scheme 8, it is clear to see how the IDT and IDTT blocks form under similar conditions.

Like the syntheses of IDT and IDTT, other backbone units even without a benzene (for example, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit) also adopt a similar synthetic strategy. This kind of ring-closure step is effective but now is only limited to forming aryl substituted ladder-type backbones. This is because of the by-products from the elimination reaction if alkyl chains are used instead of aryl chains. To get the same backbone with alkyl chains, researchers have to use a time consuming route consisting of Friedel–Crafts acylation, deoxygenation, and then nucleophilic substitution. So, there is much room for optimizing this synthetic route in the future.
Generally, the ring-closure step forms five-membered cycles, but this Friedel–Crafts way is also useful for constructing six-membered cyclics. Very recently, Jen and Liu et al. reported a new ladder-type framework, in which the key step is ring-closing toward a two-dimensional perylene core in a six-membered closing manner. As a result, the multiple-fused materials bearing a highly planar backbone achieved an optoelectronic response over 1000 nm with the incorporated nitrogen atom.

To date, modification of end-cap groups has proved to be very effective for tuning the performance of materials. The property of an EWG can directly affect the LUMO energy levels, which is critical for charge dissociation and Voc. The IC is the most widely used EWG, with two cyano groups to strengthen the electron-poor feature of 1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione. The benzene ring offers four positions for modification; herein, appending a weak EDG-like methyl can increase the Voc and EWG-like fluorine can achieve a narrower bandgap for light harvesting. A systematic study on position difference effects was also reported, and replacing the benzene with thiophene isomers also works in constructing effective acceptors.

Other end groups were also reported using a similar construction strategy and these are included along with the IC in Scheme 9. It is interesting to point out that a double bond is generally used to connect the backbone and the EWG, and this position can also be adjusted. Recently, Zhang and Li et al. adopted a tandem double bonds system to extend the conjugation length which is shown in Fig. 16. In previous reports, two molecules based on IDT and IDTT cores with double bond π-bridges were designed and synthesized. By introducing double bond π-bridges, the film of these new molecules showed significantly red-shifted absorption, tuned crystallinity, and improved electron mobility, which made their blended film with a polymer donor easier to form appropriate phase separation.

Existence of a cyclopentane moiety in the backbones in most reports is quite important for appending suitable side chains to solubilize the resulting acceptor. An alkyl chain is the first choice in many examples of conjugated materials as shown in Scheme 10. However, aryl chains instead of alkyl chains are more popular in building such ladder-type acceptors. We believe this is because the synthetic routes, with ester groups existing in the precursors, can simplify the backbone forming process. That is, the aryl lithium reagent attacks the ester to form a tertiary alcohol, followed by intramolecular cyclization. If an alkyl lithium or alkyl Grignard reagent is used in this step, then the next elimination process competes with the cyclization, which leads to difficult work-up and low yield. Thus, the most feasible way for appending alkyl chains to a multi-cyclopentane system is by using a nucleophilic substitution reaction, and this requires a ketone as the precursor for de-oxygenation. And, the ketone precursor can be also transferred from an ester group by Friedel–Crafts acylation. Obviously, this synthetic route is more complicated. In addition, another problem for this route is low solubility of the rigid ketone. An alternative way to reduce the synthetic difficulty of fully alkyl chains is using mixed side chains, called “asymmetrical sides.” Xu and Bo et al. firstly developed this method by using dialdehyde compounds instead of general diester precursors to simplify the synthesis.

As for the aryl side chain, a current study was done on the meta and para positions for the phenyl group or substantially replacing the phenyl group by thiophene. But in theory, the short alkyl chains involved in removing a conventional benzene group should produce better intermolecular packing, which has been partly proven in an IDT system. Until very recently, the popular IDTT system had adopted the same modification, and a new acceptor, C8-ITIC, which has linear alkyl side chains on an IDTT core, was synthesized through a heterocycle extension strategy. The advantage of this synthetic route is that all intermediates are soluble and readily purified and have general applications in chemical synthesis. Compared to reported ITIC with phenylalkyl side chains, C8-ITIC exhibits a reduction in the optical band gap, higher absorptivity, and an increased propensity to crystallize, which shows the important role of side chains on the properties of acceptor molecules.

Many researchers may notice that there are possible substituted positions on the central benzene of IDT or IDTT cores; however, no related reports are available probably due to synthesis difficulty. Another kind of BDCPDT-core based material can easily make this modification by using different side-chains in the precursors. Unlike the aforementioned side-chains on the sp3 hybridized carbon that make them point out of the backbone planes, these kinds of side-chains are appended to the conjugated backbone; thus, they can directly affect energy levels especially the HOMO. This impact is quite similar to that of end-cap groups which are placed along the molecule's long-axis, so it could be described as a short-axis substitution.

Recently, Jiang, Zhang and Li et al. found this short cut. It is predicable that the other relative system bearing central unsubstituted hydrogen can adopt this modification to further improve the materials' performance, as shown in Fig. 17. In this work, two new fused-ring electron acceptors (CBT-IC and SBT-IC) were designed and developed by utilizing n-hexyl and n-hexylthio as short-axis substitutions based on the BDCPDT system. The short-axises could readily modify absorption spectra and energy levels of CBT-IC and SBT-IC due to different electron-donating/-withdrawing natures of n-hexyl and n-hexylthio substitutions. Furthermore, compared with BDT-IC without any short-axis substituents, both CBT-IC and SBT-IC exhibited higher maximum absorption coefficients. In the film, however, crystallinity and charge mobility of acceptors were decreased since the short-axises were introduced. Combined with a medium bandgap polymer donor, J71, both of CBT-IC and SBT-IC based OPV devices exhibited a higher PCE over 11%, and higher maximum EQE over 75% than a BDT-IC based device. This work demonstrated that a short-axis could be a very useful approach to optimize materials which may give a way to further designing better non-fullerene acceptors.

The last rings at each side of a backbone are always thiophene, and EWGs are appended from the α-positions. However, the β-position of an end-thiophene is rarely developed when designing new acceptors. Attention should be paid that substitution on the β-position is unfavorable for polymer donors because that substitution could make a twisted conformation to the neighboring rings. However, this is no longer a problem for an acceptor because this is the end group in the ladder-type system.

Very recently, Tang et al. reported a new non-fullerene acceptor, ITC6-IC (in Fig. 18), with long alkyl chains in the terminal electron-donating building blocks to enhance steric hindrance, which made the molecule have a planar structure with a high degree of unified configuration and better solubility in chemical solvents. What's more, the alkyl chains could reduce the structural order of ITC6-IC film, thus enhancing the compatibility of ITC6-IC with polymer donors and facilitating the tunability of blended films. These new results showed that the regiochemistry in OSCs is an area worth studying, and it may provide a new strategy to design high performance materials.

While this review has shown considerable progress with OSCs based on ladder-type acceptors in recent years, and also discussed current design principles and possible modifications with this kind of acceptor, further insightful considerations on physical properties and devices are also needed for next improvements of OSCs. The acceptor is not a unitary material in the active layer in a device, so it is of equal importance to develop highly efficient donors to keep up the pace of emerging effective acceptors.

A number of reasons could explain why this kind of ladder-type molecule is an effective OSC material: its planar backbone has a strong π-orbital overlap that can enlarge the absorption range, it has a relatively low energetic disorder, it may form pure domains but still maintains efficient charge generation, and the out-of-plane side-chains on the fused core can be beneficial for the formation of a favorable interpenetrating donor/acceptor network with a suitable degree of phase separation in the active layers. Thus, these new materials bring many opportunities and challenges in this active research area.
First, lots of researches relating to OSCs have been focused on polymeric donor materials, as they usually have better film morphology and film-forming properties than their monomers. As for the morphology of an active layer, AFM, TEM, R-SoXS, and GIWAXS were used to obtain insights into the behaviors of aggregation and crystallization of donor and acceptor materials. Improved molecular packing and enhanced crystallization of materials can contribute to improvements of Jsc and FF, as improved molecular packing is conducive to an increase in charge-transport characteristics and a reduced recombination. Although semiconducting polymer materials have these morphological advantages, they suffer from difficult purification procedures and synthetic reproducibility, which restricts their commercial development. Therefore, it's a good research direction to develop some small molecular donor materials which are easily synthesized with low cost to build all small molecule blends for OSCs with vast potentials for future development. Some groups have taken a lead in this area but now the most efficient OSCs based on all small molecules still lag behind the widely-studied polymer: ladder-type acceptor OSCs.
On the contrary to the all small molecule OSCs, some researchers realize these ladder-type blocks are also useful for building polymer acceptors, which have been dominated by imide-based acceptors for a long time. For example, the most popular acceptor, N2200, is constructed by these and has the best efficiency. But as Zhang et al. reported, a new high efficiency polymer acceptor with a PCE over 9% was designed and synthesized from being inspired by IDIC which has a planar structure, high electron affinity, as well as high absorbance. This demonstrates the great potential of a polymer acceptor in coupling with polymer acceptors for high performance all polymer PSCs.
A rigid conjugated backbone endows the ladder-type acceptor with the possibility to extend their absorption in the NIR region. It is well known that about 47% of sunlight is in the region of visible light while 53% of it is in this region. It would be very helpful to improve the efficiency of OSCs if near-infrared light could be effectively utilized. If this acceptor is combined with another narrow bandgap donor, then a semitransparent device could be achievable as shown in Fig. 19. What's more, they could be widely used in tandem OSCs, bioimaging, senor, military equipment and so on.
Besides, in the view of manufacturing processes, almost all the reported devices are fabricated by a spin-coating process with a ladder-type acceptor, as shown in Fig. 20. Vacuum sublimation as a viable option should not be ignored. As we know, reproducibility and large-area device's implementation for evaporation techniques are quite superior to the spin-coating technique. Additionally, the organic light emitting diodes (OLED) industry has built up a stream line for large area panels and has great likelihood for success if the OPV materials can be vaporized with high efficiency. Now, the alternatives to fullerenes for vacuum-deposited small-molecule organic solar cells still mainly are comprised of perylene derivatives or halogenated (sub-) phthalocyanines, with the highest PCE of 8.4%. How to design ladder-type non-fullerene acceptor materials suitable for vacuum-deposited small-molecule organic solar cells thus is of interest for industrial researchers.
Moreover, it is a big challenge for NFA-based OSCs to maintain their stability for a long time. Although organic materials show good thermal stability and photo-stability, their morphological stability still needs to be improved. Most ladder-type based solution-processed solar cells with high performance require additional complicated post-cast treatments or additives to optimize their morphology, which can lead to irreproducibility and increased cost. These intricate treatments are unfit for large area production and further development. It's of great significance to develop high performance materials without additional treatments in a device, which can lower the cost and increase the stability.
And lastly, there are still some mechanism issues needing deep study and investigation. It has been reported that some systems can achieve a high Jsc, fill factor, and PCE with low Eloss. But why is it that this only works in certain systems and how does the reduced non-radiative recombination rate contribute to low Eloss? And how can Eloss be further decreased in a more effective way which can be used in most NFA systems? Recently, Hou et al. tentatively proposed that the molecular electrostatic potential maybe is the reason why charge generation can be effective with a small driving force between donor and acceptor. It's essential to further set up appropriate theoretical models of the charge transfer phenomenon to have a deep understanding of Eloss and explore efficient ways to decrease it.

Since 2015, rapid advances have been achieved in ladder-type non-fullerene acceptors; thus in this review, we summarized recently reported non-fullerene acceptors in this system according to different backbones and highlighted some important studies. As a very promising subbranch of non-fullerene acceptors, ladder-type materials have several advantages: (i) various tuning modes in molecular design; (ii) a broad absorption region to harvest solar energy; and (iii) good morphology control. Based on these intrinsic features and the great efforts from many groups, the PCE of NF-OSCs increased from below 6% to over 13% and we were able to outline this rapid-growing research area in this review.

Meanwhile, design guidelines for chemical construction of ladder-type acceptors were also discussed. We noted that modifications primarily focus on backbone variation, side-chain engineering, and end-cap group substitution. Based on these reports, several backbones, such as IDT, IDTT, BDCPDT, PT, etc. have successfully exceeded 10% of PCE, indicating great potential for future optimization. As a comparison, backbones shorter than five-fused rings or longer than nine-fused rings are now inferior to the above-mentioned blocks. A short backbone, in many studies, was proved to possess relative low electron mobility which may inhibit performance in devices. A long backbone, however, shows at least comparable or enhanced electron-mobility. But, we should point out that acceptors with short backbones have a great potential for building wide bandgap acceptors and have achieved some good results. Side-chains also play an important role in tuning the properties of acceptors. Unlike a mono-substituted side chain on the nitrogen atom of traditional imide-based acceptors, the side-chains formed a 3-D conformation along with the rigid backbones and affected intermolecular packing. The end-cap group can directly tailor the electronic properties of acceptors so now it perhaps is the most efficient tool for improving a material's performance. The modes we discussed above are normally based on a symmetrical conformation; actually, an asymmetrical conformation should also be useful in constructing ladder-type acceptors by introducing different side-chains, end-groups, or substantially using an asymmetrical backbone and this definitely needs further investigation in the future.
To construct an ideal NFA-based OSC system, selection of a concerted donor and the NFA is of vital importance. On one hand, the energy level of donors and acceptors should be matched to insure they have complementary absorption in the light spectrum as well as an appropriate driving force for excitons separation. On the other hand, intrinsic morphologic miscibility between donors and acceptors is supposed to be acceptable to make sure the morphology of the active layer is smooth and homogeneous. As for donor materials, they should not only have good stability in organic solvents, but also have a tendency towards aggregation and self-assembly when forming a film in a device fabrication process. Yang et al. proposed that developing NFA materials with strong absorption in the NIR region and blue region is the key for further development of NFA solar cells, especially for tandem cells. Accordingly, donor materials with medium and wide band gaps deserve further future attention.
Ladder-type acceptor research has been extensively explored in just a few years, which soon became a very hot topic for fundamental studies. Although there has been an accumulation of information on the design principles and mechanistic understanding of these materials, there will be plenty of room for next opportunities and challenges. Many possibilities still remain to be explored and hopefully we have listed part of them by analyzing the publications of many excellent papers in various journals. We enthusiastically look forward to the new advancements in this exciting area of research.
In the end, we wish that this review may provide a clear panorama of these novel functional materials for OPV academia and attract more chemists and physicists to move them towards massive industrial applications.
