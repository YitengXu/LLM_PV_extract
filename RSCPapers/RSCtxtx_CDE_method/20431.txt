Two soluble isomeric acceptor molecules based on a triptycene core, which is connected to three aroylenimidazole units are described. Due to the inherent threefold axis, the molecules are soluble and thus could be fully photophysically characterized in solution and film. Additionally, the preliminary results of these acceptors in organic photovoltaic devices with two different donor materials are reported.

The power conversion efficiency of bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ OSCs) has dramatically increased in recent years mainly due to the ongoing development of new donor polymers and oligomers. These donor materials exhibit photophysical and electrochemical properties tailored to fit those of fullerene derivatives (PC61BM and PC71BM) which are used as electron acceptors. Recently, research efforts to replace fullerene acceptors have increased due to the existence of a large number of compounds that show promise as alternative electron acceptors because of their spectroscopic and electrochemical properties. In particular, rylenediimide and aroylenimidazole derivatives exhibit excellent molecular properties as electron acceptors such as appropriate energetics, large extinction coefficients and good thermal and photostabilities. Despite these attractive properties, no reports exist concerning the application of aroylenimidazoles as electron acceptors in BHJ OSCs, mainly because the majority of these π-systems are planar and self-assemble in a fashion that is disadvantageous for the formation of an ideal donor:acceptor morphology. By incorporating acceptor units in molecules with a nonplanar geometry, a number of non-fullerene acceptors have been successfully processed in BHJ OSCs with efficiencies of up to 8.3%. In 2012, Liu and Troisi gave a structural suggestion for the design of new non-fullerene acceptors based on two acceptor units, such as naphthalene diimides (NDIs), or perylenediimides (PDIs), which are connected via a rigid methine unit. Due to the fact that in triptycene three aromatic benzene units are connected via two methine bridgeheads, it is an ideally suited molecular scaffold to place three electron acceptor units in a fashion similar to the one proposed by Liu and Troisi. Furthermore, photoelectron spectroscopy studies suggest that there is an electronic communication between the three benzene units of triptycene by homoconjugation. Although triptycenes with extended π-planes have been reported, to the best of our knowledge, none of these compounds have been used as acceptors in BHJ OSCs to date. We were interested in the synthesis of triptycenes with aroylenimidazole units, which have nearly ideal LUMO levels and high extinction coefficients. Additionally, due to the inherent ‘three-bladed’ molecular geometry, a better phase separation of these new electron-acceptors in BHJ OSCs is expected in comparison to their planar congeners. Here, we present the synthesis of two isomeric rigid π-extended triptycenes with three aroylenimidazole units and first tests of these compounds as non-fullerene acceptors in BHJ OSCs with poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) and poly({4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b0]dithiophene-2,6-diyl}{3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl}) (PTB7) as donor materials.

The synthesis of the C3v-symmetric isomer 7a (Scheme 1) starts from triptycene triamine 1a, which was converted in three steps into the triaminotrinitro triptycene 4a according to the protocol described earlier by MacLachlan et al. for the Cs-symmetric isomer 4b. In contrast to the procedure described by MacLachlan, the intermediate N-acylated triptycene 2a was isolated in almost quantitative yields simply by filtration of the resulting precipitate obtained after 3 h of stirring the reaction mixture at room temperature. Subsequent nitration within 10 min with fuming nitric acid results in 3a with yields of 79%. In comparison to the previously described procedure, the overall reaction time was significantly reduced and the combined yield for the two-step method is even higher than that for the one-pot method. Hydrolysis of amide 3a was performed using a mixture of aqueous conc. hydrochloric acid and ethanol under reflux conditions for 12 h giving triaminotrinitro triptycene 4a in 62% yield after column chromatography.
The Cs-symmetric isomer 4b was synthesized from 1b using the same reaction sequences (see ESI) in 75% yield; in comparison, by the procedure described by MacLachlan the same compound was isolated in 42% overall yield. The next step was the condensation of 4a and 4b with naphthalene monoimide (NMI) 5, which was synthesized by using naphthalenetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride and 2,6-diisopropylaniline (see ESI). On the basis of literature protocols, several conditions for the condensation of 4a and 5 to the trisnaphthaleneimide 6a have been tested, with the finding that the conversion works best in quinoline at 180 °C in the presence of zinc acetate dehydrate, giving 6a in 61% yield after the separation of the reaction mixture by size exclusion chromatography. The nitro groups have been reduced with tin(II) chloride in ethyl acetate at 85 °C and subsequently the second threefold condensation to the C3v-symmetric tris aryolenimidazole 7a has been performed in DMF at 140 °C in yields of 23%. It is worth mentioning that the final condensation step in the syntheses of aroylenimidazoles rarely occur in yields higher than 16–30%. The Cs-symmetric isomer 7b has been achieved under the same conditions from 6b in similar yields (18%) (Scheme 2).
All NDI containing compounds (6a/6b and 7a/7b) have been investigated by UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy (see Table 1 and the ESI) as well as cyclovoltammetry. For compounds 7a and 7b ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) was also carried out (see Fig. 1 and Table 1).

For both isomeric pairs (6a/6b and 7a/7b) the absorption spectra are comparable. 6a/6b show two pronounced vibrational fine-structured maxima at λ = 360 and 381 nm, which can be assigned to the π–π* transition of the NDI units (see ESI). 7b exhibits strong absorptions at λ = 331 nm with a maximum extinction coefficient of ε = 5.28 × 104 M−1 cm−1. Similarly to 7b, 7a absorbs at 329 nm (ε = 5.01 × 104 M−1 cm−1). Furthermore, two very broad maxima at λ = 412 nm and 486 of 490 nm, respectively, can be observed. Compared to the absorption in solution, the spin-casted films of the two isomers show slightly bathochromic shifted peaks (ca. 25 nm) which can best be explained by stronger π–π interactions of the molecules due to a closer packing in the solid state. From the onset of their longest wavelength absorptions (at 564 nm for both isomers) the optical bandgap of both isomers is estimated to be 2.2 eV in solution. The compounds 7a/b each show a broad peak in the emission spectrum recorded in CH2Cl2 with a maximum at λ = 622 nm and a Stokes shift of 130 nm resulting in an orange-red fluorescence (see Fig. 1). The quantum yields (φ = 10 ± 3% for 7a and φ = 12 ± 3% for 7b) for both compounds are comparable.
The electrochemical properties of C3v- and Cs-symmetrical compounds 7a and 7b have been investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Again no significant differences between the two isomers could be detected. In Fig. 2 the CV of the C3v-symmetric isomer 7a is depicted, showing two reversible reduction waves at E1/2 = −1.0 V and E1/2 = −1.5 V against Fc/Fc+ as the internal standard. The HOMO and LUMO energies were found to be ELUMO = −3.6 eV and EHOMO = −5.8 eV assuming the absolute energy level of Fc/Fc+ to be 5.1 eV. 7b exhibits a slightly different ELUMO value (−3.7 eV) than 7a, and a EHOMO at −5.9 eV. These values are in agreement with density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Gaussian at the B3LYP/6-31G** level), which show two degenerated LUMOs for both isomers at −3.4 eV and one HOMO each at −5.9 eV (Fig. 3). Whereas the degenerated LUMO orbitals are located on the naphthalene imide units, the HOMO orbitals are found at the central triptycene core, showing an alternation in phase contribution of the wave functions, which suggest a homoconjugation over all three triptycene blades. The energetics and optical properties of both compounds 7a and 7b in film were investigated by ultra-violet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) and UV-vis spectroscopy (see Fig. S33, ESI). Based on the high energy edge of the valence band, the ionization potential of both 7a and 7b is found to be −6.3 eV. The optical gap in the film was measured to be 2.1 eV, allowing us to estimate the electron affinity of both compounds to be −4.2 eV. These values suggest the use of 7a and 7b as electron-acceptor for BHJ OSCs. P3HT and PTB7 revealed an efficient transfer of charge between donor and acceptor molecules (see ESI).
Although low electron mobilities of μ = 3.6 × 10−6 and 4.1 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been measured, both aroylenimidazole isomers 7a and 7b were preliminarily investigated as non-fullerene acceptor materials in BHJ OSC devices. With P3HT as the donor material with an inverted cell architecture, cells with both 7a and 7b give open circuit voltages of VOC ∼ 0.5 V, which are compatible with the calculated energetics. Short circuit currents of JSC ∼ 1 mA cm−2 and fill factors of 36% or 39% respectively have been measured, resulting in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 0.2%. The low short circuit currents could be explained by an unfavorable donor:acceptor phase separation, which has been observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM, see the ESI). We suggest that the unfavorable morphology can be explained by the mismatch in the solubility of the donor and acceptor (low solubility of 7 at ∼16 mg mL−1 compared to that of P3HT at ∼60 mg mL−1). With PTB7 as the donor material, VOC could be increased to 0.75 V and JSC to 3.5 and 3.75 mA cm−2, respectively for 7a and 7b. Therefore, the PCE was increased to 1.0%.
To conclude, we have synthesized three-dimensional molecules consisting of aroylenimidazole units, which has been fully photophysically characterized in solution. To the best of our knowledge, this has been difficult for other congeners of this substrate class. The energy levels of the compounds 7a/7b reveal that this new class of compounds can act as potential non-fullerene acceptor material in BHJ OSCs. Preliminary tests to incorporate the compounds into solar cell devices showed for the first time that these materials could be used as acceptors, giving PCEs of about 1% for both isomers. Further directions in the investigation will include the use of other donor materials as well as increasing the solubility of the aroylenimidazole acceptor compounds to be able to tune the microstructure of the BHJ towards higher efficiencies.
