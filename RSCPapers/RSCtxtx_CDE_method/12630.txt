In organic solar cells (OSCs), the vast majority of photovoltaic materials are concentrated in unipolar materials, but bifunctional small molecule materials that can work as donors and acceptors have rarely been studied and their photovoltaic performance severely lags behind that of their unipolar counterparts. Herein, a novel A–DA′D–A small molecule material with an electron-deficient core as the central unit and rhodanine as the terminal group, namely BPM1, was designed and synthesized. BPM1 exhibits strong absorption in the range from 400 nm to 660 nm and possesses the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of −5.38 eV and −3.61 eV, respectively. More importantly, BPM1 displays bipolar charge transport properties, with an electron and hole mobility of 6.10 × 10−4 and 4.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Therefore, BPM1 can work as a donor and acceptor for OSC applications. As an acceptor, paired with the donor P3HT, the BPM1 based devices showed a superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.1% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.09 V. On the other hand, as a donor, blending with the acceptor Y6, the BPM1 based devices exhibited an optimal PCE of 10.5%. Ternary devices based on BPM1:PM7:Y6 (1:0.1:1, w/w) showed an excellent PCE of 14.8% with an improved short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Notably, either as a donor or an acceptor, the PCEs are the highest values for OSCs based on bifunctional materials. This work may provide a new insight for the design of high-efficiency organic photovoltaic materials and promote the development of bifunctional small molecule materials for OSC applications in the future.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn much attention during the past several decades due to their outstanding advantages in fabricating low-cost, light-weight, solution-processible and flexible devices. The state-of-the-art OSCs with bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structures have realized outstanding performances with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 19.0% for single-junction solar cells, which greatly benefits from the development of photoactive materials and device engineering. To date, unipolar photoactive materials which can be classified into hole-dominated p-type ones and electron-dominated n-type ones have been extensively studied for high-efficiency OSCs. Bifunctional small molecule materials that can act as both a donor and an acceptor for OSC applications have also shown great potential in developing new material systems and expanding material versatility. However, the related studies are rarely reported, and the performance of the corresponding devices severely lags behind their unipolar counterparts as shown in Fig. 1. For instance, a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivative was developed by Chen et al., named F(DPP)2B2, in which the electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) are calculated to be 2.80 × 10−4 and 4.30 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The PCEs were more than 3.0% when F(DPP)2B2 worked as either an electron donor or acceptor. In addition, two bipolar small molecule materials named DRCN5TT and DRCN3TT were designed by Chen et al., employing an electron-rich TT unit as the core to build the backbone. When DRCN5TT worked as a donor and blended with PC71BM, the device delivered a PCE of 7.0%. With DRCN3TT as an acceptor, a PCE of 3.6% was obtained in the P3HT:DRCN3TT device. In 2018, a small molecule bipolar material DTFBR was synthesized by Sun et al., presenting a nearly planar backbone structure. When DTFBR served as an acceptor, the P3HT:DTFBR device showed a coarse surface morphology, resulting in a PCE of 3.6%. On the other hand, a PCE of 2.4% was obtain in the DTFBR:PC71BM device. Therefore, the development of new bifunctional small molecule materials for high-performance OSCs is challenging but meaningful to the design of active layer materials.

From the perspective of photovoltaic material design, several aspects must be taken into consideration to design bifunctional materials: (1) a strong and complementary absorption with the selected donor or acceptor is supposed to enable a high short circuit current density (Jsc); (2) suitable energy levels are required to match the paired materials in the blend films to ensure sufficient driving force for exciton separation; (3) both high hole and electron mobilities can ensure efficient charge transport in the blend films; (4) appropriate miscibility with the blending donor or acceptor to promote proper phase separation and well interpenetrating network structure formation. Based on the above mentioned and inspired by the design of the state-of-the-art fused ring small molecule acceptors, in this work, a small molecule BPM1 was developed, as shown in Fig. 1, featuring the structure of A–DA′D–A, with dithieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-e:2′,3′-g][2,1,3]benzothiadiazole (BTP) as the central unit (DA′D) and rhodanine as the end group (A). The BTP core will promote the delocalization of π electrons and enables more effective charge transfer due to a better planarity structure. Rhodanine terminal groups can adjust molecular absorption and packing, and the HOMO/LUMO energy levels. Thus, BPM1 possesses appropriate energy levels, along with dual carrier transport properties, allowing it to work as a bifunctional small molecule material for both an electron donor and acceptor in OSCs. As an acceptor, combining with P3HT as the donor, the BPM1 based devices exhibited an outstanding PCE of 7.1% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.09 V. As a donor, paired with the acceptor Y6, the BPM1 based binary devices showed an optimal PCE of 10.5% with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 22.9 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 53.1%. The ternary device with PM7 as the morphology modulator exhibited an excellent PCE of 14.8% with an improved Jsc of 25.3 mA cm−2 and FF of 69.6%. Notably, either as a donor or an acceptor, the PCEs are the highest values for OSCs based on bifunctional small molecule materials.

The detailed synthesis route of BPM1 is presented in Scheme S1 in the ESI, and 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MALDI-TOF mass spectra are provided in the ESI. The targeted molecule was prepared by a Knoevenagel condensation reaction with high yield, and it displayed good solubility in common organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, chloroform and toluene at room temperature. The molecular geometry of BPM1 was investigated with density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d, p) level, where all of the alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups to simplify the calculations (Fig. S1). BPM1 possesses a superior planar backbone with a dihedral angle between the fused ring core and terminal groups of 0.02°, which is conducive to intermolecular interactions. Meanwhile, both the HOMO and LUMO of BPM1 are delocalized over the entire molecular backbone. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were employed to investigate the thermal properties of BPM1. As shown in Fig. S2a, a good thermal stability of BPM1 was indicated by its decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of 350 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. S2b, BPM1 shows an endothermic peak at 192 °C with a melting enthalpy of 15.9 J g−1 and an exothermic peak at 127 °C with a crystal enthalpy of 11.0 J g−1. These results indicate the good solubility and thermal stability of the bifunctional material, which can meet the requirement of device fabrication.


The normalized ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of BPM1 in solution and film are displayed in Fig. 2b. In chloroform dilute solution, BPM1 shows strong absorption in the range of 400–660 nm. From the solution to the thin film, the maximum absorption peak redshifts from 585 nm to 626 nm and the absorption range shows significant extension, implying a strong intermolecular interaction in thin film. The optical band gap of BPM1 is estimated to be 1.80 eV based on the absorption edge (689 nm) of the BPM1 neat film. Besides, BPM1 displayed a complementary absorption with the star polymer donor P3HT and small molecule acceptor Y6 (ref. 19) (Fig. S3a and b), respectively, which is beneficial to achieve a high Jsc. The energy level of BPM1 was measured by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) characterization. As shown in Fig. S3c, the onset oxidation (φox) and reduction potential (φre) values of BPM1 are 0.67 eV and −1.10 eV vs. Ag/Ag+, respectively. Herein, according to the equations: HOMO = −e(φox + 4.71) (eV) and LUMO = −e(φre + 4.71) (eV), as depicted in Fig. 2c, the HOMO and LUMO levels of BPM1 are calculated to be −5.38 eV and −3.61 eV, respectively. BPM1 possesses high-lying HOMO and LUMO levels compared to Y6 (−5.65 eV and −4.10 eV) and low-lying HOMO and LUMO levels in comparison with P3HT (−5.00 eV and −3.10 eV). The energy level offsets between BPM1 and P3HT or Y6 can provide driving force to ensure sufficient exciton dissociation and charge transport.


The space charge limited current (SCLC) method was applied to evaluate charge-carrier mobilities in a BPM1 neat film (Fig. S4). Hole-only and electron-only devices were fabricated with the structures of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/BPM1/MoO3/Al and ITO/ZnO/BPM1/poly[(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]dibromide (PFN-Br)/Al, respectively. The μe and μh of BPM1 were calculated to be 6.10 × 10−4 and 4.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Thus, BPM1 can serve as a donor and acceptor due to the appropriate HOMO/LUMO level and dual carrier transport properties. In order to clearly contrast, the μe and μh values for reported bipolar small molecule materials are summarized in Fig. 2d. The higher and more balanced dual carrier transport behaviors indicate that BPM1 will be a promising bifunctional small molecule material for OSC applications.


OSC devices with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layers/PFN-Br/Al were fabricated to investigate the bifunctional properties of BPM1 in OSCs. The detailed device optimization process can be found in Fig. S5–S7 and Tables S1–S8. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best-performing OSCs and corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 3a and c, respectively. All related photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. When BPM1 worked as an acceptor, a poor performance with a very inferior PCE of 1.1% was displayed in P3HT:BPM1 as-cast devices (Fig. S5 and Table S2). Afterwards, P3HT:BPM1 devices under thermal annealing (TA) at 130 °C for 10 min achieve an outstanding PCE of 7.1% with a high Voc of 1.09 V, a Jsc of 11.4 mA cm−2 and a FF of 57.0%. Compared to the as-cast devices, the improved Jsc as well as FF are the main reasons for their high performances when the devices are under TA treatment (discussed right below). As a donor, blended with the acceptor Y6, the BPM1 based devices achieve a good PCE of 10.5% with a Voc of 0.86 V, Jsc of 22.9 mA cm−2 and a FF of 53.1% by solvent vapor annealing (SVA) with carbon disulfide (CS2). Clearly, the BPM1:Y6 devices exhibit an undesirable FF and Jsc. To address this issues, polymer donor PM7 as a morphology modulator was introduced into the optimized BPM1:Y6 devices to improve the phase separation and domain size of blend films, resulting in the corresponding devices achieving an excellent PCE of 14.8% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 25.3 mA cm−2 and an FF of 69.6%. Furthermore, a good repeatability is displayed in Fig. 3b, the statistical efficiencies of 30 devices show Gaussian distribution, and the average value reaches 6.8%, 10.2% and 14.5% for the P3HT:BPM1, BPM1:Y6 and BPM1:PM7:Y6 devices, respectively. Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that the PCEs of BPM1 devices are the highest for OSCs based on bifunctional materials, both as a donor and an acceptor (Fig. 3d).

The EQE characterization is depicted in Fig. 3c. When BPM1 worked as an acceptor, the EQE curve of P3HT:BPM1 devices indicates a photo-response in the range of 400–660 nm. On the other hand, the EQE curves of BPM1:PM7:Y6 devices where BPM1 is the donor exhibit a stronger photo-response compared with the optimized BPM1:Y6 devices, which is in good agreement with the higher Jsc.

To investigate the exciton dissociation and charge collection process in devices, the plots of photocurrent (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves were collected (Fig. S8). We obtained the exciton dissociation efficiency (Pdiss) and charge collection efficiency (Pcoll) of the devices by testing (see the ESI for a detailed explanation). As an acceptor, the values of Pdiss (95.0%) and Pcoll (72.7%) in P3HT:BPM1 devices with TA treatment are higher than the values of Pdiss (67.0%) and Pcoll (35.6%) with the as-cast (Table S9). On the other hand, as a donor, it is noteworthy that adding a small amount of PM7 will obtain a higher Pdiss (95.4%) and Pcoll (85.0%) compared to those of the BPM1:Y6-based devices (Pdiss = 84.2% and Pcoll = 65.7%). Improving exciton dissociation and charge collection are consistent with the enhanced photovoltaic parameters of the devices.

The charge recombination process was further analysed by measuring the light intensity (Plight) dependence of Voc and Jsc. The Voc as a function of the Plight can be described as Voc ∝ n(kT/q)lnPlight, (k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in kelvin, and q is the elemental charge). Generally, the slope of Vocversus lnPlight was used to estimate the type of trap assisted or bimolecular recombination in devices, and closing to kT/q implies that bimolecular recombination dominates in devices. As shown in Fig. S9a, the slope of the P3HT:BPM1-based devices with TA treatment was calculated to be 1.38 kT/q, which is much smaller than that of the as-cast devices (4.59 kT/q), indicating that trap assisted recombination was suppressed. On the other hand, the slopes of devices based on optimized BPM1:Y6 and BPM1:PM7:Y6 were 1.33 kT/q and 1.11 kT/q (Fig. S9b), respectively. Obviously, the PM7-doped devices suffered from less trap assisted recombination and the bimolecular recombination was dominant in devices. Meanwhile, the Plight dependence of Jsc was further measured to probe the bimolecular recombination degree in these devices. We adopt the formula of Jsc ∝ (Plight)α to describe the relationship of Jsc and Plight, where the exponent α can reflect the bimolecular recombination degree. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the related α values of the optimal P3HT:BPM1, BPM1:Y6 and BPM1:PM7:Y6 devices were 0.959, 0.960 and 0.964, respectively, indicating negligible bimolecular recombination in these devices. The charge recombination can be effectively suppressed in optimal P3HT:BPM1 and BPM1:PM7:Y6 devices, accounting for the variation in Jsc and FF.
The μh and μe of the active layers were also analysed to investigate the charge transport behaviour in the blend films. As depicted in Fig. S10 and Table S10, the μh/μe for P3HT:BPM1 blend films with TA treatment was 7.75 × 10−4/1.25 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was higher compared with the blend films based on as-cast (1.78 × 10−4 and 4.69 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1). On the other hand, for the optimized BPM1:Y6 device, μh and μe were calculated to be 2.61 × 10−5 and 1.98 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and the ratio of μh/μe was 1.32. Furthermore, the BPM1:PM7:Y6 device exhibited a higher and more balanced charge-carrier mobility than the optimized BPM1:Y6, of which μh, μe, and μh/μe values were determined to be 5.79 × 10−4, 4.92 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.18, respectively. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 4c and d, transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) were determined to evaluate the charge extraction time (τ1) and charge carrier lifetimes (τ2) in the corresponding devices. As an acceptor, the P3HT:BPM1 devices with TA treatment exhibited a faster carrier extraction time (τ1 = 0.09 μs) and a longer carrier lifetime (τ2 = 0.98 μs) than the as-cast deices (τ1 = 0.19 μs and τ2 = 0.44 μs). As a donor, the optimized BPM1:PM7:Y6 devices showed a shorter carrier extraction time (τ1 = 0.17 μs) than those of BPM1:Y6 (τ1 = 0.22 μs), and the carrier lifetimes (τ2) of BPM1:Y6 and BPM1:PM7:Y6 were 1.02 μs and 1.58 μs, respectively. These results suggest a more efficient charge extraction and charge transfer in optimized P3HT:BPM1 and BPM1:PM7:Y6-based devices, supporting the significant enhancement of Jsc and FF.

To explore the crystallinity and molecular packing properties in neat and blend films, grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was employed. The 2D pattern and 1D line-cut intensity profiles in the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) directions of blended films are displayed in Fig. 5, and those of neat films are given in Fig. S11. The corresponding diffraction data are listed in Tables S11 and S12, which are going to be meticulously discussed below. The BPM1 neat film processed by THF showed a broad scattering peak in a large azimuthal angle (Fig. S11a), which comes from the amorphous content in the BPM1 film. Blending with P3HT, as shown in Fig. 5a and b, two blend films are dominated with a face-on orientation. After TA treatment, the OOP (010) π–π stacking distance decreased from 3.83 to 3.76 Å, and the IP (100) lamellar distance decreased from 16.98 to 16.53 Å. Meanwhile, the crystallite coherence length (CCL) of OOP (010) diffraction increased from 20.19 to 29.76 Å and the CCL of IP (100) diffraction significantly increased from 29.76 to 141.37 Å. Besides, a range of lamellar diffraction peaks of h00 in the IP direction appeared. These results indicate more ordered π–π stacking and enhanced crystallinity by TA treatment, which were beneficial to charge transport and collection and resulted in a high Jsc and FF in devices. The BPM1 neat film processed by CF exhibited a preferential “face-on” orientation, featuring a (100) diffraction peak at 0.27 Å−1 in the IP direction and a weak π–π stacking peak (010) at 1.66 Å−1 in the OOP direction (Fig. S11b). As shown in Fig. 5c and e, pairing with the acceptor Y6, the blend films also take a “face-on” orientation, which facilitates vertical charge transport. The CCL values of BPM1:Y6 and BPM1:PM7:Y6 blend films were calculated to be 23.56 Å and 21.75 Å in the OOP (010) direction with a d-spacing slightly increased from 3.63 Å to 3.65 Å, indicating a loose π–π stacking after adding a small amount of PM7 and suppressing the aggregation in all-small molecule (ASM) systems. The result elucidates the variation in Jsc and FF.

To better understand the surface and bulk morphology of the blend films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed. When BPM1 is blended with P3HT, there is an undersized phase separation based on as-cast blend films of P3HT:BPM1 with a root-mean-square surface roughness (Rq) of 0.59 nm (Fig. 6a), which is adverse to forming a suitable morphology and is consistent with the above result of inferior PCE. After TA treatment, as shown in Fig. 6b, an obviously increased Rq value of 2.86 nm was obtained, which contributes to reducing charge recombination. At the same time, the related TEM images revealed a similar tendence (Fig. 6e and f). A better nanofibre network structure was well formed in optimized P3HT:BPM1-based devices, which is conducive to obtaining a high Jsc and FF. When BPM1 is blended with Y6, as depicted in Fig. 6c and d, the Rq value of the optimized BPM1:Y6 and BPM1:PM7:Y6 was measured to be 7.78 nm and 2.57 nm, respectively. The result indicates that the introduction of PM7 can effectively reduce the Rq of the blend film. Besides, after the addition of PM7, a fibrous aggregate structure can be seen in BPM1:PM7:Y6 blend films (Fig. 6g and h), which is beneficial to efficient charge transport. To further confirm the effect of PM7 on the morphology, the contact angles of pure BPM1, PM7 and Y6 films were measured based on water and diiodomethane liquid drops, as shown in Fig. S12. The surface tension (γ) values of BPM1, PM7 and Y6 were calculated on the basis of Wu's model, and the relevant parameters are summarized in Table S13. Furthermore, the miscibility of PM7 and Y6 with the bifunctional small molecule material BPM1 was evaluated from Flory–Huggins interaction parameters (χD–A). According to the above theory, the closer the γ of these two materials are, the smaller the parameter χ is. The χ between PM7 and Y6 was calculated to be 0.024κ, which is much lower than 0.124κ for BPM1/Y6, indicating good compatibility between PM7 and Y6. Consequently, PM7 was introduced into BPM1:Y6, regulating the morphology and forming a suitable phase separation.

In summary, a bifunctional small molecule material named BPM1 with a BTP-fused unit as the central core and 3-butylrhodanine as the end group has been successfully developed. BPM1 displays appropriate HOMO/LUMO energy levels, as well as dual carrier transport properties that enable it to act as a bifunctional material for both a donor and an acceptor in OSCs. When BPM1 is used as an acceptor and blended with P3HT, the devices based BPM1 obtain a high PCE of 7.1% and a high Voc of 1.09 V. Meanwhile, as a donor, matching with Y6 as an acceptor, a PCE of 10.5% is achieved by constructing ASM-OSCs. Besides, PM7 as the morphology modulator is introduced into the optimized BPM1:Y6 devices, which can fine-tune the domain size of blend films, resulting in the corresponding devices achieving an impressive PCE of 14.8% with an improved Jsc and FF. Notably, the PCEs in our work are the highest values for OSCs based on bifunctional materials, either as a donor or an acceptor.
