Solution-processed organometal trihalide-based perovskites have attracted attention in the field of solar energy due to their high absorption and low temperature fabrication. We demonstrated the droplet-assisted two-step process of spin coating lead iodide (PbI2) followed by spray coating methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) to prepare a continuous lead iodide perovskite film. A simple airbrush gun was used to control the volume of CH3NH3I, in order to attain a uniform, stoichiometric and continuous perovskite film. An insufficient or excess volume of CH3NH3I gives poor crystallinity and morphology, which gradually reduces the device performance. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.66% was achieved for 100 nm of PbI2 followed by 300 μl of CH3NH3I and annealing at 100 °C for 120 min. To address the reproducibility of the device performance, 50 devices were fabricated for statistical analysis and 80% of the devices showed the average PCE of 10–11% with reproducible JSC, VOC and FF.

Natural energy sources like sunlight, wind, tides and geothermal heat have abundant renewable energy resources that are safe for the environment. Photovoltaic (PV) energy conversion is one of the important techniques used to accomplish today's energy demands. PV energy conversion is the best way to produce electrical energy directly from sunlight, without emitting toxic substances and greenhouse gas and also necessitates less maintenance. Organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells have unique properties with better efficiencies than solely organic and inorganic solar cells. Perovskite-based hybrid solar cells with high efficiencies, which are prepared by a simple solution processing technique, are the most substantial development in recent years. The organic–inorganic perovskite family take the form of an ABX3 (where A = CH3NH3+, B = Pb2+ and X = I−, Cl− and Br−) structure consisting of an organic component in the cuboctahedral A site and an inorganic component in the octahedral B site. The electron-hole diffusion length of methylammonium lead triiodide perovskites (CH3NH3PbI3) is about 100 nm and that of the mixed-halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) is about 1 μm. These high values strengthen the hope for future hybrid solar cells. In recent years, CH3NH3PbI3-based perovskites have achieved 15% efficiency in both mesoporous and planar structures. By using mixed halides (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx), Yang Yang’s group reached a highest efficiency of 19.3%. Several techniques have been used to form uniform perovskite films, including spin coating, thermal evaporation, dip coating, a vapour-assisted process, blade coating and spray coating.

The one-step spin coating process with the mixed perovskite solution of CH3NH3I and PbI2 gives poor film coverage due to the quick reaction between PbI2 and CH3NH3I. In order to overcome pin hole perovskite film formation, two-step processes were identified and widely used, such as the sequential deposition of both PbI2 and CH3NH3I by thermal evaporation, two-step spin coating of PbI2 and CH3NH3I, spin coating of PbI2 followed by dip coating of CH3NH3I and spin coating of PbI2 and vapour deposition of CH3NH3I. In the above techniques, a few defects appeared while using the two-step processes such as PbI2 film peeling and dissolving while dipping in CH3NH3I solution, dissolving the PbI2 layer while spinning CH3NH3I on top layer, and, additionally, thermal deposition requires a high vacuum and is an expensive technique. Some common disadvantages arise while using the abovementioned two-step processes such as precursor wastage and the difficulty in controlling the PbI2 and CH3NH3I stoichiometric ratio. To overcome these problems, we introduce a new two-step process combining the spin and spray coating techniques for pin hole free perovskite film formation. Spray coating the CH3NH3I creates a path to fabricate a large area roll-to-roll process without wasting the precursor which reduces the fabrication cost.
In this manuscript, we report a two-step process of spin coating PbI2 and spray coating CH3NH3I for a continuous pin hole free perovskite film formation. The diffusion of CH3NH3I droplets into the PbI2 provides well-defined grain size with full coverage. The stoichiometric perovskite film could lead to a better crystallinity and an improved device efficiency of 11.6%. Controlling the thickness of PbI2 and the volume of the CH3NH3I precursor solution guides an optimum perovskite thickness which yields better absorption and efficient charge transformation.

Hydroiodic acid (HI) (57 wt% in water), methylamine (CH3NH2) (40 wt% in aqueous solution), lead iodide (PbI2) (99.998%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diethyl ether were purchased from Alfa Aesar and used without further purification. Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was synthesized using the method described by Qi Wang et al. by reacting 15 ml of HI with 13.5 ml of CH3NH2 at 0 °C for 2 h in a three-neck flask under a nitrogen atmosphere with constant stirring. The solvent was evaporated from the mixture using a rotary evaporator and a CH3NH3I white precipitation was observed. The precipitated white powder was collected, washed with diethyl ether three times and dried under vacuum at 60 °C overnight. The dried powder was stored inside a glove box for further use in our experiments.


The ITO-coated glass substrates (<10 Ω sq−1, RiTdisplay) were cleaned through sonication once in detergent (20 min) and subsequently twice in deionized (DI) water (20 min each) and then dried under N2 gas. The substrates were treated with ultraviolet (UV)/ozone for 15 min to clean the surfaces and also to improve the surface adhesion. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the ITO surfaces at 4000 rpm spin speed for 60 s followed by annealing at 130 °C for 30 min. The substrates were transferred to a glove box for the preparation of the perovskite active layer by the two-step method. PbI2 was dissolved in DMSO at 40 wt% and CH3NH3I was dissolved in 2-propanol at 3 wt% and both solutions were kept on the hot plate at 70 °C overnight. The PbI2 solution was spin-coated onto PEDOT:PSS at different spin speeds (from 4k to 8k rpm) and the CH3NH3I solution was directly spray-coated (at room temperature) onto the PbI2 film at different volumes (200 μl to 500 μl). After spraying the CH3NH3I, the sample was kept on the hot plate at 100 °C for 60 to 240 min to form the crystalline perovskite film. The optimized conditions based on device performance were 100 °C annealing for 120 min. The [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) was dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) at a concentration of 20 mg ml−1 and was spun on the perovskite layer at 6000 rpm for 60 s followed by annealing at 100 °C for 30 min. The device structure (see Fig. S1) was completed by the sequential thermal evaporation of C60 (30 nm), 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (7 nm BCP) and 100 nm aluminium electrode through a shadow mask under vacuum (pressure: 1 × 10−6 Torr). The active area of each device was 10 mm2.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded at room temperature using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer equipped with a diffracted beam monochromator set for Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) in the 2θ range 10–80° with a step size of 0.03939° and a step time of 99.45 s. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded using an FEI Noval 200 scanning electron microscope (15 kV). PEDOT:PSS spin-coated glass substrates were used for XRD analysis and PEDOT:PSS spin-coated ITO substrates were used for SEM image recording. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of the samples were measured using an optically excited Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (266 nm, 3–5 ns pulse, 10 Hz) focused on a beam diameter of about 0.5 mm. The absorption spectra of the films were measured using a Jacobs V-670 UV-vis spectrophotometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a PHI 5000 Versa Probe equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). All measurements were performed at room temperature. The devices were illuminated with a solar simulator (Thermal Oriel 1000 W), which provided a simulated AM 1.5 spectrum (100 mW cm−2), inside a glove box using a Xe lamp. The light intensity was calibrated using a mono-silicon photodiode with a KG-5 colour filter (Hamamatsu).

The preparation of the perovskite film based on the two-step process is schematically shown in Fig. 1. At first, the DMSO-based PbI2 solution was spin-coated onto the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate and then the 2-propanol-based CH3NH3I solution was sprayed on top of the PbI2. The air brush sprayer (with a nozzle head size of 0.3 mm and a fluid cup with a capacity of 7 cm3) was connected to an air compressor and the pressure was maintained at 40 psi. The brush sprayer was kept at 12 cm distance from the substrate to make sure that the samples were fully covered while spraying. The CH3NH3I droplets were inter-diffused into the PbI2 during the spraying and the colour of the film started to change from yellow to light brown. PbI2 has a relatively low solubility in 2-propanol; when spraying it will not be damaged and 2-propanol can evaporate faster. After the CH3NH3I was sprayed, immediately the samples were moved to a hot plate at 100 °C to further increase the reaction rate or diffusion process. The film colour changed from light brown to dark brown with a shining surface indicating perovskite formation.

The perovskite film was prepared on a glass substrate by the two-step method with different volumes of the CH3NH3I precursor for XRD characterization. Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD spectra for different volumes of CH3NH3I. The peak at 2θ of 12.71° for 200 μl belongs to unconverted PbI2 which exactly matches with the PbI2 spectrum. The peaks with low intensity at 2θ of 14.19°, 28.51° and 31.94° corresponding to (002), (004) and (310) confirm the partial formation of a tetrahedral perovskite structure. By increasing the CH3NH3I volume to 250 and 300 μl, the peak intensity at 2θ of 14.16° becomes strong without any evidence of the presence of unconverted PbI2. The weaker peaks at 2θ of 28.24°, 28.47° and 31.94° corresponding to (002), (004), (220) and (310) confirm the formation of a tetrahedral perovskite structure. Further increasing the volume to 350 μl, the XRD spectrum contains a peak at 2θ of 11.27°, which represents the unreacted CH3NH3I as well as the perovskite peaks with lower intensities. Fig. 2(b) presents the UV-visible absorbance spectra of the perovskite films fabricated with different volumes of CH3NH3I after annealing at 100 °C for 120 min. The UV-visible spectra reveal the absorption onsets at 800 nm with a broad range from the visible to the near-infrared for all the volumes. Further, the absorption spectra show stoichiometric perovskite formation at 745 nm wavelength. Fig. 2(b) inset shows photographs of the corresponding perovskite films; the film at 200 μl was yellow in colour due to an insufficient amount of CH3NH3I and the colour of the film becomes dark brown by increasing the CH3NH3I volume to 250 and 300 μl. At 350 μl, the unreacted CH3NH3I forms the white cloudy colour on the perovskite and we can almost distinguish unconverted from fully converted perovskite film using our naked eyes based on the colour of the perovskite film. PL measurements were carried for the PEDOT:PSS/PbI2 film with different volumes of sprayed CH3NH3I, as shown in Fig.2(c). With increasing the volume of CH3NH3I from 200 to 350 μl, the PL peak intensity increased and was blue shifted from 773 to 766 nm. For the volumes of 250 and 300 μl, the peak maximum was at 771.85 and 771.25 nm, respectively, which is close to the previously reported stoichiometric perovskite. The PL intensity was increased by increasing the volume from 250 to 300 μl because a greater number of excitons were generated in the crystalline perovskite. The PL intensity was reduced by further increasing the volume to 350 μl, which was due to the poor crystallinity of the perovskite film. The figure inset shows the spectra of the PEDOT:PSS/PbI2 films with a PC61BM quenching layer and different volumes of CH3NH3I. The crystalline perovskite film (250 μl and 300 μl of CH3NH3I) shows better quenching compared to the non-crystalline perovskite film due to the better interface between the perovskite and the quencher.
The morphology of the perovskite film depends on the volume of CH3NH3I over the PbI2 film; to investigate this, SEM images were captured and are shown in Fig. 3. The morphology of the spin-coated PbI2 on PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 3(a)) is cracked with a non-continuous film; cracks started to disappear during the spraying of CH3NH3I. The morphology and grain size of the perovskite film were controlled by controlling the volume of CH3NH3I. Fig. 3(b) shows a uniform perovskite film with a smaller grain size for the 200 μl volume of the sprayed CH3NH3I and by increasing the volume (to 300 μl) the grain sizes were increased because of the stoichiometric ratio of PbI2 and CH3NH3I. Larger grain size enhances the way for efficient charge transfer and a reduction of exciton recombination. There was an excess of CH3NH3I present on the surface of the perovskite while using a volume of 350 μl, which indicates the formation of a non-continuous rough film. For comparison, we included the SEM image of the spin-coated mixed perovskite solution (CH3NH3I:PbI2 (1:0.75) molar ratio) in Fig. S2, which shows a non-continuous rough film with lots of microfibers.
To understand the diffusion of the liquid droplets of CH3NH3I on the PbI2, the XPS depth profile was analysed. The XPS depth profile was measured using an Ar gun in alternative sputtering mode for 100 min sputtering with 3 min of interval time. First, PbI2 in DMSO was spin-coated onto the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate and it was immediately moved for CH3NH3I spraying. The strong interaction between DMSO and Pb2+ can retard the crystal structure of PbI2, which directly allows the CH3NH3I to diffuse and react fully with PbI2. The diffusion of CH3NH3I of two different volumes (200 μl and 300 μl) in the PbI2 film was analysed. While using the 200 μl volume of CH3NH3I, the curve shows a higher distribution of iodide ions than lead ions on the top surface, which starts to drop before reaching the PEDOT:PSS film. An insufficient volume of CH3NH3I produces incomplete conversion and leads to nonstoichiometric perovskite formation as shown in Fig. 4(a). For 300 μl of CH3NH3I, the distributions of lead and iodide ions were similar throughout the film and both started to drop once it reached PEDOT:PSS. The curve clearly shows the diffusion of iodide ions throughout the film and reaching the bottom of the PbI2 layer as shown in Fig. 4(b). The carbon 1s peak starts to rise at the same time as the iodide and lead peaks start to drop after 45 min of sputtering. Complete formation of perovskite film throughout the whole layer was observed while using the 300 μl volume of the CH3NH3I precursor with annealing at 100 °C for 120 min. A volume of 300 μl of CH3NH3I (3 wt%) was enough to fully convert the 100 ± 5 nm of PbI2 film into perovskite film and an insufficient or excess volume provides nonstoichiometric and low crystalline perovskite film.
We fabricated devices having the architecture of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PC61BM/C60/BCP/Al (see Fig. S1) for investigating the PV performance. Here, C60 was used to reduce the trap densities. Fig. 5 shows the J–V characteristics of the device with 100 ± 5 nm of PbI2 thickness with different volumes of CH3NH3I under simulated air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) solar irradiation. There was no delay time between the measurement voltage points in all J–V measurements. All the solar cell performances were measured using an aperture metal mask with a 10 mm2 active area. Table 1 lists the corresponding device parameters. The best performance device was monitored at 300 μl of CH3NH3I followed by annealing (100 °C) for 60 min. The device had a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 20.84 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.91 V and a fill factor (FF) of 58.64%, leading to a high efficiency (η) of 11.12% and an average η of 10.32%. The device performance of the volume with 200 μl (CH3NH3I) shows lower VOC, JSC, FF and η of 0.87 V, 16.45 mA cm−2, 55.69% and 7.97%, respectively, because unconverted PbI2 was still present in the perovskite film. This unconverted PbI2 suppressed the charge transport and absorption of the device performance. Increasing the volume of CH3NH3I to more than 300 μl also shows lower device efficiency of 10.38% with VOC of 0.91 V, JSC of 18.59 mA cm−2 and FF of 61.36%, because the excess amount CH3NH3I leads to a poor crystalline perovskite film. The perovskite film thickness varied from 175 ± 5 nm to 245 ± 5 nm while varying the CH3NH3I volume. We further optimized the thickness effect on the perovskite film by varying the 40 wt% of PbI2 film with different volumes of CH3NH3I. All the devices were annealed for 60 min at 100 °C and the device performance parameters are listed in Table S2. Different spin speeds (4k, 5k, 6k, 7k and 8k rpm) of the PbI2 film show the variation in thickness from 135 ± 5 nm to 80 ± 5 nm. The thicker PbI2 films required a greater volume of CH3NH3I, and vice versa, the thinner films required a smaller volume of CH3NH3I to form stoichiometric perovskite films. Thick perovskite films absorb more light compared to thinner films and are expected to give improved JSC values and better device performances, but exciton recombination was higher in the thicker film because of the limited diffusion length in the iodine-based perovskite film. The best device performance was accomplished for a perovskite film thickness of 220 ± 5 nm, with 100 ± 5 nm (6000 rpm) of the PbI2 film and 300 μl of CH3NH3I (Table 1). For comparison, the J–V characteristics and device performance parameters of the spin (PbI2)/spray (CH3NH3I), spin (PbI2)/spin (CH3NH3I) and one-step mixed solution (CH3NH3I:PbI2 (1:0.75) molar ratio) spin coating are also included in Fig. S3 and Table S1. The corresponding device shows a lower efficiency of 7.38% with poorer JSC and FF values due to the non-uniform film formation in the single step preparation. As optimizing the thickness of PC61BM is also important to improve the device performance, the J–V curves of the perovskite layers with different thicknesses of the PC61BM layers are shown in Fig. S4 and the detailed device parameters are summarized in Table S3. A 130 nm thick PC61BM layer gives lower JSC and FF values leading to poor device performance. This arises due to the high series resistance when a dissociated charge carrier takes a longer distance to reach the electrode. In the case of thinner PC61BM thickness, the charge transportation will be easier and lead to higher JSC and FF values. Too thin PC61BM (∼75 nm) shows decreased device performance because of surface defects in the PC61BM layer. The optimal device performance was obtained for a thin PC61BM layer of 85 nm, yielding a η of 11.55%.

The device performance dependence on the annealing duration was also investigated; the J–V characteristics were monitored for different annealing durations and are shown in Fig. 5(b) and summarized in Table 2. The device with a 120 min annealing period gives a better performance compared to lower and higher annealing durations. During the spraying of CH3NH3I on top of the PbI2, the colour of the perovskite slightly changed from yellow to pale brown which indicates that less reaction is happening between the CH3NH3I and the PbI2. The colour of the film starts to become dark brown during prolonged annealing time and it plays a key role in the crystalline perovskite formation. A shorter annealing duration may lead to unconverted perovskite films and a too long annealing duration may degrade the perovskite film. The optimum annealing time of 120 min gave the better VOC of 0.91 V, JSC of 21.06 mA cm−2 and FF of 60.84% leading to the best η of 11.66% and an average η of 11.17%. To check the reproducibility of the device performance, we repeated the device fabrication in the best conditions for more than 50 samples in four batches. As shown in Fig. 5(c)–(f), the majority of devices displayed a PCE around 11% with an average fill factor of 62%, a short-circuit current of 19 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit voltage of 0.91 V.

The forward and reverse sweep of J–V curve for the champion device is shown in Fig. 6(a), which gives a negligible J–V hysteresis that was observed regardless of the sweep direction. The origin of the J–V hysteresis was mainly attributed to trap formation in the lead halide perovskite materials. The optimized device structure and film formation significantly reduced the J–V hysteresis. Here, we used a continuous perovskite film fabricated by a two step method (spin/spray) and PC61BM as a passivation layer to reduce the trap densities. The best device showed a broad external quantum efficiency (EQE) from 350 to 800 nm and attained a maximum value of 88% at 510 nm as shown in Fig. 6(b). There was a dimple at the wavelength of ∼600 nm in the EQE spectrum, which is due to the strong reflection of glass/ITO at this wavelength. The JSC value integrated from the EQE (18.87 mA cm−2) agreed well with that measured using the solar simulator (20.24 mA cm−2). The integrated JSC from the EQE spectrum was slightly lower than the JSC measured from the solar simulator, because the barrier for the photocurrent was large under monochromatic (or low intensity) illumination and a large number of micro-shunts present when the cell is irradiated only on a limited area.

In summary, we demonstrated a novel two-step preparation combining spin and spray coating techniques to form a continuous, crystalline and stoichiometric lead iodide perovskite for high-efficiency hybrid solar cells. A simple airbrush sprayer was used to spray CH3NH3I, which produced an efficient perovskite film with a best device performance of 11.66%. Complete diffusion of CH3NH3I into PbI2 took place when a sufficient amount of CH3NH3I was provided, and led to highly crystalline and stoichiometric perovskite formation. This combination of techniques provides a new route for the fabrication of low-temperature solution-processed large area roll-to-roll perovskite solar cells.
