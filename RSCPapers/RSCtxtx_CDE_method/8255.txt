A new acceptor S-alkyl thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carbothioate-based acceptor (TTS) was firstly developed via easy of synthesis and applied in the construction of donor–acceptor (D–A) type conjugated polymers, by replacing the alkyl chain of ketone-substituted thieno[3,4-b]thiophene with an alkylthio side chain. Then, two new TTS-based polymers PBDTT-TTSO and PBDTT-TTSE were synthesized by Stille coupling reaction. The TTS acceptor moieties made the polymers exhibit a lower band gap (∼1.5 eV) and appropriate HOMO and LUMO energy levels relative to the fullerene acceptors, which could make the polymers perform well in photovoltaic devices. Solar cells were fabricated with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The polymer PBDTT-TTSO device exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.7% with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.68 V, a short circuit current density (JSC) of 12.7 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 54.6% while the PBDTT-TTSE device yields a higher PCE of 5.8% with a VOC of 0.70 V, a JSC of 14.6 mA cm−2, and a FF of 56.7%. The results indicate that thioester-substituted thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TTS) is a promising building block for further design of high performance photovoltaic polymers.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention because of their potential utility in the production of flexible, light-weight, and low-cost large-area devices through roll-to-roll printing via solution processing. Although the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs has been over 10% for single junction solar cells, it still can't meet the demand of commercialization. Generally, in a typical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSC, the active layer consists of an interpenetrating network formed by an electron-donor material blended with an electron-acceptor fullerene derivative (typically [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)). Currently, the most critical challenge in developing ideal electron-donor materials is to design and synthesize conjugated polymers that simultaneously possess broad and strong absorption band in visible and near-infrared region, high hole mobility, suitable energy levels, good solubility for solution processing, optimal morphology and nanoscale phase separation of the interpenetrating network of the donor/acceptor blend active layer.

Conjugated polymers based on thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) have been studied extensively as low optical band-gap polymers. However, compared with other donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers, the polymers based TT as A building block usually exhibit a lower open circuit voltage (VOC), which is the limiting factor for the device's PCE. Various electron-withdrawing groups such as ester (COOR), ketone (COR), sulfonyl (SO2R), fluorine (F), trifluoromethyl group (CF3), N-alkyl-2,7-dithia-5-azacyclopenta[a]pentalene-4,6-dione (DTPD) have been introduced on the 2 or 3 position of TT to tune the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level to improve VOC.
Moreover, there are only several literatures investigated alkylthio-substituent conjugated polymers so far. In contrast with alkyl chains, alkylthio substituents are of particular interest for several reasons. First, the van der Waals radius of sulfur (∼0.18 nm) is less than that of –CH2 (∼0.20 nm), which will reduce the steric strain slightly. Secondly, the sulfur atom is known to be a weak electron donor due to the poor overlap of its orbital with the π-system on the polymer backbone, which will decrease the HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the polymer. For example, according to the previous report, poly[(3-hexyl-thio)thiophene] (P3HST) showed a lower optical band gap of 1.82 eV compared with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT, 1.85 eV), and the alkylthio side chains decreased the HOMO energy level of the polymer. However, most alkylthio side chains reported were substituted on the D unit of the D–A type conjugated polymers in the form of thioether. Moreover, a potential problem may exist that sulfur atom in thioether compound can be oxidized easily, which may result in an unpredictable effect to the polymer.
Based on the above consideration, we replaced the alkyl chain of ketone-substituted TT with alkylthio side chain to develop a new acceptor S-alkyl thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carbothioate (TTS). To our knowledge, the thioester substituent on the acceptor unit has not been reported. Apart from broadening the optical absorption and decreasing the HOMO energy level as previously mentioned, the antioxidant capacity of sulfur atom of thioester can be enhanced. In addition, compared with the TT-based acceptors mentioned previously, it is easier to synthesize monomer TTS, and the homologous polymers obtained exhibit promising photovoltaic performance. In this work, we reported the synthesis and characterization of two new polymers PBDTT-TTSO and PBDTT-TTSE, which consisted of benzodithiophene (BDT) and TTS moieties substituted with octyl or 2-ethylhexyl groups, respectively. Both polymers utilize light absorption to exceed 800 nm. Meanwhile, the two polymers show favorably aligned HOMO and LUMO energy levels relative to that of conventional fullerene acceptors. The photovoltaic performance of PBDTT-TTSE devices display a VOC of 0.70 V, a short circuit current density (JSC) of 14.6 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 56.7%, and a PCE of 5.80%. This work demonstrates that the new thioester-substituted acceptor TT moiety is a promising building block for high performance PSCs.

The synthetic routes for monomers and polymers are shown in Scheme 1. Firstly, 3,4-dibromothiophene was mono-lithiated by n-BuLi and subsequently quenched with dimethylformamide (DMF) to produce compound 2 in 82% yield. Then a mixture of compound 2, ethyl thioglycolate and potassium carbonate was heated at 80 °C for 12 h with copper(II) oxide nanopowder as the catalyst to provide thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate (3) in 54% yield. Compound 3 was brominated with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) at room temperature to give compound 4 in 70% yield. After hydrolysis in the alkali medium, the corresponding TT carboxylic acid was obtained. Finally, the monomer 6 can be obtained by the condensation of the carboxylic acid and the corresponding thioalcohol (RSH).

The polymers PBDTT-TTSO and PBDTT-TTSE were synthesized by Stille coupling reaction with tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4) as the catalyst. The crude products were precipitated in methanol and collected by filtration. Soxhlet purification afforded the black polymers. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis using tetrahydrofuran as an eluent provided a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 18.5 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.01 for PBDTT-TTSO and a Mn of 25.3 kDa with a PDI of 1.88 for PBDTT-TTSE, with respect to a polystyrene standard.

The thermal properties of the polymers were examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the TGA curves are shown in Fig. 1. In the TGA measurement, the decomposition temperatures (Td) at a 5% weight loss occurred under a nitrogen atmosphere are as high as 374 °C and 380 °C for PBDTT-TTSO and PBDTT-TTSE, respectively, which show good thermal stabilities. It is adequate for the fabrication of PSCs and other optoelectronic devices.


The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the polymers PBDTT-TTSO and PBDTT-TTSE in dilute chloroform solution and as thin films are shown in Fig. 2. The optical properties of the polymers are listed in Table 1. Both polymers show very similar optical characteristics, covering a broad absorption range from 300 nm to 800 nm. The absorption peaks at short wavelength are originated from π–π* transition of the polymer main chains and side chains, while the absorption peaks at long wavelength could be attributed to the strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the electron-rich moieties and electron-deficient segments in the polymer backbones. The absorption peak of the polymer PBDTT-TTSO has a red shift of 19 nm as thin film compared to the absorption peak of 644 nm in dilute chloroform solution. Meanwhile, PBDTT-TTSE shows the absorption peak at 661 nm and an enhanced band at 712 nm in solid film, which indicates slightly increased π–π stacking. The absorption edges of PBDTT-TTSO and PBDTT-TTSE are at 816 and 827 nm corresponding to the optical band gaps of 1.52 and 1.50 eV, respectively. The optical band gaps are lower than those of ester or ketone-substituted polymer PBDTTT-E-T (1.58 eV) and PBDTTT-C-T (1.58 eV). The results also support the viewpoint that the alkylthio side chain can broaden the optical absorption mentioned previously.

Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out to measure the molecular energy levels of the polymers. The redox potentials are estimated from the onsets of the oxidation and reduction. All voltammograms were calibrated using the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as the standard, and their energy levels are assumed at −4.8 eV relative to vacuum. The potential of this internal standard under the same condition was 0.39 eV versus saturated calomel electrode (SCE). As shown in Fig. 3a, the onsets of oxidation and reduction of PBDTT-TTSO are observed at +0.92 and −0.70 V vs. SCE. The corresponding HOMO and LUMO energy levels are estimated to be −5.33 and −3.71 eV according to the empirical equation: EHOMO/LUMO = −(Eox/red + 4.41) eV. Similarly, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PBDTT-TTSE are determined to be −5.36 and −3.73 eV (Table 1). The HOMO energy levels of PBDTT-TTSO and PBDTT-TTSE calculated from CV curves are similar to that of DTPD-based polymers PEBDTPD (−5.37 eV). Although the branched side chain can slightly decrease the HOMO level compared to the linear side chain in accordance with that of ester or DTPD-substituted polymers reported, the energy levels of both polymers are in the ideal range for the high PCEs according to Brabec's estimation if taking the LUMO energy level of PC71BM as −4.1 eV (Fig. 3b). As well known, the VOC is mainly dependent on the difference between the HOMO energy level of the donor and the LUMO energy level of the fullerene acceptor, the relatively deep-lying HOMO levels of two polymers could give a high VOC in solar cells.


In order to investigate the potential applications of both polymers in solar cells, the BHJ-PSCs were fabricated with device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM/Ca/Al, where PEDOT:PSS and Ca layers were employed as buffer layers to facilitate hole and electron extractions. The devices were tested under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The current density–voltage curves of the polymer/PC71BM devices are shown in Fig. 4a and the optimized photovoltaic performance with 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO, 3%, v/v) are listed in Table 2. The device based on PBDTT-TTSO/PC61BM (1:1.5, w/w) exhibits a VOC of 0.67 V, a JSC of 11.8 mA cm−2 and a FF of 54.7%, yielding a PCE of 4.33%. When replacing PC61BM with PC71BM, the JSC can increase to 12.7 mA cm−2 while the VOC and FF almost remain unchanged. In comparison, the VOC of PBDTT-TTSE device is ∼0.02 V higher than that of PBDTT-TTSO, which is well consistent with their HOMO energy levels (−5.33 eV and −5.36 eV, respectively) (Table 1). The optimized photovoltaic performance of PBDTT-TTSE/PC71BM demonstrates a VOC of 0.70 V, a JSC of 14.6 mA cm−2, a FF of 56.7%, and a PCE of 5.80%, which is almost the same as that of non-fluorine substituted TT-based polymers including ester-substituted polymer PBDTTT-E-T (6.21%), DTPD-based polymers PEBDTPD (5.30%), and sulfonyl-based polymers PBDTTT-S-T (5.93%).

EQE spectra were measured under illumination of monochromatic light shown in Fig. 4b. The EQE curves of the devices show a good photo response in the 300–800 nm regions, which coincides with the corresponding absorption spectra. It is observed that the EQE value of PBDTT-TTSE is higher than that of PBDTT-TTSO in the range (430–800 nm). The highest value for PBDTT-TTSE can exceed 60% at 460 and 650 nm. The result agrees well with the higher JSC and PCE of PBDTT-TTSE than PBDTT-TTSO.
The hole mobilities of the polymers were investigated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. High mobility could guarantee effective charge carrier transport to the electrodes and reduce the photocurrent loss in photovoltaic devices. The hole only mobilities of the blend films were measured with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM (100 nm)/Au. The SCLC model is described by

here,
J stands for current density, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium, μ is the hole mobility, V is the internal potential in the device and L is the thickness of the active layer. The internal potential V is obtained by subtracting the built-in voltage (Vbi) and the voltage drop (Vs) from the series resistance of the substrate from the applied voltage (Vappl), accordingly: V = Vappl − Vbi − Vs. The relationship between current and voltage in the hole-only devices of polymer films is shown in Fig. 5 and the calculated hole mobilities of polymers are listed in Table 2. The hole mobility of PBDTT-TTSO is determined at 4.75 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 while the hole mobility of PBDTT-TTSE film is three times as that of PBDTT-TTSO, which can reach 1.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The high mobility of PBDTT-TTSE is in favor of the charge carrier transport and could result in high current density, which is consistent with the JSC data of PSC devices in Table 2. The relatively lower mobility may be one reason of low photovoltaic performance compared to those of ester or ketone-substituted polymer PBDTTT-E-T (6.74 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and PBDTTT-C-T (0.27 cm2 V−1 s−1).


Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to investigate the surface morphology of the blend films of polymer/PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) with the addictive of 3% DIO. The height and phase images are shown in Fig. 6 and the preparation conditions are the same as the device fabrication. AFM images of both blend films exhibit smooth surfaces while the root-mean-squared (RMS) roughness of the PBDTT-TTSO/PC71BM film (RMS = 2.64 nm) was slightly lower than that of the PBDTT-TTSE/PC71BM film (RMS = 3.13 nm). For the phase image, the dark-colored and light-colored areas correspond to PC71BM domains and polymers, respectively. As we know the exiton diffusion length is less than 20 nm and the perfect domain size should not exceed 30 nm. It can be observed from Fig. 6b and d that the phase images of the blend films exhibit nanoscale phase separation with suitable domain sizes, which could contribute to charge carrier transport and collection. Interesting, the polymer PBDTT-TTSE shows a more desirable nanoscale phase separation with the domain sizes of ∼20 nm compared to PBDTT-TTSO. The results are in accord with the photovoltaic performance of the two polymers.


All starting materials and reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification, unless otherwise mentioned. Toluene was distilled over sodium in the presence of benzophenone as indicator. CHCl3 and CH2Cl2 were distilled over calcium hydride.


1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker Advance III 600 spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS, δ = 0 ppm) as an internal standard. GPC analyses were made using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as eluant and polystyrene standard as reference. UV-vis absorption spectra were performed on Lambda25 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were taken on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation. The CV experiments were carried out at room temperature with a conventional three-electrode system using a glassy carbon electrode as working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode, and saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode. Tetrabutylammonium phosphorus hexafluoride (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) in acetonitrile solution was used as the supporting electrolyte, and the scan rate was 100 mV s−1. Ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was used as the internal standard. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed on STA-409 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Topographic images of the active layers were obtained through atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode under ambient conditions using an Agilent 5400 instrument.


The PSCs devices were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymers:PCBM/Ca/Al. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS [30 nm, Baytron PVP AI 4083] was spin-cast on precleaned ITO-coated glass at 4000 rpm. After baking at 150 °C for 20 min, the substrates were transferred into glovebox, where the active layer (∼100 nm) of the blend of the polymer and PCBM was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer. Finally, a Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) metal top electrode was thermal evaporated onto the active layer under about 2 × 10−4 Pa. The active area of the device was 0.1 cm2 defined by shadow mask. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley 2420 source measurement unit under simulated 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) irradiation from a Newport solar simulator. Light intensity was calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell. The external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of solar cells were analyzed using a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency measurement system.

In summary, we replaced the alkyl chain of ketone-substituted thieno[3,4-b]thiophene with alkylthio side chain to develop a new acceptor thioester-based acceptor (TTS), which was synthesized easily. Then, two new polymers PBDTT-TTSO and PBDTT-TTSE were designed and synthesized by Stille coupling reaction. The TTS acceptor moieties made the two polymers exhibit a lower band gap (∼1.5 eV) and desirable HOMO and LUMO energy levels relative to the fullerene acceptors for PSCs. The PBDTT-TTSE-based photovoltaic device demonstrates a VOC of 0.70 V, a JSC of 14.6 mA cm−2, a FF of 56.7%, and a high PCE of 5.80%. This study indicates that thioester substituted thieno[3,4-b]thiophene may be a highly useful building block for further design of high performance photovoltaic polymers.
