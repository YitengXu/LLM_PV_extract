A low-cost, non-toxic, environmentally friendly, and solution-processed new oxide-based semiconducting material (Sn1−xCoxO2) was developed as an absorption material for all oxide solar cell fabrication in this work. The newly developed n-type cobalt-doped tin oxide (n-Sn1−xCoxO2) nanoparticles and p-type copper oxide (p-Cu2O) nanostructures were successfully synthesized via a low-temperature solution process. Combined with the use of non-vacuum spray and hot-press processes, the n-Sn1−xCoxO2/p-Cu2O heterojunction solar cells exhibit low-cost and large-scale fabrication advantages. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.2% can be obtained from the solar cells with n-Sn0.86Co0.14O2/p-Cu2O, under AM 1.5 illumination, a noteworthy improvement in solution-processed all-oxide-based nanostructures heterojunction solar cells.

Responding to the threats of global warming and climate change urges the development of environmentally friendly and low-cost solar cell technologies. In addition, it is critical to develop earth-abundant absorption materials for solar cell applications. Currently, the mainstream PV market is dominated by crystalline silicon-based solar cells. Although crystalline silicon-based solar cells provide high efficiency advantages, the cost due to vacuum process and limitation on large-scale production still make it hard to compete with the electricity cost of fossil energy. Consequently, in addition to the demands of low-cost, and earth-abundant/non-toxic materials, a non-vacuum and large-scale process for solar cell fabrication is needed for sustainable power generation. In order to provide solutions for low-cost and large-scale applications, spray and solution processes for new absorber layers were developed to replace vacuum-based technologies. The non-vacuum technologies for solar cell fabrications, such as organics, dye-sensitized and oxide-based solar cells, are very attractive because of their potential applications on inexpensive oxide-based solar cells with minimal energy input. Recently, Cu2O, SnO2, TiO2, CuO, ZnO, AZO and other oxide semiconducting materials were developed for low-cost and large-scale applications. The Cu2O is a p-type semiconductor with a direct band gap of about 2.0 eV and a theoretical maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of approximately 20%. Besides, Cu2O-based heterojunctions which exhibit superior solar spectral absorption in short wavelength range were studied. So far, the highest energy conversion efficiency of Cu2O-based heterojunction solar cells with simple planar interfaces is 2% under AM 1.5 illumination. However, they were fabricated by vacuum process.

Relatively less works have been focused on the implementation of nanostructures in inexpensive, stable, and solution-processed inorganic solar cells in the past. Previous attempts to fabricate nanostructured oxide-based solar cells by solution process resulted in the PCE less than 1%. Yuhas and Yang drop-casted Cu2O nanoparticles into ZnO NW arrays with a 10 nm thick TiO2 coating (buffer layer), Gibson and Cui utilized chemical electroplating to deposit Cu2O thin films onto ZnO nanopilliar. The drop-casting or chemical electroplating of nanoparticles/films may lead to the formation of a discontinuous interface and poor contact between the nanostructures due to the random orientation and arrangement of nanostructures. It is therefore important to resolve the interface issues encountered in solution process.
In this work, we develop a new environmentally friendly material, cobalt-doped tin(IV) oxide (Sn1−xCoxO2) nanostructure as an n-type material via solution process for heterojunction solar cell applications. The n-Sn1−xCoxO2 nanostructure was used to improve solar spectral absorption in long wavelength range. In addition, p-type Cu2O nanostructures were used as p-type semiconductor materials in solar cells. Furthermore, a non-vacuum hot-pressing process followed by spraying was developed to improve interface between nanostructures for heterojunction solar cell fabrication. Finally, n-Sn1−xCoxO2/p-Cu2O nanostructure solar cells were fabricated to measure PCE.
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. 1(a)–(c) and their respective transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in (d)–(f), inserted with TEM diffraction patterns, show the Sn1−xCoxO2 synthesized using 0%, 0.025 wt%, and 0.075 wt% concentrations of cobalt sulfate solutions, respectively. The syntheses were carried out using wet-chemical reduction at low temperature (60 °C) with the process details described in the Experimental section of the ESI. From Fig. 1(a)–(f), these nanoparticles all show similar spherical nanostructures with a diameter of 10–20 nm. The dotted ring-shaped TEM diffraction patterns inserted in Fig. 1(d)–(f) indicate that these nanoparticles are polycrystalline. Above experimental results indicate that crystalline Sn1−xCoxO2 nanostructures can be successfully synthesized at a cobalt sulfate concentration of 0 wt%, 0.025 wt%, and 0.075 wt%, by optimizing the wet chemical reduction process. Besides, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images in Fig. 1(g)–(i) clearly show that these nanoparticles all reveal the fringes of (110) planes of Sn1−xCoxO2 with a lattice spacing of about 0.33 nm. Furthermore, the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses in TEM show that the cobalt atomic percentage of the Sn1−xCoxO2 synthesized at 0 wt%, 0.025 wt%, and 0.075 wt% of cobalt sulfate concentrations were 0, 1.2, and 4.2%, corresponding to SnO2, Sn0.96Co0.04O2, and Sn0.86Co0.14O2, respectively. The Co to Sn atomic ratio for these nanoparticles increases with the increase of cobalt sulfate concentration.

Fig. 1(j) shows the SEM image of the p-type Cu2O network nanostructures which were synthesized in this work using the wet-chemical reduction process at low temperature with the process optimization described in the experimental section of the ESI. It can be observed that the Cu2O network nanostructures are aggregated and composed of thin nanowire bundles. The TEM bright-field image of Cu2O network nanostructures in Fig. 1(k) clearly shows that nanoparticles cover on the surface of thin nanowires. The inserted dotted ring-shaped TEM diffraction pattern in Fig. 1(k) indicates that the Cu2O nanostructures are polycrystalline. Besides, the typical HRTEM image of an individual Cu2O nanoparticle in Fig. 1(l) reveals the fringes of (111) planes of Cu2O with a lattice spacing of about 0.25 nm. Furthermore, the impurity levels were under detection limit of EDS in TEM, indicating that high-purity Cu2O nanostructures have been synthesized.
The crystal structure of Sn1−xCoxO2 nanoparticles annealed in air at 400 °C was also characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) that can measure the crystal structure of more nanoparticles at a time. Fig. 2(a) shows polycrystalline structures of tin oxide with various cobalt-doping, revealing major diffractions from (110), (101), (211), and (301) planes. In Fig. 2(a), no additional phases such as the CoO1−x, SnO, or metallic Co were observed. The energy band gaps of Sn1−xCoxO2 nanoparticles were also measured with the results of 3.66 eV, 3.41 eV, and 3.35 eV for pristine SnO2, Sn0.96Co0.04O2, and Sn0.86Co0.14O2nanoparticles, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The XRD and energy band gaps of Sn1−xCoxO2 results are similar to those in the previous report. It can be observed that the energy band gap decreases as the cobalt-doping in tin oxide increases.
As for Cu2O network nanostructures, the XRD in Fig. 2(c) shows their crystalline structure with the peaks of (110), (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes. The estimated value of band gap (Eg) of Cu2O nanostructures is about 2.2 eV obtained by extrapolating the linear part of the plot curves to intercept the energy axis as shown in Fig. 2(d), the same method as that used for the measurements of Sn1−xCoxO2 nanoparticles.
Non-vacuum spray and hot-press technologies (process details are described in the Experimental section of the ESI) were found to improve interface quality between Cu2O and Sn1−xCoxO2 in this work. Fig. 3(a) shows the schematic solar cell structure fabricated in this work, which is consisted of a 350 nm thick Cu2O network nanostructures filled with 1 μm thick Sn1−xCoxO2 nanoparticles, and a 100–200 nm thick mixing layer composed of Sn1−xCoxO2/Cu2O nanostructures interlayer in between. Fig. 3(b) shows the cross-section SEM image of Sn0.86Co0.14O2/Cu2O heterojunction solar cell with a low magnification image of ITO-glass/Sn1−xCoxO2/Cu2O/Pt/Ti/glass structure (x = 0.14) in the inset. Fig. 3(c) and (d) shows cross-section TEM bright-field and dark-field images (inserted with EDS line scan), respectively, that reveal the microstructure of the Sn0.86Co0.14O2/Cu2O nanostructures heterojunction fabricated by utilizing spray and hot-press processes. From Fig. 3(c), it can be observed that the Sn0.86Co0.14O2/Cu2O nanostructure heterojunction exhibits continuous interfaces between Sn0.86Co0.14O2nanoparticles and Cu2O nanostructures without voids or gaps. It also shows that under the hot-pressing at 200 °C and 143 kg cm−2 for 1 h, Cu2O nanostructures and Sn0.86Co0.14O2nanoparticles were not damaged. An interlayer composed of the mixture of Cu2O and Sn0.86Co0.14O2nanostructures can be found based on the EDS line-scan under TEM dark-field imaging in Fig. 3(d). In addition, the HRTEM lattice images in the insets in Fig. 3(c) confirm that the lattice structures of Sn0.86Co0.14O2 (top right corner) and Cu2O (bottom left corner) remain the same. Their EDS analyses also confirm that their compositions were not changed.

Fig. 4(a) shows optical properties of newly developed n-Sn1−xCoxO2 and p-Cu2O nanostructures in this work. The absorption versus scanning wavelength measured by UV-Vis shows high absorption for 1 μm thick Sn1−xCoxO2 nanoparticles in the wavelength of 700–1400 nm and for 350 nm thick Cu2O nanostructures in 300–800 nm. Above combination enables the desired wide-band spectrum of sunlight absorption. It can be also observed that the absorption of Sn1−xCoxO2 nanoparticles increases with the increase of the cobalt-doping in thin oxide in Fig. 2(a), the Full-Width Half-Maximum (FWHM) of XRD is broad, indicating the poor crystallinity of Sn1−xCoxO2 nanoparticles. It is likely that the wide-band absorption capability is attributed to the defective structure of Sn1−xCoxO2 nanoparticles. Therefore, the featureless of absorption spectra is likely attributed to the defective structure of Sn1−xCoxO2 nanoparticles, which is similar to the previous report. However, the detailed mechanism needs further investigation.

Fig. 4(b) shows the short circuit current (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the solar cells fabricated from n-SnO2/p-Cu2O, n-Sn0.96Co0.04O2/p-Cu2O, and n-Sn0.86Co0.14O2/p-Cu2O nanostructures. It can be clearly observed that as the cobalt-doping in tin oxide increases for above solar cells, the extracted Jsc increases from 0.25 mA cm−2, 0.43 mA cm−2, to 1.43 mA cm−2, and the Voc increases from 0.012 V, 1.899 V, to 2.325 V, respectively. The result indicates that the increased light absorption, short circuit current and open circuit voltage were dominated by n-Sn1−xCoxO2 layer. The improvements of Jsc have been attributed to the higher sunlight absorption of the n-Sn1−xCoxO2/p-Cu2O heterojunction solar cells. The open circuit voltages were improved at higher cobalt-doping, whose mechanism still remains unclear and needs further investigation. Fig. 4(c) shows the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7 × 10−4%, 0.43% to 1.2%, and the fill factor (FF) of 24%, 57% to 36% for the solar cells fabricated from n-SnO2/p-Cu2O, n-Sn0.96Co0.04O2/p-Cu2O, and n-Sn0.86Co0.14O2/p-Cu2O nanostructures, respectively. Fig. 4(d) shows the typical J–V curve for the solar cell made of n-Sn0.86Co0.14O2/p-Cu2O nanostructures with the highest PCE (= 1.2%), Voc = 2.325 V, Jsc = 1.426 mA cm−2, and FF = 36%. The J–V curves of solar cell made from p-Cu2O/n-Sn0.86Co0.14O2nanostructures were measured for three times (3 min between two measurements) and the solar cells output were stable. However, it is still not clear and needs further investigation for the reasons why the FF is in nonlinear relationship with cobalt-doping concentration and the open circuit voltage increases with cobalt-doping.
The cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements were conducted on Sn0.86Co0.14O2nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 5. The corresponding fitting data are summarized in Table 1, which reveal four peaks centered at 2.32, 1.92, 1.71 and 1.29 eV. The total energy-band value by summing those from peak 2 and peak 3 is ∼3.63 eV, which is close to the band gap of Sn0.86Co0.14O2 (∼3.35 eV) measured by UV-Vis. Therefore, these two energy states for the peaks 2 and 3 of Sn0.86Co0.14O2nanoparticles (1.92 and 1.71 eV, respectively) could allow the absorption of transmitted sub-band-gap photonsvia sequential ground-state/exciting-state absorption processes. As previous reports, the energy levels in the up-conversion with relaxation of electrons follow E1 + E2 = Eg + Erelax (where Eg and Erelax are energy band-gap and relaxation energy, respectively). The total energy-band value by summing those from peak 2 (E1 ≈ 1.92 eV) and peak 3 (E2 ≈ 1.71 eV) is (E1 + E2) = ∼3.63 eV, which is close to the band gap of Sn0.86Co0.14O2 (Eg ≈ 3.35 eV). Therefore, it can be considered that the energy band-gap (Eg) is ∼3.35eV and the relaxation energy (Erelax) is ∼0.28 eV in this up-conversion with relaxation of electrons. Although the p-Cu2O/n-Sn0.86Co0.14O2nanostructures solar cell doesn't contain Er3+ doping, the phenomenon are very similar and follow E1 + E2 = Eg + Erelax that describes the up-conversion system for light absorption. However, it needs further investigation to realize the root cause why the p-Cu2O/n-Sn0.86Co0.14O2nanostructures solar cell without Er3+ behaves like the up-converter. With the help of these two extra states on absorbing sub-band-gap photons, the up-conversion absorption of Sn0.86Co0.14O2/p-Cu2O solar cells in long wavelength was achieved because of the smaller sub-energy-gap than energy band gap. Thus, the increment of Jsc was observed and the conversion efficiency of the Sn0.86Co0.14O2/p-Cu2O solar cell was improved.

In summary, low-cost, non-toxic, environmentally friendly, and solution-processed new oxide-based semiconducting materials (n-Sn1−xCoxO2) were developed as absorption materials combined with the use of p-Cu2O nanostructures for all oxide solar cell fabrication in this work. The newly developed n-type Sn1−xCoxO2 semiconducting materials, including SnO2, Sn0.96Co0.04O2, and Sn0.86Co0.14O2nanoparticles, as well as p-type p-Cu2O network nanostructures were successfully synthesized via low-temperature (60 °C) solution process. The band gap of tin oxide increases with the increased cobalt-doping in tin oxide. UV-Vis results show high absorption for Sn1−xCoxO2 nanoparticles in the wavelength of 700–1400 nm and Cu2O nanostructures in 300–800 nm. Above combination enables the desired wide-band sunlight absorption for n-Sn1−xCoxO2/p-Cu2O nanostructures heterojunction solar cells. In addition, the n-Sn1−xCoxO2/p-Cu2O heterojunction solar cells fabricated by spraying and hot-pressing processes were found to exhibit a continuous interface between p-Cu2O network nanostructures and n-Sn1−xCoxO2 nanoparticles without voids and gaps. The successful filling of n-Sn1−xCoxO2 into p-Cu2O that can increase their contact area and charge transfer makes the n-Sn1−xCoxO2/p-Cu2O nanostructures more superior for all-oxide photovoltaic applications. According to CL spectra, it is suspected that the n-Sn0.86Co0.14O2/p-Cu2O solar cell could enhance transmitted sub-band-gap photons absorption via sequential ground-state/exciting-state absorption processes. Consequently, the short circuit current and PCE of Sn0.86Co0.14O2/Cu2O solar cell were improved. Nevertheless, it still needs to investigate the mechanism to explain why the increase of cobalt-doping in tin oxide could improve the open circuit voltages of the n-Sn0.86Co0.14O2/p-Cu2O solar cell significantly. The highest power conversion efficiency can be obtained from the solar cells with n-Sn0.86Co0.04O2/p-Cu2O nanostructures, showing the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 2.325 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 1.426 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 36%, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.2% under AM 1.5 illumination (or one-sun solar simulator at 100 mW cm−2). This result shows a noteworthy improvement in the PCE of solution-processed all-oxide-based nanostructures heterojunction solar cells. Moreover, the n-Sn1−xCoxO2 and p-Cu2O nanostructures are earth-abundant, stable, low-cost, and environmentally friendly materials. Combined with the use of non-vacuum spray and hot-press processes, the n-Sn1−xCoxO2/p-Cu2O heterojunction solar cells can be fabricated at low-cost with minimal energy input, feasible for future large-scale applications.
