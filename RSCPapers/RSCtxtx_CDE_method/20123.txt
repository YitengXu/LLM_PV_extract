In dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the TiO2 photoanode film plays an important role in increasing the power conversion efficiency. In this work, TiO2 nanoparticles were first coated on fluorine-doped tin oxide by the doctor-blade method, and then a thin film of zinc sulfide (ZnS) was successfully fabricated on the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles using the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method. The performance of the DSSCs was examined in detail using a cobalt sulfide counter electrode and I−/I3− electrolyte. X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy measurements were used to find the composition of the films. Characterization with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicated that the recombination rate decreased drastically during the electron transportation. The DSSCs based on ZnS coated TiO2 photoanode achieved a power conversion efficiency of 5.90% under 1 sunlight illumination, which is higher than that of the bare TiO2 photoanode (4.43%). This suggests that the promising ZnS-coated TiO2 nanoparticles accumulate a large number of photo-injected electrons in the conduction band of the photoanode and the N719 dye lowers the recombination of photo-injected electrons with the redox electrolyte.

In the past decade, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have gained much attention in scientific research and industrial applications due to their easy fabrication methods such as the roll-printing technique, and they are also renewable and carbon-free. The versatile advantages of DSSCs such as long-term stability under thermal conditions, eco-friendliness, and cost effectiveness further enhance the commercial prospects of DSSCs compared with traditional petrochemical energy sources and fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas. A typical DSSC consists of a film of semiconductor metal oxide (usually TiO2 or ZnO deposited on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)), which is sensitized with a monolayer of dye molecules, as well as a redox electrolyte, which generally consists of triiodide/iodine and a counter electrolyte.

TiO2 or ZnO-based photoelectrodes are important components in DSSCs, and they improve the conversion efficiency because of various morphologies, high surface area for loading large amounts of dye molecules on the photoelectrode, and fast electron transport. Electro-chemical anodization of titanium films results in the creation of TiO2 photoelectrodes, and this has attracted much attention because they are inexpensive, chemically stable, have excellent charge transport capabilities and are highly reproducible with easily tunable geometry. TiO2 photoelectrodes not only possess tremendous advantages but also play three major roles: (1) providing a FTO substrate for dye adsorption, (2) accepting excited electrons from the sensitizer, and (3) transporting the electron toward the FTO substrate. Even though it has tremendous advantages, some factors limit the predicted high efficiency and performance of the TiO2-based DSSCs, such as poor utilization of near-infrared light and a large amount of grain boundaries. The electron generation and transfer at the interface (TiO2) is a key process to improve the performance of DSSCs which suffer from more charge recombination. For this reason, efforts have been made to improve the performance using a barrier built at the surface of TiO2 by introducing nanoparticles, different morphologies, and varying the thickness of the photoelectrode to suppress electron recombination.
Recently, morphology-dependent TiO2 photoanodes such as hierarchical anatase nanowire arrays (HNW) and nanoparticles (NP) have attracted many researchers due to their superior light scattering, rapid electron transport, and higher conversion efficiency properties. Park et al. reported nonstructural TiO2 films with a large surface obtained by a combined process of graft polymerization and sol–gel method for DSSCs, achieving a conversion efficiency of 3.8%. Xu et al. reported a double-layer TiO2 film obtained by a hydrothermal process, achieving a greater photovoltaic performance of 6.15% due to effective dye absorption and rapid electron transport. Even though these reports show higher current density and efficiency, the DSSCs still possess higher charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye and electrolyte interface, which is a crucial factor that determines the catalytic activity and inner electron loss that occurs at the interface.
Recently, many researchers have focused on metal-doped TiO2 electrodes, which act as a blocking layer for significantly controlling the electron back transfer from the substrate to the electrolyte and for performance improvement of DSSCs. Desai et al. have reported on hybrid TiO2–SnO2 nanotube arrays obtained by a liquid-phase conversion process. They achieved a conversion efficiency of 3.53% due to the lower electron recombination and a longer lifetime of electrons. Pang et al. recently reported a TiO2 core and a SnO2 shell that were successfully fabricated by a one-step solvothermal technique. An efficiency of 6.24% was achieved due to a larger surface area and the suppression of charge recombination. In DSSCs, the CE is an essential part for determining the performance. Mostly, a platinum (Pt)-coated FTO substrate is employed as the CE for DSSCs. However, Pt is a noble metal with low abundance, and it is very expensive, which limits large-scale manufacturing. Several inorganic materials, including metal oxides, nitrides, carbides, and sulfides, have been used to fabricate Pt-free CEs for DSSCs due to their simple fabrication processes. Among them, CoS has been proposed for the CE of DSSCs due to its excellent catalytic ability towards I3− reduction and its low cost.
In recent years, encouraging conversion efficiency of liquid electrolyte DSSCs has been achieved by optimized counter-electrodes, new routes of sensitization and surface passivation such as depositing a thin layer (insulating metal oxides (Al2O3), ZnS, or SiO2) on the surface of ZnO or TiO2. One of the most widely used technique is the deposition of a ZnS layer on the surface of TiO2 photoanode taking advantage of the easy preparation and the striking enhancement of the efficiency achieved. ZnS is a more environmentally friendly material, and is constituted by more earth-abundant elements, and depositing ZnS layer between the TiO2 and dye molecules is beneficial to enhance the electron injection and reduce the charge recombination. Bare TiO2 film shows better performance under UV-light illumination. However, ZnS coated on the TiO2 surface or combination of TiO2/ZnS shows appreciably better photocatalytic activity than the bare TiO2 film. Moreover, deposition of the ZnS layer or doping of nonmetal elements like N, S, I, and B in TiO2 influences the light absorbance properties and the electron transport.
In this study, we have fabricated a ZnS shell on TiO2 nanoparticles by a simple successive ion layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique in order to reduce the electron back reaction using the shell as a blocking layer. CoS nanoparticles were directly deposited on a conducting FTO substrate which acts as a CE for DSSCs using a simple chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to prepare TiO2-ZnS-based photoanodes. The presence of the ZnS layer on the TiO2 can effectively hinder the interfacial recombination at the interface between the TiO2 and the electrolyte. The resulting electrode TZ2C shows excellent power conversion efficiency of 5.90% compared to the bare TiO2 photoanode (4.43%) due to the improved short circuit current density (12.60 mA cm−2) under 1 sun light illumination.

To prepare the mesoporous TiO2 photoanode, FTO substrates (8 Ω sq−1 resistances) were first cleaned with acetone/ethanol for 15 min each using an ultrasonic bath and then rinsed thoroughly with deionized (DI) water. The cleaned substrates were dried with nitrogen gas to remove any residual organics. The TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared using a commercially available nanoporous TiO2 paste with a particle size of 20 nm (Ti-Nanoixide HT/SP Solaronix). The TiO2 paste was applied on the FTO substrate by the doctor blade method and heat treated at 450 °C for 30 min in order to remove the organic substances. The detailed preparation of the TiO2 electrode is explained in previous reports. The prepared TiO2 photoanode was immersed for 5 min in an aqueous solution containing 0.2 M Zn(NO3)2 to allow Zn2+ ions to adsorb over the TiO2 photoanode. Then, the electrodes were rinsed with water and ethanol to remove the excess Zn2+ ions. The photoanodes were then dipped for 5 min into a solution containing 0.2 M of Na2S, where the S2− ions react with pre-adsorbed Zn2+ ions to form ZnS. This entire dipping process was considered as one cycle, which was repeated 1, 2, 3, and 4 times to achieve good adsorption over the TiO2 photoanode.


FTO was used as the substrate for the preparation of the CEs and photoanodes due to its excellent electrical conductivity and resistance to the corrosive electrolyte. All precursors for the synthesis of CoS thin films were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification, unless otherwise mentioned. For the preparation of CoS, we used (CH3COO)2Co·4H2O, thioacetamide, and CH4N2O as a cobalt source, a sulfide source, and a stabilizing agent, respectively. The ultrasonically cleaned FTO substrates (1.3 × 1.6 cm2) were immersed in a solution containing 0.1 M of (CH3COO)2Co·4H2O, 0.8 M of thioacetamide, and 0.4 M of CH4N2O, which was placed in a hot air oven maintained at 70, 80, and 90 °C for 2 h. After 2 h of deposition, the prepared CoS thin films were washed with water and ethanol several times, followed by annealing at 60 °C for 1 h. No CoS thin film formation was observed at 70 °C, while densely coated film was observed at 90 °C. The film coated at 80 °C shows semitransparency, and this deposition temperature was chosen for further fabrication of CEs.


Finally, the prepared TiO2/ZnS photoanodes (0.25 cm2) were immersed in commercially available N719 dye for 20 h at room temperature after drying with a hair dryer. Then, the sensitized photoanodes and the CEs were assembled with hot-melt Surlyns (50 μm, Sx170-25, Solaronix), and the internal space was filled with an iodide/triiodide redox electrolyte through predrilled holes on the CEs.


The crystal structure was explored using X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/Max-2400, Rigaku) at 40 kV and 30 mA in the 2θ range of 20–80°. The surface features and morphology of the photoanodes were determined by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-4200, and Hitachi) operated at 15 kV. The elemental composition of ZnS was identified by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted using a Biologic potentiostat/galvanostat/EIS analyzer (SP-150, France) in the frequency range of 1 mHz to 100 kHz under 1 sun illumination. The optical absorption of the TiO2/ZnS films was examined by an OPTIZEN 3220 UV spectrophotometer. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs were found using an ABET Technologies (USA) solar simulator (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5) under 1 sun illumination.


In this report, the ZnS was coated on the TiO2 by the SILAR method and ZnS1 denotes 1 SILAR cycle, ZnS2 denotes 2 cycles etc. For convenience, the DSSCs fabricated using TiO2 + CoS, TiO2/ZnS1 + CoS, TiO2/ZnS2 + CoS, TiO2/ZnS3 + CoS, and TiO2/ZnS4 + CoS are denoted as TC, TZ1C, TZ2C, TZ3C, and TZ4C, respectively. The phase composition of as-prepared TiO2, TZ1C, TZ2C, TZ3C, and TZ4C films was analyzed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns, which resemble an anatase structure without any new phases. For all the films, five diffraction peaks were observed at around 25.32°, 37.84°, 48.07°, 62.75°, and 78.75°, which were assigned to the [101], [004], [200], [204], and [206] crystal planes, respectively. Only one diffraction peak of ZnS is observed (2θ = 28.87°, JCPDS card no: 00-039-1363), this could be because of extremely low Zn and S content (Zn:S = 1.85:3.47 for TZ2C electrode) on the TiO2 surface (Ti:O = 26.53:68.15 for TZ2C electrode). The decrease in the peak intensity of TiO2 is mainly due to the incorporation of ZnS on TiO2, or formation of some amorphous substance on the film surface of TiO2 and these data matched well with JCPDS, PDF no. 21-1272. As the ZnS layers deposit on the TiO2 surface, peak positions in the XRD were slightly shifted to higher 2θ values, which can be attributed to the incorporation of ZnS ions onto TiO2. The sizes of the nanoparticles were estimated using the Debye–Scherrer formula, D = 0.91τ/βcosθ where β is the full width at half maximum of the peak diffraction angle θ and τ is the wavelength of X-ray diffraction. The average particle size was found to be 30.4–34.05 nm for bare TiO2 and ZnS coated TiO2 nanoparticles from the prominent (004) diffracted peak, which is in good agreement with that observed in SEM images. The crystalline nature and structure of the CoS thin film were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and the detailed explanation is shown in ESI (Fig. S1).

ZnS nanoparticles were deposited on the TiO2 surface to increase the high specific surface area and adhesion between the film and substrate. Fig. 2 displays the FESEM image of the bare TiO2, TZ1C, TZ2C, TZ3C, and TZ4C electrodes on the FTO substrate. In comparison with the bare TiO2 film, the ZnS-coated films occupied a large number of ZnS nanoparticles on the TiO2 surface, and gaps between the nanoparticles were reduced drastically by increasing the number of ZnS coating cycles, which improves the adhesion of the TiO2/ZnS on the FTO. When the ZnS deposition was increased on the TiO2 surface beyond 4 cycles, the sensitized photoanodes started to peel off from the FTO substrate. The optimized ZnS SILAR cycles on TiO2 is shown in ESI (Fig. S2). We obtained good adhesion between the TiO2/ZnS and dye using 1 to 4 cycles of ZnS deposition on the FTO. To investigate the surface morphology and thickness of the as-prepared CoS film on the FTO substrate, SEM and surface cross-sectional images were recorded, and the corresponding images are shown in ESI (Fig. S3).
Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis was used to identify the elemental compositions of the prepared electrodes on the FTO substrates. The resulting EDX spectra and their corresponding elemental composition are shown in Fig. 3. In comparison with Fig. 3b, Fig. 3a shows strong peaks for Ti and O, and no external peaks were observed. The atomic percentage of Ti decreased (70.60 to 27.85%) and O increased (29.40 to 69.16%) when the ZnS film was coated on the TiO2 film (Fig. 3b) by the SILAR method. Upon increasing the ZnS SILAR cycles from 2 to 3 and 3 to 4, the TiO2 affects the formation of Ti more than O and hence Ti is depleted on the FTO substrate. Therefore the Zn and S content is increased upon increasing the ZnS cycles. The atomic percentages of Zn and S were found to be (1.23:1.77), (1.85:3.47), (3.47:5.11), and (5.12:6.52) in the samples of TZ1C, TZ2C, TZ3C, and TZ4C, respectively. Interestingly, the formation of S was faster than the Zn source.
The light absorption properties for each of the photoelectrodes of the bare TiO2, TZ1C, TZ2C, TZ3C, and TZ4C were assessed by UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 4). The absorbance slightly increased with an increase in ZnS layer deposits on TiO2, and a slight violet-shift was observed only between 350 and 400 nm compared with the bare TiO2 electrode. This increased absorbance indicates that the final deposited ZnS layer on the TiO2 hardly participates in harvesting incident light compared to the bare TiO2. However, more ZnS deposition (>4) on TiO2 does not show any appreciable difference from the TZ2C. All these electrodes were used for the determination of J–V characteristic curves.

Fig. 5 shows the resulting current density–voltage curves of the five photoelectrodes. The resulting parameters are shown in Table 1, including the open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and efficiency (η). Using bare TiO2 as a photoelectrode and CoS as a counter electrode, the fabricated cell exhibited Jsc and Voc values of 9.31 mA cm−2 and 0.65 V, respectively, resulting in a low efficiency of 4.43%. The electrocatalytic activity of the TiO2 electrode was very low, and the higher electrocatalytic activity of the electrode provides greater current density. Under continuous sunlight illumination, the TZ2C electrode exhibited a superior conversion efficiency of 5.90% in the I−/I3− electrolyte, which is higher than that of the TZ, TZ1C, TZ3C, and TZ4C electrodes. It can be concluded that the enhanced power conversion efficiency mostly arises from the positive influence of ZnS on TiO2, which resulted in enhanced photo-electron harvesting efficiency of the photoanode and relatively low Rct (17.25 Ω).

The high photocurrent density (Jsc = 12.60 mA cm2) leads to higher conversion efficiency for TZ2C than the bare TC photoanode. This suggests that the replacement of Ti2+ by Zn2+ ions on the surface greatly reinforced with an increase in the surface stability compared to the bare TC photoanode. Consequently, ZnS–dye aggregates may be greatly reduced, and thus the dye molecules are adequately adsorbed on the electrode surface. On the other hand, the performance of the TZ3C and TZ4C electrodes was much lower than that with the TZ2C (η = 4.15% and Jsc = 8.10 mA cm−2 for TZ3C and η = 2.96% and Jsc = 5.87 mA cm−2 for TZ3C). The decrease in Jsc for the TZ3C and TZ4C electrodes resulting from its lower conductivity and catalytic activity for the I3− reduction was demonstrated by EIS measurements. However, the number of ZnS cycles on TiO2 may increase the optical band gap and the insulating properties of TiO2 films, which drastically reduces the rate of electron transfer from the photoanode to FTO.
To ensure the effective photovoltaic performance of TiO2/Pt (Pt), TiO2/CoS (TC) and TiO2/ZnS2/CoS (TZ2C, ZnS coated TiO2 as photoanode and CoS as CE) based DSSCs were fabricated and the resulting photocurrent versus voltage curve is shown in Fig. 6. The I–V curves show that the Pt based cell provides a much lower photoelectric conversion efficiency of 5.06% compared to TZ2C (5.90%) based cell. Specifically, the Pt based cell shows a relatively lower current density of 11.16 mA cm−2 (12.60 for the TZ2C cell) with a similar fill factor (0.68 for the Pt cell and 0.69 for the TZ2C) and open-circuit voltage (0.65 for Pt and 0.66 for TZ2C). It can be concluded that the enhancement in the conversion efficiency mostly arises from the enhanced short circuit current density. On the other hand, the performance of the bare TiO2 based cell (TC) is greatly lower than that with the Pt and TZ2C based cell.
In order to identify the causes of performance improvement, UV-vis absorbance was recorded after dye loading on the bare TiO2 and ZnS coated TiO2. In DSSCs, the sensitizer plays a crucial role; it is solely responsible for the electric current generation by harvesting the solar light and injecting the excited electrons into the TiO2 conduction band. The UV-vis absorbance is shown in Fig. 7 and the spectra indicate that the absorbance of bare TiO2 and ZnS coated TiO2 (TZ1C) did not show any significant difference. In comparison with TZ2C, it can be observed that the peaks are broadened and the absorption increased dramatically with increased number of ZnS layers (TZ2C) which is due to an increased number of adsorbed dye molecules on the TZ2C film. TZ3C and TZ4C films did not show any significant difference in the adsorption spectra and show lower absorption compared to TZ2C and TiO2 films. This suggests that the minimal ZnS ions on the TiO2 surface can significantly affect the dye loading. Therefore, the significant Jsc increase for the ZnS coated TiO2 film (TZ2C) should be mainly related to the improvement of dye loading.
We employed EIS to elucidate the electrochemical characteristics of each part of the device, such as the photoanode, counter electrode, and Warburg diffusion resistance in the electrolyte. Fig. 8 shows the Nyquist plots for DSSCs using photoanodes with the films of TC, TZ1C, TZ2C, TZ3C, and TZ4C obtained under one sun illumination of AM 1.5 G at an applied bias of Voc (frequency range of 1 mHz to 100 Hz). The inset in Fig. 8 shows the equivalent circuit model used for DSSCs. The prepared DSSCs incorporating the I−/I3− electrolyte and each cell had an effective area of 0.25 and 0.8 cm2 for the photoanodes and CEs.
The resulting impedance parameters obtained by fitting an equivalent circuit (EIS, Fig. 8) for the EIS spectra are shown in Table 2. The series resistance (Rs) and chemical capacitance (Cμ) at the photoanode and electrolyte reflect the charge recombination (Rct) process between the dye sensitizers/TiO2/ZnS and electrolyte interface. A larger Rs value indicates a higher charge recombination rate, and a larger Cμ indicates the upward shift of the Fermi level, which gives a large Voc. The values of Rct for the DSSCs with TC, TZ1C, TZ2C, TZ3C, and TZ4C are 27.49, 21.72, 17.25, 34.99, and 36.09 Ω, respectively. The low Rct value of TZ2C corresponds to higher electrocatalytic activity. The Warburg diffusion impedance (Zw) for the TZ2C shows a value lower than that of TC, which reveals that I3− can be rapidly reduced to I− to speed up the diffusion of I3−. The very high values of Zw for TZ3C and TZ4C compared to the TZ2C demonstrate a lower diffusion velocity of the redox couple. The values of Cμ for the DSSCs with the TC, TZ1C, TZ2C, TZ3C, and TZ4C are 5.21, 7.001, 8.31, 4.63, and 4.51 μF, respectively (Table 2). The tendency of Cμ totally agrees with the tendencies of the conversion efficiency listed in Table 1, which indicates that the DSSCs with a higher value of Cμ correspond to large collection of photoexited electrons into the conduction band of photoanode which is responsible for the large current density of the cell. However, the overall impedance of the TZ2C electrode is superior to that of the other electrodes due to its high specific surface area and strong adhesion on FTO. This result is in good agreement with the other analysis (J–V and Bode-plot) (Fig. 9).

The electron lifetime (τr) in the prepared films could be calculated from the maximum angular frequency of the impedance semicircle arc at mid-frequency according to the following formula:
τe = 1/2πfmax
where
fmax is the peak frequency among the mid-frequency peaks. Thus, a mid-frequency peak shifting towards the higher frequency represents lower electron lifetime, and vice versa. The lower τr for the TC (0.190 ms) may be due to the large back reaction of electrons with the iodide triiodide electrolyte. Notably, the introduction of ZnS on TiO2 (TZ2C) not only remarkably decreases the recombination of photo-injected electrons with the redox electrolyte, but also improves τr (0.223). The value of τr decreases gradually with the increasing number of ZnS cycles (TZ3C, TZ4C) on TiO2 due to the excess amount of ZnS ions which is increasing the resistance of the photoanode. A large trap level was set by the ZnS on TiO2 for the TZ3C and TZ4C-based DSSCs, which makes it difficult for electron transfer and reduction of the τr of the photo-injected electrons inside the TiO2/ZnS photoanode.

In order to verify that the prepared electrode (TZ2C) is a reliable material for the stability in the I−/I3− electrolyte, EIS analysis was conducted using 11 cycles of scans. The obtained curves are shown in Fig. 10. It can be seen that there are no changes observed in the first semicircle, and more changes were observed in the middle and lower semicircles between the first and eleventh EIS curves of the photoanode with TZ2C. The EIS curves after the eleventh SILAR cycle of the scan shows that the middle and lower semicircles decrease drastically, which indicates that the electrode becomes more beneficial and it suppresses the recombination of photo-injected electrons with the redox electrolyte and making more electrons to accumulate in the photoanode. This improves the performance of the DSSCs by increasing the fill factors.
From the band gap, the possible electron transfer mechanism in the photoanode is assumed using the earlier reports. and is schematically depicted in Fig. 11. In Fig. 11a, during the electron injection there are undesirable side processes: the electrons injected to the CB of TiO2 may reduce either the oxidized dye (recombination) (1) or I3− in the solution (dark current) (2). These two processes lower the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc). Due to a higher band gap of ZnS (3.6 eV), the excited electrons are confined inside the TiO2 and the holes are localized in ZnS. In addition, introducing a ZnS layer between the TiO2 and dye molecules can effectively avoid the formation of the insulating [dye-Zn2+] complexes, which is beneficial for improving the device's stability and the reduction of charge recombination. It was observed that introduction of a ZnS layer on top of TiO2 (Fig. 11b) makes a more efficient photocatalyst than pure TiO2. This result was attributed to the ZnS layer which acts as a blocking layer to shield the TiO2 from the outer dye/electrolyte, and provides physical separation of the injected electrons in TiO2 from the positively charged dye/the electrolyte, thereby reducing the interfacial recombining to obtain a high photovoltaic performance. The J–V plots in Fig. 5 and Table 1 show that an efficiency of around 5.90% is obtained by an optimized combination of these materials. One striking result is the importance of the presence of ZnS in the bottom layer of the dye. The efficiency of the cell is improved from 4.43 to 5.90% when we added a ZnS layer between TiO2 and the dye. Consequently, the electron lifetime is improved with the introduction of the ZnS layer.

In summary, we have demonstrated for the first time that ZnS coated on the surface of TiO2 films can be used as photoanodes in DSSCs. An efficiency of 5.90% with Voc = 0.66 V, FF = 0.69, and Jsc = 12.60 mA cm−2 has been achieved under one sun illumination in conjunction with I−/I3− electrolyte and CoS as a counter electrode. The detailed characterization and experimental results indicate that the ZnS fabrications are beneficial for the photocurrent and performance of the DSSCs due to the large accumulation of photo-injected electrons in the conduction band of the photoanode. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis revealed that the smallest charge transfer resistance (17.25 Ω) and highest chemical capacitance (8.31 μF) was obtained with the TZ2C photoanode, which is directly reflected in the current density. The electrode with TZ2C also shows much better stability in the redox couple. The increase in ZnS cycles on TiO2 proportionally increases the charge recombination rate and affects the device's performance. These results confirm that a few cycles of ZnS on TiO2 were very effective at drastically decreasing the charge transfer resistance and enhancing the device's performance. We believe that through our continuous efforts on further optimization of the photoanode by controlling the ZnS thickness, morphology, and fabrication techniques, a new record efficiency for DSSCs will be easily attainable, which is in progress in our laboratory.
