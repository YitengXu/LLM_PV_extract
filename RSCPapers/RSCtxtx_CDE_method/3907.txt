The LUMO/HOMO energy levels of conjugated polymers are key parameters for their applications as polymer electron donors for polymer solar cells (PSCs). The widely-used strategy to tune the LUMO/HOMO levels of polymer donors is to develop D–A type polymers based on an alternating electron-donating unit (D) and an electron-accepting unit (A). In this paper, we report a novel approach to tune the LUMO/HOMO levels of polymer donors via replacing a C–C unit by a B ← N unit for enhanced PSC device performance. The control polymer PCPDT shows the LUMO/HOMO levels of −2.71 eV/−4.98 eV, which are both much higher than those required for an ideal polymer donor. By replacing a C–C unit with a B ← N unit, the resulting polymer PBNCPDT exhibits much lower LUMO/HOMO levels of −3.23 eV/−5.20 eV. PBNCPDT also shows a narrower optical bandgap (Eg = 1.73 eV) than that (Eg = 1.85 eV) of PCPDT, which is helpful for harvesting of sunlight. Moreover, PBNCPDT with the B ← N unit is not a typical D–A type conjugated polymer because its LUMO and HOMO are both delocalized over the whole conjugated framework. As the control PSC device based on PCPDT exhibits an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.45 V and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.63%, the device of PBNCPDT shows much improved Voc of 0.82 V and PCE of 3.74%. These results indicate that a B ← N unit can be used to develop polymer donors for high-performance PSC devices.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have received great attention due to the advantages of low cost, flexibility and light weight. Intensive efforts have been devoted to the development of polymer electron donors to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. The key requirement for a polymer donor in PSC is its LUMO/HOMO energy levels. When phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) with a LUMO level of −3.9 eV is used as the acceptor, an ideal polymer donor should have a LUMO level of around −3.6 eV for efficient exciton dissociation and should have a HOMO level of around −5.1 eV for optimized high open-circuit voltage with a bandgap (LUMO/HOMO difference) of around 1.5 eV for efficient harvesting of sunlight. As normal homopolymers, e.g. poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), always have a large bandgap and cannot possess such ideal LUMO/HOMO levels, a successful strategy of alternating an electron-donating unit (D) and an electron-accepting unit (A) has been widely used to tune the energy levels of conjugated polymers for good PSC device performance. A large family of D–A type polymer donors with finely tuned LUMO/HOMO levels have been reported to exhibit excellent PSC device performance. Another efficient strategy to design donor polymers with suitable LUMO/HOMO energy levels is using quinoid polymers with electron-withdrawing substitutes.

The B ← N coordination bond and the C–C covalent bond are isoelectronic and isosteric. The B ← N unit has been widely used by Yamaguchi et al., S. Wang et al. and Y. Wang et al. to develop small molecules with low-lying LUMO levels. Recently, our group has introduced a B ← N unit into the design of conjugated polymer acceptors. By replacing a C–C unit with a B ← N unit in the D repeating unit of a D–A type conjugated polymer, the LUMO/HOMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers can be decreased by 0.5–0.6 eV and consequently the typical polymer donor is converted to a polymer acceptor. In this manuscript, we report the application of a B ← N unit to tune the LUMO/HOMO levels of polymer donor materials for enhanced PSC device performance.
The cyclopenta-[2,1-b:3,4-b′]-dithiophene unit (CPDT) is a widely used electron-donating unit. The homopolymer of CPDT (PCPDT) exhibits the LUMO/HOMO levels of −2.71 eV/−4.98 eV, which are largely deviated from −3.60 eV/−5.10 eV of an ideal polymer donor. In this manuscript, in order to tune the LUMO/HOMO levels of PCPDT for good PSC device performance, we utilize the B ← N unit and develop an alternating polymer PBNCPDT with the much decreased LUMO/HOMO levels of −3.23 eV/−5.20 eV (see Scheme 1). The delocalized LUMO and HOMO over the whole conjugated framework indicate that PBNCPDT is not a typical D–A type polymer. As the control PSC device based on PCPDT exhibits the low open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.45 V and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.63%, the PSC device of PBNCPDT shows a much improved Voc of 0.82 V and PCE of 3.74%. These results indicate that the B ← N unit is a novel approach to tune the energy levels of polymer donors for high-performance PSCs.

The synthetic routes of both PBNCPDT and PCPDT are shown in Scheme 1. Stille polymerization of 2 and 5 readily afforded PBNCPDT in 77% yield. With the unsymmetric B ← N-containing unit, PBNCPDT should be regiorandom because both head-to-head and head-to-tail bonding modes of the B ← N-containing unit and the CPDT unit may exist. The chemical structure of PBNCPDT is verified by 1H NMR and elemental analysis. PCPDT was synthesized by the Stille polymerization of the corresponding C–C unit-containing monomers 4 and 5. The synthesis of the homopolymer of 1 was also tried, and the product was insoluble in common organic solvents. Thus, the homopolymer of 1 was not discussed in this work. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) and PDI were 37100 g mol−1 and 2.28 for PBNCPDT, and 33900 g mol−1 and 2.75 for PCPDT. Their thermal stability was characterized using thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA) under a N2 flow. PBNCPDT and PCPDT display a degrading temperature (Td) at a 5% weight loss of 331 °C and 390 °C, respectively (see the ESI). Their high molecular weights and good thermal stability imply that the two polymers can be used to fabricate polymer solar cells.


Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory were performed to theoretically investigate the effects of the B ← N unit on the electronic structures of PCPDT and PBNCPDT. To simplify the calculation, the model molecules with two repeating units and methyl side chains, TCPDT and DBNCPDT, were employed. As shown in Fig. 1, similar to those of TCPDT, both the LUMO and HOMO of DBNCPDT with a B ← N unit are delocalized over the nearly entire framework. Replacing a C–C unit by a B ← N unit in conjugated polymers does not significantly affect the distribution of electrons. D–A type conjugated polymers based on an alternating electron-donating unit and an electron-accepting unit always have HOMO delocalized on the entire conjugated framework and LUMO localized on the A unit. The delocalized LUMO and HOMO of DBNCPDT indicate that PBNCPDT with the B ← N unit is not a typical D–A type polymer. Comparison of the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of TCPDT and DBNCPDT suggests that the B ← N unit significantly decreases the LUMO and HOMO levels of the conjugated polymers (Fig. 1). As discussed later, the decrease of LUMO/HOMO energy levels will be beneficial for the application as a polymer donor for polymer solar cells.


The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the polymers in solutions (o-DCB) and in thin films (spin-coated onto quartz substrates) are shown in Fig. 2 and the data are listed in Table 1. In solution, the absorption maximum of PBNCPDT (λmax = 590 nm) is red-shifted by 22 nm compared to that of PCPDT (λmax = 568 nm). In thin films, while the absorption spectrum of PCPDT shows a broad absorption band with two peaks at 615 nm/576 nm, the absorption spectrum of PBNCPDT exhibits an absorption maxima at 647 nm/612 nm. The redshifts of absorption spectra from in solution to in film for the two polymers are due to the strong intermolecular interactions and the close packing of the polymer backbones in the solid states. While PCPDT in thin films exhibits an optical bandgap of 1.85 eV, PBNCPDT shows a narrower optical bandgap of 1.73 eV due to the employment of the B ← N unit. As discussed above, the narrow bandgap is important for efficient harvesting of sunlight in PSC.

To investigate the effects of the B ← N unit on the LUMO/HOMO energy levels of the polymers, cyclic voltammetry measurements of the polymer films were performed. As shown in Fig. 3a, PCPDT shows an irreversible reduction wave and a reversible oxidation wave with the onset reduction potential (Eredonset) of −2.09 V and the onset oxidation potential (Eoxonset) of +0.18 V, respectively. In comparison, PBNCPDT shows quasi-reversible reduction and oxidation processes with more positive onset reduction potential and onset oxidation potential (Eredonset = −1.57 V, Eoxonset = +0.40 V). According to these onset reduction and oxidation potentials, their LUMO/HOMO energy levels are estimated and listed in Table 1. The LUMO/HOMO levels of PCPDT and PBNCPDT are −2.71 eV/−4.98 eV and −3.23 eV/−5.20 eV, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3b, the HOMO level of PBNCPDT with the B ← N unit is lowered by 0.22 eV than that of PCPDT, which is expected to give a higher open-circuit voltage in PSCs. The LUMO level of PBNCPDT is decreased by 0.52 eV compared to that of PCPDT. Moreover, despite the large decrease, the LUMO level of PBNCPDT is still higher by 0.67 eV than that of PC71BM, providing enough driving force for exciton dissociation in PSC devices. These results imply that the B ← N unit can significantly decrease the LUMO/HOMO energy levels of conjugated polymers and make the LUMO/HOMO energy levels of PBNCPDT be suitable for the application as a polymer donor in PSCs.



Fig. 4 shows the fluorescence spectra of PBNCPDT in organic solvents with different polarities, including chlorobenzene, tetrahydrofuran, CHCl3, CH2Cl2 and o-dichlorobenzene. The fluorescence peaks of PBNCPDT in organic solvents are all around 665 nm and no solvatochromic effects are observed. It is well-known that D–A type molecules or polymers usually exhibit redshifted fluorescence peaks in polar solvents compared to non-polar solvents. Therefore, the absence of solvatochromic effects of PBNCPDT confirms that PBNCPDT is not a D–A type conjugated polymers. This is consistent with the theoretical calculation results of PBNCPDT, which shows both delocalized LUMO and delocalized HOMO.


PSC devices using PCPDT and PBNCPDT as polymer donors were fabricated with a conventional configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al. The active layer was spin-coated from the solution of polymer:PC71BM with a ratio of 1:3 (w/w) in o-DCB containing 3 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the solvent additive. Fig. 5a displays the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices under AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) and Table 2 summarizes the device characteristics.

The device based on PCPDT shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.63% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.45 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 3.16 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 44.3%. In comparison, the device of PBNCPDT shows a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 9.89 mA cm−2, a FF of 46.1%, corresponding to a PCE of 3.74%. The Voc of PSCs is related to the difference between the HOMO level of the polymer donor and the LUMO level of the PC71BM acceptor. It is notable that the Voc of the device of PBNCPDT with the B ← N unit is enhanced by 0.37 V compared to that of PCPDT. This is consistent with the deeper HOMO level of PBNCPDT compared to PCPDT. The much improved Jsc of the PBNCPDT-based device compared to that of the PCPDT-based device is attributed to both the improved active layer morphology and the enhanced sunlight absorption capability. Fig. 5b shows the EQE curves of the two devices. The integral current density values calculated from the EQE curves and the standard AM 1.5 G spectrum agree well with those measured from the J–V scan. Owing to the much improved Voc and Jsc, the PSC device of PBNCPDT with the B ← N unit exhibited much enhanced power conversion efficiency compared to that of PCPDT. The PSC device performance suggests that the LUMO/HOMO levels of PBNCPDT with the B ← N unit are more suitable for PSC polymer donor application than that of PCPDT.
TEM and AFM were employed to study the active layer morphology of the PSC devices of the two polymers. Fig. 6a and b show the TEM images of the PCPDT:PC71BM blend and PBNCPDT:PC71BM blend, respectively. The polymer domains appear as bright regions and the PC71BM domains appear as dark regions because of their different degrees of electron scattering. The PCPDT:PC71BM blend exhibits a large-scale phase separated morphology, which is not beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport, and thus leads to limited Jsc and low PCE. In comparison, the PBNCPDT:PC71BM blend shows a nanofibrillar network morphology and the fine fibers of the donor polymer can be clearly seen, resulting in good photovoltaic performance. Fig. 6c and d display the corresponding AFM height images of the surface of the two films. Although the two films have the similar root-mean-square (rms) roughness, much larger scale phase separation is observed in the PCPDT:PC71BM blend compared to that in the PBNCPDT:PC71BM blend. This is in consistence with the TEM results and the device performance.

In summary, we demonstrate a strategy of decreasing the LUMO/HOMO energy levels of polymer electron donors via replacing a C–C unit by a B ← N unit for enhanced PSC performance. The resulting polymer with the B ← N unit is not a D–A type conjugated polymer because its LUMO and HOMO are both delocalized over the whole conjugated framework. The LUMO/HOMO levels of PBNCPDT with the B ← N unit are −3.23 eV/−5.20 eV, which are lowered by 0.52 eV/0.22 eV compared to that of PCPDT with the C–C unit (−2.71 eV/−4.98 eV). Moreover, PBNCPDT also shows a narrower optical bandgap than that of PCPDT. These improvements make PBNCPDT be more suitable to be used as polymer donors for PSCs. As the control PSC device based on PCPDT exhibits a low Voc of 0.45 V and PCE of 0.63%, the PSC device of PBNCPDT shows a much improved Voc of 0.82 V and PCE of 3.74%. These results indicate that the B ← N unit can be used to develop polymer donors for high-performance PSC devices, and intensive studies on polymer donor materials following this strategy are in progress in our laboratory.

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker AV-400 (400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C) spectrometer in CDCl3 at 25 °C. Elemental analysis was performed with a VarioEL elemental analyzer. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was recorded at 35 °C to measure the molecular weights of the polymers with a Waters 410 instrument. Monodisperse polystyrene was used as the standard and THF was used as the eluent. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of the polymers were performed under a N2 flow under at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 with a Perkin-Elmer-TGA 7. The temperature of degradation (Td) was corresponding to a 5% weight loss. UV-Vis absorption spectra and fluorescence spectra were measured with a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer and a Hitachi F-4500 spectrometer, respectively, in spectral grade solvents.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the polymer films were performed with a CHI660a electrochemical workstation using n-Bu4NClO4 (0.1 M) in acetonitrile or N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as an electrolyte solution and ferrocene as an internal reference at a scan rate of 50 mV S−1. The CV cell consisted of a glassy carbon electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and a standard calomel reference electrode. The polymers were casted on the working electrode for measurements. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the polymers were calculated according to the equations: HOMO/LUMO = −(4.80 + Eonsetox/Eonsetred) (eV). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was recorded with a SPA300HV (Seiko Instruments, Inc., Japan) in the tapping mode.

PC71BM (American Dye Source) was purchased from the commercial resources and used as received. PBNCPDT and PCPDT were used without further treatments. ITO glass substrates were successively ultrasonicated for 10 minutes with detergent, de-ionized water, acetone, and iso-propanol, respectively. The processed ITO glass substrates were dried at 120 °C overnight and subsequently UV-ozone treated for 25 min, and then PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P VP A14083) was spin-coated on these pre-cleaned ITO substrates and baked at 120 °C for 30 min. Then, all the substrates were transferred to a glove box filled with nitrogen. The active layer (100 nm) based on PBNCPDT:PC71BM (1:3 w/w) was spin-cast with the solution in ortho-dichlorobenzene/1,8-diiodooctane (97:3 by volume). The PCPDT:PC71BM (1:3 w/w) active layer (100 nm) was spin-coated from the ortho-dichlorobenzene/1,8-diiodooctane (97:3 by volume) solution. Finally, LiF (1 nm) and Al (100 nm) were sequentially deposited on the top of the active layer in a vacuum chamber after the vacuum pressure being reached 4 × 10−4 Pa. The active area of our device was 8 mm2. Under illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 provided by an Oriel 150 W solar simulator with an AM 1.5 G filter, we measured the J–V curves of the devices using a Keithley 2400 source meter. We measured the EQE under the short-circuit conditions with a lock-in amplifier (SR830, Stanford Research System) at a chopping frequency of 280 Hz during illumination with a monochromatic light from a Xenon lamp.
