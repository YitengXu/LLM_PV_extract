We fabricated and tested inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs) that use a blend of PTB7-Th and PC71BM as the active layer and poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dihexylfluorene)] (PFN) with different amounts and types of acid derivatives as the cathode buffer layer to systematically study the effect of amounts and types of acid additives such as acetic acid (AA), 4-trifluoromethyl benzoic acid (CF3BA), trifluoroacetic acid (CF3AA), and 4-toluene sulfonic acid (TsOH) on the device performances. Consequently, a significant improvement was obtained for the device based on ZnO/PFN with 1.0 equivalent (eq.) of acid derivatives. The PCE of the device with 1.0 equivalent of AA, CF3BA, CF3AA, and TsOH was 9.9, 10.3, 10.3, and 10.6% respectively, whereas the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device with pristine ZnO was 8.7%. The performances of the devices followed the trend of the acid dissociation constant of acid derivatives. In addition, we discovered that the most effective acid derivative is TsOH. Furthermore, we observed that the devices based on PFN with acid derivatives exhibited reduced trap-assisted recombination and interfacial bimolecular recombination. Furthermore, reduced trap-assisted recombination of the devices agreed well with the trend of the PCEs of PSCs and followed the trend of the acid dissociation constant of acid derivatives.

In the past few decades, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted a lot of attention because they are capable of being promising energy resources in the future. PSCs can be particularly advantageous in large scale applications where roll-to-roll is used because they are flexible and light-weight. Recently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs reached up to 16%, and this can be achieved by synthesizing donor and acceptor materials (i.e., photoactive materials), control of the morphology of the photoactive layer, and engineering the electrode interface. Currently, the studies on PSCs are mainly focused on the improvement of their PCEs.

The charge collection capability plays an important role in enhancing the PCEs. By inserting a buffer layer between the active layer and electrodes, the energy offset can be overcome and the charge collection capability of the cathode can be enhanced. Selecting an appropriate material for the buffer layer can efficiently reduce the recombination of charges and lower the contact resistance at the electrode interface, which lead to the improvement of charge extraction capability. Consequently, the short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF) can be selectively or even simultaneously enhanced in a single junction device. ZnO has been commonly used as the electron transport layer in inverted PSCs. Thus, by decreasing the energy offset at the ZnO interface, the electron collection capability can be enhanced. Tremendous approaches have been proposed to decrease the energy offset between ZnO and photoactive layers, e.g., introduction of conjugated/non-conjugated polymer electrolytes or self-assembled monolayer (SAM) treatment at the interface. Lithium or ethoxylated polyethyleneimine (PEIE) doping in the ZnO matrix can improve the PCEs by reducing the defects and traps of the ZnO layer. Among them, conjugated polymer electrolytes (CPEs) have been widely used as the cathode buffer layer (CBL). Basically, CPEs consist of a hydrophobic conjugated main chain and hydrophilic polar ionic groups as the side chain. The polar ionic group is directed toward the surface of the ZnO layer and the hydrophobic main chain is directed toward the photoactive layer. Thus, the device performance can be improved by forming an interface dipole through the spontaneous reorganization of polar ionic groups.
Poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) has been widely used in electroluminescent devices as an emitter and CBL for PSCs when compared with other CPEs. This polymer can be dissolved in common solvents such as chlorinated hydrocarbon, tetrahydrofuran (THF), toluene, or xylene. Therefore, it is difficult to construct multi-layer structured devices because of the poor solvent resistance of the successive layer coating. However, quaternarizing PFN with alkyl bromide (bromoethane or bromomethane) or adding a small amount of acetic acid (AA) to PFN can alter its intrinsic solubility. Both quaternarized PFN and PFN modified with AA were readily soluble in polar solvents such as methanol, ethanol, N,N-dimethylformamide, and dimethylsulfoxide. These treatments allow the application of PFN to fabricate multi-layer structured devices. A typical degree of quaternarization for PFN is less than 90% even after a long quaternarization reaction time (a week or longer). PFN salts are easily formed by a simple acid–base reaction of AA with the tertiary amine group in the side chain of PFN. These salts do not dissolve in chlorinated hydrocarbon, THF, toluene, or xylene. Therefore, adding AA into the PFN matrix is convenient for preparing insoluble films with solvent resistance on the successive layer coating. However, it is necessary to systematically study the effect of the amount of added AA on the device performance because an excess of AA in the PFN layer can destroy the device. Polyelectrolytes with different counter anions have also been used to enhance the electron injection/collection ability at the cathode interface. Therefore, it is necessary to study the effect of the type of acid additive on the photovoltaic properties to understand the role of the counter anion of acid derivatives. In this study, we report the photovoltaic properties of inverted PSCs (shown in Fig. 1b and c) based on PFN with different amounts and types of acid derivatives (shown in Fig. 1a) as the CBL. To the best of our knowledge, the effect of the amount and type of acid additive in the PFN interlayer on photovoltaic properties has never been reported before.

We used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to analyze the presence of acid derivatives on the ZnO surface. Fig. 2a shows the survey spectra of acid derivatives on the ZnO surface. The peaks at 530, 400, and 285 eV in the survey spectra correspond to O 1s, N 1s, and C 1s, respectively. The peak at 688 eV in the XPS spectra of ZnO/PFN-CF3BA and ZnO/PFN-CF3AA corresponds to F 1s (Fig. 2b). As shown in Fig. 2c, the peak at 169 eV in the XPS spectrum of ZnO/PFN-TsOH corresponds to S 2p. The presence of the acid–base reaction product of PFN and acid derivatives was confirmed by the XPS spectra. The peaks at 1045 and 1021 eV (Fig. S1a) correspond to Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2, respectively. The position of the corresponding peaks in ZnO with diverse acid-modified PFNs was shifted to higher binding energy than those in the spectrum of pristine ZnO. This means that the change in the surroundings of the Zn atoms has become more electron rich compared to pristine ZnO. The peaks at 532 and 530 eV (Fig. S1b) in the XPS spectrum of ZnO were assigned to oxygen in the OH group and in ZnO, respectively. The number of defect sites in ZnO cannot be estimated from the intensity of the OH peak because the peak at 532 eV originated from the ZnO and acid derivatives simultaneously.

The equilibrium constant (K) of the reaction between PFN and different types of acid derivatives (shown in Fig. 3) can be estimated by using K = 10(pKa(PFN-H+A−)−pKa(A–H)), where pKa(A–H) is the pKa value of the acid derivative and pKa(PFN-H+A−) is the pKa value of PFN-H+. Assuming that PFN-H+ is equivalent to a trialkyl ammonium salt and its pKa value is 10.75, the K values of acid–base reactions between PFN and different types of acid derivatives were estimated to be 1.0 × 106, 1.2 × 107, 3.3 × 1010, and 3.6 × 1013 for AA, CF3BA, CF3AA, and TsOH, respectively. Thus, it was confirmed that all the trialkyl amine in the side chains was completely converted to a trialkyl ammonium salt by the addition of acid derivatives such as AA, CF3BA, CF3AA, and TsOH.
Fig. S2 shows the static water contact angle (SWCA) measurement data of the ZnO surface and ZnO surface with PFN-acid derivatives. The SWCA of the ZnO surface with PFN added with 1.0 equivalent (eq.) of acid derivatives is larger than that of the ZnO surface (19.08°) because the ZnO surface with PFN-acid derivatives becomes more hydrophobic when compared with the pristine ZnO surface. Because of the high hydrophobic nature of fluorine atoms, the ZnO surface with PFN-CF3BA and PFN-CF3AA exhibited a larger SWCA when compared with the others. The SWCA data can be well related to the physical properties of PFN-acid derivatives, which might affect the photovoltaic properties of PSCs with different combinations of acid derivatives and PFN as the CBL.
We fabricated inverted type PSCs (ITO/ZnO/PFN with acid derivatives/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag) to investigate the effect of different types of acid derivatives on the photovoltaic properties. Several different amounts of acid derivatives ranging from 0.5 to 6.0 eq. were tested to detect the optimum concentration of acid derivatives (see Table 1). We noticed that the devices with PFN added with 1.0 eq. of acid derivative exhibited the highest PCE. As for AA, the amount of AA did not significantly affect the PCE of the devices. Besides, an excess of CF3BA and TsOH did not significantly affect the PCE. This is presumably because these acid derivatives are in the solid state. However, the PCE of the devices with PFN added with 6.0 eq. of acid derivative was excessively lower when compared with the other types of devices. As shown in Fig. S3, the surface roughness of ZnO/PFN with 6.0 eq. of CF3AA was 5.39 nm, which was excessively larger than that of ZnO/PFN with 1.0 eq. of CF3AA (3.02 nm). This is because the excess of liquid CF3AA may deteriorate the ZnO layer. Fig. 4a and b display the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs with PFN added with an optimum amount of acid derivatives that exhibit the highest PCE under illumination and the J–V curves under dark conditions; their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The PCEs of the devices with AA, CF3BA, CF3AA, and TsOH were 9.9% (short circuit current (Jsc) = 18.8 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (Voc) = 0.80 V, and fill factor (FF) = 66.5%), 10.3% (Jsc = 18.8 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.81 V, and FF = 68.2%), 10.3% (Jsc = 18.4 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.81 V, and FF = 69.5%), and 10.6% (Jsc = 18.7 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.80 V, and FF = 70.6%), respectively, whereas the PCE of the device with pristine ZnO was 8.7% with Jsc = 17.7 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.80 V, and FF = 61.4%. Thus, it is evident that a significant improvement can be obtained using the device based on ZnO/PFN with 1.0 eq. of acid derivatives. The PCEs of the PSCs based on ZnO/PFN with 1.0 eq. of AA, CF3BA, CF3AA, and TsOH were improved by 15.0, 18.9, 18.2, and 21.4%, respectively, when compared with the PSC based on pristine ZnO.

The relative enhancement of Jsc of the PSCs based on ZnO/PFN-AA (1.0 eq.), ZnO/PFN-CF3BA (1.0 eq.), ZnO/PFN-CF3AA (1.0 eq.), and ZnO/PFN-TsOH (1.0 eq.) was 6.28, 6.51, 3.96 and 5.77%, respectively, when compared with the PSC with pristine ZnO. And the relative enhancement of FFs of the PSCs with ZnO/PFN-AA (1.0 eq.), ZnO/PFN-CF3BA (1.0 eq.), ZnO/PFN-CF3AA (1.0 eq.), and ZnO/PFN-TsOH (1.0 eq.) was 8.3, 11.1, 13.2 and 15.0%, respectively, when compared with the PSC with pristine ZnO. The main contributing factor for the enhancement of efficiency was the improvement of Jsc and FF, simultaneously. In order to understand the trend of the Jsc of the PSCs, we performed Kelvin probe microscopy (KPM) measurements of ZnO and PFN-modified ZnO. KPM is a well-known powerful tool for investigating the work function of metals or semiconductors. The work function of ZnO/PFN-AA (1.0 eq.), ZnO/PFN-CF3BA (1.0 eq.), ZnO/PFN-CF3AA (1.0 eq.), and ZnO/PFN-TsOH (1.0 eq.) was –4.09, –4.11, –4.07, and –4.06 eV, respectively, which are higher than that of pristine ZnO (−4.29 eV). Thus, the energy offset at the interface was reduced by the thin layer of PFN with diverse acid derivatives. The reduction of the energy barrier at the interface will promote the electron collection capability. Thus, the Jsc values of the devices with ZnO with PFN with diverse acid derivatives were better than that of the device with pristine ZnO. The work function data agree well with the trend of Jsc. Noticeably, the trend of Jsc data and the work function were not significantly dependent on the type of acid derivative. Interestingly, the PCE and FF of the devices follow the trend of the pKa value of acid derivatives.
The series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) were obtained from the J–V curves obtained under dark and 1.0 sun conditions (summarized in Table 2). The Rs of the devices with ZnO/PFN-AA, ZnO/PFN-CF3BA, ZnO/PFN-CF3AA, and ZnO/PFN-TsOH under dark conditions was 2.64, 2.59, 2.48, and 2.12 Ω cm2, respectively, and they are smaller than that of the device with ZnO (3.02 Ω cm2). The Rs values of the devices under 1.0 sun conditions were higher than those under dark conditions and follow the trend of the Rs data under dark conditions. The obtained Rs data support the trends of FF and PCE. The Jsc data calculated from the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) curves (see Fig. S4) of the devices agreed well with the Jsc of the devices. The shunt resistance (Rsh) of the devices with ZnO/PFN-AA, ZnO/PFN-CF3BA, ZnO/PFN-CF3AA, and ZnO/PFN-TsOH under 1.0 sun conditions was 0.83, 1.00, 1.02, and 1.10 kΩ cm2, respectively, which are higher than that of the device with pristine ZnO (0.58 kΩ cm2). The Rsh data under illumination are well coherent with the FF of the devices.

To determine the carrier recombination and transport mechanism, we acquired the electrical impedance spectra (EIS) of the PSCs with ZnO and ZnO/PFN with 1.0 eq. of AA, CF3BA, CF3AA, and TsOH, respectively under dark conditions. The EIS measurements were performed under dark conditions at different applied voltages with a frequency ranging from 1 Hz to 1.0 MHz. Fig. 5a shows the Nyquist plots of the devices at 0 V. In our results, a single semi-circle without the transmission line was observed in the Nyquist plots of each device. The transmission line is generally observed when the transport resistance is smaller than the recombination resistance (Rrec), indicating efficient charge collection. In the case of strong recombination, the EIS spectra followed the Gerischer impedance model. The absence of a transmission line indicates that the devices experience strong recombination. In addition, the diameter of the semi-circle has been assigned as charge transfer resistance.
The size of the EIS semi-circle reflects the extent of Rrec. Thus, the arc size in EIS depends on the extent of charge recombination in PSCs. The magnitude of Rrec of the devices was in the order: ZnO (1150 kΩ) < ZnO/PFN-AA (1490 kΩ) < ZnO/PFN-CF3BA (1890 kΩ) < ZnO/PFN-CF3AA (2350 kΩ) < ZnO/PFN-TsOH (2365 kΩ). By introducing acid-modified PFN as the CBL, the size of the semi-circle is increased, leading to increased Rrec, and thus the recombination at the interface is suppressed. Noticeably, the device based on TsOH modified PFN exhibited the highest Rrec among the acid derivatives, indicating the lowest reduced interfacial recombination. This can be well related to the FFs of the PSCs.

Fig. 5b shows Rrec as a function of applied voltage under dark conditions. It should be noticed that with an increase in the applied voltage, the Rrec gradually decreased. This is due to the fact that the extraction of charge is hindered at a high applied voltage. The Rrec of the devices based on acid-modified PFN at each applied voltage exhibited higher values than that of the device with pristine ZnO. This result confirms that the devices with acid-modified PFN lower the charge recombination during charge transfer and transport. Among the devices, the device with TsOH modified PFN exhibited the highest Rrec at various applied voltages. Fig. S5 shows the Nyquist plots of the devices at 0 V under 1.0 sun conditions. The Rrec of the devices based on ZnO, ZnO/PFN-AA, ZnO/PFN-CF3BA, ZnO/PFN-CF3AA, ZnO/PFN-TsOH was 3.69, 6.35, 6.69, 7.14, and 7.21 kΩ, respectively. They are well coherent with the Rsh data under illumination and follow the trend of Rrec under dark conditions. The magnitude of Rrec of the devices under 1.0 sun conditions was significantly smaller than those of the devices under dark conditions. This is due to the fact that the photo-induced charge carriers lower the Rrec of the devices.
To elaborate the electron transport properties of the ZnO layer, electron only devices (ITO/ZnO/PFN with 1.0 eq. of AA, CF3BA, CF3AA, or TsOH/PC71BM (60 nm)/Al (100 nm)) (Fig. S6) were fabricated and tested. The electron mobility of the device was calculated by using the Mott–Gurney equation. The electron mobility of the devices based on ZnO/PFN with 1.0 eq. of AA, CF3BA, CF3AA, and TsOH was 2.73 × 10−3, 3.30 × 10−3, 3.33 × 10−3, and 3.34 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. They are higher than that of the device based on pristine ZnO (2.24 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). Thus, the Jsc data of the devices based on ZnO with acid-modified PFN were improved compared to that of the device with pristine ZnO. But, the change in mobility data is not significantly dependent on the type of acid derivative. This is one possible reason for the Jsc data not being significantly dependent on the type of acid derivative.
Furthermore, we evaluated the relationship between the photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) to realize the charge transport and collection properties of the devices. The Jph and Veff can be defined as JL (current density under illumination) − JD (current density under dark conditions) and V0 (voltage at Jph = 0) − Va (applied voltage), respectively. As shown in Fig. S7, the Veff values in the saturated photocurrent regime (Vsat) of the device based on pristine ZnO and ZnO/PFN with 1.0 eq. of AA, CF3BA, CF3AA, and TsOH were 0.20, 0.18, 0.18, 0.16, and 0.15 V. Noticeably, the trend of saturated voltage agrees with the change of Jsc of the PSCs because a smaller Vsat indicates a faster transition from the space-charge-limited regime to the saturation regime.
The saturation current density (Jsat) can be correlated with the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax), exciton dissociation probability, and carrier transport and collection probability at high Veff. The Gmax was calculated by using the equation Jph/qL, where q and L are the electron charge and thickness of the active layer, respectively. Gmax is related to the absorption of light by the active layer. The Gmax under the Jsat conditions of the devices based on pristine ZnO and ZnO/PFN with 1.0 eq. of AA, CF3BA, CF3AA, and TsOH was 1.60 × 1028, 1.61 × 1028, 1.68 × 1028, 1.64 × 1028, and 1.66 × 1028 cm−3 s−1, respectively. No significant changes in Gmax were observed because the Gmax is dependent on the absorbance of the active layer. The Jsat is limited by the carrier transport and collection, when all the photo-generated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers at high Veff. Thus, the carrier transport and collection probability at any Veff can be estimated from the ratio of Jph/Jsat. The saturation current density (Jsat) is estimated from the convergent value of Jph. The Jph/Jsat values of the PSCs with ZnO/PFN with 1.0 eq. of AA, CF3BA, CF3AA, and TsOH were 94.1, 94.5, 94.9, and 95.2%, respectively, which are higher than that of the device based on pristine ZnO (90.1%). This is due to the fact that the acid-modified PFN improves the carrier transport and collection of the devices. The trend of Jph/Jsat data of the devices with acid-modified ZnO follows the trend of the performances of the devices.
To realize the charge recombination kinetics at the interfaces further, we investigated the Jsc and Voc of the devices as a function of illumination intensity. The relationship between Jsc and illumination intensity is generally defined as Jsc ∝ Iα, where I is the illumination intensity. When α is 1, the devices exhibit completely bimolecular recombination under short-circuit conditions. As shown in Fig. 6a, the α of the devices based on ZnO/PFN with 1.0 eq. of AA, CF3BA, CF3AA, and TsOH was 0.98, 0.98, 0.98, and 0.97, respectively, which are comparable to that of the device based on ZnO (0.96). This indicates that the devices exhibited slight bimolecular recombination because of the decreased space charge at the interfaces. However, the α values were not dependent on the type of acid derivative. These results match well with the trend of Jsc and electron mobility of the devices.

Fig. 6b displays Voc as a function of illumination intensity (I). The relationship between Voc and illumination intensity is defined as Voc ∝ skT/qln(I), where k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, and electron charge, respectively. If the device has only the trap-assisted recombination channel, then the s value will be 2. If the device has only the band-to-band recombination, then the s value will be 1. The s values of the devices based on ZnO/PFN with 1.0 eq. of AA, CF3BA, CF3AA, and TsOH were estimated to be 1.36, 1.28, 1.16, and 1.12, respectively, which are smaller than that of the device with pristine ZnO (1.37). Thus, the devices exhibited reduced trap-assisted recombination. Note that the change in the s values of the devices agrees well with the trend of the PCEs of PSCs and follows the trend of the pKa value of acid derivatives.
Furthermore, the devices were kept in a nitrogen-filled glove box without passivation. After 800 hours, the PCEs of the devices based on ZnO and ZnO/PFN with 1.0 eq. of AA, CF3BA, CF3AA, and TsOH were found to be 97, 97, 94, 97, and 96% of their initial PCEs. The acidity of the additives did not significantly affect the device stability. However, the devices with excess acid derivatives exhibited poor stability when compared with the devices with 1.0 eq. of acid derivatives. The PCEs of the devices after 800 hours with 1.0 eq. of AA, CF3BA, CF3AA, and TsOH were found to be 88, 89, 90, 87, and 89% of their initial PCEs. The PCE of the device based on ZnO after 800 hours was 91%. This is presumably because the excess of acid derivatives destroys the devices.

All chemicals were purchased from Alfa Aesar or Sigma-Aldrich and used as received unless otherwise described. Poly([2,6′-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b;3,3-b]dithiophene]{3-fluoro-2[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl}) (PTB7-Th) and PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester) were purchased from Derthon Optoelectronic Materials Science Technology Co. Ltd. Poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dihexylfluorene)] (PFN) was synthesized by the literature procedures. And the rest of the experimental details for the static water contact angle, AFM, IPCE, EIS, and J–V curves of electron only devices, and Jphvs. Veff curves of the devices are available in the ESI.


To systematically study the effect of acid additives such as AA, CF3BA, CF3AA, and TsOH in PFN on device performance, we fabricated and tested inverted PSCs that use a blend of PTB7-Th and PC71BM as the active layer and PFN with different amounts and types of acid derivatives as the CBL. The optimum amount of acid derivatives was found to be 1.0 eq. for all the devices based on ZnO/PFN. The PCEs of the devices with 1.0 eq. of AA, CF3BA, CF3AA, and TsOH were 9.9, 10.3, 10.3, and 10.6%, respectively, whereas the PCE of the device with pristine ZnO was 8.7%. The main contributing factor for the enhancement of PCE was the improvement of Jsc and FF, simultaneously. The trend of Jsc data and the work function were not significantly dependent on the type of acid derivative. The FF and PCEs of the devices followed the trend of the acid dissociation constant of acid derivatives. We discovered that the most effective acid derivative was TsOH in this study. The devices based on PFN with acid derivatives exhibited reduced trap-assisted recombination and interfacial bimolecular recombination. Notably, the reduced trap-assisted recombination of the devices agrees well with the trend of the PCEs of PSCs and follows the trend of the acid dissociation constant of acid derivatives.
