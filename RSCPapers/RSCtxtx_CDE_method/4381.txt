Smart electronic devices are becoming ubiquitous due to many appealing attributes including portability, long operational time, rechargeability and compatibility with the user-desired form factor. Integration of mobile power sources (MPS) based on photovoltaic technologies with smart electronics will continue to drive improved sustainability and independence. With high efficiency, low cost, flexibility and lightweight features, halide perovskite photovoltaics have become promising candidates for MPS. Realization of these photovoltaic MPS (PV-MPS) with unconventionally extraordinary attributes requires new ‘out-of-box’ designs. Natural materials have provided promising designing solutions to engineer properties under a broad range of boundary conditions, ranging from molecules, proteins, cells, tissues, apparatus to systems in animals, plants, and humans optimized through billions of years of evolution. Applying bio-inspired strategies in PV-MPS could be biomolecular modification on crystallization at the atomic/meso-scale, bio-structural duplication at the device/system level and bio-mimicking at the functional level to render efficient charge delivery, energy transport/utilization, as well as stronger resistance against environmental stimuli (e.g., self-healing and self-cleaning). In this review, we discuss the bio-inspired/-mimetic structures, experimental models, and working principles, with the goal of revealing physics and bio-microstructures relevant for PV-MPS. Here the emphasis is on identifying the strategies and material designs towards improvement of the performance of emerging halide perovskite PVs and strategizing their bridge to future MPS.

For over 4.6 billion years, sunlight has been the largest natural energy source for our planet and has played a critical role in life existence. Early on, solar radiation provided the energy required for biomolecular transformations that drove various biophysical processes, such as metabolism, to create survival of lifeforms autotrophically, chemotropically, or heterotrophically. Later, photosynthetic processes emerged in microbes utilizing sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to synthesize oxygen and glucose, changing the atmospheric composition of ancient Earth and providing the foundation for the birth of aerobic multicellular life. Over time, these organisms have developed a variety of efficient ways to use solar energy. For example, as shown in Fig. 1, photosynthesis in green plants and cyanobacteria demonstrates high efficiencies reaching up to 5–10%. Birds are known to use photo-sensitive molecules in their retina to guide their navigation with the help of sunlight and geomagnetic field (by tuning the ratio between photoexcited singlet and triplet states under a magnetic field). Insects and hornets are known to exhibit a photoconductive phenomenon at the ‘yellow strips’ of their cuticle, which is believed to correlate with their daytime flight as solar radiation speeds up restoration of the ionic channel activity and the synaptic transmission in shoving motion. For poikilotherms or cold blooded animals such as frogs, absorption of heat from solar radiation is an important way to regulate their body temperature after hibernation, which is related to the solar-thermal effect of bio-dye molecules.

Today, rising electrification in developing countries and the rapid development of electronic devices in developed countries has created a huge electricity demand. In order to meet this growing demand, solar energy is being considered as one of the important renewable energy solutions. The COVID-19 pandemic and the post-COVID-19 era, when mobility restrictions limit activities of traditional power sectors, have demonstrated that renewable energy such as that obtained using solar photovoltaic techniques exhibit higher resilience than conventional energy sources. Projecting to the future, solar energy could play an important role in enabling longer operating times for mobile electronic devices such as smart phones, smart watches, various health monitoring sensors, mini-androids, drones, etc. For these ubiquitous devices, photovoltaic mobile power sources (PV-MPS), with an ‘off-the-grid’ design, can independently and sustainably provide energy for recharging batteries and are attractive solutions for future devices.
PV-MPS are attractive for use in mobile electronic devices due to their properties including portability, light-weight, flexibility, foldability, high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and long lifetimes. Recently, halide perovskites have demonstrated attractive physical properties such as micrometer-scale long exciton diffusion lengths, large optical absorption coefficients of up to 105 cm−1, direct bandgaps with great tunability down to the ideal 1.5 eV and great mechanical properties such as high folding, bending, and stretching tolerance, thanks to the ‘soft’ nature of the crystallographic lattice. These properties make them good photoactive layer candidates for photovoltaic applications. Compared to traditional first generation (1G) PVs of crystalline gallium arsenide (GaAs) and silicon (Si) (rigid and inflexible), and second generation (2G) PVs of multicrystalline or thin film inorganics, perovskite PVs exhibit high efficiency, high flexibility and low cost simultaneously, representing a promising technique for third generation (3G) PVs, particularly fitting well with the niche market of MPS. So far, perovskite PVs displayed an ultrahigh PCE of over twenty-five percent, exceeding those of state-of-the-art commercial multicrystalline silicon PVs, as well as other 3G PVs, including dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs), and quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs). As shown in Fig. 2a, the low manufacturing cost and the mechanical merits of the material make perovskite PVs good candidates for MPS applications. Another key figure-of-merit for MPS applications is the power-to-weight ratio (specific power or mass power density) defined by the overall output power over a specific device weight. In comparison to other flexible PV techniques based on thin film CdTe, amorphous silicon, organics, and QD light absorbers, perovskite PVs exhibit the highest value of 29.4 W g−1 (Fig. 2b), which could give the MPS a bonus attribute of ultra-light-weight. Similar to the power-to-weight ratio, power generation per unit area could be another key figure-of-merit, which can be represented from the PCE value. In principle, PCE is defined as the ratio of electric power output to light power input (i.e., one-sun illumination of 100 mW cm−2) which has taken the area into consideration. For example, silicon PVs with a module efficiency of 20% indicate a maximum electric power output of 20 mW over a 1 cm2 area under one-sun illumination. In comparison, the OPV module displays a much smaller power of 5–7 mW cm−2 but the perovskite module could offer 16 mW cm−2 or an even higher output, comparable to that of Si-PV.
Taking these into consideration and aiming at different levels of hierarchies, markets, and networks, as illustrated in Fig. 2c, the perovskite PV-MPS could have applications in small wearable electronics, such as smart electronics, epidermal electronics, e-textiles for entertainment, gaming and fashion (e.g., CuteCircuit by the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, USA and Project Jacquard by Google), medium size appliances such as vehicles, drones (e.g., Titan Aerospace's Solara 50 project), and robotics, and large architectural power sources (building and construction integrated power plants). Evolving from rigid devices to flexible electronic fabrics, many different types of products have been added into the market. With continuously growing demand from various applicational goals, market size is expected to reach up to 70 billion dollars by 2025 (Harrop, 2014). Various fields within this market include outdoor entertainment, healthcare, academic research and education, agriculture, cellular and mobile devices, consumer electronics and appliances, military, finance, athletics, and retail. Traditional 1G and 2G PV techniques may not meet all these implementations due to their intrinsic brittle nature and lower power-to-weight ratios. Although there have been attempts to incorporate demo samples of silicon or GaAs PV cells into automobiles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), there are still many barriers to overcome, such as cost, weight, and mechanical durability/endurance before these are feasible options. In the meantime, the perovskite PV technology could provide conformal and better performance solutions as long as issues such as manufacturing, performance, stability, and toxicity are addressed. Bio-inspired materials could be a viable option to address the gap in the current research. Biological materials and processes have been optimized through millions of years of evolution in the 8 million species on Earth. Delicate biomolecules and systems could lead to low-energy-cost synthesis, efficient mass transfer and energy usage, as well as intelligent functionalities such as self-healing and self-cleaning. Implementing templates from various biosystems has accelerated our advancements within disciplines such as engineering, architecture, medicine, neuromorphic computations,etc.
In this review, we will comprehensively discuss the bio-inspired strategies to address existing issues in perovskite PVs by reviewing (1) various biological molecules such as DNA, bacteriorhodopsin, and porphyrins to optimize the perovskite lattice and crystallization at the atomic/meso-scale, (2) biological structures to guide an optimized device structure with enhanced light harvesting and with robust resistivity against environmental stimuli at the device level, and (3) biological systems to inspire designs of perovskite PV-MPS with attributes such as increased-efficiency charge transfer, improved energy usage, and self-healing and self-cleaning functionalities at the system level. The marriage between biological systems and perovskite photovoltaics for next-generation solar-based mobile power could potentially provide a roadmap to revolutionary techniques in the future. We anticipate that this review could provide new insights and enable collaborations between these two fields.

The earliest bio-inspired attempt in PVs could be traced back to the 1970s and was based on the photosynthesis in green plants (mimicking basic electrochemical processes) which lead to the early development of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). It was based on a photoelectrochemical system consisting of a natural dye (mimicking pigment chlorophyll) as the light absorber, a photo-sensitized anode (with TiO2 offering the suitable conduction band to accept the excited electrons from the dye) and an electrolyte (to provide a redox bath to regenerate the dye). In early DSSCs, the liquidous electrolyte and low absorption coefficient of the dye significantly limited the efficiency and practical usage. Later, the fast development of solid electrolytes such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), as well as the replacement of the natural dye by halide perovskite materials, eventually led to the prototype of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Using prior knowledge from OPVs, DSSCs and even G1 and G2 PVs, many efforts have been made in the research and development of PSCs. This included interfacial engineering, compositional engineering, process development, and structural stability to advance the field to a milestone performance with a PCE of 25.7% and a T80 lifetime of >103 hours under accelerated testing (working temperature of 70 to 75 °C for solar cells under AM 1.5 one-sun illumination, without cooling systems). However, issues of defects at the lattice scale (nm), grain boundaries (GBs) at the mesoscale (μm) and their joint effects on Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination losses, interface-level charge extraction/transport/collection insufficiencies, device-level instability, manufacturing-oriented problems, and system-level non-intelligence need to be addressed with well-evolved and delicate solutions to move towards commercialization of PV-MPS. Fig. 3 provides an overview of the bio-inspired approaches for optimizing the performance of perovskite PV-MPS on using strategies focused on materials. Various biomolecules with specific functional groups that interact with either lattice defects, GBs or interface-level insufficiencies could be incorporated to enhance the properties for a given application. Bio-structural mimetic design could enable devices with functionalities under different environmental conditions, such as lotus-like hydrophobicity for rain/dust self-cleaning. From the PSC structural perspective, there are three main types of functional layers: electrodes (transparent front electrode and back contact), perovskite light absorbers, and functional charge transfer layers (CTLs including the hole transporting layer (HTL) and the electron transporting layer (ETL)). In the following text, we will specify various bio-derived additives/systems and prior attempts at incorporation, as well as hypothetical applications, in electrodes, charge transfer layers, and perovskite photo-absorber layers in PV cells.


At the user level, a mobile energy source (MPS) requires the device to be as easy to carry as possible. Considering the planar geometry of PV products, a foldable/flexible feature (such as a poster-like PV module product) can significantly reduce the storage space. This flexibility requirement is highly compatible with the ‘soft’ nature of halide perovskite materials. The perovskite exhibits a low Young's modulus of ∼5–20 GPa compared to the value of over 70 GPa for CIGS and Si-based inorganic semiconductors, and a higher defect tolerance due to the polaron nature that the electron–phonon coupling induced localized lattice deformation in the perovskite which could allow the charge carriers to travel long distances regardless of the presence of defects. The CTL including the HTL and ETL could also have good compliance in mechanical deformation, which could be realized using thin organic layers, polymeric materials (e.g., poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA)), and thin films of nanocrystals. In order to make the whole device highly foldable/flexible, both the back contact (top electrode) and front transparent conductive electrode (bottom electrode) need to be optimized as well. Particularly in the application of perovskite solar cells, compatibility to this type of PV technique also has certain requirements such as nonreactivity to the perovskite, a good semiconductor–metal interface in perovskite solar cells, and a protective role against moisture as well as multiple conventional concerns such as energy level matchup and good charge collection/conductivity attributes.


Assuming the light incidents from the bottom, the top electrode (back-contact electrode) is the uppermost layer in a PSC, generally composed of conductive metals such as silver (Ag), gold (Au), aluminum (Al), cupper (Cu) or carbon (C). The top electrode layer commonly serves to collect charges from the adjacent CTL and also to reflect the unabsorbed incident light backwards to the perovskite absorber to recycle the light. Ag and Au are commonly used electrode materials and in PSCs they exhibit good device efficiency. However, several chemical/mechanical stability issues have been raised recently. Particularly in the case of Ag, the movable I− ions from the perovskite layer can chemically react with Ag to produce a more stable phase of AgI. This will induce an I-vacancy in the crystallographic lattice which leads to the self-doping of the perovskite to an n-type semiconductor and thereby a poor contact at the semiconductor/metal interface. In addition, formation of the I− vacancy could also trigger a quick lattice collapse and eventually the degradation of device performance. This effect can also be present when a HTL is inserted between the perovskite and the top Ag electrode, where the HTL such as spiro-MeOTAD exhibits unavoidable pin-holes and voids providing highways for the migration of Ag atoms from the top electrode and I-ions from the bottom perovskite and further triggers the subsequent chemical reaction. In order to mitigate this problem, additional interfacial engineering strategies such as passivation of perovskite grain boundaries and insertion of interlayers could help. Nevertheless, Ag might not be the ideal choice for perovskite PVs. Similar to Ag, in Au electrode-based devices, Au atoms can also penetrate underlying CTLs and perovskite layers exposed to temperature conditions above 75 °C. According to Domanski et al., the migration of Au atoms can be reduced by the insertion of a thin Cr film below the Au electrode. This is a typical strategy in making transparent electrodes consisting of ultrathin Cr and Au, where the ultrathin Cr layer could sufficiently inhibit the accumulation of Au into aggerates and consequently uniformize the Au into a continuous film. From the cost and manufacturing perspective, both Au and Ag are not ideal candidates for commercial devices, although they have the highest reported PCEs and most of the ongoing research is based on Au and Ag. Alternatively, Al could be a more cost-effective solution (1 kg per 2 USD vs. 1 kg per 60000 USD of Au). So far, Al has been introduced as the top electrode for the p–i–n (inverted) architecture due to its higher Fermi level that can match well with the conduction band (CB) of n-type buffer layers for selective electron collection. Nevertheless, the Al electrode still has the issue of Al infiltration into the underlying organic layers and an additional oxidation issue that superficial Al atoms could be oxidized to Al2O3 when exposed to ambient air. In order to overcome these instability issues, particularly the metal atom infiltration problem, Cu, or another inert metal, could be a good electrode candidate. For example, Zhao et al. demonstrated that the Cu top electrode in a p–i–n (inverted) PSCs displayed good stability. By tracking the hypothetical formation of CuI at the interface between Cu and CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) at an elevated temperature of 80 °C for 100 hours, the authors confirmed that no diffusion of Cu into the perovskite occurred. This indicates that Cu could be a feasible candidate for a top electrode for stable, cost-effective, and high-performance PSCs. Apart from these bulk metal electrodes, various innovative electrodes including carbon black, silver nanowires (NWs) (AgNWs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), and dielectric/metal/dielectric structures have been attempted as top electrodes with good stability and cost-effectiveness. Beyond the basic requirements such as manufacturing cost, operational stability and a high PCE, for specific applications in MPS, the electrode should also have suitable mechanical properties. These properties include not only the mechanical flexibility of the electrode under bending conditions, but also the adhesion characteristics with its adjacent layer (i.e. underlaying CTLs) to ensure mechanical integrity of the device, which otherwise will lead to mechanical delamination of the top electrode from the bottom device during harsh or repeated bending conditions, leading to product failure. From the manufacturing perspective, simpler manufacturing processes of the top electrode would be more favorable. Conventional metal thin-film electrodes are generally based on the vacuum thermal evaporation process which requires high energy consumption and tedious processing steps. Alternative top electrodes need to be compatible with simpler and less energy-consuming processes such as mechanical transfer or solution processes.

Recently, biomimetic electrodes have been proposed in the energy sector. For example, a “biomimetic ant-nest electrode structure” has been proposed in lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. The “ant-nest-like” electrode can be fabricated using three easy processing methods, including ball-milling (for slurry mixing), doctor-blading (for laminate casting), and a sacrificial method (for porous structure creation), with CNT being the conductive additive to ease electron transportation and poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-fluorenone-co-methylbenzoic ester) (PFM) being the conductive binder (Fig. 4b). Such a design is inspired by the naturally superefficient ant-nest network, which is well known for its high spatial usage capable of abundant storage, and the multi-interconnected channels allowing efficient and fast food transportation. Following this scenario, shortening the travel time for charge carriers in PV devices by means of delicately designed nanostructures could secure a more efficient charge transport and thus minimize scattering losses during transport. Design of such a nanostructure for efficient transport is not easy, but could be modeled from existing bio-prototypes. The ‘foraging trail networks’ established by ants could be a good example. As shown in Fig. 4a, wood ants can build the foraging trail networks that provide a shorter travel time for the foraging ants to deliver the information of the food source. Foraging ants use attractive trail pheromones to guide their nestmates to food or water, use a repellent pheromone to mark unrewarding paths, and concentrate the signal at trail bifurcations (or decision points), thereby forming an information delivery network. Such a network is built with low construction costs and low maintenance efforts but displays high message transport efficiency. Similar to this foraging trail network, many other efficient biological transport systems have been discovered and investigated in different species, such as ants and bees. For example, in ant colonies, an individual ant can only do simple tasks, but millions of ants can collectively build an intelligent network with higher level intelligence complex behaviors like foraging for food, raising aphid “livestock,” building nests, waging war with other colonies and burying their dead. This interaction of individual components with simple behaviors to produce a whole network with complex behaviors is a new research field called ‘emergent propriety’ in the neuroscience branch of biology. The ‘emergent propriety’ has been found in many bio-prototypes such as cells (as components of vascular networks), mycelia (as components of fungal networks) or individual insects (as components of social insect foraging networks). Specifically, fungal mycelial networks can realize efficient transportation and robustness against damage, slime molds can create networks that balance transport efficiency and robustness, and these natural ‘smart’ networks at different biological levels point to the impressive ability of self-organized intelligent systems that satisfy specific goals. Mimicking this ‘emergent propriety’ has been proposed to develop the next-generation of non-von Neumann computation and artificial intelligence's (AI's) life 2.0. For smart transport and collection of charge carriers in the electrode, another well-known example is the natural leaf, exhibiting high mass transport efficiency, which has been widely used in biomimetic electrodes. In a natural leaf, the “hierarchy” vein structures embedded in spongy leaf cells can efficiently deliver water and minerals to every single leaf cell (will be specifically discussed in Section 3.2 – Bottom electrode). In parallel, the leaf can also manage the light usage efficiently. Fig. 4c illustrates the leaf body composed of palisade cells, spongy cells, and veins. It should be noted that palisade and spongy cells can scatter the sunlight by the refractive index mismatch between the cells and intercellular air spaces, leading to high light usage. The palisade cells also guide the incident light towards the deeper layer for effective light capture as well as an enhanced interfacial reflection. The spongy cells with large numbers of cell–air interfaces give rise to an internal light scattering effect that elongates the light path. Such a natural “optical meta-structure” can further tune the fractions between forward- and backward-scattered light by designing the population and geometry of the cells. Fig. 4d demonstrates the utilization of this natural leaf vein structure as a transparent network-electrode. Specifically, a leaf is etched to eliminate the organic material and cells and maintain the vein scaffold network, which is then coated by metals to form a mesh network electrode. Overall, natural structural design of the top electrode (back contact) enabling optimized optical management for enhancing light usage in PSCs will benefit the device efficiency. Following this, “optical meta-structure” could be a promising route for high performance PSCs.

In contrast to the reflection role of the top electrode (back contact), the bottom electrode (front contact) of PSCs is responsible for transmitting incident solar light to the inner perovskite light absorber as well as collecting free charge carriers from the perovskite. Therefore, it should not only possess suitable electrical properties, including sufficiently high electrical conductivity and suitable energy level to match with that of the photoactive layer, but also high-level light-transparency allowing sufficient light to pass through. In conjunction with the PV-MPS, an additional attribute of the bottom electrode should be a qualified flexibility, allowing a large degree of mechanical deformation of PV-MPS devices. This flexibility requirement can be achieved by using ultrathin polymer layers of high light transmittance. Table 1 summarizes the polymeric candidate with physical and chemical properties for optical use. Clearly, conventional polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET, Tg ∼ 78 °C) or polyethylene naphthalate (PEN, Tg ∼ 123 °C) have excellent optical transparency >87%, but are limited by the working temperatures, while the aromatic polyimide (PI) displays excellent thermal stability up to 300 °C but suffers from poor optical transmittance. Balancing the light transmittance and thermal stability remains one of the most challenging projects for their typical optoelectronic applications. In the case of PSC manufacturing, both charge transfer layers and photoactive perovskite layers can be processed at low temperatures. For example, MAPbI3 film can be processed at low-temperatures (<100 °C). Kim et al. carried out early studies replacing a high-temperature sintering processed TiO2 layer with a low-temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD)-processed TiOx layer for the ETL, displaying a 12.2% PCE and good bending test results on a PEN/ITO substrate. Directly assembling PSCs from the aforementioned polymeric bottom electrode substrates (via the “bottom-up” method) can lead to the MPS-oriented products. Using traditional commercial flexible plastic transparent electrode substrates such as indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated PET and PEN, many researchers have made early attempts since 2014. Albeit the initial success in achieving higher performance, the intrinsic drawbacks of these ITO coated PET and PEN include limited material inventory, high price, low optical transmittance, and severe mechanical fragility, which have significantly limited their application range. For example, ITO usually shows a significant sheet resistance increase (by over 500% in Fig. 5a) due to the presence of linear cracks after 1000 bending cycles (with a bending radius of 4 mm). Therefore, in the MPS-oriented portable PSCs, since the major mechanical limitation comes from the fragility of transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), engineering the mechanical properties of the TCOs and developing alternative flexible transparent electrodes has become the most straightforward strategy.

In order to replace the fragile TCOs, candidates including highly conductive polymers, ultra-thin metal films, and metal-NW- or CNT-based grids or networks have been explored. PEDOT:PSS is composed of conductive PEDOT and water-dispersible PSS, which has been widely used in the larger scope of electronics such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and solar cells. PSS has the dual functionality of electrical doping and desolating the PEDOT in water. Tuning the doping level through additional dopants such as H2SO4 can further improve the overall electrical conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film, increasing from 1 S cm−1 (Clevios PH1000) to > 4000 S cm−1. Recently, Park et al. utilized PEDOT:PSS to replace the TCO as the bottom electrode substrate for PSCs. By employing the structure of NOA63/highly-conductive PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/EGaIn (Fig. 5b), the resultant PSC exhibited over 10% PCE with excellent flexibility (i.e., a recovered PSC from bending under a bending radius of 1 mm maintained a 96.4% efficiency). Alternatively, ultra-thin metal films have also been employed as transparent electrode substrates for a long period. Such an ultra-thin metal film can be either a single continuous film or sandwiched between two dielectric layers. As noble metals such as Ag and Au have low electrical resistance (1.6–2.4 mΩ cm−1), they are the most frequently used ultra-thin metal electrodes. It should be noted that such a transparent ultra-thin metal electrode can also be used as a top electrode in either single junction PSCs or tandem PSCs. For example, Lee et al. employed Cu (1 nm)/Au (7 nm) as the top transparent electrode for a single-junction PSC built upon a Ti foil substrate, achieving a 14.9% PCE. The major challenge in an ultra-thin metal electrode is the trade-off between the electrical conductivity and the optical transmittance. Flexible PSCs using ultra-thin metal electrodes, such as a sandwiched structure of “aluminium zinc oxide (AZO)/Ag/AZO”, a single ultrathin layer of bare Ag and an ITO coated Ag film, usually exhibit lower PCEs in the range of 6–10%, which might be due to the poor perovskite crystals in these early studies. Recently, Liu et al. constructed microstructured WO3/Ag/WO3 (WAW) multilayer transparent electrodes through a glancing angle deposition (GLAD) method. Fig. 5c shows the device configuration and mechanical stability. The resultant flexible device displays a PCE of 13.79% and retainment of 90.97% of the initial PCE after 1000 bending cycles under a maximal strain of 1.3%.
Metal-NW- or CNT-based grids or networks have also been utilized as transparent electrodes. These grids or networks exhibit excellent electrical conductivity, broad spectral transmittance, and super mechanical flexibility, which are widely applied as transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs) in various optoelectronic devices. More importantly, their grids or networks are composed of fibrous conductive polymers, metal NWs and CNTs, making them good candidates to form a “leaf vein” network architecture. The natural designed “leaf vein network” system consists of a two-dimensional network composed of branches having different diameters at different scales. Such leaf vein networks play an important role in photosynthesis by supplying nutrients and water to the leaf cells and transport the photosynthesized carbohydrates to other parts of the plants. Meanwhile, these networks also serve as a flexible backbone for ensuring the mechanical stability of the leaf.Fig. 6a displays an example of a Magnolia liliiflora leaf vein network. The natural vein network has been designed into a highly efficient style to simultaneously ensure bidirectional transport and provide sufficient mechanical stability. Such a transport function of the “leaf vein networks” shares many characteristics with the electrodes applied in photochemical cells, solar cells, LEDs, Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors, where electrical current can be collected or distributed more efficiently. The high-efficiency transport in “leaf vein networks” can be ascribed to the hierarchical structures, consisting of the petiole, midrib, and secondary and lower-order veins (Fig. 6a). A gradual thickening from secondary veins towards the midrib and the petiole reflects the variation in the amount of resources being transported along the network. The supply of water and nutrients (yellow arrows in Fig. 6a(i)) attenuates from the petiole towards the midrib and subsequently to the leaf blade; the photosynthetic product carbohydrates are collected in the opposite direction but with increasing amounts (red arrow in Fig. 6a(i)). These lower-order veins connect the secondary veins to the midrib, rendering an interconnected network, which ideally provides a bidirectional transport between leaf cells and other parts of the plant, playing an important role in collecting and distributing the organic material to the plant. For electronics, the bottom electrode substrate (front electrode) can also be designed in a similar way, where metal fingers collect the local currents and transport them towards the metal bus bars and subsequently to the strings. As shown in Fig. 6a(ii), such a design has been well applied in Si-PV panels where the photo-generated current is first collected by the fingers (grid line) and then be converged to the bus bars. Li et al. reported large-area flexible transparent electrodes based on such “leaf vein-like” silver hierarchical-metal-grids (HMGs) consisting of the mesoscale first-order vein (“trunk”) and microscale secondary vein (“branches”) (Fig. 6b(i)). As can be seen in Fig. 6b(ii), the branched grids uniformly distribute the conductive pathways and the laser-etched trunk grids can converge the current from the branch. Meanwhile the grid structure also provides a reasonably high optical transmittance (∼81%) with a low sheet resistance (1.36 Ω sq−1) through the optimal geometrical design of the grid widths and spaces, and the sizes of the colloidal crackle patterns in the branch. Although such an HMG is aimed for the application of electrochromic smart windows, directly using this flexible and transparent HMG as the bottom (front) electrode in PSCs is promising. Jia et al. also reported a vein-like TCE based on copper electroless deposition on a leaf vein scaffold. They first chemically etched the tissues and cells on a real leaf and then dried and flattened the vein network as a scaffold template for copper electroless deposition.Fig. 6c(i) and (ii) compare the micrographs of a real Magnolia liliiflora leaf vein (MLLV) with a Cu-plated MLLV network prepared via electroless deposition for thirty minutes. As a result, these vein-like transparent conducting electrodes display an ultralow sheet resistance of <0.1 Ω sq−1 (much lower than the value of ∼7 Ω sq−1 in PET/ITO), broadband optical transparency >80%, and high current density transport capability >6000 A cm−2. It should be noted that various methods have been developed to construct a metal wire network/grid mimicking this leaf vein like TCE. According to the metal material classification, Cu nanowire networks, solution-processed Ag nanowire networks, lithographically fabricated metal meshes, cracked polymers, cracked TiO2 and cracked silica nanoparticle thin layers obtained through novel approaches, lithography assisted In2O3 grain boundary, and metal nanotrough-like networks have been proposed for TCEs. Fig. 6d lists the published results of TCEs with Rsh < 10 Ω sq−1 combined with a transmittance (T) of approximately 80%, in which the ‘black symbols’ denote the TCEs obtained with interconnected metal networks, the ‘red’ ones denote the solution-processed Ag NW films, and the ‘blue’ ones denote the leaf vein involved frameworks. The state-of-the-art ITO has benchmark Rsh of 7 Ω sq−1 and T of 85%. In most of the prior TCE studies, Rsh was in the range of 1–10 Ω sq−1 with a T of ∼80%. It should be noted that leaf vein derived frameworks can exhibit lower Rsh than commercial ITO. For example, Han et al. obtained metallized veins through Ag sputtering and achieved a Rsh less than 10 Ω sq−1, which is twice as small as that of ITO while exhibiting a high transmittance of 85% compared to 80% for PET/ITO. In their work, metallization was performed by Ag sputtering in vacuum, and Ag was only coated on one side of the vein. The sputtered Ag has an amorphous nature. These factors jointly lead to a relatively high Rsh, even though this resistance is still smaller than that of ITO. Yu et al. employed a polymer-assisted metal deposition to metallize the leaf veins, which enhanced the copper wrapping effect on the veins and thus produced a lower Rsh of 0.25 Ω sq−1. However, the poor copper adhesion on carbon-based veins usually leads to copper delamination and low material stability. Recently, Jia et al. utilized electroless copper plating through the Pd seed layer which can be strongly anchored on the vein surface. With this enhanced Pd binding effect, the copper coating has a stronger material stability able to be stored for over one year.
So far, these metallized vein network TCEs are not widely used in PSCs and have only been attempted in several seminal works in OPVs. Properly engineering the geometric and topological layout of the vein network remains the major challenge due to the trade-off between optical transparency and electrical conductance. Recently, Wang et al. designed Cu nanowires with different diameters to construct the hierarchical network for OPVs (Fig. 7a). They used both large-diameter-long (LDL) Cu NWs (with an average diameter of 120 nm and an average length of 150 μm) and small-diameter-short (SDS) Cu NWs (with an average diameter of 25 nm and an average length of 30 μm) as well as an LDL and SDS mixture with different weight ratios to optimize the geometric layout of the vein network. As a result, a hybrid nanowire network composed of 25 wt% LDL and 75 wt% SDS nanowires exhibits the best performance due to the highest transparency and conductance at this ratio (Fig. 7b). For OPVs, the devices employing different types of Cu NWs were fabricated. In accordance with the transparency and conductance trend, the device with 25 wt% LDL and 75 wt% SDS showed the highest values of both FF and JSC, which can be attributed to the efficient light harvesting and charge collection features of this bottom electrode (Fig. 7c). In terms of the geometric optimization of the vein network, Han et al. engineered the quasi-fractal (or hierarchical) structure using a natural leaf template. Fractal in mathematics is a subset of Euclidean space with a complex dimension exceeding its topological dimension, and has many embodiments in nature such as trees, vertebrate lungs, and circulatory or neuron systems (will be detailed in Section 4.2 – Fractal neurons). For leaf vein-like electrode usage in solar cells, the key justification is based on an assumption that the electrical current flow in this structure is analogous to the fluid flow, as both the current flow and inviscid fluid flow can be mathematically described by the Laplace equation, fundamentally supporting its electrode application. Compared to a uniform network, such a quasi-fractal (or hierarchical bar-finger) structure derived from the design of natural leaf vein will display a better performance for charge carrier transport and collection. As shown in Fig. 6, the network mainly consists of secondary veins with emanated smaller veins, forming an angular network (reticulate veins). The smallest veins have a diameter of ∼50–110 μm, being split into shorter branches at each node. Such a network pattern is usually termed as ‘umbrella trees’, belonging to non-uniform fractals with fractal properties pertaining to the ‘canopy’ which refers to a structure that is formed by the branch tips rather than the whole pattern. Fractal analysis has been used as a powerful tool to characterize the complexity of plant structures. In fractals, the branch ordering taxonomy-based method is usually used for fractal dimension determination. However, the irregular nature of the venation network in natural leaf vein usually leads to large uncertainties in fractal characterization. Alternatively, angle determination between sub-veins at the bifurcation level is an easier way. Umbrella canopies typically display a particular branching angle at a given magnification ratio, which is usually named the smallest angle compatible with self-avoidance (in two-dimension). In fractal geometry of mathematics, a fractal dimension is usually characterized as a measure of the space-filling capacity of a pattern that tells how a fractal scales differently from the space where it is embedded. By determining the branching angle in a leaf vein, a fractal dimension (Ds) of 1.4 ± 0.2 can be determined, falling within the range of 1.4–1.8, which confirms that such a network is an approximate non-uniform fractal. In addition, Han et al. also developed a theoretical fractal model of a leaf vein-like electrode network subjected to three optimization conditions: (i) maximal surface coverage; (ii) uniform current density; and (iii) minimal overall resistance at fixed shading (Fig. 7d). To maximize the surface coverage, Ds needs to be approximately two. A minimal overall resistance is theoretically incompatible with the requirement of either maximal surface coverage or uniform current density. With topological extension, the network in the third direction can satisfy the requirements of both maximal surface coverage and uniform current density. As a result, this leaf vein-like quasi-fractal structure (hierarchical) displays a smaller contact resistance of 2.6 Ω, compared to the values of 14.8 Ω from the uniform (non-hierarchical) network and 28.4 Ω from ITO as shown in Fig. 7e. Furthermore, the quasi-fractal-based PV cell could exhibit a slightly higher efficiency of 5.46% than the value of 5.37% from the non-hierarchical network electrodes (Fig. 7f).

Above we have discussed PSCs obtained with a conventional fabrication procedure starting from a transparent flexible bottom electrode, followed by deposition of multiple layers, and ending with a top electrode (Fig. 8a), where the transparent bottom substrate can be either polymeric (plastic) glasses (mentioned above), willow glass (a PCE of 13.14% to 18.1% has been demonstrated), mica (layered framework of aluminosilicate; a mica/ITO based device displays a PCE of 9.67%), and even paper (a PCE of 9.67% has been demonstrated). PSC manufacturing from a metal foil electrode presents an unconventional but promising strategy. Fig. 8b shows the device assembly procedure, where multiple layers are deposited directly on the foil substrate, followed by the addition of the top transparent electrode. As the metal foil substrates are often opaque, the counter (top) electrodes need to be transparent. Table 2 summarizes the performances of representative flexible PSCs built on the metal foil substrates. Titanium foil (Ti-foil) is the most frequently used foil substrate, as it would be convenient to obtain a TiO2 layer on top of Ti-foil which is known as an efficient ETL in PSCs. A record PCE of 14.9% has been obtained by Han et al. using the device structure of Au/Cu/HTL/MAPbI3/TiO2/Ti-foil. This relatively high PCE comes from the high crystalline quality and low number of oxygen vacancies of the TiO2 layer. The oxygen vacancies on the oxidized Ti-foil surface determine the effectiveness of the TiO2 ETL. Minimizing the number of oxygen vacancies of the TiO2 ETL benefits the electron collection efficiency and thus improves the PCE. Furthermore, such Ti-foil-based PSCs exhibit higher fatigue resistance than those using the conventional ITO/PET substrate, by showing 100% initial PCE maintenance after 1000 times bending at a bending radius of 4 mm. In addition to Ti-foil, copper foil (Cu-foil) has also been used in flexible PSCs. Ahmadi et al. prepared cuprous iodide on a Cu-foil by exposing the precleaned Cu-foil in iodide vapor, which serves as the hole transport layer (HTL) for the device. After being coated with the perovskite, the device is then coated by a ZnO ETL, followed by spray coating of Ag NWs as the top electrode, which exhibited a PCE of 12.80%. These foil-based solar cells show good feasibility of perovskite PV-MPS but present challenges in top transparent electrode manufacturing and limited mechanical stretchability of the bottom metal foils.

Fiber-structured energy devices, including fiber-based triboelectric nanogenerators, batteries, supercapacitors, sensors, chromic devices, solar cells, etc., have recently received enormous attention due to their high potential for integration into wearable textiles. By weaving these fiber devices into clothes with proper fibrous structural design, clothing integrated MPS can be easily obtained. As shown in Fig. 9a(i), this will provide access to multiple built-in sensors, small electronics and applications integrated within the MPS clothing. Fig. 9a(ii) and (iii) show the concept that a PSC fiber device can be incorporated into the smart fabrics to power multiple functional electronics. Research and development of these MPS fabric power plants may be further stimulated by the fast-growing need for near-body/on-body electronics. From a technical point of view, compared to the common thin film-based PSCs, many technical challenges, such as the complication of fiber axial perovskite synthesis, curvature interface manipulation, and nonuniform light exposure on PSCs with adoption of a 1D-fiber (cylinder-type) geometry, need to be considered. In any case, the device fabrication starts with the fiber electrode. In 2014, Qiu et al. utilized a stainless-steel fiber as the backbone cathode for a fiber PSC device. Fig. 9b shows the device structure. The steel fiber was sequentially dip-coated by an n-type TiO2 compact layer and a mesoporous layer, followed by the perovskite being infiltrated into the mesopores. The HTL was encrusted through dip coating and the device was finalized by the dry-drawing from a spinnable CNT array of transparent multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) with an average diameter of 10 nm. The fiber-shaped PSCs delivered a PCE of 3.3%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.664 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 10.2 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.487, demonstrating the earliest attempts for PSC fabrics. In contrast, Li et al. employed a multi-twisted CNT as the backbone core (Fig. 9c). They chose the highly flexible CNT fiber that is directly spun-twisted from a spinnable CNT array as the anode and sequentially coated thin layers of compact n-TiO2, meso-TiO2, CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, poly(3-hexylthiophene)/single-walled carbon nanotube (P3HT/SWNT), and silver (Ag) nanowire network from the inside out, and used a Ag nanowire network as the outside effective contact bridging the neighbouring CNT fiber electrodes. The device exhibits a champion PCE of 3.03%, with VOC = 0.615 V, JSC = 8.75 mA cm−2, and FF = 56.4% and could withstand 1000 bending cycles with no significant efficiency loss. Besides the CNT and steel fiber, Ti wire is another candidate for the backbone electrode. Hu et al. utilized the Ti wire as the core backbone for the fiber PSC. As shown in Fig. 9d, an integrated device structure of Ti/c-TiO2/meso-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au has been assembled in a fiber format, where a thin layer of Au nanoparticles (NPs) was employed as the top semi-transparent electrode. The device exhibits a 5.3% PCE under AM 1.5 illumination and an apparent 8.4% efficiency in a diffuse model. Qiu et al. further modified the Ti wire (core backbone of the fiber cell device) and used the transparent aligned CNT sheet as the counter electrode (Fig. 9e). With an anodization process, an array of TiO2 nanotubes were radially grown on the Ti-wire, showing a mesoporous configuration. Then a porous, sponge-like PbO layer was coated on the TiO2 array using cathodic deposition, followed by addition of hydroiodic acid to form the PbI2 precursor of the perovskite. After conversion into the perovskite by dipping into methylammonium iodide (MAI) solution and being coated with the HTL and top electrode (wrapped by a transparent CNT tape with 80% transmittance in the 400–800 nm spectrum range and 500 S cm−1 electrical conductivity), the device shows a PCE of 6.8%, with a VOC of 0.852 V and a JSC of 16.1 mA cm−2. Further covering a 5 nm Ag outside the CNT led to a PCE increase to 7.1%. Table 3 summarizes the device performance parameters of the fabric PSCs. Overall, the novel fabric structure and high performance of PSCs could help pave the way for future self-powering e-textiles. Composing the above fiber-based solar cells into wearable textiles requires properly weaving them in accordance with an appropriate fibrous structural design. Examples of fibrous structures are observed in many processes in nature, with one well-known example being the spider web. Different fibrous structures will have different weights, energy densities, and mechanical properties in the final MPS products. In nature, in order to confer certain mechanical properties, the fibers are usually arranged in a specific pattern. For example, in the palm trunk of coconut palm, there are three types of fibers with different patterns located in different regions in the trunk (the cortex, the peripheral zone and the central zone): the outer surface cortex is composed of numerous longitudinal fibrous strands; the periphery contains a narrow layer of parenchyma cells and high density vascular bundles forming a hardened support for the tree; the central cylinder consists of ground parenchymatous tissues scattered with vascular bundles with a higher moisture density and responsible for longitudinal matter transport. Weaving the fiber into different patterns with involvement of other types of fiber components could diversify the functionalities. Similar to the palm trunk, in wood there are parallel tubular cells which are reinforced with cellulose fibrils in a spiral wound, embedded in a matrix of hemicellulose and lignin. The winding angle of fibrils leads to different mechanical properties (such as stiffness and strength) for the wood. Fig. 10a shows the wood fibril bundles at different scales. Bamboo is another example and is one of the strongest natural fiber composites. Fig. 10b shows the hierarchical structure of bamboo, where the vascular bundles in the parenchyma matrix are surrounded by supporting fibers. Cellulose microfibrils reinforce the intertwined hemicellulose–lignin matrix.

Overall, in terms of some specific requirements regarding the mechanical properties for the MPS products, these wood and bamboo structure inspired innovations are promising. For example, Sun et al. proposed a bamboo-like graphitic carbon nanofiber for energy storage applications. The design was inspired by the bamboo structure where there is a periodic distribution of interior holes along with the length and graded pore structure at the cross-section, which would not only enhance the stability with different mechanical deformations but also provide a higher surface area for the access of electrolyte and lower ion-transport resistance. The final device exhibits excellent performance, even when operated under conditions of bending at 90° and twisting at 180°. Recently, Zhu et al. reported a bamboo derived biodegradable and biocompatible transparent conductive electrode for PSCs, which exhibits extreme flexibility and light-weight. The bamboo-based bioelectrode PSCs display a PCE of 11.68%, the highest among all biomass-based PSCs. Meanwhile, the flexible device has a highly bendable mechanical stability, maintaining over 70% of its original PCE after 1000 bending cycles at a 4 mm curvature radius. Cai et al. developed an efficient HTL consisting of P3HT and bamboo-structured CNTs for PSCs. The addition of bamboo-structured CNTs (1–2 wt%) led to over one-order-of-magnitude higher conductivity and two-order faster interfacial charge transport. These attempts are good examples of how the structured bio-inspired materials could lead to higher mechanical performance of solar cells. Nevertheless, weaving the fiber-like solar cells into fabric patterns by means of bio-inspired pathways (e.g., spider web) or some art forms (e.g., kirigami and origami) might lead to a fabric PV-MPS with unexpected mechanical performance.

To extend the applied potential in MPS, PSCs with extreme mechanical stretchability are of great interest. This will require the PSCs to have recoverable device performance after various mechanical deformations including stretching, twisting, bending, and delamination. Many prior efforts have mainly focused on bending durability only, leaving stretchability vastly unexplored. Although the aforementioned fiber-structured device and textile-type devices have shown great robustness against various mechanical deformations, balancing the mechanical performance with PCE is still a technical challenge. The layer-by-layer coating on a metal-fiber backbone needs to be uniform and should have minimized defect density; otherwise, the PCE will drop significantly. The connection of individual fiber-devices into a whole fabric needs to be carefully designed to reduce the longitudinal series resistance for charge transport. For the textile-type device where manufacturing of multiple layers is deposited on a textile, the rough and curved surface of the textile could induce many unwanted interface issues for the whole device. Alternatively, another design could be the “island-bridge” structure (consisting of “device islands” and “wire bridges” connecting these islands, derived from silicon-based stretchable electronics and frequently utilized for stretchable systems), which have already been applied in PSCs. The “island-bridge” design first fabricates the device on a paper-electrode substrate, followed by a papercraft with proper post-cutting (kirigami) or post-folding (origami). This enables the PSCs to preserve their initial PCEs under large mechanical deformations such as stretching, bending, and twisting. Jo et al. reported that the PSCs based on the kirigami- and origami-strategies demonstrated 400% stretchability and a high areal coverage. The main drawback of the “island-bridge” design is the trade-off between the coverage-area and stretchability. The higher ratio of the “bridge” area will produce a better stretchability, but will lower the total output power due to the smaller area of the “device island” (geometrical fill factor). Fig. 11a(i) shows a solution to this trade-off dilemma. By adopting the origami folding, the bridge can be folded up and stacked in the device region (“island”). This strategy allows an efficient spatial usage (or geometric fill factor) close to 100% (Fig. 11a(ii)). Meanwhile, the stretchability could be maximized by employing different kirigami designs. Li et al. also adopted the kirigami-based cutting strategy for a stretchable PSC. Fig. 11b(i) and (ii) show this cutting design, with the out-of-plane deformation possibly being able to sufficiently disperse the stress load, thus increasing the stretchability. The kirigami-based PSCs with an optimal geometric design exhibited high stretchability with a strain of 200%, high twistability with an angle of up to 450°, and high bendability with a radius down to 0.5 mm. Furthermore, the kirigami-based PSCs displayed good mechanical endurance with an invariant PCE after 1000 repetitive stretching, twisting, and bending cycles. Fig. 11b(iii) and (iv) show the photograph of kirigami-based PSCs mounted on a human wrist with accommodation to the stretching deformation. Qi et al. also reported kirigami structured PSCs with serpentine interconnects. Fig. 11c shows the schematic diagram and photograph of the stretchable PSCs. The yellow area in Fig. 11c(i) is the gold electrode from which the sub-cells are arranged in arrays. A packaging layer of Eco-flex is further used at both sides of the cell to protect the device. As a result, the obtained devices exhibited a high and stable PCE of 17.68% with a robust mechanical cycling performance of 87% of the initial PCE after 300 cycles of continuous stretching under a large stretching ratio of 80%. The optimized PSC also shows stable efficiency in a harsh environment (80% relative humidity) for 10 days. Overall, research on stretchable device platforms for PSCs is still at the development stage. In addition to the “island-bridge” structure, pre-strained wrinkle structure and papercraft-inspired approaches have also been investigated to realize the PSC based portable MPS. This will rely on various state-of-the-art fabrication technologies including photolithography, laser processing, and 3D printing for engineering, optimizing and innovating new device architectures.


PSCs are layer-by-layer stacking-structured devices with the core perovskite layer absorbing the light and generating excited electrons and holes, which need to be transferred across multiple interfaces before being collected by the electrodes. Charge transfer layers (CTLs) are responsible for minimizing the charge losses during the interfacial transfer process. In the case of PSCs, multiple HTL and ETL materials have been applied following several selection rules of (i) excellent thermal/photochemical stability; (ii) suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level aligning with those of the perovskite; (iii) optimal charge carrier mobility for efficient transport; (iv) good processing ability; (v) good operational phase stability; (vi) low cost and easy attainability; and (vii) proper optical transparency. So far, multiple artificial CTL materials including spiro-OMeTAD, spiro-like-based derivatives, carbocyclic small molecules, nitrogen-, sulfur-, oxygen-, or silicon-containing organics, metallomacrocycle-based materials, π-conjugated oligomers, and other inorganic semiconductors have been utilized as the HTL for PSCs. Meanwhile, metal oxides (e.g., TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, WO3), organic n-type materials (PCBM, ICBA), core–shell nanoparticles, plasmonic nanoparticles,etc. have been employed as the ETL for PSCs. Optimal CTL materials satisfying all the aforementioned requirements might lead to a new route towards minimized energy losses during interfacial transport in PSCs. Hence, material expansion from these commonly used artificial materials to some novel functional materials that have not been well recognized yet could be a promising research direction, especially if they are cheaper, more abundant and more easily obtainable.

Natural/bio-materials offer such an opportunity. Incorporation of natural bio-semiconductors into electronic, information processing and storage devices, and bio-/artificial-semiconductor interfacing, are growing research areas. New fields at the intersection of synthetic biology and semiconductor technology–semiconductor synthetic biology (SemiSynBio) has been rapidly developing to take advantage of significant efficiency and information processing capabilities from biological systems compared to the best equivalent silicon-based systems. Specifically, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and small cell integrated functional devices, biological/artificial electronics, and biological/artificial coupling systems with high-level automation have been attempted. Using natural/bio-semiconducting materials not only broadens the material inventory for seeking a suitable CTL material for ultrahigh-efficiency PSCs, but also offers great opportunities to redefine the architecture and manufacturing of PSCs in a more efficient or intelligent way towards MPS-oriented products.

Among those biomaterials of interest, charge transport and relevant charge transfer processes in double helical DNA have attracted huge interest over decades due to their close relevance to the oxidative damage in DNA, which is believed to be related to aging and senility of all living creatures. In recent decades, research of DNA has discovered long-range charge transport phenomena in DNA and has shown the adaptability in defined nanostructures by proper design and synthesis, further stimulating the research interest in DNA serving as a building block for nanoelectronic applications. As shown in Fig. 12a, DNA has four chemical bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T), where A pairs up with T, while C pairs with G to form the ‘base pair’ units. Each base is also attached to a phosphate molecule and a sugar molecule, forming a cluster called a ‘nucleotide’. Nucleotides are arranged in two long-strands with a spiral form, called a ‘double helix’. The double helix DNA is analogous to a spiral staircase, with the base pairs being the individual steps, while the sugar and phosphate molecules are the vertical railings. Sequencing the base pairs and tuning the pair numbers (coding) of DNA allows a high degree of variability. Each organism has a unique DNA sequence, which details their genetic information. Human DNA consists of about 3 billion base pairs, with 96% similarity to the DNA sequence of great ape species. With the base pair complexity, the charge transfer (CT) behaviour in the DNA double helix can be different. Using different DNA models, multiple mechanisms have been proposed for interpreting the CT along the DNA chains. Fig. 12b summarizes these mechanisms including (i) ballistic (wire-like) transport, (ii) super-exchange, (iii) A-hopping, (iv) G-hopping, and (v) polaronic hopping. The ballistic (wire-like) CT mechanism assumes a delocalized π-bond (created by the stacked nucleobases of DNA) through which the injected charge can propagate. Such a ballistic mechanism was proposed by Barton et al. to rationalize the observations of a picosecond transfer photoinduced CT between rhodium and ruthenium metallo-complexes intercalated in a DNA stack (Fig. 12b(i)). Super-exchange CT assumes a well localized donor and acceptor, which occurs when there are large energy gaps between the donor/acceptor and bridge energies. In this way, quantum tunnelling via the states of the intervening bridge dominates the transport, which has been verified by the theoretical prediction of CT in short DNA sequences (Fig. 12b(ii)). Such a CT mechanism is similar to those in proteins, with an exponential decay constant of ∼1 Å−1. The A-hopping mechanism is a multi-step transport which subdivides the transport into two mechanisms: (i) transport between AT pairs and (ii) transport between AT and CG pairs. Charge transport follows an incoherent hopping mechanism among the transport between AT nucleobases but changes into a thermally activated injection when transporting from AT to CG pairs (Fig. 12b(iii)). In G-hopping, a hole moves between CG nucleobases, mediated by an intervening AT (Fig. 12b(iv)). This model has been verified by multiple atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) experiments showing that the electrical resistance of DNA fragments decreases with an increase in the G-content. Polaronic hopping (Fig. 12b(v)) is related to the electron/hole cloud polarization that is likely delocalized over several base pairs. This polarization arises due to the redistribution of electron density in the DNA themselves and/or due to the interaction with the solvent molecules and/or the thermally activated polaronic motion. The polaron model is used to rationalize experimental data that there is little change in the radical cation migration efficiency through long distances (10–55 base pair) within the DNA. This will lead to a large electron/hole cloud delocalization over several bases, thereby an overall increased conductivity of the DNA.


DNA and its derivatives have been applied in organic electronics including organic LEDs, organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and OPVs, by optimizing the interfacial electrical contact between the photoactive layers and the electrodes and/or modifying the micromorphology of the complex organics. Recently, Thomas's group found a significant exciton disassociation effect upon interfacing the organic photovoltaic system with the DNA molecules. Several DNA-modified ETLs have been applied in organic solar cells with the device structure of ITO/ETL/P3HT:PC70BM/HTL/Ag (Fig. 13a(i)). By using an ETL of DNA, ZnO-NPs, or ZnO-NPs/DNA, the photocarrier behaviour exhibited different dynamics at the interface, thereby showing different PCEs. Fig. 13a(ii) compares the false color NIR transient absorption (TA) maps for the ITO/ETL/P3HT:PC70BM/MoO3/Ag using an empty ETL or a DNA ETL. Incorporation of the DNA ETL led to an obvious change in the photobleaching at different characteristic wavelengths labelled as PB1, PB2, and PB3 of P3HT (Fig. 13a(iii) and (iv)). Spectral cuts at a probe delay of 800 fs of the TA map in Fig. 13a(iv) show significant variations in PB2 and PB3 features, including a strong blue shift of PB2 from the cell using the ZnO-NPs/DNA ETL. This observation suggests that the ZnO-NPs/DNA has a great photo-optical effect on the conjugation length and intrachain coupling of photocarriers in the P3HT. Overall, insertion of this ultrathin DNA layer between the photoactive layer and electrode leads to a more efficient carrier extraction as evidenced by a lower population of trapped excited exciton states and faster extraction at intermediate timescale decays (5 and 100 ps). It should be noted that, in the above work, DNA can also be chemically doped into a p-type HTL with preferable energy levels better matching those of the photoactive layers. For example, via a redox reaction with hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (CTMA), the HOMO can be shifted towards −5.4 eV, perfectly aligning with the valence band maximum (VBM) of the MAPbI3 perovskite, while the LUMO of DNA–CTMA can be maintained as high as −1.1 eV. Such a band structure will efficiently block the electron transfer between DNA–CTMA and the MAPbI3 perovskite due to a large Schottky barrier for the electron, but will secure an efficient hole transfer due to the formation of an Ohmic contact. Yusoff et al. recently utilized such a DNA–CTMA as the HTL for perovskite solar cells. The well-aligned energy level of the VBM of MAPbI3 with the HOMO of DNA–CTMA minimizes the energy loss for hole transfer and optimizes the magnitude of VOC from 0.90 V to 1.04 V. The LUMO coefficients are located on the thymine and cytosine units of DNA. By tuning the ratio and thus the LUMO to a higher level, the DNA–CTMA HTL could efficiently block electrons, reducing the recombination loss and enhancing both the JSC and PCE from 19.20 to 20.85 mA cm−2 and from 12.49% to 15.86%, respectively. More recently, our group also incorporated the hole-extraction facilitated DNA into the grain boundaries (GBs) of a perovskite film (Fig. 13b(i)). A 3 nm-thick DNA layer bridging the neighbouring perovskite crystal grain can facilitate the charge transfer across the GBs, increasing the charge carrier mobility two times from 1.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 2.43 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. As a result, hole extraction throughout the DNA modified device shows a more efficient process with a faster photoluminescence (PL) quenching (Fig. 13b(ii)–(iv)). Consequently, a DNA-modified PSC shows a PCE of 20.63% compared to the value of 18.43% from a reference cell, and the hydrophobic nature of CTMA modified DNA further extends the device's lifetime from the day-scale towards the month-scale.

By exploiting its intrinsic molecular conductive nature, DNA can be an excellent integrant in electrically optimizing the properties of functional layers and enhancing the performance of the solar cell device. Fig. 13c summarizes different types of solar cells being incorporated with DNA. It should be noted that PSCs have shown higher PCEs compared to OPVs and represent the optimal platform of applying DNA engineering. Nevertheless, as DNA itself displays complex and multi-hypothetical charge transfer mechanisms, incorporation of DNA into the perovskite system requires an in-depth understanding from the molecular scale to the macroscale for successful device design and operation. More investigations and theoretical models are required to elucidate DNA/perovskite interfacial charge dynamics.

Fractals are prevalent in nature, in part because of their ability to generate a large surface area within a given volume. The fractal leaf vein hierarchy structure, mentioned in the previous section (3.2 Bottom electrode), can efficiently deliver water from the petiole towards the leaf blade. In a broader scale, such a natural fractal design of tree branches allows trees to absorb more sunlight, allows bronchial trees in animals to efficiently transfer oxygen to the bloodstream, and allows the coastlines to sufficiently disperse wave energy from the ocean. The nervous system (comprising ∼1011 neurons) in the human brain is another example of fractal geometry as well, with ∼1014 synapses or connections among these brain cells. This indicates an average of 103 connections for each cell through axons reaching out to make the synaptic connections with the dendrites of other neurons. As shown in Fig. 14a, the nervous system is designed in a fractal branching pattern, connecting thousands of neuron's axons and dendrites which allows them to communicate with a large number of neighbouring cells. If the nervous system were designed using a Euclidean geometry, for example in cube-like shapes neatly packed into the brain, each neuron would only connect with at most six other cells, which would not allow the necessary synaptic communication. Overall, the fractal neurons exhibit advantages in delivering, processing and storing information in a more spatially efficient way, which aligns with the fractal geometry structural design. That is, by connecting structural patterns with each other over variable size scales, one can obtain a large surface area and excellent transportability. Accordingly, fractal structural design can efficiently disperse or collect entropy (information), energy, and mass over large temporal and spatial dimensions. Therefore, artificial fractal structures inspired from natural designs (e.g., clouds, coastlines, trees, neurons, bronchial trees, blood vessels) have been widely researched for applied mathematics/physics (e.g., antennas) and could have great significance when applying them in designing optimized electrodes for solar cells.


The fractal neuron concept is predicted to enhance the charge transport efficiency for solar cells. For example, a branched network is responsible for more efficient light manipulation through sublayer scattering. Meanwhile, interfacial charge transfer at a heterojunction with a proper fractal design could further assist the dissociation of the excitonic state into free charges, which aligns with the “bulk heterojunction (BHJ)” idea in OPVs. The structured electrodes are also able to collect the photogenerated charge carriers in a more efficient way. For example, Kay et al. constructed Fe2O3 electrodes displaying improved transport properties due to a fractal (‘cauliflower’) structure. Meier et al. developed a micro-structured PEDOT:PSS HTL on an Al electrode which enhanced the charge flow and improved the PCE for the solar cell. Recently, Chamousis et al. also used fractal electrodes to promote charge separation and extraction from the illuminated photoactive layer. Fig. 14b(i) shows a fractal silver layer with a dendritic topography, coated by a thin PEDOT:PSS HTL used as the photoelectrode. The fractal silver layer on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate was prepared via electrochemical deposition of silver sulfate (Ag2SO4) under diffusion-limited conditions. Such a spatial stretching structure benefits the charge flow from the photoactive layer towards the photoelectrode, as illustrated in the energy level diagram in Fig. 14b(ii).


Fractal structures inspired and/or mimicked from examples in nature have been employed in designing high-performance functional structures for various applications. In solar cell research, these fractal structure designs have been made to manipulate the light for (i) optical reinforcement for higher photocurrent through multiple effects (e.g., anti-reflection effect) and/or (ii) specific coloration for devices through the introduction of ‘artificially colored’ meta-structures. Light manipulation using the anti-reflective function of the structures has been a highlighted part of their applications. For solar cells, optical loss by light reflection at surfaces is responsible for 14% of the total losses. Thus, it is critical to reduce the reflection losses to improve the PCE. Optical reflection occurs at the interface between two media having different optical refractive indices and can be explained by Fresnel's equations. When light passes through two media of refractive indices n1 and n2, respectively, the reflection (R) at the interface can be predicted using the equation of R = [(n2 − n1)/(n2 + n1)2]. A smaller difference between the refractive indices of the two media will result in less reflection. For 3D structures having subwavelength periods or lengths, the effective refractive index of the system is determined by the volume fraction. The eyes of certain species of moths, butterflies, and flies have such a fractal microscopic design with arrays of protuberances which have dimensions smaller than the wavelength of the incident light upon them. Fig. 14c(i) shows a picture of a moth's eye (Cephonodes hylas) with a microscopic view showing the arrays of protuberances (Fig. 14c(ii) and (iii)). Such a feature forms a region with a graded refractive index at an interface (between two media), which can substantially reduce the amount of light that is reflected by the interface. As a result, the reflectance reduction is thought to increase the sensitivity of the visual system of the species. This fractal microstructure also leads to the transparent sections of an insect's wing, giving them a camouflaging effect. On the basis of this fractal moth-eye anti-reflection strategy, an improvement in transparency at the front contact of solar cells has been attempted.

One example in PSCs is the structural modification of the TiO2 ETL in an n–i–p device architecture. Kang et al. reported utilizing the nanopatterned mp-TiO2 layers with a conical shaped ‘moth-eye’ structure (of a 500 nm-dorm feature) for improving the light harvesting efficiency (LHE). This bio-inspired fractal nanostructure can reduce the reflection at the interface between the mp-TiO2 ETL and the MAPbI3 photoactive layer as the fractal pattern induced optical manipulation which resulted in an antireflective property. Using soft nanoimprinting lithography and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamping methods, a moth-eye patterned mp-TiO2 layer was successfully obtained, showing a well-ordered periodic 2D hexagonal symmetry (Fig. 14d(i)). The optical enhancement from the moth-eye patterned mp-TiO2 layer was also observed from the photograph of a real film, as can be seen from the colorful surface (light scattered) of the patterned mp-TiO2 film in Fig. 14d(ii). In addition, the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method also predicts the optimized optical field distribution in the fractally patterned mp-TiO2 film (Fig. 14d(iii)). As a result, in comparison with the flat layer, PSCs incorporating the moth-eye TiO2 exhibit a 5.3% enhancement of photocurrent and improve the PCE from 15.74% to 17.48%.
The fractal structure in the eye or wings of insects also leads to the strong coloration. This structural color, in contrast to dyes or pigments, originates from the interference of ordered coherent scattering of light waves, which provides the coloration for species. For example, the fractal structure, and the resultant color, in the wings of butterflies is important for camouflage, mating, and warning. Similarly, from the art perspective for the MPS products, PVs with aesthetical versatility, appealing appearance and colorfully vivid features are becoming more and more important in modern life. Beyond the basic power supplier function, multiple products such as building integrated PV and PV built-in clothing also must consider the aesthetics of the end product. In regards to this, Zhang et al. developed a multilayered scaffold that can provide optical reflection at certain visible wavelengths and provide the PSC device with structural colors. Fig. 14e(i) and (ii) show the device architecture incorporating a porous photonic crystal (PC) based scaffold with dual functionalities of optical reflection and charge transport. By precisely tuning the reflectance peak of the PC and the absorption from the infiltrated perovskite, vivid iridescences with variable colors ranging across the visible spectrum can be obtained. For example, Fig. 14e(iii) shows the reflectance spectra of an orange (orange lines) and blue-green (dark cyan lines) PSC using the PC scaffold. On further tuning the PC and perovskite nanostructures, colors ranging from red (0.41, 0.34) to orange (0.41, 0.40), green (0.33, 0.41), blue-green (0.29, 0.35), and blue (0.29, 0.30) in the chromaticity space have been obtained for the PSC devices (Fig. 14e(iv)). These PSCs with a wide range of iridescence also exhibit efficient performance with PCEs of up to 8.8% with a blue hue. The use of natural fractal inspired structural colors, rather than utilizing pigments or dyes, as meta-optical materials provides a promising outlook for development of PSCs and their MPS products.
Meng et al. also reported vivid colored PSCs using 2D ‘inverse-opal’ perovskite (IOP) photonic films. Typically, the inverse-opal (IO) structured films (film replicas containing colloidal crystals (artificial opals)) are composed of patterns with ordered void arrays surrounded by solid materials in continuous alternations of high and low refractive indices. Such a structure affects the light wave propagation and alters the optical properties of the film. The 2D IOP film can be fabricated via template-assisted spin-coating processing. Fig. 14f(i) and (ii) show the microscopic structure. Additionally, the IOP film makes the angular dependency of color variation possible, which originated from the optical reflection of the nanostructures (Fig. 14f(iii)). This feature can allow PSCs to be utilized for various applications that require aesthetic functions. Briefly, specifically tuning the IOP micro-geometry and the optical properties of the perovskite (by changing the material composition at the crystallographic A, B and X-sites of the ABX3 halide perovskite), colorful devices with good PCEs (6.7% to 11.2%) have been obtained.

Bacteriorhodopsin (bR) protein extracted from Halobacterium salinarum has been broadly utilized in multiple biohybrid electronics known as “bioelectronics” that merges current electronic techniques with biology. The bR (playing the role of a light-driven proton pump in the purple membrane (PM) of the archaea Halobacterium salinarum) consists of seven-transmembrane (7TM) helices and a retinal chromophore covalently bound in the central region through a protonated Schiff base to a lysine residue (Fig. 15a(i)). The PM (Fig. 15a(ii) and (iii)) is composed of a 2D hexagonal crystal with an ∼6.2 nm unit cell (containing the bR trimer and lipid molecules as the intertrimer medium). The photocycle in bR can be initiated by the photon absorption at the covalently bound chromophore retinal which leads to a series of conformational changes within the protein and ultimately to the proton transport across the cell membrane. Such a photon-activated mechanism, along with the ability of bR to regenerate, makes it possible to develop bR-based nano-optoelectronics. For example, the aligned bR PM film on ITO has shown an efficient and stable photocurrent response. Early attempts of utilization of bR as a light-activated component in PV cells exhibited 9.73 mV cm−2 and 41.7 mV cm−2 in dry and aqueous systems, respectively. Although there have been many successful cases of bR-based biohybrid electronics (which have been well reviewed elsewhere), practical utilization of these biomolecular-based components in electronics requires a detailed understanding of the coupling of these individual bR molecules to the macroscopic surfaces of electrodes, as well as the evolutions in the electronic environment under dynamic (nonequilibrium) conditions. Prior research has revealed that bR can be fully functional over a wide range of temperatures and pH, while the conductivity of bR could be separated into two regimes, determined by various charge transport mechanisms. At lower temperatures (T < 250 K), the electrical conductance is dominated by the electron tunneling mechanism which switches to the electron hopping mechanism as the temperature increases. The electron hopping mechanism will be affected by the removal of the retinal chromophore within the bR. The interaction intensity between the bR protein and the electrode substrate can also affect the transport mechanism.


As the bR is responsible for a series of photochemical reactions ultimately leading to the protons pumping across the membrane, PVs can utilize each individual reaction to promote either efficient photon absorption or charge transport. Hence, different operating mechanisms in regards to bR being applied in PVs have been reported. Table 4 summarizes the studies that used bR to promote charge transport in related optoelectronics. For example, Allam et al. reported on the assembly and utilization of a bR/TiO2 nanotube array as the photoelectrode in photoelectrochemical applications. The ∼7 μm thick nanotube array of TiO2 films was fabricated by room-temperature anodization of Ti-foil in formamide electrolytes containing NH4F, followed by sensitization with bR. This nanotube array of TiO2 enables sufficient attachment of bR at the surface (Fig. 15b(ii)). By using the bR/TiO2 hybrid photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting, the hybrid electrodes obtained an increased photocurrent density of 0.65 mA cm−2 (under AM 1.5 illumination), about 50% improvement compared to the pure TiO2 nanotubes (0.43 mA cm−2) fabricated under the same conditions. The improvement is due to the efficient bR-assisted electron transfer from the electrolyte to the photoanode of TiO2. Fig. 15b(i) shows the energy level diagram and the mechanism of electron injection to the bR/TiO2 photoanode in the presence of a redox I3−/I− electrolyte solution. The bR has a LUMO and a HOMO energy level of −3.8 and −5.4 eV (based on surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS)), respectively. TiO2 has a conduction band maximum (CBM) of −4.2 eV, which allows an efficient electron injection from bR to TiO2 (Fig. 15b(i)). In the presence of the redox electrolyte (0.02 M I3−/I−), an electron can be captured by bR and excited from the HOMO to the LUMO upon illumination, which is then expected to travel to the TiO2 photoanode. Guo et al. also proposed a bR/metal heterogeneous structure for efficient charge transfer, which also leads to a novel PV stack system. On the optical side, using delicate, well-patterned structures to maximize the light absorption is one of the most widely used strategies in nature. For example, in the leaf cell, as the core organ for photosynthesis, Granum consists of a stack of 10–100 thylakoids containing pigments and electron-acceptors. When the light stimulates the antenna pigment in the thylakoids, electrons can be excited and transferred via the photoelectric conversion process. The stacking design of thylakoids provides a large surface area which allows highly efficient solar radiation capture. It has been reported that, by mimicking this stacking design through construction of TiO2 nanosheets templated by graphene, the photoelectric response can be enhanced ∼20 times. The bR and its surrounding purple membrane also have a 2D crystalline feature (Fig. 15a(iii)), making it possible to stack with a metal to form a laminar electrode capable of more efficient radiation capture. This has been achieved by constructing bR/Au NPs heterogeneous multilayers for a photovoltaic stacking system (Fig. 15c(ii)), where the bR layers are inserted between AuNP layers. The bR layers serve as the photon acceptor and the Au NP layers can further enhance the photocurrent because of their native surface plasmon field effect. Fig. 15c(i) illustrates the equivalent energy level diagram of the photochemical reaction in these stacks. When a continuous incident light (350–800 nm) is shed on the device, the excited state can be pumped by AuNPs leading to the emission of ∼520 nm light. The 520 nm light is then absorbed by bR, giving rise to a photocycle starting from the B570-state to the J600-state, and then passes to the M412-state in bR. It should be noted that the blue light is also contained in the stimulated light source, which can directly affect the bR's ability to accelerate the decay of the immediately formed M412-state in bR. This provides a shorter time pathway II (light activates the M412 to an excited state Me, which can facilitate a quicker decay to the B state) to complete the typical photocycle, leading to a ‘bypass photocycle model’ in bR. With the stacking of Au NP layers, the photocycle pathway of the partial bR molecule will take this (‘bypass’ short-cut) pathway II, which represents a more efficient and accelerated photocycle for bR. For PV applications, bR has been employed as a photosensitizer in bio-sensitized solar cells (BSSCs), where the bR proteins are attached on a TiO2 film. These proteins can be photo-excited and transfer the excited states to the TiO2 photoanode, and also refill the electrons from the redox reaction with the electrolyte. Thavasi et al. built the first BSSC using bR as a light harvester, being adsorbed at the TiO2 electrode, exhibiting a VOC of 0.35 V and a JSC of 0.09 mA cm−2 under an illumination of 40 mW cm−2. Following this, Mohammadpour et al. and Jeganathan et al. fabricated BSSCs based on the TiO2/bR electrode and the devices displayed PCEs of 0.35% and 0.49% under AM 1.5, respectively. More recently, Das et al. reported a bR assisted photocycle in PSCs. The bR can be inserted between the TiO2 ETL and the perovskite photoactive layer, which implements the energy transfer step involving photon absorption and the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process. Fig. 15d shows the energy level diagram (Fig. 15d(i)) and the schematic illustration of the corresponding PSC device (Fig. 15d(ii)). The light energy conversion can be achieved through the transfer of the photogenerated electrons from the perovskite to the bR molecules through a FRET process. The photogenerated electrons can be subsequently transferred to the TiO2 ETL, driven by the energy level difference between bR and TiO2. This bR bridge between the perovskite and TiO2 is further verified by the observation of reduced interfacial charge recombination. As a result, the bR modified PSC exhibits a higher PCE of 17.02% compared to that of 14.59% from a reference blank device.

Overall, the bR photocycle effect on photocurrent enhancement provides an additional mechanism for tuning the interface between the photoactive layer and the photoelectrode. Considering the control role of a proton ‘gate’ (bR's original role in creatures, as shown in Fig. 15a) and the photocycle process of bR, there could be two ways to export the optical signals of bR. One is to design and construct a photocell system joined by two half-cells, which can produce the proton gradient difference between the two half-cells, i.e., a proton ‘gate’. The other one is to couple the proton with electronic carriers, inducing the displacement and recombination of the charged carriers during the bR photocycle, resulting in the generation of a differential photovoltage. The ongoing research using bR incorporated hybrid structures for enhancing the photocurrent or frequency response is expected to be applied in the field of biological electronics with potential applications in medical electronics such as bR-based immunosensors and bR-based artificial retinal prostheses. Nevertheless, in solar cells, bR incorporation taking advantage of its ‘gate’ and photocycle role in complex with perovskite crystals still remains an untapped research area, with the energy/mass transfer mechanism at the bR/perovskite interface being a particularly interesting research topic. In fact, many other dyes besides bR have shown unusual energy transfer mechanisms, which has led to several interesting subtopics such as triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion and singlet fission (SF) that can bring new insights for reducing the thermodynamic losses in PSCs and hypothetical foundations for exceeding the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit of solar cells.

Natural materials including biological molecules with conjugated structures or radical features can be good charge transport materials for electronic applications. Particularly, for the π-conjugated natural pigments such as chlorins (a specific type of porphyrin which is in the form of Mg2+ complexes found as the green photosynthetic pigments in plants (chlorophylls)), the energies of frontier molecular orbitals (i.e., HOMO and LUMO) and the distribution of the orbitals (i.e., DOS) in these molecules play crucial roles in intra- and inter-molecular charge transport and are also relevant to the light absorption/emission, charge injection/extraction/trapping and electron pushing/pulling or donating/accepting effects. These π-conjugated features in those artificially synthesized semiconducting polymers/small organic molecules enable their optoelectronic properties and make them widely applied in fields such as OPVs and OLEDs. Natural pigments also have such a conjugated structure, which makes them good candidates for CTL materials in PSCs.


Porphyrins, derived from the Greek word ‘porphyros’ meaning ‘purple’, are compounds of cyclic tetrapyrroles with intense colors. In nature, porphyrins are the parent members of pigments in various species and serve key roles in various vital processes such as metabolism and photosynthesis. For example, the heme has a porphyrin ring (Fig. 16a), where the iron center (Fe2+) in the porphyrin ring can coordinate with the oxygen (O2) serving as the oxygen carrier. Hence the blood cell containing heme can carry oxygen from the lungs to various tissues. In fact, 70% of the body's iron is present in red blood cells as hemoglobin, composed of iron-porphyrin heme groups, resulting in the red color of human blood (color of Fe2+; this is different from the blue color of the blood of spiders and octopuses which contains Cu2+). Hemes are also crucial in enzymes (e.g., liver enzymes metabolizing drugs), catalases (protecting cells from oxidative damage), or electron transfer proteins. Another example of a natural porphyrin complex is found in the chloroplasts of algae and plants, i.e., the chlorophyll, a green pigment critical in photon absorption, resonance energy transfer and photoexcited charge separation in photosynthesis. Chlorophyll molecules are embedded in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts in photosystems (Fig. 16b) and are well arranged so that light harvesting and transportation (>95% transfer efficiency) could maximize the efficiency in such a small system. The high energy transfer efficiency is realized by the unique property of chlorophyll (incorporated with Mg2+ in the porphyrin ring) that the absorption and emission spectra overlap exceptionally well, so the energy transfer to nearby molecules can favorably follow the Förster (resonance) mechanism. Following this, the photon energy can be harvested by chlorophyll and then transferred among ∼100 chlorophyll molecules through this resonance mechanism. As a result, the overall energy transfer process, from photon absorption to arrival at the reaction center, is less than 10 ps, which is significantly faster than the chlorophyll fluorescence lifetime of 5 ns (in this way the fluorescence loss is negligible). Replacing Mg2+ with other metals will not only change the absorption and emission spectra, inducing less efficient resonance energy transfer, but also competitively quench the chlorophyll's excited state (through a spin–orbit coupling or ‘heavy atom effect’) and reform the ground state. Therefore, the Mg2+ chlorophyll is designed by nature to maximize the efficiency of photosynthesis. Additionally, other porphyrin-derived natural pigments are found in cobalamin (vitamin B12 source as shown in Fig. 16c, which is typically involved in the metabolism of every cell in the human body, affecting DNA synthesis and regulation as well as fatty acid and amino acid metabolism), biliverdin and protoporphyrin (Fig. 16d, found in thin regions of eggshells and proposed to strengthen the egg shell). Overall, the porphyrin-based materials with relatively high chemical stability have shown an enormous application range, including chemical usage (oxidation, atom transfer, and electron transfer catalysts), advanced functional devices (CO2 reduction, light harvesting, information storage, and chemosensors), medical applications (photochemotherapy for cancer treatment), and imaging techniques as well (used as fluorescent/photoacoustic imaging dyes in the biomedical field).

Considering their low oxidation potential and high charge transport capabilities, porphyrins are considered to be efficient CTLs in PVs. Because of the large structural tuning capacity, porphyrin materials could have high versatility in terms of electrochemical, photophysical and charge-transport properties, making them good CTL candidates for perovskite materials of highly tunable energy levels. In addition, porphyrins have excellent thermal stability and high hole mobility due to the strong π–π stacking and intermolecular charge transfer of the porphyrin film (in fact the porphyrin materials have been applied as electron donors in BHJ OPVs). These jointly secure their initial success in PSCs. Table 5 summarizes prior examples of using porphyrin materials as HTLs in PSCs. In 2016, Chou et al. reported the first porphyrin based HTL (zinc porphyrins: Y2 and Y2A2) for PSCs. As shown in Fig. 17a, Y2 and Y2A2 consist of a meso-5,15-bis(ethynylaniline)porphyrin backbone bearing butyl (Y2) or dodecyl (Y2A2) chains, with two facing alkoxyphenyl groups in the other two opposite meso positions. The design benefits the electronic communication between the porphyrin core and the donor amine group. As a result, the Y2 and Y2A2 films exhibit a well-matched HOMO of −5.22 eV (close to the CBM of −5.4 eV of MAPbI3) and a high hole mobility of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, resulting in a PCE of 16.60% (comparable to that of 18.03% from a reference cell using spiro-OMeTAD). Chen et al. reported the 5,10,15,20-tetrakis{4-[N,N-di(4-methoxylphenyl)amino-phenyl]}-porphyrin with Zn(II) and Cu(II) being centered in the porphyrin ring (abbreviated as ‘ZnP’ and ‘CuP’ in Fig. 17b). Density functional theory (DFT) results show that the four meso-substituted triarylamines surrounding the porphyrin ring are nearly perpendicular to the porphyrin due to steric hindrance, giving a twisted spatial structure. Both the porphyrin core and the triarylamine contribute to the HOMO DOS distribution of ZnP and CuP, while the LUMO is only determined by the porphyrin ring. Compared to ZnP (−5.29 eV), CuP has a lower HOMO of −5.37 eV. The corresponding film exhibits a similar hole mobility of about 3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, nearly two-fold higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD (1.58 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). A ZnP based PSC exhibits a PCE of 17.78% compared to the spiro-OMeTAD reference (18.59%). For the HTL application in solar cells, the morphological features of the film, such as pin-hole, uniformity, surface roughness, and porous density, as well as their effects on mobility, electrical conductivity and slight energy-level shifting, are crucial to the final device performance. Re-engineering the molecular structure of porphyrins to optimize the intermolecular interaction and their stacking in the final film can be a shortcut. Chiang et al. extended the coplanarity of porphyrins by using the dimeric porphyrin conjugate structure. The resultant porphyrin dimers WT3 and YR3 were composed of ethynylaniline electron-donating moieties attached at the lateral meso-positions of the porphyrin (Fig. 17c). The enhanced coplanarity enables a better intermolecular interaction and a higher PCE of 19.44% from the WT3 based device (compared to that of 18.62% from the spiro-OMeTAD reference device). Kang et al. employed three different substituted electron-donating triarylamine (TAA) groups to extend the π-conjugation of the molecule (coded as SGT-061, SGT-062, and SGT-063 with their structures being shown in Fig. 17d). These molecules consist of a coplanar porphyrin core and different TAA bulky donor groups which possess a larger dihedral angle between the alkoxy-substituted phenyl ring and the donor TAA. This spatial effect gives rise to a strong interference for the dense molecular arrangement and a modulation on the π–π intermolecular stacking. Consequently, the SGT-061 with a less bulky donor group and a tighter molecular stacking exhibits a higher hole mobility of 2.60 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 than those of SGT-062 (1.28 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and SGT-063 (8.01 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1). Although the device exhibits a relatively lower PCE of 9.0–12.6% (compared to the value of 16.6% from the spiro-OMeTAD-based reference cell) due to the low hole mobility, the rule of “the less bulky, the easier molecular stacking” is verified in practice. Overall the molecular stacking of the porphyrin materials plays the most important role in their HTL films for PSCs. Besides the modulation on such a coplanarity, the intermolecular stacking and the consequent film morphologies can also be influenced by the functional moieties surrounding the core porphyrin ring. For example, Lee et al. designed a series of novel zinc porphyrins (PZn) with different diphenyl-2-pyridylamine (DPPA) moieties surrounding the porphyrin cores. These DPPA moieties had electron deficient pyridine bridging the core porphyrin (Fig. 17e), so the energy level and spatial interaction of adjacent molecules could be adjusted in certain levels. The DPPA group also contributes to the oriented stacking of the molecules, as the 2D grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD) revealed that the PZn–DPPA film showed enhanced face-on π–π stacking compared to the PZn–TPA film (with the (010) out-of-plane (Qz) peak at around 1.70 Å−1 corresponding to an intermolecular π–π distance of ca. 3.70 Å). This improved face-on π–π stacking might be the reason for the promoted vertical charge transport, as observed in the mobility results. Consequently, the PZn–DPPA has the lowest HOMO of −5.36 eV and a decent hole mobility of 4.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, delivering a PCE of 14.11%, comparable to the value of 14.61% from the spiro-OMeTAD-based reference device. Moreover, the modulation of the porphyrin based HTL can also be electronically changed through the adjustment of the functional groups. This will change the HOMO, for example, and affect the hole extraction at the perovskite/HTL interface. It has been well documented in OPVs that the incorporation of strong electron-withdrawing elements such as fluorine (F) can mitigate the π-electron cloud and downshift the energy level to a certain degree. Azmi et al. employed this strategy to further decrease the HOMO energy level of the porphyrin HTL to make an Ohmic contact between the perovskite and HTL. Specifically, Zn porphyrin (PZn)-based materials with four fluorinated triphenylamine (FTPA) substituents (PZn–2FTPA and PZn–3FTPA in Fig. 17f) have been synthesized. As expected, the PZn–2FTPA displayed a lower HOMO of −5.37 eV compared to −5.14 eV from the non-fluorinated PZn–TPA. The PZn–3FTPA displayed a comparable hole mobility of 3.91 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a higher PCE of 18.85% compared to the values of 3.37 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 16.37%, respectively, for the non-fluorinated PZn–TPA device. Additional studies on engineering of the molecular structure of porphyrin-based HTLs have also been reported with the corresponding molecular structures being shown in Fig. 17g and h and the device performance parameters listed in Table 5. Beyond the scope of structural engineering of the porphyrin material, the oxidation state of the porphyrin HTL can tune the carrier concentration and consequently the electrical conductivity. For example, Cao et al. developed dual valent Co(II)/(III) mixed incorporation into the porphyrin film. The Co(II)/Co(III) pair is typically known as one of the best combinations for redox processes, which has been used as an electrolyte in DSSCs. A mixture of Co(II)P and Co(III)P (Fig. 17i) has been used as the HTL for PSCs as well. Normally the methoxy-substituted triphenylamine group in most above-mentioned porphyrin HTLs is responsible for the high solubilities in common organic solvents and the extended π-conjugation is responsible for efficient charge transport. The additional methoxy-substituted oxyalkyl chain attached at the triphenylamine group can further tune the solubility of the whole porphyrin molecule.
In addition, the centered Co(II) and Co(III) serve as a redox couple to tune the oxidation level of the HTL. Consequently, both Co(II)P and Co(III)P HTLs exhibit similar hole mobilities to that of spiro-OMeTAD but slightly lower HOMO levels of −5.30 and −5.28 eV, respectively. The Co(II)P/Co(III)P mixed HTL displayed a PCE of 20.5% compared to that of ∼19% from the spiro-OMeTAD based reference cell. In addition to the role of charge transfer in PSCs, the porphyrin materials can also serve as a dual functional layer that simultaneously harvests photons, excites the charges and transports these excited charges. Gao et al. reported a hybrid PV cell composed of a NIR-absorbing BHJ layer on top of the perovskite. The BHJ layer containing a mixture of DPPEZnP-TSEH and PCBM not only displayed a broad photoresponse to over 800 nm but also possessed suitable energy levels and a high mobility to afford a high PCE of 19.02%. The NIR photon usage for PV conversion by the top BHJ layer is verified by the extended EQE as well as the transient absorption study. Above all, various examples referring to the changes in the meso-substitution of tetraaryl-porphyrin (such as variations of the substituents and metal centers) have been demonstrated and discussed, which can have different impacts on the energy levels, absorption features, intermolecular interaction/stacking and its effect on the final film morphology as well as electrical properties. Additional versatility of porphyrin derivatives by reforming the cyclic tetrapyrrolic ring, such as other tetrapyrrole-based molecules (e.g., chlorins (Chl), bacteriochlorins (BChl), Zn(II)chlorophyll derivatives with BChl, Chl, and Por macrocycles, and other core-modified porphyrins), has been studied to use them as potential HTLs for PSCs. Fig. 18 compares their molecular structures and relative performance as the HTL in PSCs. Although there have been a wide range of artificial porphyrin derivatives synthesized and employed in PV cells, the principle motif of using these porphyrin HTLs is to transfer the charge carriers through their π-conjugated electronic structure. This is relatively superficial in comparison to their delicate role in nature. For example, the chlorophyll in leaf cells is constructed in such a design that the energy transfer strictly follows the highly efficient Förster resonance mechanism. Instead of directly utilizing certain biomaterials as a disordered film in devices, delicately arranging the biomaterials into a subsystem (having an ordered structure or a delicately designed structure to evoke a highly efficient working mechanism) with maximal abilities of charge transfer might be a better solution.

The porphyrins and analogous derivatives discussed above represent the most widely used materials in PVs. Particularly, their optical response featuring two absorbance bands in visible and NIR regions also enables their applications as photoactive materials (dyes) in DSSCs. The high hole mobility also benefits their ‘electron donor’ role in the BHJ blend in OPVs. Apart from these porphyrins and their analogous derivatives, natural pigments with aromatic fused π-conjugated structures can also be potential CTL materials in PSCs. Similar to porphyrin derivatives, most of them have been applied as photoactive dyes in DSSCs. Table 6 summarizes some of the natural conjugates, their corresponding properties and roles in nature. Anthocyanins, a type of flavonoid (a class of compounds with antioxidant effects), are the pigments that give different shades of red, purple, and blue to plants. Anthocyanins have higher chemical reactivity than other flavonoid classes, due to their specific pyrylium nucleus (C-ring) (Fig. 19a). To exemplify, anthocyanins are also ubiquitous water-soluble pigments having important roles in the physiology of plants (repelling herbivores and parasites, attracting pollinators and seed dispersers, and protecting plants against biotic and abiotic stresses) and humans (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and anti-diabetic properties). Chemically, anthocyanins are weak diacids, nucleophiles, and hard and soft electrophiles, with a high tendency to develop π–π stacking interactions and binding with hard metal ions. The π–π stacking can facilitate the film to have higher intermolecular charge transfer, and the binding ability to metal ions can potentially passivate lattice defects in perovskites. They also exhibit the typical chemical properties of polyphenols, including an electron donor property and affinity with proteins. Their biological role in terms of transformation and catabolism in humans and effects on health is well-reviewed elsewhere. Carotenoids, the tetraterpene pigments with yellow, orange, and red colors (Fig. 19b), are widely distributed in photosynthetic bacteria, certain species of fungi and archaea, algae, plants, and animals, giving the characteristic color to pumpkins, carrots, corn, tomatoes, canaries, flamingos, salmon, lobster, shrimp, and daffodils. Carotenoids are conjugated double bond compounds with recurring isoprene units, which are responsible for the π-electron delocalization along the backbone and thereby a certain level of electrical conductance. All carotenoids are highly lipophilic and exhibit low solubility in water, making them potential materials for introducing hydrophobicity to the moisture-sensitive perovskite materials in PSCs. Their conjugated nature also makes them antioxidants (inactivate the reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage, which is essential to the immune system), attractants, and UV attenuators. Recently, carotenoids have received growing attention because of their therapeutic values and health benefits, as well as their applications in the perfume and food industries. Mangostin is the major xanthone from Garcinia mangostana (whose fruits are referred to as the ‘queen of fruits’ in Thailand) and has been utilized as the starting material for semisynthetic preparation of multiple biologically active derivatives. Its structure is shown in Fig. 19c, with the presence of multiple instances of including two prenyl chains, three phenolic hydroxyl groups and two unsubstituted aromatic carbons. Mangostin displays chemopreventive properties in medical applications. In PV applications, mangostin is used as the dye in DSSCs (exhibiting a relatively low PCE of 2.63%). Rutin (3,3′,4′,5,7-pentahydroxyflavone-3-rhamnoglucoside, shown in Fig. 19d) is a flavonoid pigment in medicinal plants (usually found in sources such as buckwheat, Japanese pagoda tree, Eucalyptus, hawthorn, lime tree flowers, elder flowers, etc.) and is used to make medicines (responsible for various pharmacological qualities including antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, cytoprotective, vasoprotective, neuroprotective and cardioprotective properties). As the natural antioxidant, rutin has been reported as the reducing agent in synthesis of Ag NPs. The rutin-modified Ag NPs can be used as a chromogenic probe for metal ions in aqueous environments. Elseman et al. reported the strategy of silver chelation on rutin as an additive for increasing the hole conductivity in the HTL. The rutin-modified Ag NP blended PHPT-py HTL led to a PCE of 21.1% for the PSC, while the reference cell using the typical spiro-OMeTAD HTL has a PCE of only 20.8%. This is due to the re-oxidation effect by rutin–Ag NPs on the PHPT-py HTL, enhancing the electrical conductance of the HTL. The deoxidized rutin can be easily oxidized by oxygen and these oxidized states of rutin can be further reduced by the PHPT-py HTL. Hence, the catalytic role of rutin–Ag NPs improves the properties of the PHPT-py HTL. Meanwhile the chelation-like rutin–Ag NP complex restricts the migration of the halide group in the perovskite and consequently improves the operational stability of the PSC device. Overall, the rutin–Ag NPs could be a promising additive to the existing HTL materials in PSCs. Anthocyanins (a type of flavonoid with antioxidant effects; the structure is shown in Fig. 19e) are found in vibrantly colored fruits, leaves, and flowers capable of attaching to transition metal oxides (TMOs) such as TiO2 surface which has been reported as the photo-sensitizer in DSSCs. Although anthocyanin pigments are abundant in nature, isolated anthocyanins are highly degradable, depending on several factors such as pH, storage temperature, and sunlight exposure.Betalains (Fig. 19f) are a class of yellow and red tyrosine-derived pigments found in the cactus Mammillaria flower petals, red beets, Swiss chard, Amaranthus caudatus, etc. Betalains exhibit many attractive properties including antioxidant, anti-cancer, anti-lipidemic and antimicrobial properties. Betalains are water soluble with functional –OH and –COOH groups which can make it easy to attach TMOs. Other commonly used natural dyes as photon absorbers in DSSCs include the chain-like molecules such as β-carotene (non-polar compound and highly lipophilic, shown in Fig. 19g(i)), lutein (lipophilic and generally insoluble in water, shown in Fig. 19g(ii)), violaxanthin (a natural xanthophyll pigment, shown in Fig. 19g(iii)), and neoxanthin (a carotenoid and xanthophyll, shown in Fig. 19g(iv)). There are a wide range of natural pigment materials where the large π-electron conjugation enables visible light absorption and hence the coloring properties of these materials. The π-electron conjugation and delocalization also make it possible for charge transport in a certain range. Considering their application as CTLs in PSCs, an intermolecular hopping mechanism must be feasible, requiring close intermolecular packing of these natural pigments within the thin film. Additionally, intentional doping to increase the charge carrier density or improve other mechanisms such as radical assisted transport and/or organic transport can be possible routes towards highly efficient CTLs applied in PSCs. Although the application of these natural conjugates as CTLs in PSCs remains unexplored, their potentially high charge carrier mobility, tunable energy level, good solution-processability and benefits compared to artificial materials (e.g., low-cost, abundance in supply, and reliable stability) may trigger new protocols for more efficient CTLs for PSCs.

Carbonized materials can be directly obtained from natural sources through high-temperature sintering and are advantageous due to their low-cost, versatile microstructures and high chemical/thermal stabilities. Mei et al. reported the pioneering work of using a porous carbon film as an efficient and stable hole collection layer in PSCs. Carbon-based hole collection materials also exhibit good air/water stability and high compatibility for easy manufacturing such as doctor-blading, screen printing, and electrospray printing. These attributes make them promising materials for anodes in PSC devices and their extended applications in MPS. Particularly from the cost perspective, carbon-based PSCs could significantly reduce the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of the PV MPS in contrast to those using metal electrodes.

Compared with the synthesis of existing state-of-the-art charge collection materials which requires tedious and complex processing and expensive precursors, carbonized natural organics with a delicate microstructure are good alternatives. For example, activated carbon with microstructures (e.g., hierarchical porous structure) for supercapacitor applications can be synthesized from natural corncob and lignin of wood. For applications in Li-ion batteries, hierarchically porous nitrogen-rich carbon as an anode material has been derived from wheat straw. Similarly in PSCs, using an ancient Indian method, Mali et al. designed an ecofriendly route to extract cross-linked carbon nanoparticles from Aloe vera as the HTL and electrode to achieve printable PSCs, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 20a. The authors extracted Aloe vera gel from leaves and dried it in sunlight to obtain the intermediate carbon powder. After being washed with acid, the product was annealed at a high temperature (1000 °C). The final product was crosslinked carbon nanoparticles with uniform size (denoted as AV-C) (Fig. 20a(i)). The screen-printed carbon film from the AV-C carbon paste showed outstanding conductivity (∼7 Ω cm2) compared to one made from a commercial colloidal carbon paste (∼80 Ω cm2). With the AV-C carbon, a fully printable triple-layered mesoporous scaffold consisting of a TiO2/ZrO2/AV-C based PSC showed a PCE of 12.75% (Fig. 20a(ii)), higher than that of the device using commercial carbon ink (10.53%). In addition, an unencapsulated device based on AV-C showed a small PCE decrease after 900 hours in ambient air with a relative humidity of 35% (while the reference PSC fails after 100 hours of operation) (Fig. 20a(iii)). Gao et al. also synthesized various bio-carbon materials through pyrolysis of common plant waste including corn stalk (CS), peanut shell (PS), Phragmites australis (PA) and bamboo chopsticks (BC) (Fig. 20b). Results demonstrated that all of the aforementioned carbon materials could serve as the HTL/electrode layer for PSCs (Fig. 20b(i) and (ii)). The cell based on biocarbon extracted from BC exhibited the best performance compared to the others with a PCE of 10.30%. It should also be noted that the cell based on the biocarbon exhibited exceptional stability compared with the conventional PSC, and the BC-based cell exhibited nearly 90% of the PCE retained after 2000 hours in ambient conditions with a 30% relative humidity (RH) (while the reference device failed after 300 hours) (Fig. 20b(iii)).
Overall, the carbon-based hole collector layer in the PSC enables the exemption of the expensive HTL and could further reduce the cost because of the replacement of noble Au with carbon. In addition, carbon and its derivatives as highly conductive charge collectors are abundant in nature as most organics are carbon-based materials able to be carbonized through various established techniques. Employment of these natural carbonized materials still needs to follow the principles of (i) excellent electrical conductivity and charge carrier mobility, (ii) uniform microstructures with minimized pores, traps and defects, (iii) small and uniform particle size as well as good and dense film morphology, (iv) high purity and stability, and (v) good compatibility to up-scaling manufacturing, in addition to their unique (vi) ability to inherit microstructures from their original natural carbonate sources. In particular, application in perovskite solar cells, carbon electrodes or carbonized CTL with an extremely low manufacturing cost is one of the biggest thrusts for their commercialization. Utilization of already carbonized or direct use of carbon electrodes has been reported. The use of carbonate sources in vitro, followed by post-carbonization, in order to further simplify the manufacturing may offer additional potential for innovative device fabrication.

The perovskite photoactive layer in PSCs is responsible for photon absorption and a subsequent quick conversion into a free electron and a hole, thanks to its low exciton binding energy, so room-temperature thermal heat can separate the excitonic electron–hole pair into free charges. To maximize the photovoltaic efficiency in these photoactive layers, properties including (i) efficient photon absorption (e.g., broad spectral response, high light-distinction coefficient, long lifetime of excited states, clean band structure with minimized density of shallow trap-states or in-band traps) and (ii) efficient excited charge transport towards corresponding electrodes (e.g., high electron and hole mobilities to ensure less potential energy loss and charge density loss during transit, ambipolar transport ability that enables opposite drifting of excess photon-excited electrons and holes under external electric fields). These requirements are exactly met by perovskite materials, which have a good band structure (direct bandgap and a high optical absorption coefficient of 105 cm−1), tunable energy level (bandgap ranges from 1.15 to 3.06 eV), a long exciton diffusion length (1 μm in polycrystalline films and 100s μm in single crystals), sharp DOS at the VBM and CBM and low effective masses, and high electron and hole mobilities. This makes the perovskite the current optimal platform for PV applications. In addition to this, PSCs with a specific type of production will need additional attributes. For example, for PV-MPS applications, PSCs may require high mechanical properties (e.g., flexibility for curved UAV wings, fabrics and other wearable implementations), higher stability and efficiencies for outdoor applications (e.g., PV-tile roof under extreme weather conditions), and some other specific features (e.g., transparency for the PV-window; high vacuum/pressure endurance for spatial application). Under these considerations, bio-inspired strategies (including delicate structures, chemically functional biomolecules and their hybrids with the target materials) can be helpful in adding new functionalities to the current baseline PSC platforms. For more specific examples in terms of mechanical properties, natural materials with sophisticated microstructures (such as columns of circular layers in wood or bone, or the complex helicoidal chitin fibers in the stomatopod club) can be simultaneously light-weight, strong, flexible and tough; some of them can be porous with a hierarchical design to provide paths for efficient mass transport and/or to reduce weight; many natural materials are also able to self-repair repeatedly without any external interference; such natural materials can also be built with a relatively limited number of components and a simple structure under minimized energy supply in a highly efficient manner. Finding the common design themes among them and developing a novel bio-inspired paradigm is hence reliable, some of which have already been successfully applied in different fields. In terms of PVs, these bio-inspired strategies for enhancing the original properties or adding new attributes to current perovskite photoactive layers are expected to expand the horizon of the development of PSC-based MPS.


Enhancing the mechanical properties (toughness, bendability, etc.) of PSCs is important, particularly with consideration of portable, foldable and mobile power applications. Natural hybrid materials such as nacre and bone exhibit remarkable toughness and strength. Fig. 21a and b summarize and compare the mechanical properties between natural and artificial materials. In fact, most natural materials are composites of certain forms, including polymeric (e.g., polysaccharides, proteins) and ceramic (e.g., silica, calcium salts) components or composite building blocks. From this toolbox, a wide range of hybrid materials (such as wood, bamboo and palm, comprising cellulose fibers within a lignin–hemicellulose matrix; insect cuticle, comprising chitin in a protein matrix) are assembled materials. Similarly for nacre, its hybrid composite design gives the primary strengthening and toughening mechanisms. More specifically, nacre has a ‘brick and mortar’ micro-composite structure (Fig. 21c). The bricks are crystalline aragonite (CaCO3) platelets with a dimension of 0.5 μm thickness and 8–10 μm width, providing strength, while the mortar (20–50 nm thick) is a biomolecular adhesive composed of proteins and chitin, providing toughness and ductility. This alternative laminar multilayer structure has multiple toughening mechanisms including crack bridging, pulling/sliding of aragonite platelets, crack propagation deflection and energy dissipation by the organic layer, which are well discussed in prior reviews. Such a hierarchical structure from nacre has inspired the development of engineered materials in PSCs with remarkable toughness and mechanical strength. In PSCs, one of the major challenges is the brittle nature of the halide perovskite film. It is difficult for the perovskite material to meet the stretchability, twistability and bendability requirements of the PSC device and the final MPS products able to accommodate the complex human body movements. Inspired by the promising results for the biomimicry study of nacre in other electronically applied materials (e.g., interface-reinforced graphene-based fibers, reduced graphene oxide–poly(acrylic acid) nanocomposites), researchers attempt to adopt the nacre concept to enhance the reliability of mechanically flexible PSCs. Hu et al. mimicked the natural mineralization process of nacre by introducing two polymers of poly(styrene-co-butadiene) (SBS) and polyurethane (PU) into the perovskite (Fig. 21d) to modulate the mechanical features of the perovskite photoactive layer. The SBS serves as a scaffold that reduces the nucleation energy barrier and induces heterogeneous nucleation of the perovskite. Meanwhile, PU undergoes chemical interactions with the perovskite precursors which suppress the nucleation rate. Mediated by the synergistic effect of SBS and PU, the resultant photoactive film exhibits oriented grains. Owing to the stress release effect by the elastic polymeric matrix, the PSC exhibits outstanding bendability and stretchability (Fig. 21e). The SBS–PU based PSC module shows no clear PCE decrease after bending in 2 mm curvature for 5000 cycles compared to an 80% PCE loss in a reference device.


There are a wide range of potential natural examples for mimetic implementation in PSCs. These delicate structures can be applied in designing mechanically qualified PSCs and their terminal MPS products. Mechanically, beyond the aforementioned specific strength, stiffness, and Young's modulus in Fig. 21b, another important figure-of-merit is the specific energy absorption (SEA), which defines the absorbed energy by a structure per unit mass. The SEA can be calculated from the force–displacement (F–D) characteristic (exemplified in Fig. 22a) of the target material using the equation of SEA(d) = (EA(d))/m, where d is the displacement, EA is the energy absorbed by the material as represented by the shaded area under the F–D curve, and m is the mass of the target material. Similarly, SEA per unit volume (SEAV) defining the energy absorbed per unit volume can also be calculated using the equation of SEAV(d) = (EA(d))/V, where V is the volume of the energy absorber. Fig. 22b shows the SEAV of various biostructures with respect to conventional (simple artificial) structures. Among them, the honeycomb-like sandwich architecture has been widely observed in nature, such as turtle shells and beetle forewings (Fig. 22c) and has been utilized to design strengthened carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) panels with greater energy absorption and a lower peak load for construction applications. Similarly, the elson (tail plate) of Stomatopoda (mantis shrimp) (Fig. 22d) exhibits excellent mechanical impact resistance because of its special structure, which has been mimicked for designing corrugated panels. The augmentation of the impact resistance comes from the significantly improved crashworthiness and reduced initial peak force in these bio-inspired sandwich panels. Another candidate for designing the bio-inspired structures for mechanical energy absorption is the head of a woodpecker. Several studies in mechanical engineering have been done to mimic the woodpecker's head structure to improve the low-velocity impact behavior of a sandwich beam structure (which is superior to the conventional beams, with a lower developed stress, a smaller damage area and less deformation while sustaining a higher maximum impact force). Unlike the conventional honeycomb structure, the walls of the woodpecker's beak-inspired honeycomb structure are wavy (Fig. 22e). This structure enables a superior absorption capability of mechanical energy compared with 125% enlarged SEA. Besides those high SEA structures inspired by animals, structures from plants are also of interest. For example, by mimicking the composite structure of palmetto wood, bio-inspired ‘sandwich’ composite structures using carbon fiber reinforced plastic sheets and the polymeric foam core have been developed and well-investigated. Similar examples can be found in leaf structures, where the core is designed by filling the honeycomb into a proper ortho-grid, with improved specific strength and energy absorption. In addition, the hierarchical structures inspired by the leaf can further improve the loading capacity. Another hierarchical design to enhance mechanical strength could be found in hard shell animals. For example, the hierarchically structured mussel shell is typically strong and tough. As can be seen from Fig. 22f, the shell consists of micro-byssal threads. The byssal threads are in a sandwich structure at the micro-scale, made of a matrix and granules which vary in cross-linking density. The granules contain a higher cross-linking density than the matrix and this controls the difference in local mechanical properties and allows good stress dissipation and mechanical energy absorption when the shell is stressed. Inspired by this design, researchers developed a hierarchical steel composed of a hard layer and a coarse-grained layer to deliver vastly superior mechanical properties. This hetero-composite design may also be applied in a perovskite solar cell device. For example, a polymeric matrix is used to blend with the perovskite to form a BHJ composite, so that the polymer could (i) allow sufficient stress-energy dissipation, store the strain and consequently lead to good mechanical toughness of the composite, or (ii) allow a ‘healing process’ after damage by re-bonding the neighboring broken grains to heal the crack. Either way, from the electrical perspective, a conjugated polymer with certain electrical conductivity is of paramount importance to ensure a good PCE. Stress-tolerance for PV-MPS also includes the dynamic endurance, which means that the device needs to have a high lifetime able to handle many cycles of folding–opening–refolding. This will require a good inner friction tolerance to avoid any serious fractures of the multiple layers in the device under the condition of a large bending angle. A natural example bearing both good hardness and flexibility or mobility is the bone and joint. These could be attributed to the remarkable hierarchical architecture of bone, constituted by both the soft collagen protein and stiffer apatite mineral (Fig. 22g). Bone's universal elementary building block is the mineralized fibrils, which are assembled from collagen molecules and mineralized by apatite crystals. In the body, the bone tissue functionality is related to stiffness which is determined by the collagen/mineral ratio. For instance, ear bone has over 80% of mineral content so that it is sensitive and vibratile with applied acoustics. In contrast, long bone with 20% mineral content, which is light-weight to enable mobility, could absorb the mechanical energy.

Overall, there are various promising structures formed at ambient temperature in creatures that have specific high mechanical properties. Nevertheless, there is limited success in mimicking such functional structures for applications to improve mechanical properties for PSCs. The challenges mainly include the lack of reliable approaches for translating these ‘design motifs’ found in natural materials to a specific utilization in solar cell applications, as well as the technical challenges of making these bioinspired structures using perovskite materials that can be installed within a PV device. Nevertheless, there is exciting potential within the vast inventory of natural examples with delicate structures that may lead to inspiring design principles/rules and highly efficient functionalities implemented to minimize energy consumption. For example, preparing a nanostructured perovskite layer using the precursor ink of the perovskite and a micro-mold (e.g., PDMS mold) could be a good way to manufacture a mechanically stable and optically multifunctional film, and the mold pattern could be mimicked from the nanostructures from shrimp shell, woodpecker's beak or beetle forewings. Learning and understanding these natural designs, and eventually manufacturing and implementing them in products requires the development of advanced nanomanufacturing techniques, which can be a long-term, costly project, but may have a ground-breaking impact to the broader community outside of the PV field. Overall, nature provides a huge library of ‘design manuscripts’; how to utilize them to optimize existing models and even make innovations, and the challenges in developing more advanced tools are the two prior problems to be addressed now.

For real applications of PV-MPS, weather conditions such as rain, snow, wind, and dust need to be taken into consideration. A device with a self-cleaning feature could ensure a stable power output and extend its lifetime. In the following section, several natural prototypes for self-cleaning and corresponding self-cleaning solar cells will be discussed.


Lotus leaves possess special water repellency and surface non-wettability where water droplets cannot stably adhere to the surface of leaves (or petals in some cases) but spontaneously roll away or bounce off. In this way, dirt particles and dust can be routinely removed from the leaves or petals, which is usually called the ‘lotus effect’ or ‘self-cleaning lotus’ (Fig. 23a). This non-wetting property originates from the nano- and microscale hierarchical cilium-like structures superimposed on top of micro-papillae, as well as an epicuticular covering of low surface energy wax on these papillae (Fig. 23a(ii) and (iii)). This structural topography at the surface with a significantly large surface area could generate a higher energy barrier at the interface between the liquid and solid, but also trap the air below the water droplets forcing them to partially sit on a membrane of air. These effects jointly give rise to a superhydrophobic property at the surface (contact angle >150° and a sliding angle <5°). The super-hydrophobicity of these solid surfaces is crucial for self-cleaning of glasses, anti-icing and prevention of snow adhesion to glass surfaces, and anti-corrosion/anti-biofouling.


This self-cleaning property is an important attribute for practical usage of solar cells, particularly for applications in remote desert areas (e.g., Africa, the Middle East, four-season countries), some industrial areas (e.g., with accumulation of dust, snowfall and airborne dirt from factories) and solar-driven robotic spatial exploration (e.g., The Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover mission of NASA's Mars Exploration Program). The accumulation of particles from the surrounding environment on the surface will block the light and compromise the output power of PV cells/panels/modules. Currently, cleaning methods to remove these particles include the electrostatic method, mechanical method, and coating method for PV product surface cleaning. Considering the energy for the cleaning process, the coating method with a specific surface microstructure design is of great interest. In the case of PSCs, Kang et al. reported on the water-repellent PSCs based on PDMS films with lotus leaf-inspired hierarchical arrays well-equipped with a self-cleaning capability. The structured PDMS film is additionally attached (due to the strong van der Waals interaction between PDMS and glass) to the glass side of a PSC which can enhance the light incidence by an anti-reflection effect while having a self-cleaning functionality. Fig. 23b(i) shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the PDMS layer with hierarchical pyramid arrays (having a 45° angle at the bottom edge side). This hierarchically structured PDMS layer creates super-hydrophobicity on the surfaces leading to a self-cleaning effect (Fig. 23b(ii)), where the dust particles could be removed easily by water droplets rolling off the surface due to the large contact angle of 157° (Fig. 23b(iii)). This additional lotus-inspired PDMS thin sticker layer thus exhibits an easy but effective way of making self-cleaning PSCs. Similarly, Tavakoli et al. also reported a nano-cone array of an antireflection film attached onto the front electrode of the substrate in order to improve the water-repellence as well as the optical transmittance. The PDMS film (thickness of 0.2 mm) with a nanocone array pattern (1 μm pitch and 1 μm depth, as shown in Fig. 23c(i)) was fabricated by molding from an imprinted Al foil template which was first prepared via a multistep anodization coupled with a wet etching process. Fig. 23c(ii) shows the ‘dust self-cleaning experiments’, where the dust/small particles can be easily removed from the device by rolling water droplets across the surface sufficiently cleaning the dusty surface. Furthermore, the aspect ratios (defined by the height of nanocones over periodicity) of the PDMS nanocones can be tuned through the molding process. Besides the inverted micro-pyramidal structured (IMPS) PDMS coating film, incorporation of an additional hydrophobic layer can further enhance the self-cleaning effect for the device. Dudem et al. reported the fluoro-octyltrichlorosilane (FOTS)-coating on the surface of micro-pyramidal PDMS (Fig. 23d(i)) and obtained a superhydrophobic behavior with a very large water contact angle of 150° (Fig. 23d(iii)). The micro-pyramidal structured PDMS was prepared by peeling from a Si-mold after curing at 75 °C for 2 hours, followed by a treatment (rinse) of a mixture of trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl) silane and n-hexane for several minutes and drying in an oven at 30 °C for 12 hours. The self-cleaning behavior of a FOTS-treated IMPS–PDMS film was tested by dropping water on the dust covered film. Fig. 23d(ii) shows the efficient self-cleaning process. In real outdoor conditions, these nano/micro-structured PDMS films with a super-hydrophobic surface have exhibited an efficient self-cleaning ability when exposed to raindrops, and the PSCs integrated with the PDMS layer showed good device stability for 32 days.


‘Healing’ is defined as the act or process of curing or of restoring to health. In nature, healing is an intrinsic ability in the biological world, encompassing from plants to animal kingdoms, roughly classified into eight prevalent mechanisms: (i) reversible muscle control, (ii) clotting, (iii) cellular response, (iv) layering, (v) protective surfaces, (vi) vascular networks or capsules, (vii) exposure, and (viii) replenishable functional coatings by the biological community. Table 7 summarizes the healing in nature (flora and fauna) through an organizational approach. Flora includes herbaceous plants that die down to ground and regrow each year (i.e., annuals, biennials, and perennials) and woody plants referring to trees that maintain a persistent woody stem above ground year-round; fauna includes vertebrates (animals with a spinal cord) and invertebrates (without a spinal cord). Due to the huge variability of species, their specific self-healing mechanisms differ significantly. For example, Fig. 24a shows the wound healing in a tree limb, where the cells at the wound (cut) are hardening to seal off the wound to prevent the exposure to harmful microbes. Some plants also have special secretion cells (or the vascularized networks throughout their tissues), which could release latex, gum or volatile oils at the cut to heal injuries and/or to repel predators.Fig. 24b shows a latex producing tree as an example, which has inspired the application of ‘self-healing elastomers for dampers’. In vertebrates, bone remodeling via a complex series of cellular and humoral activities is important to the species.Fig. 24c shows this process, which begins with the debris cleaning at the existing bone fracture by the osteoclasts (cells that break down bone tissue), followed by remodeling by pre-osteoblasts to wound the site, reproduction of the extracellular matrix and mineralization to produce new bone. During this process, continuous ‘precursor’ supply of hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells is crucial to this ‘synthetic reaction’. This concept has inspired ‘self-sealing and self-healing concrete’. As a broad overview, Table 8 lists a chronological overview of some self-healing/repair materials/applications inspired by nature according to prior literature.

In terms of perovskites, one challenge in this material is its high chemical activity with oxygen and moisture in air. Placing a halide perovskite thin film in the ambient atmosphere will introduce a gradual surface degradation (chemical impurities, surface traps, etc.) that is harmful for their use in PSCs. Removing this already degraded surface layer inspired by the ecdysis and moulting of animals (Fig. 24d) could be a potential solution. In fact, the concept of ‘surface layer removal to obtain a high-quality fresh layer’ has been widely used chemically and physically in manufacturing (e.g., surface cleaning of monocrystalline silicon wafers for chip manufacturing) and in research (e.g., mechanical exfoliation of 2D materials for obtaining a fresh surface). For a perovskite crystal, the surface trap has significant harmful impacts on the interfacial contact. Fig. 24e shows a cross-sectional SEM image of a perovskite crystal with poor surface morphology. Properly polishing the top surface with techniques such as laser polishing or other fine lapping may help to passivate those unwanted surface defects. To prevent surface degradation of halide perovskite films, an alternative pathway could be a quick surface passivation before reaction with air. Like the wound healing process at the epidermis in soft tissues of the invertebrates, covering the reactive surface with a clotting-like ultrathin layer may be helpful in inhibiting the reaction with ambient harmful agents. This spontaneous self-surface-protection could be conceptualized either by introducing specific additives in the perovskite that can spontaneously form a robust top protecting layer on the halide perovskite (will be discussed in Section 5.3 – Bio-additives) or by intentionally coating a capping layer on top of the wet halide perovskite film before its reaction with air. Protective skin and an outer shell are widely used strategies in nature. Fig. 24f shows the examples of cell walls of plants that can protect the cell, skin epidermis that can protect the inner tissues, the exoskeleton of insects that can provide protection against harsh environmental stimuli, and marine collagens that can protect marine organisms. In comparison, for the research of perovskite solar cells, different protection strategies have been proposed (Fig. 24f). For example, a core–shell structure could protect the core perovskite lattice, an ultrathin organic coating layer on the grain could protect the crystal grain of the perovskite, and a 2D capping layer could protect the 3D perovskite layer underneath. This is particularly important for perovskite solar cells, where the surface traps account for a significant loss. Particularly in single-crystalline perovskite solar cells, since the inner bulk region is having no boundaries, surface traps could lead to a serious issue in contact with the CTL or electrodes. Passivating these surface traps or delaminating the top-rough ‘skin’ to induce a smooth inner surface during device assembly is the next hurdle to overcome. This may require sophisticated manufacturing techniques such as laser-annealing, laser polishing and flashing lamp annealing techniques.

PSCs targeted for MPS applications may have soft and deformable attributes. However, soft elastic materials typically used for PSCs and other electronics are susceptible to puncturing and tearing, leading to mechanical failures, performance losses, and even the lead leakage from the perovskite layer. This potential failure greatly limits the use of MPS in applications such as autonomous field robotics or remote mission (e.g., spatial mission) where repairs are challenging or even impossible. Hence, soft MPS which are self-healable and functionally repairable like natural skin or nervous tissue are of great interest. In a higher-level field view of artificial self-healing materials, many nature-inspired mechanisms and materials have been proposed. These include semiconducting polymeric networks, recoverable polymers, ionic hydrogels, liquid metal (LM) microfluidics, and LM microcapsules patterned on solid lines. These methods can also be transferred to be used in PSCs. At this point, self-healing in PSCs still is not fully developed. For specific consideration of halide perovskites, some aspects of this material are serious issues for industrial implementation, including the environmental impact from the lead as well as the materials’ photo- and chemical-stability. The material is intrinsically metastable with significant anharmonicity in the chemical bonds and consequent dynamic disordered states within the crystallographic lattice. Restoring the properties from a ‘damaged’ state of the halide perovskite to its original ‘healthy’ state to prevent device failure is of great importance. As an organic–inorganic hybrid material with a ‘soft’ attribute (a much smaller Young's modulus than those of typical inorganic semiconductors such as Si and GaAs), it is possible to heal the perovskite using the aforementioned methods applied in other ‘soft’ materials such as polymers. For example, using chemical/physical treatments (e.g., exposure to degrading chemical, thermal, or light treatments) on halide perovskites, cracks and pin-holes can be merged well. Early studies have revealed that the incorporation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) additives into the MAPbI3 perovskite can revert the degraded crystal (yellow δ-phase) back to the black β-phase. Specifically as shown in Fig. 25a(i), by infiltrating the perovskite into a PEG scaffold, the composite film exhibits a recovery behavior after degradation upon water spray, which otherwise would display an irreversible degradation if no PEG was involved. By constructing the PEG scaffold-based PSC (Fig. 25a(ii)), a self-healing device performance has also been obtained. The PCE decays with reduced VOC and JSC upon exposure to water vapour but then returns to its original value in less than one minute (Fig. 25a(iii)). This self-healing phenomenon might originate from the excellent hygroscopicity of the PEG coupled by its strong interaction with perovskite lattice terminals. PEG has stronger interactions with water molecules than those of the perovskite and water, so the water can be retained in the PEG phase instead of diffusing into the perovskite phase; PEG can also keep the MAI (through hydrogen interactions) from escaping away through a higher volume of water spray. By putting back into a dry atmosphere, as long as the retained water molecules evaporate, the non-perovskite yellowish phase turned back to the black β-phase. Similar to polymers, small organics with proper interactions with the perovskite lattice can also assist the self-healing of the PSC. Recently, Ran et al. reported the incorporation of large-volume amines (LVAs) in the Sn-based PSC with a self-healing property. After heating or exposing to air (the Sn-based PSC is highly sensitive to heat and oxygen due to the quick oxidation of Sn2+ in FASnI3), the LVA-based device could partially restore its PCE from 60% of its initial value to 80% after being placed in a N2 atmosphere for a specific time. This self-healing effect might be due to the steric hindrance effect of the LVAs.

Similar ‘self-healing’ effects in PSCs upon exposure and termination of proton radiation have also been observed. This might be more important for outer space and space ship mission applications. The proton (p) radiation, together with helium (He) (resulting from galactic cosmic radiation or solar flares, with a particle flux of 103 to 108 cm−2 s−1 depending on the distance from Earth), is the major cosmic radiation source for the solar cells and MPS used in spatial missions (e.g., spaceships and satellites in the outer space). Protons with high energies (close to 1 MeV) can induce ionization and lattice displacement, and result in device damage to solar cells. Lang et al. found that the PSC exhibited compromised PCE upon proton irradiation but displayed a self-healing effect by returning the PCE to its original value after terminating the radiation (Fig. 25b(i)). This can be understood from the proton irradiation-induced displacement of hydrogen. The proton irradiation typically results in the chemical bond breakage of C–H and N–H, rendering localized in-band states (further leading to Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination) (Fig. 25b(ii)). After termination of the proton irradiation, the displaced hydrogen atoms migrate back towards the lattice and passivate the localized defects, recovering to their original state. This self-healing process is verified in the recovery of the photocurrent (Fig. 25b(iii)).
Besides the above moisture and proton radiation stimulated self-healing, another type of healing is via illumination. Several groups have reported such photo-induced degradation and recovery of the device PV parameters under constant solar irradiation, applied external bias and storage in the dark. In early 2015, Bag et al. reported the first observation of photoinduced quasi-reversibility of the performance of PSCs (MAxFA1−xPbI3). The PSC degradation under sunlight contains both thermally activated fast ion transport and lattice-expansion triggered by IR light in the solar spectrum. Interestingly, they also observed that, after keeping a previously illuminated MAPbI3 PSC in the dark for 15 min, the lost PCE of the device can be recovered when re-illuminated. Similarly, Yadav et al. also found that, under conditions of illumination and bias, the JSC of the PSC decreased in a reversible pathway and recovered to its initial number after being kept in the dark for a short time. The ion movement and accumulation, and the resultant interfacial change at selective contacts is concluded to be a possible mechanism restricting the PV performance recovery. These ion-migration induced recoverable PCE changes in PSCs have been further supported by the work of Domanski et al. (Fig. 25c). By in situ cooling the working PSCs and exemption of thermally induced non-reversible PCE loss, the device exhibits a significant PCE loss under continuous operation (in light) and then shows PCE recovery to its initial value after resting in the dark. As shown in Fig. 25c(ii), in the initial condition, the ionic pairs (stoichiometric anion and cation) are randomly distributed in the perovskite layer; in the non-stabilized condition (devices are exposed to light and biased to MPP) anions (vacancies) migrate to the HTL side and form a Debye layer at the interface, leaving the relatively immobile cation behind; at longer timescales over 103 s (i.e., the stabilized condition), cations migrate and form another Debye layer at the ETL side. Both Debye layers at the HTL and ETL sides are harmful for photocarrier extraction and hence lead to PCE degradation, but it is recoverable. Particularly when the PSC device is given several hours of ‘resting’ in the dark, the ionic distribution can thermodynamically return to its initial random state and thereby the device appears to be ‘fresh’ again and thus the PCE is restored. Supported by modelling and elemental depth profiling results, the slow ionic migration (timescale >103 s) induced reversible PCE losses are further verified. Based on this timescale of >103 s, the natural day/night cycles (timescale of 104 s) can provide enough time for self-healing of the device performance spontaneously. A similar recoverable behaviour of the PSC was also observed by Lee et al. After being exposed to 365 nm UV light for >1000 hours under inert gas (<0.5 ppm H2O), followed by one-sun soaking (allowing dispatch of stacked charges and neutralization of defects), the PSC showed PCE recovery. In parallel, a claim of ‘light-activated metastable trap-states’ to explain the recovery behaviour of PSCs has also been documented. Nie et al. demonstrated that PSC degradation under constant solar illumination is due to the photocurrent loss, which can quickly self-heal within 1 min in the dark to its original value (Fig. 25d(ii)). PSC capacitance measurements and film time-resolved (TR) PL spectroscopy attribute the observed photocurrent loss to the ‘light-activated metastable trap-states’ (Fig. 25(iii)), which further leads to the space charges at the interface (resulting in non-homogeneous electric fields interfering with charge transport in the device) as supported by both experimental data and DFT analysis. Overall, in PSCs there have been several interesting phenomena observed for ‘self-healing’: (i) two distinct time regimes of recovery: fast recovery (i.e., <1 min, retrieving ∼96% of its initial PCE), slower recovery (tens of minutes to an hour, i.e., 103 s, fully restoring the photocurrent); (ii) the photocurrent degradation can be attributed to the formation of light-activated, metastable and deep trap-states (>0.5 eV); (iii) both the degradation and self-healing of PSCs are highly sensitive to temperature and light, the former's dynamic (timescale of 103 s) being slower than that of the latter (timescale of 102 s); (iv) a VOC decrease by 40 mV has been observed and is due to the deep trap-states. To explain these behaviours, a more general and fundamental property of the perovskite material needs to be clarified, the ‘polaron’ model. The formation of small polarons is generally responsible for this experimental ‘self-healing’ behaviour in PSCs based on the following considerations: (i) localized polaronic states can be manifested as deep trap-states in the forbidden band, which further gives rise to the space charge accumulation and a ≤40% photocurrent reduction; (ii) the formation time of small polarons is faster than the time scales of PSC degradation; (iii) the slow degradation of the photocurrent can be attributed to the accumulation of small polarons. Considering these, Nan et al. provided a first-principles calculation on the light-induced photocurrent degradation and self-healing in MAPbI3 PSCs. It is demonstrated that, under photoexcitation, changes of the crystallographic lattice (due to photo-activation of site vacancies, followed by geometric relaxation) lead to the formation of partially localized excitons being trapped at the defects. In the meantime, the other excitons can be dissociated into free charges at the femtosecond scale due to their very small exciton binding energy. Hence there is the coexistence of trapped excitons and free charges. The trapped excitons can be released (to yield a recovery effect) with an activation energy of 26 meV for the I-site vacancy and 38 meV for the Pb-site vacancy in MAPbI3. Overall, the photocurrent degradation and recovery in PSCs can be determined by the competition between the trapping and release of excitons. This mechanism is more general and can be applied for similar perovskites such as FAPbI3, MAPbBr3, and FAPbBr3, but with a faster recovery dynamic. The optical ‘damage’ to the perovskite film has also been investigated and found in the recovery of the PL of multiple perovskite films. These observations indicate that illumination induced ‘damage’ of the perovskite can be repaired continuously.
Outside the self-healing of the perovskite crystals, another consideration can be the quarantine of leakage of the toxic lead by some self-healing encapsulation materials when the PSC is mechanically damaged. Recently, Jiang et al. reported a self-healing polymer-based encapsulation to reduce the lead leakage from damage. Three encapsulation methods (Fig. 26a) have been investigated coupled with realistic simulated mechanical damage (to simulate the real hail impact) as well as Pb leakage rate. The crucial factor to minimize the Pb leakage is the self-repair ability of encapsulating polymers. Fig. 26b and c compare the different encapsulation methods in terms of their effectiveness in limiting the lead leakage. Fig. 26b shows the photographs of PSC modules with different encapsulation methods before impact and Fig. 26c shows the photographs of these PSC modules after mechanical impacts (followed by two water dripping tests, the first by heating at 45 °C and a second water dripping test). Different encapsulation methods yield various degrees of perovskite decomposition. Particularly, an epoxy resin (ER)-based polymer with a Tg of ∼42 °C, when sandwiched between a PSC module and a top capping glass, can effectively reduce the rate of Pb leakage from 30 to 0.08 mg h−1 m−2 under various simulated weather conditions. Taking advantage of such ‘self-healing’ attributes from the polymeric encapsulation materials to protect the device, quarantine the lead, and even recover the partial performance loss is a promising pathway to extend the lifecycle of PSC based MPS products. On a broader scale beyond the epoxy resin, self-healing polymers involving various chemical processes (including incorporation of covalent, free-radical, and supramolecular dynamic bonds) and physical events (such as employing enhanced van der Waals interactions, interdigitated copolymeric morphologies – embedded, reactive, encapsulated fluids that can infiltrate into a wound and trigger sequential chemical reactions for damage repair and cardiovascular networks) are providing new insights. Although artificial self-healing in versatile systems may contain complex mechanisms, self-healing in living systems involves complex cascade reaction series, the exact chemistries of some of which are far from being understood. Resembling these natural self-healing processes from learning and mimicking the reactions at the molecular scale is the major ongoing task in the community of artificial self-healing materials. Learning, transferring, and applying these techniques into the more specialized PSC field may create a big leap to self-healable MPS products.

Incorporation of processing additives into the photoactive layer is a universally effective methodology to boost PV cell performance. In OPVs, small molecule additives can tune the micromorphology of the BHJ blend and hence tune multiple electronic properties; in PSCs, additives have been reported to have multiple effects on the device performance. There are various types of additives including salts, molecules, polymers, and even nanoparticles, with varied effects, including modulating crystalline features, stabilizing the perovskite phase, adjusting energy-level alignment, enhancing operational stability, eliminating hysteresis, suppressing nonradiative recombination, etc. In contrast to those inorganic additives, biomolecular additives may have additional functionalities through molecular interactions with the perovskite lattice by their specific functional chemical groups. A good example is in caffeine, which is the active substance in coffee. A recent study has revealed the effectiveness of incorporation of caffeine in boosting the stability of PSCs. The caffeine molecule has two CO groups (Fig. 27a(i)) with lone pair electrons that could interact with the Pb2+ from the perovskite lattice through strong Coulombic coordination, serving as a ‘molecular interlock’ between adjacent perovskite grains. Meanwhile, these molecules can serve as Lewis bases passivating the Lewis acid-type defects like undercoordinated Pb2+ in perovskites, thus reducing the trap density. This molecular interlock effect also suppresses the ion migration, yielding a superior stability for a PSC based on the n–i–p structure (Fig. 27a(ii)) to retain 90% of the initial PCE after 1700 hours when annealed at 85 °C (in contrast to 60% of the initial performance remaining from the reference blank device after 175 hours of annealing, as shown in Fig. 27a(iii)). Similarly, Zhang et al. introduced N719 (a dye derived from chlorophyll) into the MAPbI3 perovskite crystal. The –COOH groups from N719 were found to form complexes with the MA+ (MA+ = CH3NH3+) in the perovskite lattice (Fig. 27b(i)), which modifies the diffusion of water molecules in the materials. Theoretical calculations show a much higher migration barrier of water molecules in the N719-based perovskite. As a result, the water penetration into the perovskite layer can be greatly inhibited (Fig. 27b(ii)), and the moisture stability of the device is significantly improved. Nearly 70% of the PCE can be retained at a high RH of 60% for 400 hours (Fig. 27b(iii)). Our group also revealed that the incorporation of hydrophobic DNA–CTMA into the perovskite crystal can sufficiently improve the device stability by nanoscopically wrapping the perovskite nanocrystals (Fig. 27c(i)). The strong hydrophobicity of DNA–CTMA also enhances the non-wettability upon contact with water (Fig. 27c(ii)) and thereby improves the device lifetime (Fig. 27c(iii)). Recently, our group reported a ‘perovskite/perovskite’ bilayer structure. The bottom perovskite layer is a bulk layer with a typical grain size of hundreds of nanometers, while the top perovskite layer consists of perovskite–artemisinin core–shell nanocrystals. This bilayer structure is spontaneously formed by adding the artemisinin molecules (Fig. 27d(i)), which have been known as medicine molecules against malaria. Artemisinin has a unique endoperoxide ring that produces free radicals to damage the proteins of parasites and thereby cure the disease. The sesquiterpene lactone structure and alkyls make artemisinin insoluble in water, showing a hydrophobic behavior. As a result, the hydrophobicity from the artemisinin-incorporated MAPbI3 top layer (Fig. 27d(ii)) improves the device stability with a retained efficiency >18% which corresponds to ∼95% of the initial PCE after one-month exposure to ambient environment (Fig. 27d(iii)). Overall, by providing functional groups to anchor the terminal partially bonded atoms in the perovskite lattice, the biomolecular additives are effective in improving the stability of the crystal. In addition, the PCEs of the resultant PSCs can be improved to certain degrees mostly due to the enhanced crystalline quality. Fig. 28 summarizes the PCEs of the PSCs incorporated with multiple bio-molecular additives. The highest PCE of 20.63% comes from the device structure of FTO/TiO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au with the addition of DNA–CTMA into the perovskite layer. Nevertheless, biomolecules are naturally more complex than typically used artificial additives and their role in the cascade reaction series in a species can be even more complicated and delicate. Harnessing their specific chemical group as a functional agent to couple with those active terminal atoms/crystallographic sites in the perovskite lattice might be a good way to improve performance, but it remains technically inefficient and scientifically unclear when using such complex molecules to execute simple redox chemical reactions between biomolecules and the perovskite lattice. Instead, simplifying the biomolecule structures, designing an optimal structure using the knowledgebase and knowhow from aforementioned successes, and utilizing a more functional-oriented bio-additives for PSCs might be a better alternative.


Extending from the scope of the abovementioned nanoscale or molecular-scale mixing of biomolecules and semiconductors, blending organisms with semiconductors at the meso-scale is another research interest. Classic examples such as dye-sensitized solar cells where natural dyes are adsorbed at the surface of TiO2 to execute the light-triggered biological processes across their interface, or photo-bioelectrochemical cells and photobiofuel cells with biomolecules, cells or bacteria immobilized on the metal electrodes have been extensively studied for applications in energy harvesting, sensing and storage. Particularly, similar to the photoactive layer of perovskite in a perovskite solar cell, the photosynthetic proteins (e.g., Reaction Centre – Light Harvesting 1 (RC-LH1)) from natural organisms such as Rhodobacter sphaeroides play the key role in natural photosynthesis reactions because of not only their similar role in photoexcitation of electrons to that of the semiconductor but also their unique attributes such as ultrahigh quantum efficiency for energy transfer and charge separation as well as the maintenance of this high efficiency at low temperatures such as 4 K. Recently, Tan et al. took advantage of the wide response window of photosynthetic proteins to light, temperature, pressure, etc., and developed self-powered all-weather sensory systems. By incorporating RC-LH1 into an electrolyte medium of a triblock copolymer (thermoreversible gel (TRG)), the photoelectrochemical cell even exhibited a self-healing behavior. This successful demonstration of photosynthetic proteins in solar-driven sensor applications revealed the underlying potential of natural photosynthetic proteins in innovating multifunctional solar devices.

Similarly, bacteriorhodopsin (bR) is another well-known photoactive protein usually found in the purple membrane of Halobacterium salinarum. In Section 4.3, we have discussed their role in the charge transport layer in solar cells. Beyond charge transport, in light of the enhanced potential for light-induced proton pumping and color switching, bR has also been adopted as a platform for various applications such as fuel cells, photodetectors, biosensors, artificial retinas, nanosensors, storage devices, holographic memory, security inks, and bio-defense or camouflage, which have been well documented in another review paper.
Although not well studied so far, interfacing these relatively larger-size proteins with perovskite photoactive layer materials to render new composites could potentially extend the application domains of solar cells. For example, the low-temperature environment workable RC-LH1 could extend the solar cells’ application range to meet a critical environmental condition of extremely cold weather. Technically, employing these larger-size proteins in vitro in a perovskite polycrystalline layer still needs to be properly strategized, where prior learnings from effective immobilization of proteins on the electrode of a photoelectrochemical device may be helpful. In parallel, fundamental research on the natural function of inter- and intra-proteins and full understanding of the efficient transfer of photoinduced electrons across the interface are also necessary and important to guide us as to how to mimic it in real devices.

In the above text, we have discussed the bio-inspired strategy for each individual component in the PSC device, including the electrode, the charge transfer layer and the perovskite photoactive layer. Zooming out from these individual components towards the perspective at the device or system level, more intriguing and creative designs of the whole device system and their corresponding manufacturing inspired by the natural bio-systems are of great interest. In the following section, bio-inspired design with successful reported demonstrations at the whole device level and unconventional manufacturing techniques replicating the sophisticated nano/microstructures from biology will be discussed.


Many living creatures can track light adaptively to maximize their exposure to the light. This light-tracking phenomenon is known as phototropism, which can be found in the example of a sunflower that can self-orient itself to face the sun throughout the day. In this tropic movement, organisms not only spatially ‘sense’ the light stimuli, but also spontaneously and continuously adjust their movements to strictly follow the incident light directions. This presents intelligence in self-regulation through the natural feedback control inherent in dynamic interactions between the stimulus and the organisms. As the natural sunlight is dynamic (Earth rotation), there is an inevitable oblique-incidence energy-density loss (OEL, sunlight density reduction when the emissive energy projects on a surface obliquely, as shown in Fig. 29a). The loss could be enormous if the incident angle is large (e.g., 75% loss at 75° incidence). In order to maintain the high-level light-reception, many plants developed such phototropism behavior. This phototropism could provide an efficient solution to address the universal OEL issue and huge energy loss in existing solar panel farms, although solar trackers have been invented to reduce the OEL but mostly need additional power to supply their rotation (will be discussed later). Harnessing such phototrophic behavior autonomously, without external control or power supply, is of great significance in achieving highly efficient and intelligent PV systematic platforms with smart autonomous adaption to complex ambient environments (such as clouds and sunset). Although many reversibly photoresponsive soft materials such as hydrogels, liquid crystal elastomers and azobenzene/spiropyran-based polymers have been proposed as good candidates for achieving this artificial phototropism behavior, their applications in solar trackers of PVs remain fully unexplored.

In the case of PVs, the output electrical power is heavily dependent on the solar irradiation that reaches the PV cell surface. The more orthogonal the sunlight reaching the cell surface, the higher the output power that can be achieved. The Earth is constantly spinning and the incident angle of the Sun's rays on the cell surface is dynamically changing, causing significant power loss of the PV cell. In addition to the Earth's daily rotation, the annual rotation of the tilted Earth (Fig. 29b), the latitude of the surface, and the local weather conditions will also affect the light absorption of the PV cell. In order to expand the overall solar harvesting, the solar tracking technology inspired by phototropism is a good solution. The state-of-the-art solar tracking techniques (Fig. 29c) include the passive tracker (e.g., liquid- or gas-based thermal expansion mechanism by the company Zomewords, and researchers like Clifford et al. and Castañeda et al.) and the active tracker (e.g., control logic and algorithm based mechanism, first presented by McFee, a control system with a microprocessor and an electro-optical sensor). The former is advantageous as it has less energy/cost consumption of the tracking system, but it lacks intelligent reaction to the weather (as it is mostly thermally driven, hot weather will significantly interfere with the tracking motion). The latter is advantageous in dynamically adapting the complex environmental conditions, but requires additional power supply to maintain its response to environmental stimuli, an algorithm to respond to the temporal weather change and responding motion.
The ultimate way of harvesting solar energy is to construct a sphere surrounding the light source. In a more cosmoscopic level, efficiently utilizing the solar energy in the Solar System by future PV technology beyond the ongoing state-of-the-art technology might be more exciting although unrealistic. For example, it could be a megastructure or the so-called ‘Dyson sphere’ conceived of as a gigantic shell of solar cells enclosing the sun and harvest 400 septillion watts of energy per second (a trillion times our current worldwide energy usage).

In real applications, the failure tolerance (the property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of (or one or more faults within) some of its components) is an important index for the product. Particularly for PSCs, the perovskite is highly sensitive to the ambient environment, making it easily degrade during normal outdoor operation. When one ‘strip’ cell in the PV module fails (e.g., may be due to small mechanical fracture, a small hole or even a microscale contact issue), the whole module may not work. In nature, such an issue can be avoided through design of features like an insect's compound eye (Fig. 30a). The compound eyes are composed of many thousands (30 thousands in larger Anisoptera dragonflies) of facets (or ommatidium, hexagonal in cross-section and a large aspect ratio with ten times longer than wide) (Fig. 30a(i)). Each ommatidium works as an individual photon sensor (as there is a cluster of photoreceptor cells at the inner wall of an ommatidium which can convert the light signal into a nerve pulse for reception by optical nerves). Hence, each ommatidium is innervated by one axon and thus providing the brain with one picture element. The brain forms an image from these independent picture elements. Such a design enables the independent work of an ommatidium with exemption of the interference from a neighboring ommatidium. In other words, the failure of an ommatidium will not affect the normal function of neighboring ommatidia. Using this concept, a ‘compound eye’ PSC has been developed recently, which contains individual cells being partitioned by a scaffold and arranged into a vast array of microcells with characteristics including a smaller size, encapsulation, and mechanical and chemical isolation. Fig. 30b shows the design. The (gray) partitioning scaffold shields the individual perovskite microcells. The microcells (in the array) are connected in parallel by both the top and bottom electrodes. The array has a pitch of 500 μm, which can be further modulated by adjusting the design of the scaffold substrates. As a result, thanks to the mechanical stress de-concentration, this ‘compound’ PSC displays a significantly enhanced fracture energy of ∼13 J m−2 (30-fold increase over a prior reported planar PSC with a value of ∼0.4 J m−2) with over 15% PCE. This design could also improve the failure tolerance; since all the microcells are electrically connected in parallel, failure of any device is expected to not cause the failure of the whole device.

This individual array design for the vision system prevails in nature, although the detailed mechanism in photon-sensing can be versatile. An analogous example is the retina's neurons that can recognize the light and convert it into neural signals. The retina is composed of three different layers: (i) outer nuclear layer (ONL, where the well-known cone and rod cells can sense the light and convert it into neural signals), (ii) inner nuclear layer (INL, where the horizontal, bipolar, and amacrine cells can transmit the neural signals from the ONL to the GCL), and (iii) ganglion cell layer (GCL, where the retinal ganglion cells can receive the neural signals from the INL and further transmit the action ionic potentials to the visual cortex through optic nerves) (Fig. 30c(i)).Fig. 30c(ii) shows the picture of real cone cells (typically 40–50 μm long and 0.5 to 4.0 μm wide) and rod cells (typically 100 μm long and 2 μm wide). The most important part composing the rod and cone cells are the numerous membrane disks (Fig. 30c(iii)) containing large numbers of photoreceptor proteins, rhodopsin. It is the rhodopsin that acts as the visual pigment to convert the light into biochemical signals. As the rhodopsin photoreceptor protein is inserted in the membrane, the disk-like packing of the membrane can enhance the population of photoreceptor proteins and improve the light sensitivity. Such an individually arrayed rod and cone layout perpendicularly inserted at the retina layer enables an efficient integration of a large quantity of individual cells, leading to a high visual resolution. Designing a retina-like photoactive array layer for PSCs on a hemisphere substrate (Fig. 30d) to panoramically harvest light might be an alternative design to the dynamic solar tracker-system. One recent study on artificial retina conceptualized the perovskite nanorod (NR) array on a concavely hemispherical artificial eye (field of view (FOV) of 150°–160°). A hemispherical porous aluminum oxide membrane (PAM) was used as the template with numerous microchannels where the perovskite single crystalline NR can grow (Fig. 30d).
Overall, many examples exist with a large potential for the use of nature-inspired designs into novel structured PSCs. Shifting our attention from the focus on individual components such as each functional layer or material towards the whole device level design, system level implementation, temporal life-cycle and recycling, network overall planning with those power consumers and other power plants could bring new insights to upgrade the device to the next level, which definitely will still need more knowledge and intelligence. These knowledgebases may have already been stored in the library of nature.

Natural micro/nanostructures (including the above-discussed nacre, bone, Lotus leaves, insect eyes and wings, etc.) have provided enormous inspiration to many important applications. In addition to those research efforts devoted to further understanding the underlying mechanisms, there is a growing effort to manufacture artificial materials with those unprecedented properties by mimicking those found in nature. Focusing on superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity in nature as examples, Jiang et al. proposed the general procedure of designing and synthesizing related artificial materials: (i) unique property selection from the biological system (bio-target), (ii) an in-depth understanding of the correlation between the natural structure and their macroscopic properties, (iii) selection of the target artificial material, and (iv) construction of the architecture to realize the aimed function. Nevertheless, the major challenge lies in techniques chosen to assemble the molecules at both nano- and microscales. So far, various strategies to synthesize functional materials that resemble natural species’ architecture and function have been developed, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD), self-assembly, lithography, and other 3D printing techniques. Particularly, additive manufacturing (3D printing, exemplified in Fig. 31a) has opened new opportunities for mimicking and manufacturing the intrinsic multi-scale, multi-material, and multi-functional structures found in nature. Nevertheless, in contrast to most man-made materials, natural materials are built in much milder inner environments within the species’ body which has ambient temperatures and an aqueous environment. The ‘manufacturing’ of natural materials is more delicate and involves bottom-up strategies in a tiny system, making them difficult to duplicate in large-scale artificial manufacturing. Importantly, natural materials combining the desirable properties of their components usually perform significantly better than the sum of their parts (similar to the emergent properties)—a natural coupling effect that has inspired much of the ongoing interest in the design of bioinspired materials. Many natural systems simply follow basic mathematical rules but turned out to be sophisticated functionalities (e.g., ant's route selection of emergency logistics algorithm). Exploring and learning the secrets from natural materials and systems offer a pathway towards solving manufacturing challenges that exist in the current PSC-based MPS. By using bio-inspiration, innovations may exist either in the individual manufacturing of the PSCs or in their integration with the MPS in a higher-level network incorporating both energy supplier and energy consumer for advanced internet of energy (IoE) systems. Stream-line manufacturing with a continuous producing attribute could allow the PSC fabrication in a highly efficient way, which will need to balance the conflicts between each individual component in the device and eventually unite them into a whole device with consistent functionality. Since the PSC consists of multiple components including the bottom electrode (front contact), ETL, perovskite light absorber, HTL, and top electrode (back contact) as well as interfacial modification layers sometimes, each component will need a specific individual manufacturing process to obtain its optimal performance, and this diversification in manufacturing processes will make it costly and time-consuming for the whole device fabrication. In comparison, streamlined manufacturing in conjunction with a joint consideration on both cost and performance of the whole device will need to minimize the conflict behaviors and maximize the reciprocal behaviors between each individual component. A natural prototype of this strategy could be the human gut microbial ecosystem (HGME) that consists of hundreds to thousands of species of bacteria, archaea, and eukarya as well as viruses. In order to maintain a eubiotic state that promotes homeostasis of the whole bodily function, individual species in the HGME (individual component in the system) could sacrifice in a certain level to reduce conflicts and enhance the reciprocals to keep this mutualism as well as their own sustainability. Regulating the individual components with the aim of achieving the optimization of the whole system is thus an important scenario in nature species. Smart regulation and intelligent and timely communication between components could thus lead to a more efficient resource/information/energy usage, which has been recognized as the internet of things (IoT) technology. Similarly, distributed energy systems could also optimize the efficiency of energy infrastructure and reduce the waste (Fig. 31b). Focusing on energy efficiency, this system-level design mainly includes the insertion, implementation, installation, and coordination of the MPS in a higher-level system. For example, MPS can be used as the power plant for a ‘MotorHome’, supplying powers to all the appliances used in the recreational vehicle (RV), where an intelligent mini-IoE system can more efficiently manage the supply–consumption correlation between the MPS and the consumer streams. This MPS-incorporated smart IoE concept can be further used in those ‘smart home’ and ‘smart city’ projects, where multiple types of MPS such as solar windows, solar tiles, solar roofs and solar farms can be incorporated as a node in the energy cyber network analogous to nature's “ant's nest” where the delivery of electricity follows a highly efficient traffic way that is free from any jam or shortage.


High-performance natural materials and systems have been well developed over millions of years’ evolution and present valuable sources for inspiration in engineering both (i) the individual material components in a subsystem and (ii) the whole integrated system. PSCs incorporating the biomimicry by learning from nature's concepts and designs are expected to be a new route towards next-generation PV-MPS technologies like their prior success in driving a paradigm shift in the development of other modern science and technology communities. In terms of individual material components in a PSC subsystem, there have been successes in demonstrating highly efficient bio-inspired strategies to improve the performance and properties of electrodes (e.g., ‘biomimetic ant-nest electrode structure’, ‘leaf vein electrode network’, other nature's fractural design inspired hierarchy electrode), the CTL (e.g., DNA, fractal neuron network, bR-inspired composite charge transfer materials, and other natural molecules such as porphyrins, natural conjugates and carbonized material incorporated CTL), and the perovskite photoactive layer (e.g., specific micro-composite inspired by nacre, bamboo, and wood, functional microscopic design aiming at self-cleaning and self-healing inspired by many natural examples, and many bio-molecular additives to improve the specific property of the perovskite crystal) of the PSC. In the case of system and overall device design, potential bio-inspiration for MPS applications includes solar trackers (inspired by sunflower and phototropism of plants), micro-cell arrays composed of sub-cells separated by a scaffold (inspired by insect compound eye arrays), and various bio-related manufacturing that have been or are being developed (although perfectly mimicking the manufacturing of natural species remains an open question in the whole field of biomimicry, 3D printing and other state-of-the-art techniques are helping to achieve a closer step).


In the specific case of PSC-based MPS, the future bio-inspiration may focus on the downsides of current PSCs. Compared with incumbent PV techniques such as Si, CIGS, CdTe PVs and OPVs, PSCs are more advantageous in terms of the relatively high PCE (due to the superior optoelectronic properties of halide perovskite materials), low cost (solution-processability of the core perovskite photoactive layer and other charge transfer layers), high degree of flexibility and large power density (lightweight device for a high output power due to the large light extinction coefficient of the perovskite so that a thin layer can harvest a high intensity of light), which make them potential candidates for the next-generation PV-MPS. Nevertheless, the drawbacks of PSCs include the (i) mechanical fragility and brittleness, (ii) environmental impact, (iii) life-time and life-cycle issue, and (iv) limitations in scale-up manufacturing, which might be the specific focus where the bio-inspiration can pop in. In addition to these, (v) the system-level design to intelligently coordinate MPS with other electricity consumers could be another dimension to consider the bio-inspiration. Fig. 32a shows the ‘Cannikin Law’ (Wooden Bucket Theory) of PV-MPS, where the bio-inspiration can serve to fill the gap from the shortest staves (five drawbacks of PSCs mentioned above). In particular, for each issue, potential solutions to the shortage of current PSC-based MPS inspired by nature are shown as follows:

(i) Mechanical robustness: at the material level, for each component in a PSC, the trade-off between mechanical and optical (electrical) properties remains a challenge, particularly for the MPS aimed at portable, foldable and stretchable applications. For example, the front transparent electrode of a PSC for wearable MPS requires certain levels of flexibility with qualified optical transmittance and electrical conductivity, while most commonly used flexible TCO-based transparent electrodes (e.g., ITO) coated on plastic substrates (e.g., PET and PEN) usually exhibit electrical conductance failure after long-term mechanical bending. Designing a flexible metal NW network inspired by nature's fractal hierarchy structure (e.g., leaf veins, neural networks) could help boost the charge transport efficiency while maintaining the mechanical endurance; employing the nacre laminar composite structure could further assist in enhancing the mechanical strength. In the case of the CTL, design of an insect's compound eye and/or butterfly wing inspired periodic nanostructure could uniformly disperse the stress to avoid the concentrated stress induced fracture. Moreover, engineering the micromorphology of the perovskite layer by introducing either ordered micro-composite structures inspired by nature's micro-patterns found in various plants or molecular dyes that can simultaneously boost the mechanical strength and electronic properties (through molecular bonding) is of great promise. At the device level, designing and innovating the device architecture inspired by the hemispheric retina to not only redistribute external stress but also enlarge the light harvesting could be another pathway. Such hemispheric design with the PSC sticking outside can further be utilized in those curved roofs, UAV wings, etc. Overall, there have been various strategies in enhancing the mechanical properties of PSCs through versatile bio-inspired designs and materials. As the learning and investigation of nature's secret goes by, there will be growing ingenious strategies inspired and applied for PSC based MPS.
(ii) Environmental impact: the major safety concern of PSCs is the heavy metal pollution of the B-site atom (Pb, Sn, etc.) in the halide perovskite material. Mostly Pb poisoning will increase oxidative stress and consequently cause various deleterious effects on hematopoietic, reproductive, renal, and central nervous systems. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has set the upper limit of the blood lead level at 10 μg dL−1 (10 μg/100 g) and at 5 μg dL−1 for adults and children, respectively. Additionally, elevated Pb levels in the environment can result in decreased growth and reproductive rates of plants and animals, as well as neurological effects in vertebrates. Hence, there is an urgent need to prevent Pb leakage and contamination. So far, the best practical policy is to screen the Pb within the PSCs to prevent the leakage, which however is a heavily under-researched field that needs attention. Some ‘self-healing’ strategies have been introduced recently to sufficiently quarantine the Pb from a broken device. The encapsulation of the perovskite within protective shells or alternatively adding reactive agents to bind and quarantine Pb to avoid leakage can also be a possible solution. Pharmacologically, the removal of lead is usually performed using ‘chelation therapy’ (a medical procedure involving the administration of chelating agents to react with and remove heavy metals from the body). For the specific case of Pb, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is used as the agent which can bind and hold onto (chelate) Pb. Using such chelating agents in PSCs may also help to ‘hold’ the Pb in the case of PSCs broken under rain (otherwise rain will wash the leaked lead into the environment). In nature, Pb also binds to a variety of different biomolecules ranging from enzymes and proteins through interactions of Pb in thiolate-rich sites found in metalloregulatory proteins (e.g., Pbr, Znt, and CadC) and in enzymes (e.g., δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD)). Incorporating certain biomolecules into PSCs may further anchor the Pb within the device in the case of device breakage and bad weather that would otherwise accelerate the Pb leakage. In addition to these, as water is the major agent that can accelerate the escape of Pb from the PSC, sufficiently preventing the water from infiltrating the device can be effective to prevent the Pb leakage. Following this, some self-cleaning strategies resembling lotus leaves (non-wettability) can help.
(iii) Life-time and life-cycle issue: life-time, life-cycle analysis, investment, pay-back time, levelized cost of energy (LCOE), etc. are important indices to establish a benchmark for pre-industrial and laboratory-scale processes as well as individual MPS applications. As the life-time of PSCs is notoriously shorter (ranging from the month to the year scale, state-of-the-art lifetime ∼10−1 to 100 years) than that of their commercial counterparts (>101 years), the first priority of the PSC industry should be the stability issue. In the case of real applications, critical weather (rain, hail, and snow), hot temperatures, day–night cycling induced light intensity change, and other environmental activities will further establish the baseline requirement of the device lifetime. On the other hand, recycling of the used device at the end of the life-cycle is also important but lacks sufficient research efforts. These fields require highly efficient and intelligent strategies to push the PSC based MPS closer towards the market. Prior bio-inspiration has resulted in early attempts at enhancing the stability of PSCs (e.g., bio-molecular doping to anchor the crystal lattice, introducing hydrophobic bio-molecules in each layer of the device and designing a lotus-like surface structure to repel the water), adaptation to the light change, and other functionalities to adapt the dynamic changes in the environment for elongating the practical lifetime (e.g., self-healing, self-cleaning). More attention may be needed at the life-cycle end. In fact, the arrival of the end-of-lifecycle of a PV is unavoidable in any case. International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that the recyclable materials in retired solar modules will be worth $15 billion in recoverable assets by the year 2050. At that specific end point, how to deal with the retired perovskite PVs should be an important topic. The conventional way to deal with PV waste is a disposal process, either by landfill or by incineration. However, both of these disposal methods need capital investment, energy/labor consumption and even consideration of the environmental impact (lead leakage). Alternatively, regenerating the retired PVs by recycling the raw materials and re-collecting them from the PV waste could circumvent these issues. From this scenario, development of a simple but efficient method to regenerate perovskite PVs and extend their lifecycle is of importance.
(iv) Limitations in scale-up manufacturing: the efficient manufacturing capable of continuously producing PSC-based MPS is important. As perovskite-based MPS can be developed for numerous portable uses, their form or design cannot be limited to certain types. For this, suitable manufacturing techniques are required to properly upscale the lab-level PSC device toward MPS-oriented production. For example, MPS products with a ‘wallpaper-like’ feature that can be attached and detached anywhere anytime could be of great interest. Realization of such MPS will need a mature up-scaling manufacturing that can print a large-area PSC device on flexible substrates. Bio-inspired additive manufacturing (e.g., 3D printing bio-photovoltaics) might be a good starting point. While considering the (a) materials’ uniqueness (crystal, instability in ambient environment, critical crystallization requirement), (b) device's complexity (multiple nanometer-scale layer-by-layer structure), (c) high optical and electrical requirements (transmittance, electrical conductance, contact between each layer), and (d) tradeoff between cost and payback, PSC manufacturing will need more delicate design and intensive efforts. Ingeniously designing and innovating a PSC-customized processing by incorporating newly-conceptualized bio-inspired strategies will be a big leap. In parallel, the energy consumption in PSC manufacturing is an important factor affecting its potential in the market. Instead of energy-intensive and cumbersome processing, the biological system can synthesize high property materials (robust mechanical properties in woods and bamboo, magnetic single crystals in jelly fish) through multiple biochemical reactions (e.g., biomineralization) in a room-temperature, aqueous environment (in contrast, TiO2 in PSCs requires high temperature sintering and perovskite crystallization needs over 100 °C annealing). Simplifying those bio-synthetic methods into an artificial synthetic paradigm that can have a bunch of advantages in the application of PSC manufacturing would be intriguing.
(v) System-level design: by bringing the bio-inspired strategies into the nano-/micro-scale design and the manufacturing techniques, the functionality of PSCs can be strengthened. For example, a solar tracking technology inspired by sunflower has been introduced to solar cell technologies. By dynamically tracking the direction of sunlight, the loss of electricity generation of PSCs from the tilted incident light will be complemented. The angle of incident light is influenced by the various spatial states of Earth (the daily and the annual rotation) and the local environment of the system. The state-of-the-art solar tracking technology should be able to dynamically react to the change of direction of sunlight in energy-efficient and cost-effective ways. Additionally, a scaffold to separate a single device into multiple devices can be a solution. By adopting the scaffold design, inspired by ommatidia (units of the compound eyes of arthropods like insects, crustaceans and millipedes), and rhodopsin of retina, for PSCs, their stability against various stimuli from temperature changes and humidity can be improved. Since each partitioned device can generate electricity individually, the whole device failure can be avoided if the system is partially broken or damaged by external factors. Such a spatial design of the scaffold was inspired by nature to have an efficient arrangement of sub-cells so that each component device can be densely positioned inside. The scaffold also allows the system to have mechanical resilience against fracture, which is enabled by the stress-deconcentrating feature of the scaffold. Synchronization and coordination at the system level can also be found at manufacturing and synthesis sides. A natural ‘organ factory’ could efficiently synthesize multi-functional structures and/or materials. The mimicry of the natural synthetic ways to manufacture artificial materials and a system production of certain functional proteins can bring new opportunities to boost the manufacturing of both perovskite materials and the PSC devices.

Bio-inspiration for next-generation MPS is a multidisciplinary topic that requires expertise related to biology, materials science, engineering, electrics, chemistry and physics. This will require researchers from different backgrounds to team up into a more comprehensive group to have a higher-level overview of the whole field and then come up with targeted strategies to fill up the ‘shortest staves’ of the ‘Wooden Bucket’ in Fig. 32a. Bio-inspiration can provide the shortcut solution to those targeted strategies but remains to be a more general and abstractive concept. Most prior built bio-inspirations are focusing on mechanical and structural engineering, as provided in several well-documented review papers. For the specific application in PSC, PV-MPS remains not fully explored. This will require more efforts to interface between the parallelly developing PSC and bio-inspiration, as conceptualized in Fig. 32b. Nevertheless, several challenges remain to be addressed:

(i) The synthesis mechanisms found in nature need further investigation and the transformation of the bio-manufacturing to the artificial needs more studies. For application purposes, bio-inspired manufacturing needs to be developed to reveal the mechanisms underlying the intriguing properties. For example, nature grows organisms in a mild environment but takes a long time (bones need years to grow), while artificial manufacturing of PSCs requires a high time efficiency from the minute to the hour scale. Understanding nature's mechanism of material formation (growth) and identifying the origin of the long-time necessity may inspire the creation of a substitutive way to mimic the natural process in a much shorter time. For example, the crystal growth in natural mild conditions (e.g., biomineralization, biological investigation on produced materials, such as shells, teeth and bone, as well as the processes that lead to the formation of these hierarchically structured organic–inorganic composites) may provide implications of designing new synthetic routes. The chemical reaction route and new mechanism found in those bio-prototypes could provide opportunities for growing perovskites in a milder ambient environment instead of the current critical requirements of high temperature and low moisture. This, however, will require an improved understanding and knowledgebase of nature's synthesis.
(ii) Materials in nature are structured and usually a mixture of various kinds of sub-components (e.g., polysaccharides, proteins, and collagen fibers) instead of a single component. They usually have a synergistic ‘1 + 1 > 2’ effect as the property of each component is meager but the whole hybrid is of high-performance. In PSCs, for each functional layer material it requires very high purity and any impurities will significantly compromise the overall device performance. In addition, there is a limited material inventory from which the specific layer could be chosen. Making composite materials and using them as functional layers in PSCs could not only possibly reduce the cost of synthesizing high purity materials but also expand the material inventory for PSCs. However, before truly understanding the synergistic mechanisms of a composite, it will be trial and error for downselecting ‘the’ composite material.
(iii) The periodic microstructure found in nature (e.g., nanostructures on butterfly wings providing the camouflage colors and superhydrophobicity for self-cleaning; nanostructures on gecko feet providing striking attachment and detachment on walls and also giving self-cleaning, self-repair, and wear-resistant properties) is abundant. In most state-of-the-art PSCs, each layer is a simple planar layer and it is difficult to design a self-assembly process to manufacture the functional layer with a designed microstructure. Duplicating these natural microstructures with impressive performance in optical and mechanical functions is still beyond the ongoing PSC manufacturing techniques.
(iv) Nature utilizes the energy and space in a highly efficient and elegant way. PSCs still have a huge energy loss limiting their efficiency below the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit. The SQ limit refers to the maximum theoretical efficiency of 33.7% for a single-junction solar cell, mostly due to the spectral mismatch between the wide spectrum of sunlight and the single-bandgap of a solar cell. Thermalization (short wavelength light generated hot carrier and a fast cooling of hot carriers to release energy to heat) and in-band transparency (no absorption of long wavelength light below the bandgap) are the major losses and sum up to over 50% efficiency losses for a solar cell. In the retinas of vertebrate animals, there are different types of optical-responsive proteins in different cells that are reactive to light of different wavelengths. These individual cells are responsive to the light independently and parallelly aligned in the array to detect the monochromatic light individually from the white sunlight. In solar cells, tandem solar cells could mitigate the thermalization loss by incorporating multiple individual light absorbers in tandem stacking. As most tandem PSCs vertically stack the short-wavelength responsive cell and long-wavelength responsive cell, a parallel design of individual cells coupled by a prism to split the light might be another design for the tandem solar cell. On the other hand, coherence phenomena prevail in the biophysical system, which could lead to nontrivial optoelectronic behaviors. For example, the fluorescence interference pattern obtained from polydiacetylene (PDA) indicates an extraordinary microscopic coherence length for a single exciton. In the field of solar cells, utilizing nontrivial behaviors such as multi-excitation generation (MEG) could make it possible to break the SQ limit. One example is the singlet fission in certain organic chromophores (e.g., pentacene, rubrene, perylene) where one excited singlet state transforms into two triplet states upon close interaction with a ground-state molecule of the same kind. In this way, doubling of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the device in short wavelength regions to 200% is possible. By incorporating SF chromophores into solar cells, the improvement of the total exciton yield to 133%, EQE to 130%, and IQE (internal quantum efficiency) to 170% has been observed in tetracene sensitized silicon solar cells, pentacene incorporated organic solar cells, and TIPS–pentacene/PbSe QD solar cells, respectively. Yet these prior conceptualizations are not likely to break the Shockley–Queisser limit in the near future because of the low starting PCE point (even the tetracene sensitized silicon solar cell exhibits a low PCE of 5.1% due to the lateral structure and many technological challenges such as overall thickness control, stoichiometry and trap density). Hybridizing the perovskite with the chromophores to trigger MEG with the aim of exceeding the SQ limit could be one promising solution, while many other issues such as interface, disordered states in organic chromophores and delicate design of an energy/electrical transduction in the system remain to be addressed.
