A new acceptor unit containing dimethyl-2H-benzimidazole was synthesized and utilized for the synthesis of a conjugated polymer containing electron donor–acceptor pairs for OPV devices. The dimethyl-2H-benzimidazole unit was designed to act as a substitute for the BT unit of PCDTBT. This novel dimethyl-2H-benzimidazole unit has two methyl groups which can supply higher solubility than those of the BT series. A thin film of PCDTMBI, containing the dimethyl-2H-benzimidazole unit, shows two broad absorption bands with maxima at 400 and 636 nm and an absorption onset of 756 nm, corresponding to a band gap of 1.64 eV. The oxidation onset of PCDTMBI was estimated to be 0.67 V, which corresponds to a HOMO energy level of −5.47 eV. The LUMO energy level of the polymer was thus determined to be −3.82 eV. A device with a PCDTMBI:PC71BM blend had a VOC value of 0.65 V, a JSC value of 10.0 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.48, leading to an efficiency of 3.12%. The enhanced efficiency of PCDTMBI was caused by the higher IPCE value between 400 and 700 nm and high mobility (2.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1).

Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture comprising an electron donor, a π-conjugated polymer, and an electron acceptor ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)), have attracted increasing attention due to their unique advantages. These include favorable solution processability (for ink-jet printing and roll-to-roll processes), which is imperative for low-cost manufacturing and commercialization, in (for example) printed lamps for developing countries. However, they have a lower power-conversion efficiency and smaller photocurrent than inorganic solar cells, but it is expected that this can be solved by development of novel materials which improve both the coverage of the solar spectrum and the absorption coefficients.

In order to increase the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of these devices, it is necessary to develop low-bandgap conjugated polymers with low HOMO energy levels. Low-bandgap conjugated polymers which absorb in the red and near-IR region can better match the solar photon flux spectrum, which is important for the improvement of the OPV device performance through increases of the short-circuit current (JSC).
Recently, research into low-bandgap conjugated polymers containing electron donor–acceptor pairs for OPV devices has become quite intense. Many low-bandgap conjugated polymers with excellent efficiencies have electron-deficient heterocycles, such as benzothiadiazole, and electron-rich moieties. Poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT), one of these low-bandgap conjugated polymers, contains a 2,7-carbozole unit as the electron-rich moiety and shows 6.0% power conversion efficiency (PCE), one of the highest certified values by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) reported to date.
Even though alternating copolymers of benzimidazole and thiophene have been reported to show small red-shifts, the quinoid form of benzimidazole has never been incorporated in the donor–acceptor type of low band-gap conjugated polymers. It should be possible to construct the quinoid form by using a 2H-benzimidazole unit, to which a dialkyl group can be introduced. The resulting dialkyl-substituted 2H-benzimidazole unit could then be used as the electron acceptor.
In this paper, new conjugated polymers containing electron donor–acceptor pairs for OPV devices utilizing a new type of acceptor, dimethyl-2H-benzimidazole, are reported to show good solubility at room temperature in organic solvents. These donor–acceptor conjugated polymers were synthesized by Suzuki coupling of 2,2-dimethyl-4,7-di(2-thienyl)-2H-benzimidazole and donors including carbazole, 4H-cyclopenta[def]phenanthrene and fluorene. The new type of acceptor was fabricated in poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2,2-dimethyl-2H-benzimidazole)] (PCDTMBI), poly[2,6-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[def]phenanthrene)-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2,2-dimethyl-2H-benzimidazole)] (PCPPDTMBI) and poly[2,7-(9,9-bis(2-ethylhexyl)fluorene)-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2,2-dimethyl-2H-benzimidazole)] (PFDTMBI). The photovoltaic properties of these polymers were investigated by fabrication of the polymer solar cells with the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/TiOx/Al.

All reagents were purchased from Aldrich or TCI, and used without further purification. Solvents were purified by normal procedures and handled under a moisture-free atmosphere. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded with a Varian Gemini-300 (300 MHz) spectrometer and chemical shifts were recorded in ppm with TMS as the internal standard. Flash column chromatography was performed with Merck silica gel 60 (particle size 230–400 mesh ASTM) with ethyl acetate–hexane or methanol–dichloromethane gradients unless otherwise indicated. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was conducted using Merck 0.25 mm silica gel 60F pre-coated aluminium plates with fluorescent indicator UV254. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded on a JEOL JMS-700 mass spectrometer under electron impact (EI) or fast atom bombardment (FAB) conditions in the Korea Basic Science Institute. The molecular weight and polydispersity of the polymer were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis with a polystyrene standard calibration. The UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian 5E UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer, while an Oriel InstaSpec IV CCD detection system with a xenon lamp was used for the photoluminescence and electroluminescence spectra measurements. The AFM instrumentation consisted of a Veeco NanoScope AFM and standard silicon cantilever (Veeco: tip radius, 8 nm; normal spring constant, 21–78 N m−1; scan rate, 2.0 Hz) under ambient conditions (in air, 20 °C).

The FETs were fabricated on heavily doped n-type silicon wafers each covered with a thermally grown silicon dioxide layer with a thickness of 200 nm. The active layer was deposited by spin-coating at 2500 rpm. Prior to active layer deposition, SiO2 surfaces were treated with octyltrichlorosilane (OTS) to make surface hydrophobic. All solutions were 0.5 wt% in chlorobenzene. The thickness of the deposited films was about 60 nm. Prior to deposition of source drain electrodes, the films were dried on a hotplate (stabilized at 80 °C) for 30 min. All fabrication processes were carried out in the glove box filled with N2. Source and drain electrodes using Au were deposited by thermal evaporation using a shadow mask. The thickness of source and drain electrodes was 50 nm. The channel length (L) and channel width (W) were 50 μm and 1.5 mm, respectively. Electrical characterization was performed using a Keithley semiconductor parametric analyzer (Keithley 4200) under N2 atmosphere.
Solar cells were fabricated on an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate with the following structure; ITO-coated glass substrate/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)(PEDOT:PSS)/polymer:PC71BM/TiOx/Al. The ITO-coated glass substrate was first cleaned with detergent, ultrasonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and subsequently dried overnight in an oven. PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PH) was spin-cast from aqueous solution to form a film 40 nm thick. The substrate was dried for 10 min at 140 °C in air and then transferred into a glove-box to spin-cast the active layer. A solution containing a mixture of polymer:PC71BM (1:4) in dichlorobenzene with a concentration of 7 mg/ml was then spin-cast on top of the PEDOT/PSS layer. The film was dried for 60 min at 70 °C in the glove-box. The TiOx precursor solution diluted by 1:200 in methanol was spin-cast in air on top of the polymer:PC71BM layer (5000 rpm for 40 s). The sample was heated at 80 °C for 10 min in air. Then, an aluminium (Al, 100 nm) electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation in a vacuum of about 5 × 10−7 Torr. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit. Solar cell performance measurements utilized an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G) solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 1000 W m−2. An aperture (12.7 mm2) was used on top of the cell to eliminate extrinsic effects such as cross-talk, waveguiding, shadow effects etc. The spectral mismatch factor was calculated by comparison of the solar simulator spectrum with AM 1.5 spectrum at room temperature. The IPCE is a measure of the photon-to-electron conversion deficiency at a particular irradiation wavelength (eqn (1)).
IPCE = (1240 × JSC)/(λi × Pin)

Carefully purified 4,7-bis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-2,2-dimethyl-2H-benzimidazole (5) (440 mg, 0.89 mmol), 2,7-bis(4′,4′,5′,5′-tetramethyl-1′,3′,2′-dioxaborolan-2′-yl)-N-9′′-heptadecanylcarbazole (6) (583 mg, 0.89 mmol), and Pd(PPh3)4 (3 mol%) were dissolved in a mixture of toluene and aqueous 2 M Na2CO3 (3 mL). The mixture was refluxed with vigorous stirring for 3 days under argon atmosphere. After 72 h, phenylboronic acid was added to the reaction, followed 12 h later by bromobenzene. The reaction mixture was then refluxed overnight to complete the end-capping reaction. After cooling the mixture to room temperature, it was poured into methanol, and the precipitated material was recovered by filtration. The resulting solid material was reprecipitated using 100 mL of THF in 1.0 L of methanol several times to remove catalyst residues and to generate polymers. The yields of the polymers ranged from 40 to 60%. The resulting polymers were soluble in THF, CHCl3, ODCB and toluene.


This dark purple copolymer was prepared by a procedure similar to that for PCDTMBI, using 2-[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-6-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-4H-cyclopenta[def]phenanthren-2-yl]-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (7) as the monomer.


This dark purple copolymer was prepared by a procedure similar to that for PCDTMBI, using 9,9-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)fluorine (8) as the monomer


The general synthetic routes to the monomers and polymers are outlined in Scheme 1. In the first step, 3,6-dibromobenzene-1,2-diamine (1) was treated with acetone and acetic acid followed by MnO2 to generate 2,2-dimethyl-2H-benzimidazole (3), which was coupled with tributyl(2-thienyl)stannane by using dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) to give 2,2-dimethyl-4,7-di(2-thienyl)-2H-benzimidazole (4). Compound 4 was brominated by N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) to provide monomer 4,7-bis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-2,2-dimethyl-2H-benzimidazole (5). Compound 5, as the electron-accepting moiety, and 2,7-bis(4′,4′,5′,5′-tetramethyl-1′,3′,2′-dioxaborolan-2′-yl)-N-9′′-heptadecanylcarbazole (6), 2-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-6-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-4H-cyclopenta[def]phenanthren-2-yl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (7) and 9,9-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)fluorene (8), as electron-donating units, were co-polymerized by a Suzuki coupling reaction with Pd(0) as catalyst to yield PCDTMBI, PCPPDTMBI and PFDTMBI. The structures and purities of the monomers were confirmed by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and HRMS. PCDTMBI, PCPPDTMBI and PFDTMBI were soluble in various organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, THF, dichloromethane and o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB).


Table 1 summarizes the polymerization results including molecular weights, PDI (polydispersity index, Mw/Mn), and thermal stability of the copolymers. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of 28500, 15200 and 8100 and weight-average molecular weights (Mw) of 182000, 39800 and 12700 with PDI values of 6.4, 2.6 and 1.6 were determined by gel permission chromatography (GPC) for PCDTMBI, PCPPDTMBI and PFDTMBI, respectively. The thermal properties of the polymers were characterized by both differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The differential scanning calorimetry analysis was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere (50 mL min−1) on a DSC 822 instrument at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Thermal gravimetric analysis was performed with a Dupont 951 TGA instrument in a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to 600 °C. These copolymers showed good thermal stability with onset decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of 416, 409 and 398 °C, respectively, under nitrogen. The PCDTMBI showed good thermal stability with a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 137 °C, indicating the polymer chain has a crystalline conformation in the solid state. The glass transition temperatures of PCPPDTMBI and PFDTMBI were not within the range 30–250 °C. The high thermal stability of the resulting polymers prevents the deformation of the polymer morphology and is important for OPV applications.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in solution and as thin films are shown in Fig. 1 and summarized in Table 2. The solution was prepared using ODCB as a solvent and the thin film by spin-coating on quartz plates from the solution in ODCB. The solution of PCDTMBI has two absorption bands with maxima at 398 and 622 nm. The PCDTMBI thin film shows two broad absorption bands with peaks at 400 and 638 nm and an absorption onset at 756 nm, corresponding to a band gap of 1.64 eV. The maximum absorption peaks of PCPPDTMBI and PFDTMBI in ODCB solution appear at 385 & 602 nm and 388 & 609 nm, respectively. The maximum absorption peaks in solid thin films were at around 392 & 624 nm and 390 & 616 nm, respectively. The short-wavelength absorption peaks have been ascribed to a delocalized excitonic π–π* transition in the polymer chains, and the long-wavelength absorption peaks attributed to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the carbazole donor and the DTMBI acceptor. While the known PCDTBT, with benzothiadiazole acceptor, has low solubility, DTMBI unit of the new series provides high solubility of the polymer while keeping the coplanarity of the backbone.

The electrochemical properties of the polymer were determined from the bandgap (estimated from the absorption onset wavelength) and the HOMO energy level (estimated by cyclic voltammetry). The CV was performed with a solution of tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Bu4N+BF4−) (0.10 M) in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at room temperature. A platinum electrode (∼0.05 cm2) coated with a thin polymer film was used as the working electrode. Pt wire and a Ag/AgNO3 electrode were used as the counter and reference electrode, respectively. The energy level of the Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode (calibrated by the Fc/Fc+ redox system) was 4.8 eV below the vacuum level. The CV spectra are shown in Fig. 2, and the oxidation potentials derived from the onsets of electrochemical p-doping are summarized in Table 3. HOMO levels (in eV) were calculated according to the empirical formula EHOMO = −(Eoxonset + 4.8). The polymers, PCDTMBI, PCPPDTMBI and PFDTMBI, exhibited absorption onset wavelengths of 756, 747 and 754 nm in solid thin films, which correspond to bandgaps of 1.64, 1.66 and 1.64 eV, respectively. The electrochemical oxidation onsets of the polymers were estimated to be 0.67, 0.74 and 0.81 V, which correspond to HOMO energy levels of −5.47, −5.54 and −5.61 eV, respectively. The LUMO energy levels of the polymers can be calculated with the HOMO energy levels and optical band gaps. The LUMO energy levels of the polymers were thus determined to be −3.82, −3.88 and −3.97 eV. The reduction potential onsets of PCDTMBI, PCPPDTMBI and PFDTMBI are −1.14, −1.19 and −1.17 eV, respectively. The electrochemical bandgaps, calculated from cyclic voltammetry data, are about 1.84 to 1.98 eV, somewhat higher than the optical bandgaps estimated from the onset wavelengths of the absorption spectra.

Fig. 3 illustrates the energy levels of the polymers compared to that of PC71BM and the work functions of indium tin oxide (ITO), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), and aluminium used in OPV devices. The differences between the LUMO energy levels of the polymers (PCDTMBI, PCPPDTMBI and PFDTMBI) and PC71BM are 0.48, 0.42 and 0.33 eV, which are above the required 0.3 eV to overcome the exciton binding energy of polymer and ensure efficient electron transfer from donor to acceptor.

The field-effect carrier mobilities of the polymers were measured by fabricating thin-film field-effect transistors (FETs) using the top-contact geometry. To reduce photocurrent loss in OPVs, a carrier mobility higher than 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 is required for high-performance OPV devices.Fig. 4 shows the FET transfer characteristics of the polymer devices of the OTS-modified SiO2. Hole mobilities of the polymers were calculated from the transfer characteristics of the OFETs. The field-effect hole mobilities of PCDTMBI, PCPPDTMBI and PFDTMBI are 2.2 × 10−3, 3.9 × 10−5, and 7.5 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.

The photovoltaic cells were fabricated by spin-coating the BHJ films from ODCB solutions of PC71BM/polymers (Table 4). PC71BM, as the electron-accepting component, has been widely used in OPV devices. All copolymers were applied as donors to conventional BHJ-type OPV devices with PC71BM as the acceptor. Typical J–V characteristics of the devices with the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM(1:4)/TiOx/Al under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) are depicted in Fig. 5. The devices comprising PCPPDTMBI and PFDTMBI with PC71BM showed a VOC of 0.47 and 0.56 V, a JSC of 4.48 and 2.44 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.32 and 0.31, giving a power conversion efficiency of 0.67 and 0.42%, respectively. The device with a PCDTMBI:PC71BM blend demonstrated a VOC value of 0.65 V, a JSC value of 10.0 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.48, leading to an efficiency of 3.12%, a much better performance than other polymers. The incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the photovoltaic devices from polymer:PC71BM blends are presented in Fig. 6. The IPCE spectra of the polymers show maxima of 52.6% at 470 nm for PCDTMBI, 34.7% at 400 nm for PCPPDTMBI, and 11.9% at 480 nm for PFDTMBI. The enhanced efficiency of PCDTMBI results from the higher IPCE value between 400 and 700 nm and from the higher mobility (2.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) than with other polymers.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies of polymer blends (polymer:PC71BM = 1:4 w/w), obtained over a surface area of 5 × 5 μm2 using the tapping mode, revealed that the morphology of the polymer/PC71BM blend film exhibited very fine domains; no large phases can be seen in Fig. 7. The AFM image of PFDTMBI exhibited a typical amorphous morphology with crystalline domains, as shown in Fig. 7(a). In comparison with blended copolymers, PCPPDTMBI (0.83 nm) and PFDTMBI (0.98 nm), the solid film of blended PCDTMBI, had a rather uneven surface with a root-mean-square roughness of 1.25 nm.

Three new polymers, PCDTMBI, PCPPDTMBI and PFDTMBI, utilizing a new acceptor, dimethyl-2H-benzimidazole, were synthesized, and showed good solubility at room temperature in organic solvents. The advantage of dimethyl-2H-benzimidazole compared to the benzothiadiazole moiety of PCDTBT is to improve the solubility of the polymer while keeping the coplanarity of the backbone. The PCDTMBI thin film shows two broad absorption bands with peaks at 400 and 636 nm and an absorption onset at 756 nm, corresponding to a band gap of 1.64 eV. The oxidation onset of PCDTMBI was estimated to be 0.67 V, which corresponds to a HOMO energy level of −5.47 eV. The device fabricated with a PCDTMBI:PC71BM blend demonstrated VOC = 0.65 V, JSC = 10.0 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.48, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 3.12%.
