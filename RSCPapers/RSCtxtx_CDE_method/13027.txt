All-inorganic perovskite cesium lead triiodine (CsPbI3) is emerging as a promising thermally stable light absorber in flexible optoelectronic devices. However, the photoactive α-CsPbI3 only exists at a temperature higher than 310 °C and rapidly degrades to the undesired δ-CsPbI3 at room temperature. Here, a vacuum-assisted drying process is first developed to fabricate all-inorganic perovskite thin films at room temperature. The film morphology and photoelectric properties as well as the long-time stability are significantly improved compared to those of the reference film fabricated with annealing process. The flexible solar cells based on such room temperature processed films demonstrate a high power conversion efficiency of 11.47% with a small hysteresis. Moreover, the champion flexible cell also exhibits high air-stability and excellent flexibility. These results offer a new pathway for developing high-performance and cost-effective flexible optoelectronic devices.

Flexible thin film solar cells have attracted extensive attention as inexpensive power sources in numerous areas varying from portable and wearable indoor electronics to building-integrated photovoltaics. Many semiconductors such as amorphous Si, CuInxGa1−xSe2 (CIGS), and CdTe thin films have been explored as the light absorbers for flexible solar cells. However, the manufacturing processes of these materials usually require relatively high temperatures (>400 °C), which becomes a big challenge for the substrates and greatly limits their applications in flexible optoelectronic devices. In recent years, solar cells based on organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites (e.g. CH3NH3PbI3) have impressively progressed towards commercialization. The simple and low-cost fabrication procedure makes organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites very promising materials for flexible optoelectronic devices. Nevertheless, the instability might be caused by the volatility of the organic cations, which greatly limits the long-term practical applications of these organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites. In contrast, all-inorganic lead halide perovskites with inorganic Cs+ instead of organic cations tend to be more stable under thermal stress and also show great potential as light-harvesting materials. For example, cubic phase CsPbI3 (α-CsPbI3) with a band gap of 1.73 eV can efficiently absorb light over almost the entire visible region. Unfortunately, α-CsPbI3 only exists at temperatures above 310 °C and is structurally unstable under ambient conditions at room temperature. To obtain stable α-CsPbI3 at a lower temperature, several strategies have been developed, such as adding a small amount of hydroiodic acid into the precursor solution, applying solvents sequentially, and using a two dimensional (2D) EDAPbI4 perovskite. In our previous work, we doped Bi3+ into CsPbI3 and obtained a stable α-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 perovskite at room temperature and achieved a high conversion efficiency of 13.2% for the champion solar cell. All these aforementioned solution methods require an annealing process at 100–150 °C to remove the residual solvent and improve the crystallization. However, the black phase α-CsPbI3 is very sensitive to the annealing temperature and easily degrades to the undesired yellow phase δ-CsPbI3, resulting in a significant decrease in the device performance and process yield. In addition, the annealing process may hinder further fabrication of more complex devices, such as tandem solar cells.

Herein, we propose a vacuum-assisted drying approach to prepare black phase α-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 at room temperature for the flexible solar cells. Differing from the conventional solution method, our method does not require the additional annealing treatment. By adjusting the solvent in the precursor solution, α-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 films with intriguing morphological and photophysical properties have been obtained. Based on the room temperature prepared α-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 thin films, we constructed flexible solar cells on flexible PET substrates. The best device showed a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.47% and a similar stabilized PCE of up to 10.84%, which exceeded the values (8.27% and 7.57%) of the best cell fabricated with the annealing process under the same conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest PCE value reported for all-inorganic perovskite flexible solar cells so far. Meanwhile, our flexible solar cells also exhibited high stability and outstanding flexibility, retaining more than 95% of their original efficiency after 200 mechanical bending cycles. This work reveals the great potential for preparing high-quality all-inorganic perovskite films at room temperature to achieve high-performance and low-cost flexible optoelectronic devices, such as thin-film transistors, light-emitting diodes, solar cells, and photodetectors.

Bismuth iodide (BiI3, 99%), cesium iodide (CsI, 99.9%), lead iodide (PbI2, 99.9%), titanium diisopropoxidebis(acetylacetonate) (75% inisopropanol), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO, anhydrous, 99.8%) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous, 99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All salts and solvents were used as received without any further purification.


The CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 precursor solution was prepared by fully dissolving 0.01 mol CsI and 0.01 mol PbI2/BiI3 mixed powder (the mol ratios of BiI3 in the mixed powder is 4 mol%) in 10 mL of DMSO and DMF mixed solvent (the volume ratios of DMSO in the mixed solvent ranges from 0% to 100%) and stirred for 12 h at 70 °C.


15.63 g of titanium diisopropoxidebis(acetylacetonate) (75% inisopropanol) was mixed with 58 mL of deionized water and stirred for 1 h with a magnetic stirrer at 200 rpm. Sequentially, 0.8 mL of nitric acid (HNO3, 70%) was added to the solution, which was then stirred for 2 h at 80 °C. Then, the mixed solvents were dispersed in 75 mL of deionized water and then the solution wastransferred to an autoclave and held at 250 °C for 14 h. After cooling to room temperature naturally, reinjection of 0.48 mL of HNO3 to the dispersion followed by centrifugation at 7000 rpm was carried out and the precipitate washed with deionized water. The centrifugation and washing process was repeated three times before obtaining a titania nanoparticle dispersion with a concentration of 28 mg mL−1 in ethanol. The uniform dense TiO2 layer was deposited on the ITO-PET substrate by spin coating 0.15 mol L−1 titanium diisopropoxidebis(acetylacetonate) in butanol at 3500 rpm and repeating the process twice, and then sintering at 150 °C for 1 h. For comparison, the TiO2 compact layers were also prepared at high temperatures with a typical method.


The CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 films were spin coated on the substrate at 3500 rpm in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Sequentially, the spin coated perovskite films were dried at a reduced pressure in a sealed container (EdwardsRV12) for 15 min to remove the residual solvent and form the final films. For comparison, the pristine CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 (i.e., A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3) films were also prepared. The pristine CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 precursor solution was deposited with similar steps. After spin-coating, the A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 films were annealed on a hotplate at 100 °C for 10 min.


First, the indium tin oxide (ITO) conducting substrate (sheet resistance < 15 ohm per square) was ultrasonically cleaned using detergent, deionized water, and acetone for 20 min sequentially, and then treated with a UV/O3 cleaner for 15 min. Then, a uniform dense TiO2 layer was deposited on the substrate via a hydrothermal method similar to that previously reported. The prefabricated titania nanoparticles dispersion was spin coated at 2500 rpm for 45 s and then annealed at 150 °C for 1 h to achieve the low-temperature processed electron collection layer. Then the perovskite layer was deposited on PET/ITO/c-TiO2 by following the procedure mentioned above. Afterward, the final film was covered by the hole transporter spiro-MeOTAD. 0.167 g of spiro-MeOTAD was dissolved in 1.00 mL of chlorobenzene, 0.0103 g of LiTFSI and 0.0298 g of tert-butylpyridine (TBP) were used as additives and then the solution was deposited by spin-coating at 5500 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 100 nm thick Au electrode was deposited on top of the device by thermal evaporation under ca. 5 × 10−5 torr vacuum condition, through a shadow mask.


The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the all-inorganic perovskite films were recorded using a Bruker D8 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The IR spectra were measured using a Bruker Vertex80v Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The surface morphology and elemental compositions of the all-inorganic perovskite films were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; Quanta 250FEG) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out in a RBD upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA system (Perkin Elmer) with Mg Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV). The impedance measurements were carried out with a frequency analyzer module in the frequency range between 100 kHz and 0.05 Hz with an oscillating amplitude of 100 mV under dark conditions or 20 mV under constant illumination conditions (100 mW cm−2 light intensity). The absorption spectra of the prepared films were measured with a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu). The PL spectra of the films were obtained at room temperature by using a steady-state lifetime spectrofluorometer (Varian Cary Eclipse). The time-resolved photoluminescence decay of the perovskite film was measured using a Horiba Fluorolog-3 Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) system with an excitation wavelength at 460 nm. The current–voltage characteristic curves of the fabricated PSCs were measured under standard AM 1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm−2, WXS-90L2, Wacom). The effective area of the cell was defined as 0.09 cm2 using a non-reflective metal mask.


In order to prepare flexible devices, the α-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 thin films were deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) patterned polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates at room temperature. To achieve good adhesion, the PET substrate was treated using UV and ozone in advance. A uniform dense TiO2 layer was deposited on the PET substrate by a hydrothermal method. The surface of the conductive PET was fully covered by an anatase TiO2 layer, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI). Fig. 1a schematically shows the vacuum-assisted drying approach for preparing the high-quality α-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 thin film. The precursor solution of CsI, PbI2 and BiI3 in the mole ratio of 1:0.96:0.04 dissolved in a mixture of dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) was spin-coated on the TiO2 layer. Then, the as-deposited film was dried at a reduced pressure in a sealed container for 15 min at room temperature to form the black α-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 perovskite film (referred to as RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3). The infrared (IR) spectra of the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film and the controlled α-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film prepared via an optimized annealing process (referred to as A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3) were essentially identical (Fig. 1b) and have no characteristic peak of DMF and DMSO, confirming that no solvent remains in the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film prepared with the vacuum-assisted drying process. This approach efficiently avoids the heating process that could trigger a mismatch in thermal expansion between the perovskite layer and substrate and further induce undesired phase transformation. Moreover, the surface morphology of the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film was smoother and more uniform than that of the controlled A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film (Fig. 1c). The smooth surface of the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film was also observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. S2. The root-mean-squared (RMS) roughness of the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film was only 27.7 nm, much lower than that of the A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film (43.1 nm). The flat surface tends to form a tight interfacial contact that could promote interfacial charge transport. More importantly, from the SEM images, we observed that the average grain size of the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film was smaller than that of the controlled A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film (Fig. 1c). We further evaluated the average grain size by full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (110) peaks in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. The calculated results illustrated that the average grain size of the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film was about 60 nm, while that of the controlled A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film was about 190 nm (Table S1). According to previous reports, the grain size was of critical importance for the stabilization of α-CsPbI3 at low temperature. Thus, an enhanced long-term stability of the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film is expected.

The XRD pattern of the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film exhibited a typical cubic structure (Pmm) with three main peaks at 14.28°, 20.28° and 24.70° respectively assigned to the (100), (110) and (111) planes (Fig. 2a), demonstrating good crystallization of the cubic perovskite phase in the film. Compared to the A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film, we found the the intensity of (110) peak of the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film was significantly increased (Fig. S3a and Table S1), which also proved the improvement of crystallinity in the film. Nevertheless, for the A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film, a weak peak at 22.64° could be observed, belonging to the (112) plane of the orthorhombic (Pnma) crystal, which indicated the existence of the non-perovskite phase in the A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film. Interestingly, we found that the (110) peaks of these two types of films both split into two peaks (Fig. S3a), illustrating the presence of microstrain in the crystal lattice. Snaith et al. proposed that a slight microstrain in the crystal lattice is helpful to the stabilization of the black phase at lower temperatures. Thus, we further quantified the extent of microstrain in the films using Williamson–Hall analysis. As shown in Fig. S3b and Table S1, the minimum microstrain in the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film was calculated to be 5.25 × 10−3, which could be suitable for keeping the black phase “frozen” at room temperature. However, the microstrain in the A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film was much higher (1.8 × 10−2) and the excessive microstrain might accelerate the ion migration, thus leading to the degradation of the perovskite structure. During the conventional annealing process, nonhomogeneous heating or small temperature changes easily induce uneven volatilization of the residual solvent and non-uniform thermal stress, thus resulting in an uneven distribution of crystals and large microstrains within the crystal lattice. In our vacuum-assisted drying process, the residual solvent volatilizes uniformly under low pressure which facilitates the formation of uniform films with smooth surfaces.

The RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film also showed slightly enhanced light absorption compared to the A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film (Fig. 2b), further implying higher content of the perovskite phase in the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film. Moreover, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra showed a much stronger PL intensity of the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film (Fig. 2c), indicating fewer traps and defects within the film. This will be more advantageous to the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film for light harvesting and charge separation in optoelectronic devices. To investigate the dynamics of charge recombination within the films, the lifetime of photo-excited carriers was measured by time-resolved photoluminescence along with the single-exponential decay function fitted curves. As shown in Fig. S4, the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film showed a long exponential PL decay tail with a time constant above 9.55 ns, almost 2.5 times longer than the short-lived traces of the A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film (3.93 ns), suggesting a longer charge diffusion length in the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film. It was in good agreement with a significant reduction of non-radiative recombination in the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film owing to the improved crystallinity and reduced defect density. We further assembled the films into complete devices with a structure of PET-ITO/c-TiO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au and performed the electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) to study the electrical properties of the interfaces. The devices were measured under constant illumination condition with an AC bias voltage of 20 mV. The frequency (ω) was swept from 0.05 Hz to 100 kHz. As shown in Fig. 2d, there are two semicircles in the Nyquist plot. The first semicircle represents the charge transfer at the interface of the c-TiO2/perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite, and the second represents the charge recombination at the interface of the aforementioned perovskites. Compared to the device based on the A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film, the device based on the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film exhibited a decreased charge transport (RCT) resistance and an increased charge recombination resistance (Fig. 2d and Table S2). This may be attributed to the much lower defect density stemming from the good crystallization and the significantly improved morphology of the film.

To evaluate the moisture tolerance of the films, the samples were kept in a constant temperature–humidity chamber at 50% RH and 25 °C for 24 h. In the case of the A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film, the color gradually changed to orange-red and the corresponding absorbance gradually decreased and finally degraded completely only within 24 h (Fig. S5a), while in the meantime the color of RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 has no visible change and the absorbance did not change obviously (Fig. S5b). The higher air-stability of the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film might be due to the lower defect density and smoother surface of the film. To further reveal the effect of microstrain on the stability, we compare the XRD patterns changing with time for the cubic RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film and the corresponding scraped RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 powder with lower microstrain (Fig. S6a). In the case of the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film, the color gradually changed suggesting that the black phase perovskite converted to the non-perovskite phase, while no obvious change in color of the scraped powder of RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 (Fig. S6b) was observed. Moreover, there was also no obvious change in the XRD patterns of the scraped powder of RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 after 7 days (Fig. S6d), while the peaks corresponding to the non-perovskite phase started to appear in the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film (Fig. S6c) and almost completely degraded to the non-perovskite phase after 15 days. The higher air-stability of the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 powder with lower strain further indicated the degradation of the black cubic CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 films due to the unsuitable residual strain in the film.

To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the devices based on the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film, we fabricated regular architecture planar solar cells on the flexible PET substrates, as shown in Fig. 3a. In the completed device, the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film was pinhole free with a thickness of about 350 nm. In contrast, we could observe some voids in the A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 layer from the cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. S7), which would significantly reduce the cell’s performance. Fig. 3b shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the flexible RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 device under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination. The champion RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 device achieved a high power conversion efficiency of 11.34%, with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 14.93 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.04 V, and fill factor (FF) of 73.05% in the forward scan direction, and an efficiency of 11.47% with a Jsc of 15.11 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.05 V, and FF of 72.32% in the reverse scan direction. Maximum power point tracking gave a stabilized current density of 12.61 mA cm−2 and corresponding to a stabilized efficiency of 10.84% (Fig. 3c). In contrast, the controlled A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 device exhibited an obvious hysteresis in the J–V curves (Fig. S8a and Table S3) and the stabilized output of the controlled A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 device was only 7.57% (Fig. S8b). As shown in Fig. 3d and S8c, the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 device also exhibited a higher external quantum efficiency (EQE) than the controlled A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 device. The integral current density over the full EQE spectrum was calculated to be 14.87 mA cm−2, which was very close to the Jsc that was obtained from the J–V curve. As the reproducibility of conversion efficiency has been a concern of the scientific community, we further measured 30 cells prepared in 5 batches. The statistical distributions of the photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE) of these cells are shown in Fig. S8d. The RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 devices exhibited a higher average PCE of 10.42% with better reproducibility while the controlled A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 cells only have an average PCE of 7.50%. The enhancement in PCE of the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 device was mainly due to the significant increase of Jsc and FF, which greatly relay on the enhanced photoelectric properties of the film.

Besides the high conversion efficiency, the long-term stability of the perovskite solar cells is also highly desired for industrial applications. We performed ageing tests on the RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 and A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 devices without encapsulation under ambient conditions with humidity of 30% at 25 °C. As shown in Fig. 3e and S9, the unsealed RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 device still maintained 67.57% of its initial efficiency after 100 h. On the contrary, the efficiency of the controlled A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 device rapidly reduced to almost zero only after 20 h, meanwhile, the color of the cell changed from black to yellow, which could be attributed to the transformation of the photoactive black perovskite phase to the photoinactive yellow phase. According to previous reports the degradation of the black cubic CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 films is mainly due to the large grain size and residual strain in the perovskite films. Our RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film prepared at room temperature not only simultaneously improves the crystal quality and reduces the grain size, but also reduces the residual strain in the perovskite films, thereby leading to significantly enhanced stability of the thin film and device. Additionally, we found that the conversion effiency and stability of the devices based-on A-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 were slightly lower than our previous reports, which is mainly due to the different substrates used in the devices.
Bending stability is a very important factor affecting the suitability of flexible photovoltaic devices for many practical applications, such as portable electronic devices. We performed bending tests of the flexible RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 device with different bending radii of curvature (∞, 6.5 mm, 4.5 mm and 2.0 mm) during one bending cycle (Fig. S10a). As shown in Fig. S10b, the photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE) remained nearly unchanged under the four different bending states, revealing excellent flexibility of the flexible RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 device under the external bending stress. To further examine the effect of bending cycles on the photovoltaic performance of the device, we measured the flexible device for 200 bending cycles (flat-bending-flat) at one bending radii of 4.5 mm, as shown in Fig. 4a. As presented in Fig. 4b, the photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE) were only marginally reduced during the bending tests, indicating its excellent operational stability during the repetitive bending test.

In our vacuum-assisted drying approach, the solubility and boiling point of the solvent greatly affected the quality of the produced all-inorganic perovskite films. The mixed solvents have better balance between the solubility and volatility. We systematically investigated the influence of solvents with different DMSO concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 1 mL of DMSO) in 1 mL of DMF and DMSO mixed solvent. The photographs of these different perovskite precursor solutions are showed in Fig. S11. The precursor solutions became more and more homogeneous with the increase of DMSO in the mixed solvent, due to the large solubility of the inorganic salts in DMSO. During the process of spin coating, the color of the films changed from orange red to light brown. Then, the film rapidly turned to dark brown with the assistance of low-vacuum process, indicating the rapid crystallization of the black α-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 phase. The IR spectra of all these RT-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 films indicated no residual solvent in the films (Fig. S12). The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results demonstrated these films were stoichiometrically related to the elemental compositions (Fig. S13) and the component elements were uniformly distributed in the films (Fig. S14a). The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) further confirmed the elemental compositions of these films (Fig. S14b and Table S4) and the overview spectra of the α-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 films and the photoemission of Bi 4d and Bi 4f clearly demonstrated the existence of Bi in the CsPbI3 lattice and the oxidation state of Bi in the α-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 films is +3. The SEM images indicated that surface of these films became increasingly uniform and compact with the amount of DMSO increasing to 0.2 mL, then the surface of the films started getting worse when the amount of DMSO increased in the mixed solvent, as shown in Fig. 5a. This indicated that DMSO plays a subtle role in regulating the crystallization of CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 for better film morphology. Therefore, it is very important to adjust the amount of DMSO in the precursor solution when using our vacuum-assisted drying approach. To further evaluate the effect of DMSO on the CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 crystal, we performed XRD measurements of these films. As shown in Fig. 5b, there are typical peaks of the yellow phase in the XRD spectrum of the CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 film prepared with pure DMF as the solvent. The peaks of the yellow phase disappeared completely when the concentration of DMSO in the mixed solvent exceeded 10 vol%. Nevertheless, when the concentration of DMSO was higher than 30 vol%, another impurity phase of Cs4PbI6 was formed in the film. Furthermore, we found that when the DMSO concentration was 20 vol%, the intensity of the (110) peak of the black phase α-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 perovskite was the strongest among these films (Fig. S15a). The corresponding FWHM of the black phase was also large (Fig. S15b), indicating a very small average grain size in the film. In addition, we observed the (110) peaks of all of these α-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 films split into two peaks, suggesting the presence of microstrain in the crystal lattice. We further quantified the extent of the microstrain in these films and found that the strain was greatly reduced in the film prepared with 20 vol% DMSO in the mixed solvent (Fig. S16). According to recent reports, the small grain size in the film prepared with 20 vol% DMSO might originate from the high wetting capability of the precursor solution on the substrate. We further measured the contact angles of the precursor solutions with different solvents on the substrates. As shown in Fig. S17, smaller contact angles are observed for the precursor solution with the mixed solvent. Such a strong wetting capability incorporated with the rapid volatilization of DMF could efficiently reduce the nucleation barrier and increase the nucleation sites, leading to the fast nucleation of the perovskites whichtransform small grains into a continuous film.

The variation of DMSO in the mixed solvent did not result in any obvious changes to the optical properties of the films. As shown in Fig. 5c, the absorption spectra are essentially identical for the films prepared with the mixed solvent. However, we noticed that the film prepared with 20 vol% DMSO in the mixed solvent exhibited an enhanced absorption, which was in good agreement with the local amplification of the PL spectra as shown in Fig. S18a. Nevertheless, the film prepared with 20 vol% DMSO in the mixed solvent shows a much stronger PL intensity indicating fewer traps and defects within the film, which is also corresponding with the results of the XRD data. The EIS spectra showed that the charge transport resistance of the film prepared with 20 vol% DMSO in the mixed solvent was the lowest (Fig. S18b and Table S5). The J–V characteristics shown in Fig. 5d exhibit the photovoltaic performance of the cells which greatly depend on the solvent in the precursor solution. The Jsc and FF are much larger in the cells prepared with mixed solvents (Table S6). Particularly, a champion efficiency was achieved in the cell prepared with 20 vol% DMSO in the precursor solution. We noted that the increase of Jsc in the cells prepared with the mixed solvent compared to the cell prepared with pure DMSO did not match with the very similar absorption spectra of the corresponding films. This may be due to the different electron transport in the films induced by the obviously distinct film quality (Fig. 5).

In summary, we have demonstrated the fabrication of high-quality all-inorganic α-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 perovskite films at room temperature for the first time. By adjusting the components of the solvent and combining a rapid vacuum-assisted drying process, we were able to obtain α-CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 perovskite films with high crystallinity and uniform surface and fabricate flexible solar cells with high conversion efficiencies (best PCE of 11.47% and average PCE of 10.42%) and improved environmental stability. The champion flexible solar cell also exhibits excellent stability and reliability in the situation of bending under different radii of curvature and retaining more than 95% of its original value after 200 mechanical bending cycles. To the best of our knowledge, the device performance reported here is among the best for flexible all-inorganic perovskite solar cells. This room-temperature processed method paves a promising way for preparing high-quality all-inorganic perovskite films for achieving high-performance and low-cost flexible optoelectronic devices.
