An alternative D–A copolymer of a dithienosilole (DTS) donor unit and a fluorinated-benzotriazole (FBTA) acceptor unit with a thiophene π-bridge, PDTS-DTFBTA, was designed and synthesized, for application as a donor material in polymer solar cells (PSCs). PSCs based on PDTS-DTFBTA:PC70BM (1:1, w/w) with thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min showed a PCE of 3.93% with a Voc of 0.64 V, which is slightly improved in comparison with its analogous polymer (PDTS-DTBTA) without the fluorine substitution. By using indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) instead of PC70BM as acceptor, the PCE was improved to 4.99% with a high Voc of 0.85 V. PDTS-DTFBTA is the first reported fluorinated D–A copolymer which shows improved photovoltaic performance with ICBA as acceptor compared to PCBM.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have drawn great attentions as a promising technology for renewable energy in recent years, because of their advantages of simple device structure, low cost, light weight, and easy large-area fabrication on flexible substrates. The key point of the studies of PSCs is increasing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) by developing new low band gap polymer donors, new fullerene derivative acceptors and new interface modification layers.

In the molecular design of polymer donor and fullerene acceptor photovoltaic materials for higher efficiency PSCs, there are several factors which should be considered, including (i) broad absorption with high absorption coefficient in the visible-near infrared region, (ii) good matching of electronic energy levels between the donor and acceptor materials, i.e., the LUMO and HOMO of the donor should be higher than the corresponding energy levels of the acceptor by at least 0.3–0.5 eV for efficient charge separation at the donor–acceptor interface, and the energy difference between the LUMO level of the acceptor and the HOMO level of the donor should be as large as possible to get higher open circuit voltage (Voc); (iii) high and balanced hole mobility of the donor phase and electron mobility of the acceptor phase in the active layer; and (iv) capability to self-assemble into a nanoscale bicontinuous interpenetrating network in the BHJ blend of the donor and acceptor to enable efficient charge separation and charge transportation. For conjugated polymer donor materials, a planar molecular structure, broad absorption, and lower HOMO energy levels are very important to meet the above mentioned requirements. Substitution by electron-withdrawing groups and donor (D)–acceptor (A) copolymerization are efficient approaches to broaden the absorption and downward-shift of the HOMO energy levels of the conjugated polymer. In the electron withdrawing substituents, fluorine atom substitution, as the smallest electron withdrawing group in size, is ideal in downward-tuning the HOMO energy levels without disturbing the planar molecular structure of the conjugated polymers. In particular, the D–A copolymers of benzodithiophene (BDT) and fluorine substituted benzotriazole showed high hole mobility and high photovoltaic performance, insensitive to the active layer thickness until the thickness is thicker than 400 nm.
Dithienosilole (DTS) is one of the most important donor units used in high efficiency conjugated D–A copolymer donor photovoltaic materials. In previous work, we synthesized D–A copolymers of DTS and benzotriazole (BTA) with and without a thiophene π-bridge, PDTS-DTBTA and PDTS-BTA. PDTS-DTBTA with a thiophene π-bridge between the DTS donor unit and DTA acceptor unit showed broader and stronger absorption, higher hole mobility and improved photovoltaic performance in comparison with PDTS-BTA without a thiophene π-bridge. Here, to further improve the photovoltaic performance of the D–A copolymer, we synthesized a new D–A copolymer of DTS and fluorine substituted BTA with a thiophene π-bridge, PDTS-DTFBTA, as shown in Scheme 1. Compared to PDTS-DTBTA,PDTS-DTFBTA with two fluorine atoms substituted on the benzotriazole (BTA) unit demonstrated a lower HOMO energy level (by ca. 0.09 eV), as expected, which is beneficial for a higher Voc of the PSCs based on the polymer as donor. The PSCs based on PDTS-DTFBTA/PC70BM demonstrated a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.93% with Voc = 0.64 V, under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2. Interestingly, the PCE of the PSCs based on PDTS-DTFBTA was improved greatly when indene–C60 bisadduct (ICBA) was used as acceptor instead of PC70BM, which reached 4.99% with a high Voc of 0.85 V. ICBA and its corresponding C70 derivative IC70BA possess 0.17–0.19 eV higher LUMO energy levels than PCBM, and displayed excellent photovoltaic performance with higher Voc when they are used as acceptors blended with the polymer donor of P3HT and other polythiophene derivatives such as poly(3-pentylthiophene) (P3PT) and two-dimension-conjugated polythiophenes. However, most D–A copolymer donor materials show poorer photovoltaic performance when using ICBA as acceptor, except for two recently reported D–A copolymers based on dithienosilole and thiazolothiazole and based on thienothiophene and bithiazole which show improved photovoltaic performance with ICBA as acceptor compared to PCBM. Considering the importance of the application of the new acceptor ICBA on the high efficiency D–A copolymers to further increase the Voc and PCE, it is very important to find more D–A copolymer examples which match with ICBA, for designing high efficiency D–A copolymer donor materials.

The chemical structure and synthetic route of PDTS-DTFBTA are depicted in Scheme 1. Monomer 1 and monomer 2 were synthesized according to the methods described in the literature, and the polymer was synthesized by Stille coupling reaction. PDTS-DTFBTA is soluble in chlorinated solvents, such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene and chloroform, and exhibits a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 6.3 K, with a polydispersity index of 1.94, which is determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis with a polystyrene standard calibration. The thermal stability of the polymer was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown in Fig. S1 in ESI. The TGA analysis reveals that the onset temperature with 5% weight-loss (Td) of PDTS-DTFBTA is 439 °C, which indicates that the thermal stability of the copolymer is good enough for application in optoelectronic devices.



Fig. 1a shows the absorption spectra of PDTS-DTFBTA solution in chloroform and film on quartz plate, together with the absorption spectrum of PDTS-DTBTA film for comparison. It can be seen that PDTS-DTFBTA demonstrates a broad absorption band both in solution and in solid film with absorption maxima at 566 nm for the polymer solution and at 577 nm for the polymer film. The absorption in solid state is red shifted by 11 nm compared with that of the polymer solution. In comparison with the absorption spectrum of PDTS-DTBTA film, PDTS-DTFBTA film displayed a similar absorption spectrum, but a stronger shoulder peak at ca. 630 nm, indicating that the fluorine substitution in PDTS-DTFBTA results in stronger interchain interactions in the polymer films. The XRD pattern of PDTS-DTFBTA displayed a stronger peak at 2θ = 5.34°, as shown in Fig. S2 in ESI. The XRD diffraction peak at 2θ = 5.34° corresponds to an interchain d-spacing of 16.6 Å, which indicates that there is some ordered structure in the PDTS-DTFBTA film.

The absorption spectra of the blend films of PDTS-DTFBTA:PC70BM and PDTS-DTFBTA:ICBA with a weight ratio of 1:1 were compared in Fig. 1b. The absorption spectrum of the PDTS-DTFBTA:PC70BM film is stronger than that of the PDTS-DTFBTA:ICBA film in the range of 350–550 nm (see Fig. 1b) because of the stronger absorption of PC70BM in this region.
Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry has been widely employed to investigate the electrochemical behavior of the polymers and estimate its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels.Fig. 2a shows the cyclic voltammogram (CV) of the PDTS-DTFBTA film on Pt disk electrode in 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6 acetonitrile solution. The onset reduction potential (φred) of PDTS-DTFBTA is −1.48 V vs. Ag/Ag+, while the onset oxidation potential (φox) is 0.43 V vs. Ag/Ag+. From the values of φred and φox of the polymer, the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of PDTS-DTFBTA were calculated to be −3.23 and −5.14 eV, respectively, according to the equations of LUMO = −e(φred + 4.71) (eV) and HOMO = −e(φox + 4.71) (eV). The HOMO energy level of PDTS-DTFBTA is lower than that (−5.05 eV) of PDTS-DTBTA due to the double fluorine substitution.
The electronic energy level diagrams of the two different donor and acceptor materials were displayed in Fig. 2b. The HOMO energy levels of PDTS-DTBTA and PDTS-DTFBTA are −5.05 and −5.14 eV, respectively. The lower HOMO energy level of PDTS-DTFBTA is desirable for its application as a donor in PSCs to get a higher Voc. In addition, compared to PC70BM, the higher LUMO energy level of ICBA could also result in a higher Voc of the PSCs because the Voc is usually proportional to the difference between the LUMO level of the acceptor and the HOMO level of the donor.

The photovoltaic properties of PDTS-DTFBTA were studied by fabricating bulk heterojunction PSCs with the device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PDTS-DTFBTA:acceptor/Ca/Al. Here, two different fullerene derivatives, PC70BM and ICBA, were used as acceptors in the PSCs. Fig. 3a shows the J–V curves of the PSCs based on PDTS-DTFBTA and PC70BM under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2. The PSCs with varied weight ratios (PDTS-DTFBTA:PC70BM from 1:1 to 1:2) in the active layer were investigated, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Table 1. Optimized performances were achieved with a PDTS-DTFBTA:PC70BM weight ratio of 1:1, and the optimized devices annealed at 120 °C for 10 min show an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.64 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 9.65 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 63.7%, giving a PCE of 3.93%. The efficiency of 3.93% is slightly improved over that (3.80%) of the PSC device based on PDTS-DHBTA. Increasing the PC70BM content to the weight ratios of 1:1.5 and 1:2 resulted in a decrease of the Jsc and PCE values of the PSCs, as shown in Fig. 3a. The performance decrease could be due to the reduction of the polymer donor content, which results in the reduction of absorption and unbalanced hole–electron transportation of the active layer.

It should be mentioned that although the HOMO energy level of PDTS-DHFBTA is 0.09 eV lower than that of PDTS-DHBTA, the Voc of 0.64 V for the PSCs based on PDTS-DHFBTA is only 0.01 V higher than that (0.63 V) of the device based on PDTS-DHBDT. The Voc value of the PSCs based on PDTS-DHFBTA is lower than that expected from the lower HOMO energy level of PDTS-DHFBTA which could be limited by a relatively higher carrier recombination rate at the polymer–fullerene interface. A similar phenomenon has been observed by Wang et. al. The relatively higher concentration of the terminal end group (structural defects) brought about by its low molecular weight Mn of 6.3 K for PDTS-DTFBTA could serve as charge carrier traps and is a possible reason for boosting the charge recombination.
To further improve the photovoltaic properties of the PSCs based on PDTS-DTFBTA, we tried to use ICBA instead of PC70BM as acceptor. ICBA possesses a higher LUMO level than PCBM, which leads to a higher Voc and PCE of the PSCs based on P3HT. The J–V curves of the PSCs based on PDTS-DTFBTA/ICBA are shown in Fig. 3b, and the detailed photovoltaic results are also listed in Table 1. Compared with the PC70BM-based devices, it can be seen that the PSC based on PDTS-DTFBTA:ICBA (1:1, w/w) with thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min demonstrated a significantly higher Voc of 0.85 V and a high PCE of 4.99%. In comparison with the PSCs based on PDTS-DTFBTA:PC70BM (1:1, w/w) with thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min, Voc is increased by 35% from 0.64 to 0.85 V, the fill factor (FF) is improved from 63.7% to 67.6%, and the PCE is increased by 27% from 3.93% to 4.99%. The increase of Voc benefits from the higher LUMO energy level of ICBA, and the higher PCE resulting from the increased Voc and improved FF. Nevertheless, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the PSC with ICBA as acceptor is slightly decreased from 9.65 mA cm−2 for the PSC with PC70BM as acceptor to 8.69 mA cm−2, probably due to the weak visible absorption of ICBA than PC70BM and the enhanced recombination caused by the structural defects of the polymer end group.
The thermal annealing played an important role in the improvement of the photovoltaic properties of the PSCs based on PDTS-DTFBTA:ICBA (1:1, w/w). Without the thermal treatment, the PCE of the device is only 2.7% with a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 6.09 mA cm−2, and a FF of 54.1%. After thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min, the Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE were all improved to 0.85 V, 8.69 mA cm−2, 67.6% and 4.99% respectively. By annealing, higher photovoltaic parameters of the PDTS-DTFBTA:ICBA devices were obtained, and the PCE of the devices was improved from 2.7% to 4.99%.
External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PSCs based on PDTS-DTFBTA:PC70BM (or ICBA) are shown in Fig. 4. The PDTS-DTFBTA:PC70BM device showed a high photoconversion efficiency with a peak EQE value of over 60%, which agrees with the high Jsc of the devices. The PSC based on PDTS-DTFBTA:PC70BM displayed higher EQE values than that of device based on PDTS-DTFBTA:ICBA in the region of 350 to 550 nm, which could be ascribed to the stronger absorption of PC70BM in the wavelength region. In addition, the effect of thermal annealing on the PSCs based on PDTS-DTFBTA:ICBA was also confirmed from the EQE measurements. The EQE spectra of the device without thermal annealing showed obviously lower EQE values, which is consistent with the lower Jsc of the corresponding PSCs.

The morphology of the photoactive layer is also very important for the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate the morphology of the blend films of PDTS-DTFBTA:PC70BM and PDTS-DTFBTA:ICBA without and with thermal treatment, as shown in Fig. 5. The film smoothness is an important factor affecting the device performance because a smooth surface induces better contact with the electrode. At the same 1:1 blend ratio, the PDTS-DTFBTA:PC70BM blend film showed a smoother surface compared to the PDTS-DTFBTA:ICBA blend films, the root mean square (RMS) roughness is 1.61 nm for PDTS-DTFBTA:PC70BM, and 3.01 and 2.44 nm for PDTS-DTFBTA:ICBA without and with thermal treatment, respectively. In comparison with the blend films of PDTS-DTFBTA:ICBA without and with thermal treatment, the blend film with thermal annealing displayed a smoother surface with the roughness decreased from 3.01 to 2.44 nm. The smaller roughness of the blend films of PDTS-DTFBTA:ICBA with thermal treatment indicates that the domain size of the phase separation of the donor–acceptor interpenetrating network could be reduced and the morphology is improved after the thermal treatment, which should be beneficial for the exciton charge separation and charge transportation.

Hole mobilities of the blend films of PDTS-DTFBTA:PC70BM and PDTS-DTFBTA:ICBA were measured by the space charge limit current (SCLC) method, as shown in Fig. S3 in ESI. The PDTS-DTFBTA:ICBA blend film demonstrated a hole mobility of 2.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is two times higher than that (1.07 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) of the PDTS-DTFBTA:PC70BM blend film.

A new D–A copolymer PDTS-DTFBTA containing a dithienosilole (DTS) donor unit, a fluorine substituted-benzotriazole (FBTA) acceptor unit and a thiophene π-bridge between them, was synthesized. The fluorine substitution makes the HOMO energy level of the polymer down-shift by ca. 0.09 eV, and enhanced the interchain interactions of the polymer. PSCs based on PDTS-DTFBTA:PC70BM (1:1, w/w) with thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min showed a PCE of 3.93% with a Voc of 0.64 V, which is slightly improved in comparison with PDTS-DTBTA without fluorine substitution. By using ICBA instead of PC70BM as acceptor, the PCE was increased to 4.99% with a high Voc of 0.85 V. PDTS-DTFBTA is another D–A copolymer which shows improved photovoltaic performance with ICBA as acceptor compared to PCBM.


All chemicals and solvents were of reagent grade and were purchased from Aldrich, Alfa Aesar and TCI Chemical Co., respectively. Toluene, tetrahydrofuran, and diethyl ether were distilled to keep anhydrous before use. The other solvents were degassed by nitrogen 1 h prior to use, unless otherwise stated.


All new compounds were characterized by 1H-NMR spectra which were measured on a Bruker DMX-400 spectrometer. Chemical shifts of the 1H-NMR were reported in ppm relative to the singlet of CDCl3 at 7.26 ppm. Splitting patterns were designated as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), m (multiplet), and br (broad). The molecular weight of the polymers was measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and polystyrene was used as a standard. Absorption spectra were taken on a Hitachi U-3010 UV-vis spectrophotometer. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was conducted on a Zahner IM6e Electrochemical Workstation. The morphology of the blend films was observed by an atomic force microscope (AFM) (NanoMan VS, Veeco, USA) in contact mode. X-ray diffraction patterns of the pristine polymer thin films were measured using a Rigaku D/MAX 2500 V/PC diffractometer operated in grazing incidence mode.

Hole mobility was measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with a hole-only device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PEDOT:PSS/Ag (100 nm). The reported mobility data are average values over two cells of each sample at a given film composition.

PSCs were fabricated with ITO glass as the positive electrode, Ca/Al as the negative electrode and the blend film of the polymers–fullerene derivatives between them as a photosensitive layer. The ITO glass was precleaned and modified by a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS which was spin-cast from a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (Clevios P VP AI 4083H. C. Stark, Germany) on the ITO substrate, and the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer is about 40 nm. The photosensitive layer was prepared by spin-coating a blend solution of polymer and PC70BM (or ICBA) in o-dichlorobenzene on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode. Then the Ca/Al cathode was deposited on the polymer layer by vacuum evaporation under 3 × 10−5 Pa. The thickness of the photosensitive layer is ca. 90 nm, measured on an Ambios Tech. XP-2 profilometer. The effective area of one cell is 4 mm2. The current–voltage (I–V) measurements of the devices were conducted on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit. A xenon lamp with an AM 1.5 filter was used as the white light source, and the optical power at the sample was around 100 mW cm−2.


The monomers 4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-5,5′-bis (trimethyltin)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (1) and 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2-(2-octyl)-5,6-difluoro-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (2) were synthesized according to the procedure in the literature. The synthetic route for poly{4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole-5,5′-diyl-alt-4,7-di(thien-2-yl)-2-octyl-5,6-difluoro-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole-5,5′-diyl} (PDTS-DTFBTA) is shown in Scheme 1. The detailed synthetic process is as follows. Under the protection of an argon atmosphere, 0.5 mmol of 1 was put into a two-neck flask. Then 12 ml of degassed toluene and 0.5 mmol of 2 were added to the mixture. The solution was flushed with argon for 10 min, and then 25 mg of Pd(PPh3)4 was added. After another flushing with argon for 20 min, the reactant was heated to reflux for 12 h. Then the reactant was cooled to room temperature and the polymer was precipitated by adding 200 ml of methanol, filtered through a Soxhlet thimble, and then subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, and chloroform. The polymer was recovered as a solid from the chloroform fraction by rotary evaporation. The solid was dried under vacuum for 12 h. The yield of the polymerization reaction was about 56%. GPC: Mw = 12.2 kg mol−1, Mn = 6.3 kg mol−1, Mw/Mn = 1.94. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3), δ(ppm): 8.02 (br, 2H), 7.33–7.09 (m, 2H), 4.76 (s, 2H), 2.46 (m, 4H), 1.81–1.21 (m, 40H), 1.01–0.83 (m, 12H).
