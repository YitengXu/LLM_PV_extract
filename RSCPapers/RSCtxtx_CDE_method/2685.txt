The development of nonfullerene acceptors has accelerated the improvement in the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of polymer solar cells (PSCs) in the past five years. However, synthetic accessibility without organostannanes is of great importance in the commercial application of PSCs. In this work, a ligand-free direct heteroarylation approach was introduced to realize high efficiency simple small molecular nonfullerene acceptors. More specifically, two simple A–D–A′–D–A type nonfullerene acceptors BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F with benzodithiophenedione (BDD) as the core moiety were synthesized in three steps without any hazardous organostannanes or any ligands. Despite the different lengths of side chains on the BDD, the simple fused-ring acceptors BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F exhibit very similar optical properties and energy levels. With PM6 as the donor, BDDEH-4F with 2-ethylhexyl side chains exhibits a much higher PCE of 12.59% and larger short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.57 mA cm−2 because the more balanced carrier mobilities and suitable phase separation result in favorable morphology compared to that of BDDBO-4F with longer alkyl side chains (PCE of 9.80%). Our results indicate that facile direct heteroarylation is an attractive approach to achieve high performance cost-effective nonfullerene solar cells.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on bulk-heterojunction morphology have attracted widespread attention owing to their multiple advantages, such as light weight, mechanical flexibility, semitransparency, and solution processability. In the past five years, the nonstop development in nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) has accelerated the steady surge in the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of state-of-the-art PSCs, owing to their various advantages including good light-harvesting ability, broad absorption in the visible region, adjustable energy level, etc. The breakthrough structural design of acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) or A–DA′D–A architectures mainly depends on the use of polyheterocyclic fused-ring units, such as indacenodithiophene (IDT), indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT), thienothiophen[3,2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole or thienothiophen[3,2-b]-pyrrolo benzotriazole. These nonfullerene acceptors with a large central polyheterocyclic core (typically 5–9 membered fused rings) can show enhanced intermolecular and intramolecular interactions, which are beneficial for a narrow bandgap, high electron mobility, and thus high photovoltaic performances with a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 18%. However, tedious synthesis, multi-step purification, and the use of hazardous organostannane reagents are often observed, an indication that green preparation requirements have not yet been met (Fig. S1).

Developing novel NFAs with a simple molecular structure and synthesis using facile processes with weakly toxic reagents are undoubtedly of significant importance. Relative to the core moieties of 5–9 membered fused rings, nonfullerene acceptors only based on 2 or 3 membered heterocycles can be considered as simple fused-ring molecules (SFAs, also named nonfused or unfused-ring acceptors in some previous studies), due to the easy accessibility. It should be noted that the simple fused-ring strategy for nonfullerene acceptors has become quite appealing only in the past two years. Chen et al. carried out the pioneering work on SFAs. Usually, SFAs can maintain good planarity and strong molecular interaction, ascribed to the multiple lock conformation of diverse noncovalent interactions (typically, S⋯O, O⋯H, F⋯H, etc.). So far, SFAs based on A–D–D′–D–A and A–D–A′–D–A type structures have been studied (the relevant parameters of PSCs are listed in Table S1). It should be pointed out that the device efficiency based on SFA molecule BTzO-4F has recently been improved to 13.80% by Huang's group. Thus the simple chemical structure of SFAs would be very promising if green synthetic chemistry could be successfully applied to the molecules.
Currently, the synthesis of SFAs typically involves toxic organostannanes or ligands (Table S1). We have noticed that direct heteroarylation with C–H activation may be a feasible approach to overcome this problem, where the reagents can be organostannane-free. Direct heteroarylation with C–H activation has been applied to exploit many high-performing conjugated polymers; however, it is rarely introduced in the synthesis of SFA molecules. In Table 1, SFAs with PCE over 10%, synthesized via the direct heteroarylation pathway, are summarized. SFAs PTIC, X-PCIC, X1-PCIC, and BTCIC-4Cl were prepared in 2–5 steps with a palladium(II)-catalyzed C–H activation coupling reaction, and the highest PCE of 11.33% was achieved by X-PCIC (Fig. S2). However, organophosphorus ligands such as PCy3·HBF4 and P(o-CH3OPh)3 were employed in the direct heteroarylation. The addition of such ligands does not satisfy the economical and ecological requirements in practical application. It is unclear whether a ligand-free approach would be possible in the C–H activation coupling reaction for SFA molecules.

This work

In this communication, a ligand-free direct heteroarylation approach for benzodithiophenedione (BDD)-based SFAs BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F was reported (Fig. 1a). To the best of our knowledge, no nonfullerene acceptor containing the BDD moiety has been reported yet. It should be noted that the well-known polymer donors PM6 (ref. 53) (Fig. 1b) and PM7 (ref. 54) for high performance PSCs also contain the BDD moiety. BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F with an A–D–A′–D–A structure contain 2-ethylhexyl and 2-butyloctyl side chains on the BDD core, respectively. By virtue of O⋯S intramolecular noncovalent interactions between the oxygen atom in the BDD backbone and sulphur atom of the cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) unit to lock the molecular conformation, BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F can maintain a fairly planar geometry. The difference in the alkyl lengths on the BDD core has little impact on the optical and electrochemical properties. In PM6-based PSCs, a maximum PCE of 12.59% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.88 V, a larger short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.57 mA cm−2, and a high fill factor (FF) of 63.38% was achieved by BDDEH-4F. For comparison, the BDDBO-4F-based optimized devices show a lower PCE of only 9.80%, due to a much lower Jsc of 19.09 mA cm−2 and FF of 58.96%. The improved PCEs of PM6:BDDEH-4F based devices can be ascribed to the appropriate morphology and phase separation of the blend films. The facile synthesis based on ligand-free direct heteroarylation and excellent device performance of our SFA molecules will pave the way to develop new nonfullerene acceptors at low cost in future.

Compared to the conventional complex and tedious synthesis of most nonfullerene acceptors, we only utilized three steps to synthesize SFAs BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F in good yields (Fig. 1c, with full synthetic details in the ESI). Particularly, the synthesis processes do not involve any hazardous organostannanes or ligands as reagents. Firstly, compounds 1a and 1b were obtained in yields of around 65% by palladium(II)-catalyzed C–H activation coupling reactions between the BDD core and cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) for 4 h, without using any ligand reagents. Subsequently, compounds 2a and 2b were prepared by the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction in high yields of about 95%. The target products BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F were obtained with good yields of 82% and 83%, respectively, through Knoevenagel condensation between the dialdehyde intermediate (2a or 2b) and the halogenated terminal (2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile, IC-2F). The chemical structures of BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F were fully characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Fig. S3–S8). In addition, both the two acceptors have good solubilities in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene at room temperature. The thermal properties of BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S9), showing decomposition temperatures (Td for 5% weight loss) at 331 and 329 °C, respectively. The good thermal stabilities of BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F completely satisfy the requirements of device fabrication in PSCs.

The geometrical conformations and frontier molecular orbitals of BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F were evaluated using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. On account of the fact that the side chains in the BDD core have little impact on molecular conformations and also in order to reduce the computation time, the alkyl groups (EH or BO side chains on the BDD core) in the molecules were replaced by methyl to simplify the calculations. The calculated results of molecular conformations and wave function distributions of frontier molecular orbitals are provided in Fig. S10. In general, the geometrical conformations of acceptors can partly retain a planar geometry with dihedral angles of 0.03° (θ1), 10.91° (θ2), 10.91° (θ3), and 0.03° (θ4), respectively. The relatively small dihedral angles indicate that the intramolecular O⋯S noncovalent interactions are conducive to locking the molecular geometry. Notably, the slightly twisted configuration between the BDD core and CPDT unit in the acceptor molecule can prevent over-aggregation in the blend film which would lead to the formation of large crystalline domains and phase separations in PSCs. What's more, the electron density distributions at the LUMO and HOMO energy levels are well delocalized throughout the whole backbone, and the calculated values of LUMO and HOMO energy levels are −3.55 and −5.52 eV, respectively.
UV-vis absorption measurements were utilized to investigate the optical absorption of BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F in a dilute solution (10−5 mol L−1) and in the solid state. In solution, BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F display similar spectral patterns with maximum absorption peaks at 715 and 714 nm, respectively (Fig. S11). The maximum extinction coefficient of BDDEH-4F in solution is 1.90 × 105 M−1 cm−1, which is higher than that (1.67 × 105 M−1 cm−1) of BDDBO-4F. From the solution to the solid state (Fig. 2a), the absorption peaks of BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F both redshift ca. 60 nm with a broadened absorption range from ca. 500 to 900 nm, indicating strong aggregated states of the molecular chains in film. Based on the optical absorption edges of the films, the optical bandgaps (Egopt) of BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F were calculated to be 1.41 and 1.42 eV, respectively.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted to characterize the electrochemical properties of BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F by using a Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode and ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the internal reference. The cyclic voltammograms are shown in Fig. S12, with detailed values summarized in Table S2. The calculated lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of BDDEH-4F are −3.94 and −5.57 eV, respectively, according to the equation EHOMO/LUMO = −e(Eox/red + 4.80) (eV). Compared with BDDEH-4F, the LUMO and HOMO levels of BDDBO-4F hardly change, corresponding to −3.93 and −5.56 eV, respectively. Generally, changing the alkyl side chain length on the BDD core has little impact on the photophysical and electrochemical properties of acceptors.
To investigate the impact of the different lengths of alkyl side chains on the BDD core on the photovoltaic performance, the popular wide band-gap conjugated polymer PM6 was chosen as the electron donor to construct the BHJ active layers for PSCs, owing to suitable complementary absorptions (Fig. 2a). Besides, the small HOMO offsets between PM6 and the acceptors are favourable for enhancing the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of PSCs (Fig. 2b). Inverted devices were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/ZnO/active layer (∼160 nm)/MoO3/Al. The optimizations of the devices are summarized in Tables S3–S5, including polymer:acceptor (D:A) ratio, thermal annealing conditions, and content of solvent additive. A D:A weight ratio of 1:1, a 0.5% v/v content of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), and thermal annealing at 160 °C for 10 min are beneficial for the optimal device performances. It should be noted that for another investigated D:A weight ratio of 1:1.2, the addition of 0.5%, 1%, and 1.5% CN all showed inferior efficiency (Table S5). The comparison of J–V curves between the as-cast and optimized devices is depicted in Fig. 2c, with photovoltaic parameters listed in Table 2. As for the as-cast devices, the BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F based active layers showed very low fill factors (FFs) of around 49%, respectively, giving PCEs of 8.39% and 7.07%, respectively. For the optimized devices, significantly improved Jsc and FF could be found for the BDDEH-4F based active layer. The Jsc was elevated from 18.58 to 22.57 mA cm−2, and the FF was improved from 50.67% to 63.38%, thus affording a much higher PCE of 12.59% (Table 2). In comparison, the optimized devices for BDDBO-4F exhibited a lower PCE of only 9.80% because of an obviously lower Jsc of 19.09 mA cm−2 and FF of 58.36%. The big difference in the photovoltaic performances of BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F indicates that suitable selection of the side chain is important in the design of an efficient A–D–A′–D–A type SFA.

The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimized PSC devices are shown in Fig. 2d. Obviously, the optimized BDDEH-4F active layer delivered much stronger EQE photoresponses from 300 to 800 nm compared with BDDBO-4F. Notably, even with a small HOMO offset between PM6 and BDDEH-4F, strong EQE responses of over 70% (peaking at 740 nm with 78.90%) can be observed in a wide range of 520−820 nm, suggesting that both the polymer donor and acceptor absorptions contribute to the EQE responses. In contrast, the optimized BDDBO-4F based active layer shows lower EQE throughout the whole spectral range, with a maximum EQE value of only 69.83% at 580 nm. As depicted in Fig. S13, the difference in EQE photoresponse is consistent with the UV-vis absorption behavior of the blend films. The integrated Jsc calculated from the EQE curves of the BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F based devices is 22.51 and 19.06 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the Jsc values from the J–V curves (within 5% mismatch).
Device stability is a critical factor that significantly impacts its commercial application. Here, the BDDEH-4F-based optimized devices were traced. Thermal stability was investigated at 80 °C in a N2-filled glovebox for more than 1 day (Fig. 2e). In the first 2 h, the BDDEH-4F-based devices were subjected to a sharp burn-in stage, during which they lost 20% of their efficiency. Interestingly, after that, the devices became very stable and could still retain 85% of the initial efficiency after 35 h thermal annealing. The storage stability was investigated in a N2-filled glovebox. The initial burn-in stage (4 days) was faint, and the devices could show a PCE of 11.97%, retaining 95% of the original efficiency (12.55%). After that, the devices were kept in a stable stage with very limited efficiency change, finally giving 11.74% PCE after 60 days. The good stabilities of the devices suggest that the SFA BDDEH-4F may form an active layer with a stable morphology when blended with the PM6 donor.
To investigate the exciton dissociation or charge transfer of the blend films, photoluminescence (PL)-quenching experiments were performed (Fig. S14). When exciting PM6 at 550 nm, the PL quenching efficiencies (PLQEs) of the optimized blend films of PM6:BDDEH-4F and PM6:BDDBO-4F were 98.78% and 98.02%, respectively, indicating efficient photoinduced electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor (Table 3). Nevertheless, when exciting the acceptors at 750 nm, the PLQEs of PM6:BDDEH-4F and PM6:BDDBO-4F decreased to 89.71% and 68.49%, respectively. In the literature, high PLQEs of about 99% have been reported. The relatively lower PLQEs achieved by the PM6:BDDEH-4F and PM6:BDDBO-4F blends may affect their Jsc in PSCs. The PLQEs might be attributed to the small HOMO offsets between PM6 and the acceptors (Fig. 2b). Relative to the HOMO level of −5.56 eV for BDDBO-4F, the slightly up-lying HOMO level of −5.57 eV for BDDEH-4F can afford more sufficient hole transfer. Indeed, higher EQE and Jsc values were observed with the BDDEH-4F based devices. Moreover, we calculated the exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss), according to previous reports (Table 3). Under short-circuit conditions, the Pdiss values of the optimized PSC devices were 94.04% and 90.19% for BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F, respectively (Fig. S15a). The higher Pdiss for the PM6:BDDEH-4F active layer indicates more efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction, thus affording larger Jsc and efficiency in devices. Further tracing the relationship between Jsc and light intensity (Plight) can shed light on the charge recombination dynamics (Fig. S15b). The fitted slope α values for PM6:BDDEH-4F and PM6:BDDBO-4F based optimized devices are 0.922 and 0.866, respectively. The higher α of the BDDEH-4F-based device suggests a lower extent of bimolecular recombination, which is consistent with its higher FF.

The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was utilized to investigate the charge transport properties of the blend films (Fig. S16). The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) values of the blend films (∼160 nm) are summarized in Table 3. The μe value of the pristine BDDEH-4F film is 3.41 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, slightly higher than that (2.79 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) of BDDBO-4F. The μh and μe values of the optimized PM6:BDDEH-4F blend film are 2.11 × 10−3 and 7.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, giving a μh/μe ratio of 2.87. In comparison, the optimized PM6:BDDBO-4F blend film shows lower μh of 1.56 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe of 3.88 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. This gives a much larger μh/μe of 4.02, suggesting not so balanced charge transport and more charge recombination for the PM6:BDDBO-4F active layer. Lower Jsc and FF were encountered by the BDDBO-4F based devices (Table 2). It should be noted that the two blend films exhibit higher μe relative to the corresponding pure films. Similar observations have been reported before. A PBDTTT-E-T:IEICO blend film showed an electron mobility of 4.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, higher than that (1.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) of pure IEICO film. Recently, our group also observed greatly enhanced electron transport (nearly one order of magnitude higher) in a nonfullerene based active layer when paring with a high hole mobility polymer donor.
To better explain the different device performances of BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F, the surface and bulk morphologies of the blend films were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As indicated in Fig. 3a and b, the optimized BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F based blend films all show fairly smooth surfaces with root-mean-square (RMS) roughnesses of 1.79 and 1.47 nm, respectively. BDDBO-4F with longer side chains on the BDD core contributes to the smoother surface of the BHJ blend film. We measured the contact angles (Fig. S17) and resulting surface energies (Table S6) of the pristine films of PM6, BDDEH-4F, and BDDBO-4F so as to reveal the miscibility between PM6 and the SFAs. The estimated Flory–Huggins interaction parameters (χD,A) are 0.065 K and 0.174 K for PM6:BDDBO-4F and PM6:BDDEH-4F, indicating that BDDBO-4F is more miscible with PM6. Very high miscibility between a donor and an acceptor will suppress their phase separation, leading to a well-mixed phase with poor crystallinity and low domain purity in a blend film. This is an unfavorable morphology resulting in deficient charge transport. Based on TEM measurement, the BDDEH-4F based blend film exhibits bicontinuous interpenetrating networks with a well-dispersed fibrillar structure (Fig. 3c). In comparison, the BDDBO-4F based blend film lacks such fibrillar structure, showing limited phase separation. In the mobility measurements, higher and more balanced charge transport was found for the PM6:BDDEH-4F blend film (Table 3).
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was conducted to investigate the molecular packing and orientation behaviors of the neat and blend films (Fig. S18). The relevant line-cut profiles are depicted in Fig. 3e, with structural parameters summarized in Table S7. The pristine PM6 film shows an in-plane (IP) (100) diffraction peak at qxy of 0.287 Å−1 and two out-of-plane (OOP) (100) diffraction peaks with qz = 0.324 Å−1 for the (100) diffraction and qz = 1.763 Å−1 for the (010) diffraction. A lamellar distance (d-spacing) of 21.85 Å and a π–π distance of 3.56 Å can be obtained from the IP (100) and OOP (010) peaks, respectively. Both the BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F pristine films display face-on dominated orientations in the OOP direction. SFA BDDEH-4F, bearing 2-ethylhexyl side chains on the BDD core, shows a shorter π–π stacking distance of 3.45 Å compared with that (3.57 Å) of BDDBO-4F bearing 2-butyloctyl side chains. After mixing PM6 and the acceptors to form the blend films, more intense IP (100) and OOP (100) peaks from the two blend films can be observed at qxy of ∼0.31 Å−1 and qz of ∼0.32 Å−1, respectively, probably ascribed to the polymer chain orientations. Interestingly, new OOP (200) peaks at qz of ∼0.65 Å−1 can be found for the two blend films, which do not exist in the pristine PM6 film. Furthermore, enhanced OOP (010) peaks are also found for the two blend films, which also display more compact π–π stacking with π–π distances of 3.43 and 3.50 Å for the BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F based blend films, respectively. The shorter π–π distance of 3.43 Å for the BDDEH-4F based blend film is beneficial for its faster electron transport in the vertical direction, thus resulting in higher Jsc and FF values for achieving better photovoltaic performance.

In summary, two new BDD-based A–D–A′–D–A type SFAs, BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F, were successfully designed and synthesized via a ligand-free direct heteroarylation approach for the first time. The different lengths of side chains on the BDD core of BDDEH-4F and BDDBO-4F hardly change their optical and electrochemical properties; however, a great impact can be observed in the nanoscale morphologies of the resulting active layers upon blending with the PM6 donor, leading to different photovoltaic performances. Relative to BDDBO-4F with longer alkyl side chains, the BDDEH-4F based active layers demonstrate higher and more balanced charge transport as well as favorable morphology due to suitable phase separation. A higher PCE of 12.59% due to a larger Jsc of 22.57 mA cm−2 can be achieved with the BDDEH-4F based devices while the BDDBO-4F based devices show a PCE of 9.80% and Jsc of 19.09 mA cm−2. Moreover, the BDDEH-4F based devices also display good thermal and storage stabilities, which are beneficial for practical application. Our results not only pave the way to construct new nonfullerene acceptors with facile synthesis based on ligand-free direct heteroarylation, but also reveal that side chain engineering of the acceptors has a great impact on morphology control of the active layer in PSCs.
