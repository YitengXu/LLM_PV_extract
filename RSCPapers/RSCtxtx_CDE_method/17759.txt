Starburst triarylamine-based organic dyes (D1, D2, and D3) have been synthesized. For the three designed dyes, the starburst triarylamine group, thiophene (or 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), and cyanoacetic acid take the role of electron donor, π-conjugation bridge, and electron acceptor, respectively. These compounds are characterized by photophysical, electrochemical, and theoretical computational methods. Nanocrystalline TiO2-based dye-sensitized solar cells were fabricated using these molecules as light-harvesting sensitizers. The overall efficiencies of the sensitized cells range from 5.48 to 6.15%. It was found that the introduction of the EDOT group in D3 bathochromically extended the absorption spectra, resulting in a leap in the photovoltaic performance in comparison to D2. Incorporation of a hydrophobic carbazole-containing segment at D2 relative with D1 retarded the electron transfer from TiO2 to the oxidized dye or electrolyte, leading to an increase of electron lifetime.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been intensively investigated since the report of highly efficient ruthenium complex-sensitized TiO2 solar cells by Swiss scientists. Ruthenium-based sensitizers, such as N3, N719, and black dye have achieved efficiencies of up to ∼11% under AM 1.5 G irradiation. To date, an overall conversion efficiency of up to 12% was achieved from porphyrin-sensitized solar cells with cobalt(II/III)-based redox electrolyte. However, pure organic dyes, commonly constructed with donor-π bridge-acceptor (D–π–A) configuration, exhibit not only higher extinction coefficient, but simple preparation and purification procedure with a low cost. Recently, enormous progress has been made in this field, and several organic sensitizers based on coumarin, indoline, and triphenylamine derivatives have been developed as promising candidates with the power conversion efficiency closer to ruthenium dyes. However, up to now, the Voc of organic sensitizers still fell behind that of ruthenium complexes, which was mainly ascribed to the faster recombination of conduction-band electrons with triiodide. In order to block the approach of the triiodide electrolyte to the TiO2 surface, various efforts such as sensitizer modification, usage of additives, co-adsorbents, and novel redox couples have been made. One of the strategies towards the molecular design is to introduce more donor segments to the primary donor, thereby forming D–D–π–A structures. As well known, extending π-conjugated bonding bridges could efficiently red-shift the absorption response, however, D–π–π–A structural organic dyes have close π–π aggregation which can not only lead to self-quenching and reduction of electron injection into TiO2 but also to the instability of the organic dyes due to the formation of excited triplet states and unstable radicals under light irradiation. Compared with the D–π–π–A structure, D–D–π–A dyes benefit from lower tendency to aggregate and better thermo-stability, and meanwhile their absorption regions can be extended and molar extinction coefficients can be enhanced. Tian et al. have reported a series of donor–donor–π bridge-acceptor (D–D–π–A) structural organic dyes incorporating several donor groups into the triphenylamine framework with starburst configuration, resulting in the red-shift in absorption and the suppression of charge recombination with electrolyte. The other research groups concurrently found that by transforming the rod-shaped molecule into a starburst type, usually employing the starburst triarylamine units as the donor, the Voc can also be improved. This enhancement should be ascribed to their aggregation-resistant nonplanar starburst configuration and multiphenyl units on the starburst triarylamine, which can block the approach of the I3− ion.

We have long been interested in the development of new starburst sensitizers for solar cell applications and have recently reported a series of efficient DSSCs using new dipolar arylamine/cyanoacrylic acid sensitizers containing thiophene unit as the spacer. Thiophene-based π-conjugated oligomers and polymers have been widely used in photovoltaic cells because of their chemical and environmental stability as well as their electronic tenability. Thiophene and 3,4-ethoxythiophene (EDOT) have been proved to be excellent bridging ligands in the sensitizers. In this study, we used EDOT as the spacer of dipolar sensitizer based on the following reasons: (1) the introduction of EDOT has its own niche in that poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) has been applied in the fabrication of polymer based photovoltaics; (2) the introduction of the EDOT group increases the spectral response and perhaps renders a better degree of charge separation.
Herein, we report the design and syntheses of a series of novel organic dyes (Scheme 1) that contain starburst triarylamine as donor and cyanoacrylic acid as electron acceptor (anchoring group). These two moieties are bridged by thiophene and its derivatives, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT), to form organic dyes, namely: D1, D2, and D3. With these dyes as the sensitizers, DSSCs of good performance were also fabricated. The cone-shaped configuration of sensitizer D2 enables them to form the compact sensitizer-layer on the TiO2 surface, and it was found that the Voc was improved effectively. The EDOT based π-conjugation segments of D3 bathochromically extend absorption spectra, leading to an increase in short circuit photocurrent densities.

The absorption spectra of the three dyes in CH2Cl2 solution are displayed in Fig. 1, and the corresponding data are presented in Table 1. All the dyes display two distinct absorption bands at 310–330 nm and 470–490 nm, respectively. The former corresponds to the π–π* electron transition; the latter can be assigned to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the TPA-based donor and the cyanoacrylic acid, which produce the efficient charge-separation excited state. As depicted in Fig. 1, dyes D1 and D2 have a similar extinction coefficient in their charge transfer transition band (absorption maxima at 471 nm and 454 nm, ε = 21400 M−1 cm−1 and 21600 M−1 cm−1), respectively, while the extinction coefficient of the π–π* transition band of D2 (ε = 31100 M−1 cm−1 at 328 nm) are larger than that of D1 (ε = 21400 M−1 cm−1 at 316 nm), which is the result of the increase of the number of carbazole units. For the π–π* transitions of conjugated chromophores, extinction coefficients are higher as the enhancement of the conjugation length. A comparative examination of the absorption spectra between D2 and D3, clearly indicates the extinction coefficient of the π–π* transition band in D2 is larger than in D3 (ε = 28400 M−1 cm−1 at 328 nm). In contrast, the charge transfer band has a larger extinction coefficient in D3 (ε = 22400 M−1 cm−1 at 486 nm) than in D2, which could be interpreted in terms of the stronger electron donating capability of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) than thiophene linker. It is noteworthy that the absorption spectrum of D3 shows a bathochromic shift (32 nm) of the maximum absorption and an extension to longer wavelength in comparison with that of D2, which is due to a better degree of charge separation by introduction of the EDOT unit into the π-bridge. The red-shift and enhanced molar extinction coefficient may favor light harvesting and hence photocurrent generation in DSSCs.

The absorption and emission spectra of the three dyes in CH2Cl2 are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI). The luminescence maxima of the three dyes are located at 590, 600, and 610 nm and their E0-0 transition energies were estimated to be 2.35, 2.32, and 2.25 eV from the absorption and emission spectra, respectively.
The absorption spectra adsorbed on TiO2 of the three dyes are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI). In comparison with D1 and D2, the absorption spectrum of D3 is broader, which is an advantageous spectral property for light harvesting of the solar spectrum. A slight red-shift and broadening of the absorption peaks on the TiO2 surface have been observed in all dyes, which might be caused by the slight aggregation of dyes on the TiO2 film. In addition, the amount of the dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 surface is shown in Table 1. The dye loading amounts of 3.06 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for D2 and 2.72 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for D3 are both lower than that of 3.36 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for D1, which may be caused by their cone-shaped molecular configuration. For D3, the bridged 3,4-ethylenedioxy groups can expand the molecular size further and lead to the smallest amount of adsorbed dyes on the photoelectrode.
To evaluate the possibility of electron transfer from the excited dye molecule to the conductive band of TiO2, cyclic voltammograms of three dyes on TiO2 were performed in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) (Fig. S3, ESI). The ferrocene was used as a calibration internal standard, and the E1/2 of the Fc/Fc+ redox couple was found to be 0.65 V vs. the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. As seen from Fig. S3 (ESI), each of the three dyes in CH2Cl2 revealed a quasi-reversible oxidative process, and one oxidative peak observed between 0 and 2.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), which is assigned to the oxidation of the triphenylamine unit in the donor moiety, are more positive than the I−/I3− redox couple (∼0.4 V vs. NHE). The oxidation potentials for D3 and D2 are significantly higher than D1, indicative of a stronger driving force for efficient dye regeneration and better ability to avoid germinating charge recombination. The finding denotes that adding the carbazole units to triphenylamine-based donor groups could tune the localization of the frontier orbitals appropriately, thus enhancing the device performance.
The energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) derived from the oxidation potentials and absorption/emission data (Fig. S1, ESI) of three dyes are summarized in Table 1. Judging from the LUMO values, the excited-state energy levels of three dyes are much higher than the bottom of the conduction band of TiO2 (−4.4 eV), indicating that the electron injection process from the excited dye molecule to TiO2 conduction band is energetically favorable. On the other hand, the sufficiently low HOMO energy levels of the dyes will ensure more effective dye regeneration and suppress the recapture of the injected electrons by the dye cation radical. These indicate that the three dyes could act as an efficient photosensitizer for DSSCs.
To scrutinize the geometrical and photophysical properties, molecular orbital calculations of D1, D2, and D3 were carried out using the TD-DFT and B3LYP/3-21G* program. From the geometrical structures of the dyes, all dihedral angles between the phenyl planes in triphenylamine based donors are listed in Table S1 (ESI) and they are all noncoplanar with each other. The angles formed between carbazole and benzene plane in D1, D2, and D3 are as large as 55.9°, 57.8°, 56.8°, which can help to inhibit the close π–π aggregation effectively between the starburst structures. On the other hand, apparently, the coplanarity between the donor and acceptor moieties in D1, D2, and D3 dyes is distinct, as represented by the 12.2°, 12.7°, and 22.4° of the dihedral angle, respectively, which may promote the conjugation efficiency of the chromophore and hence favor the electron transport process.
The electronic structures of dyes in CH2Cl2 solution were also mimicked, which is the solvent used to record the experimental spectra. The electron distribution of the HOMOs and LUMOs of D1, D2, and D3 are shown in Fig. 2. Clearly, The HOMOs of these compounds are π orbitals delocalized over the triarylamine moiety. The LUMOs are located mainly on the cyanoacrylic acid, such that the excited electron can be injected into the TiO2 electrode effectively. Distributions of HOMO and LUMO orbitals are completely separated, indicating that photoexcitation may lead to an efficient intramolecular charge separation with an effective photocurrent generation. Moreover, as depicted in Table S2 (ESI), for the three dyes, the S1 state mainly consists of mixed transitions, in which the delocalization of electron density from triarylamine to carboxylic groups is apparent. This, in combination with the near unity oscillator strength (f), confirms the charge transfer (π–π*) type of transition in the first excited state, supporting the aforementioned experimental results.
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) for DSSCs based on the three dyes are shown in Fig. 3. The onset of the IPCE spectrum based on D3 is ∼700 nm, and middle IPCE performance (>75%) was observed from 400 to 570 nm, with the highest value, 86%, at 450 nm. Under the same conditions, the onset of the IPCE spectra of DSSCs is ∼650 nm for both D1 and D2, and they exhibited lower IPCEs with maxima of 84% at ∼440 nm. The decrease of the IPCEs above 450 nm toward the long-wavelength region for dyes D1 and D2 was ascribed to the decrease of light harvesting for both dyes, reflecting lower photocurrent and hence inferior photovoltaic performance.
The current density–voltage (I–V) characteristic of the photovoltaic devices containing D1, D2, and D3 is shown in Fig. 4. Under a standard global AM 1.5 G one sun solar illumination, D1 and D2 sensitized solar cells give short circuit photocurrent densities (Jsc) of 10.52 and 10.51 mA cm−2, open circuit voltages (Voc) of 706 and 728 mV, and fill factors of 0.74 and 0.73, corresponding to overall conversion efficiencies (η) of 5.48 and 5.55%, respectively. In contrast, the D3 sensitized solar cell gives a Jsc of 12.21 mA cm−2, a Voc of 695 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.72, corresponding to η of 6.15%. As seen from Table 1, the short-circuit current and overall yield for the three dyes lie in the order D3 > D2 > D1. The short-circuit current of D3 is higher than D1 and D2, which can may be due in part to broader spectral response and higher molar absorption coefficient of D3, consist with the results of IPCEs. Another possible reason can be attributed to the higher injection efficiency of the dye D3. Due to starburst triarylamine based electron donor, bulky EDOT based linker, and low adsorbed amount on TiO2 of D3, the dye has lower tendency to molecular aggregation, as seen from the following coadsorption study, and thus reduce intermolecular quenching, leading to the increase of the electron injection efficiency. However, dye D3 sensitized cells has a lowest open-circuit voltage, for DSSCs using D3 dye show shorter electron lifetime in comparison to those using D1 and D2 dyes, as described in the following paragraph. In addition, the open-circuit voltage of D2 is higher than D1, because the starburst triarylamine structure might be beneficial for retarding the electron transfer from TiO2 to the oxidized dye or electrolyte, which would increase the electron lifetime and enhance the open circuit voltage. Besides this, it is believed that the comparatively lower-lying HOMO of D2 (estimated from the CV) also plays an important role due to its stronger driving force for the reduction of the oxidized dye. This, in turn, will lead to a slower back electron transfer from TiO2 to the dye and result in a larger Voc. In contrast, the comparatively higher-lying HOMO of D1 and D3 should lead to smaller Voc values.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses were also performed to elucidate the above photovoltaic findings. The Nyquist plots (Fig. 5a) show the radius of the middle semicircle to increase in the order D3 < D1 < D2, indicating that the electron recombination resistance augments from D3, D1, to D2. The electron lifetime (τ) values derived from curve fitting are 82.99, 147.51, and 149.10 ms for D3, D1, and D2, respectively. The results are consistent with the Voc values of the devices.
The electron lifetime is improved upon incorporation of the carbazole group, i.e., τ (D2) > τ (D1). We thus speculate that the starburst hydrophobic group may retard the diffusion of the electrolyte to the surface of the TiO2, resulting in the suppression of the dark current and blocking of the cations, Li+ and H+, from approaching the TiO2 surface. In addition, it is known that the sensitizer adsorption number affects the shorter lifetime and Voc significantly, and therefore, the shorter lifetime for the starburst sensitizer D3 was attributed mostly to the lower packing density of dyes on TiO2 compared to D1 and D2 dyes, which would result in the higher I3− concentration in the vicinity of the TiO2 surface and smaller charge recombination resistance.
The Bode phase plots shown in Fig. 5b likewise support the differences in the electron lifetime for TiO2 films derivatized with the three dyes. The middle-frequency peaks of the DSSCs based on D1 and D2 shift to lower frequency relative to that of D3, indicating a shorter recombination lifetime for the latter species. The increase in the recombination lifetime in the TiO2 film is associated with a pronounced rise in the charge transfer resistance, which depends on the structure of the dyes. In addition, at high frequency region (103–106 Hz), the peak maximum is at slightly lower frequency for D3 than the other two dyes, which corresponds to the slower charge transfer at counter electrode.
Intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) were carried out to further investigate the different photovoltaic behaviors of three dyes. Fig. 6a shows recombination time (τr) of DSSCs based on D1, D2, and D3 dyes under various incident light intensities. The results indicate that the recombination time of the devices displays a systematic trend D2 > D1 > D3, consistent with the EIS results described above. On the other hand, the electron transport times (τd) of DSSCs based on the three dyes increase in the order D2 > D3 > D1 as shown in Fig. 6b. Considering the interaction with the dye and electrolyte, we deduced it could be the reason that D2 and D3 having starburst D–D–π–A structure might limit the access to the surface by Li+ ions which are known to assist the electron diffusion along the TiO2 network, resulting in a slowest photo-injected electron transport to FTO glass. In addition, the charge collection efficiencies (ηcc) determined by IMPS/IMVS through the equation ηcc = 1 − τd/τr are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI). The results indicate that the differences of charge collection efficiency among the dyes are very small, being essentially in the range of 0.990–0.998, implying the main factor affecting the IPCEs and overall conversion efficiencies is the LHE and Φinj, in agreement with the above discussion.
To clarify the dye aggregates formed on the TiO2 surface, a study of the cell performance of the D3 in the presence of CDCA in different concentrations was carried out. The results are collected in Table S3 (ESI). CDCA did not improve the device's performance, in contrast, it decreased the power conversion efficiency. A possible explanation is that the amount of dye adsorbed on the TiO2 surface was reduced by the coadsorption of CDCA, resulting in a loss of active light harvesting. We take this result as a hint that the dyes with D–D–π–A structure have good aggregation resistant abilities by introducing starburst triarylamine group into the molecule.
According to the above analyses, the device efficiencies described from I–V curves and IPCE values are in the order of D3 > D2 > D1, and the electron lifetimes obtained in EIS and IMVS measurements show the order of D2 > D1 > D3. D3 has a higher cell efficiency than D2, albeit with a shorter electron lifetime. The outcome may be rationalized by the following reasons: (1) D3 has a broader spectral response and higher molar absorption coefficient, resulting in better light harvesting; (2) low aggregation of D3 improves its electron injection efficiency and Jsc; (3) the higher LUMO level of D3 leads to a faster electron injection. On the other hand, the somewhat higher cell efficiency of D2 than D1 is mainly attributed to the slower recombination of photoinjected electrons.

We have developed a novel type of highly efficient starburst organic sensitizers using starburst triarylamine as electron donor moiety (D1, D2, and D3), yielding maximum 84, 85, and 86% IPCEs and 5.48, 5.55, and 6.15% power conversion efficiencies, respectively. The introduction of the EDOT group in D3 increases the spectral response and perhaps renders a better degree of charge separation, resulting in a leap in the photovoltaic performance in comparison to D2, and exhibits a conversion efficiency η as high as 6.15%. Incorporation of a hydrophobic carbazole-containing segment at D2 relative with D1 is demonstrated to be beneficial for retarding the electron transfer from TiO2 to the oxidized dye or electrolyte and to enhance the charge transfer efficiency in the excited state. Our results strongly support the successful prospects of starburst organic DSSC photosensitizers such as D3 and its future derived analogues.

Briefly, TiO2 powder synthesized via hydrothermal method (20 nm) (1.0 g) was ground for 40 min in the mixture of ethanol (8.0 mL), acetic acid (0.2 mL), terpineol (3.0 g), and ethyl cellulose (0.5 g) to form a slurry, and then the slurry was sonicated for 5 min to form a viscous white TiO2 paste. The TiO2 paste was then screen-printed onto the surface of FTO coated glass (15 Ω per square, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) forming photoanode film. The thickness of films can be easily controlled through repeating screen-printing times. Afterwards, a programmed heating process was carried out to remove the organic substances in the film. The film thickness was measured by pro-filometer (AMBIOS, XP-1).

The as-prepared TiO2 films (∼15 μm) were soaked in a 0.04 M aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C and then sintered at 520 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the TiO2 electrodes were immersed into 0.5 mM CH2Cl2 solution of the dyes and kept at room temperature for 16 h. The dye loading measurements on TiO2 films were carried out by desorbing the dye into 0.8 mol L−1 triethylamine solution in CH2Cl2 and then measuring the ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra of the resultant solution with the same dilution. The adsorbed density of each dye was calculated from the difference concentration of each solution before and after TiO2 film immersion.
As for the DSSC devices, the dye loaded TiO2 photoanode was sandwiched with Pt nanoparticle coated counter electrode with the spaces between them filled with electrolyte solution. The electrolyte solution consisted of 0.6 M 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.03 M I2, 0.05 M LiI, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15 v/v).

The current–voltage characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated AM 1.5 G one sun (100 mW cm−2) illumination provided by solar simulator (69920, 1 kW Xe lamp with optical filter, Oriel). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out on a Zennium electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER) with the frequency range from 10 mHz to 1MHz with forward bias of –0.75 V in the dark. The magnitude of the alternative signal was 10 mV.


The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed with a Zennium electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER) with the frequency range from 10 mHz to 1000 kHz. The magnitude of the alternative signal was 10 mV. The impedance measurements were carried out under forward bias of −0.7 V in the dark.


Intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) measurements were conducted using electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER, Zennium) and were performed under a modulated LED light (457 nm) driven by a source supply (ZAHNER, PP210). The illumination intensity ranged from 30 to 150 mW cm−2. The light intensity modulation was 20% of the base light intensity over the frequency range of 10−1–103 Hz.


The Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded on a Keithley 2000 multimeter under the illumination of a 150 W tungsten lamp with a monochromator (Spectral Product DK240).


The optimized geometry structure and the localization of the frontier orbitals of three dyes are calculated by means of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) methods with MO62X functional at 6-311+g(2d,2p) basis set level.
