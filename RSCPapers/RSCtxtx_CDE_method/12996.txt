To enhance the efficiency of solar cells, a broadband double-layer antireflective (AR) coating with excellent transmittance and abrasion-resistance, was successfully fabricated using two layer mesoporous silica coatings. Both layers were prepared via a solvent evaporation self-assembly method in which the top- and bottom-layer mesoporous silica coatings used Pluronic F127 and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as templates, respectively. The grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) and the transmission electron microscope (TEM) results indicated that the mesopores in the double-layer AR coating belonged to a Fmmm orthorhombic symmetry structure of the SBA-16 in the top layer and a P6/mmc 3D-hexagonal structure of the MCM-41 in the bottom layer. The solar-weighted average transmittance (TPV) of the broadband AR coating is approximately 99.10% on quartz, 98.62% on borosilicate glass, and 98.55% on K9 glass in the solar spectrum range of 300–2400 nm. By introducing broadband AR coating, the overall power conversion efficiency (η) of the solar cell showed an increase of 1.23% for quartz, 1.31% for borosilicate glass, and 1.37% for K9 glass. Meanwhile, the double-layer AR coating had excellent mechanical stability; the TPV value of coating after abrasion by CS-10F wearaser only decreased 0.16% on quartz, 0.29% on borosilicate glass and K9 glass. The pencil hardness of the double-layer AR coating was found to be 6H.

Antireflective (AR) coatings are highly desirable in many optical systems such as telescopes, display devices and lasers to reduce surface reflection of incident light. A solar cell is an electrical device that converts light energy directly into electricity based on the photovoltaic effect. However, approximately 8% of light is reflected on the two surfaces of the cover glass. Conventional single-layer quarter-wave AR coatings are specific to only one central wavelength. In the real solar cell system, there exists a wide spectra range passing through the cover glass so that AR coatings with broadband antireflection are in high desire.

For the preparation of broadband AR coatings, chemical etching, as one of the earliest methods, has been widely used, but the use of highly hazardous acid etchants was not suitable for large-scale application. The physical vapour deposition method can control optical constants precisely and prepare multilayer thin film easily. However, the use of high temperatures and high cost is undesirable for large aperture and complex substrate. To obtain effective broadband AR coating for solar cell glass, a multilayer film with graded refractive index structure should be of great importance. Hiroomi Shimomura et al. reported a four-layer broadband optical AR coating with reflectance of 0.5% over the whole visible range from 400 to 800 nm through Layer-by-Layer (LbL) assembly method, but the process was very time-consuming and expensive. Suhan Kim et al. prepared a double-layer broadband AR coating with transmittance above 98% in a narrow wavelength range from 400 to 900 nm, due to the fact that the refractive index and thickness of the layer were not precisely controlled.
Mesoporous silica films prepared by solvent-evaporation-induced self-assembly (SEISA) method, had a low refractive index, and, high temperature calcination can also improve their structural integrity and mechanical robustness. In our previous work, we prepared a double-layer broadband AR coating based on a mesoporous silica layer and a particles-stacking silica layer. Inspired by our previous work, a broadband AR coating may be prepared by stacking two mesoporous layers with different refractive indices. In this work, we optimized double-layer broadband AR coating by combining two layers with different refractive indices that resulted from the different pore size in layer illustrated by following Scheme 1. As expected, the prepared broadband double-layer silica AR coating was successfully employed in solar cell glass and exhibited desirable optical performance and mechanical property in the wavelength region of most solar irradiance.

Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was purchased from Acros Organics. Ethanol (99.7%) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) was purchased from Tianli Chemical Reagents Factory (Tianjin, China). Pluronic F127 was purchased from Sigma Aldrich and CTAB was purchased from Bio Basic Inc. All of the reagents were used without further purification.


SBA-16 structured mesoporous film was prepared by the F127-containing SiO2 solution. TEOS was mixed with hydrochloric acid, ethanol (EtOH) and deionized water with molar ratios of TEOS:EtOH:H2O:HCl = 1:4.3:2:3.8 × 10−3. The mixture was left to react under stirring at 60 °C for 1.5 h. A second solution was prepared by mixing F127, hydrochloric acid, ethanol and deionized water, and slowly added into the former solution. The final molar ratio was TEOS:EtOH:HCl:H2O:F127 = 1:25:0.02:7:0.0085. The sol was stirred for 24 h and aged for 7 days at room temperature and noted as F-SiO2 solution.

To obtain MCM-41 structured mesoporous film, CTAB-containing SiO2 solution must be synthesized. TEOS was mixed with hydrochloric acid, ethanol and deionized water, the mixture was noted as solution A and stirred for 1.5 h at 60 °C. CTAB was dissolved into another solution of deionized water, ethanol and hydrochloric acid, and the mixture was noted as solution B. The solution B was then slowly added into solution A. The final solution was stirred for 24 h at 25 °C. The resulted solution had the molar ratio of TEOS:EtOH:HCl:H2O:CTAB = 1:25:0.002:5:0.1. A clear solution was ready for use after 3 days aging at room temperature and noted as C-SiO2 solution.

Theoretical transmittance spectrum of the double-layer broadband AR coating was calculated with Filmstar software. The design purpose of broadband double-layer AR coating was that the transmittance from 400 nm to 1200 nm should be higher than 99.0%. According to our previous experiment, the refractive indices of the SBA-16 coating and the MCM-41 coating were in the range of 1.16 to 1.3 and 1.18 to 1.45, respectively, relating to the template concentration in solution. The refractive index and physical thickness of broadband double-layer AR coatings and the band of transmittance >99.0% are listed in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, if the bottom layer has refractive index of 1.32 and thickness of 110 nm, and the top layer has refraction index of 1.16 and thickness of 110 nm, the transmittance above 99.0% can be achieved over a wide range from 410 nm to 1070 nm and the maximum transmittance can reach 99.97%.

The experimental transmittances of the coated glasses were measured on a U-4100 UV-VIS spectrometer in the wavelength range of 300–2400 nm. The cross-section image of double-layer AR coating was investigated by JSM-5900LV scanning electrons microscope (SEM). The pore structure of the coating was observed on a JEOL-2010 transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The refractive index and thickness of AR coatings were determined on a SE 850 spectroscopic ellipsometer at 70° incidence. The surface morphology of the coating was measured using an atomic-force microscopy (AFM, XE-100, PSIA). The mechanical property was assessed by a Taber 5700 Linear Abraser. The films were rubbed for 25 cycles by CS-10F Wearasers™ with speed of 15 cycles per minute, then flushed with ethanol and dried at 60 °C. The abrasion-resistance was determined by the decrease of the solar-weighted average transmittance before and after abrasion test. Pencil hardness was measured by a pencil hardness tester (GB/T6739-1996). The ordered mesostructure in AR coating was investigated by 2D grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) that were performed at BL16B1 beamline of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) of China. The incident X-ray wavelength λ was 0.124 nm and the camera length was 2035 mm. Photovoltaic I–V curve was measured with a Keithley 2400 source-meter under AM 1.5 G condition (100 mW cm−2) simulated by a ABET Technologies Sun 3000 solar simulator. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of incident photon to current as a function of wavelength was measured using ZOLIX CSC1011, where the light source is provided by an Ushio UXL-553Xenon short-arc lamp.


Both the mesoporous silica layers were fabricated by dip-coating on clean substrate followed by removing the templates through calcination at 500 °C. Fig. 1a and b show the TEM images of single top layer and single bottom layer. In these images, the periodic mesostructure can be clearly observed and indicated that the mesoporous appeared after removing the surfactants. The pore size of the top layer was estimated to be 7.4 nm, and the bottom layer was about 1.6 nm.

Fig. 2 shows 2D GISAXS patterns of the top-layer, bottom layer and double-layer mesoporous silica coatings. The clear Bragg diffraction spots confirmed that the coating has highly organized structure. The GISAXS patterns were analyzed by NANOCELL software, a Mathematica-based program that simulated quantitatively the positions of Bragg peaks at any incident angle above the critical angle. This simulation program used the distorted wave Born approximation to account for the effects of refraction and reflection at coating-substrate and coating-air interfaces. The GISAXS patterns of the top layer and bottom layer mesoporous silica coatings were displayed in Fig. 2a and b, indicating a face-centered orthorhombic Fmmm structure of the F127-templated SBA-16 film and 3D hexagonal structure P6/mmc of the CTAB-templated MCM-41 film. Fig. 2a presents five diffraction spots indexed to (131), (111), (311), (222) and (020) reflections of the Fmmm space group. In Fig. 2b, three diffraction spots were indexed to (002), (011) and (010) reflections of the P6/mmc space group. The GISAXS patterns of the double-layer coating are shown in Fig. 2c. Seven diffraction spots belonging to the top layer and bottom layer can be clearly observed, this means that the double-layer mesoporous coating maintained the main ordered mesoporous structure. The pore diameters obtained from GISAXS were in good agreement with the TEM results. Both GISAXS and TEM patterns were mutual complementary and allowed for a very detailed characterization of coating structure.

The surface morphology of AR coatings was measured by AFM. The AFM images and the root-mean-square roughness (Rq) values of top layer, bottom layer and double-layer AR coatings are showed in Fig. 3. The surface morphology of bottom layer was smooth and flat (Fig. 3b) with the Rq value of 0.394 nm, which explained the quite low porosity. The Rq of the top layer was 2.914 nm (Fig. 3a), indicating the porosity was bigger than the bottom one. For the double-layer film (Fig. 3c), the surface was rougher than both the bottom and the top layer, which means the surface morphology of the double-layer film was mainly related to the top layer film. Because the Rq values of all the films were less than 4 nm, the surface scattering of film was small enough to avoid the additional decrease in transmittance.


As designed in Table 1, the top layer with low refractive index of 1.16 and the bottom layer with high refractive index of 1.32 should performance well for the broadband AR purpose. In the process of dip-coating, as the evaporation of ethanol, the concentrations of F127 or CTAB increased quickly and resulted in their self-assembling into micelles. After calcination at 500 °C to remove the templates, mesopores came into being. According to the SEM results, the bottom layer using CTAB as template possessed much smaller mesopores than the top layer using F127. Therefore the refractive index of the bottom layer should be higher than the top layer and the transmittance of the bottom layer was reversely lower than that of the top layer.

The experimental transmittance spectra of the single top layer and the single bottom layer are shown by Fig. 4a and b. The peak transmittance of the single top coating is almost 100%, and the peak transmittance of the single bottom coating is just 98.1%. The refractive index and the thickness of the coating were determined on the spectroscopic ellipsometer and both the refractive index and the thickness were consistent well with the design value. From cross-sectional SEM images of the single top layer and the single bottom layer, it could be seen that the film thickness were estimated to be 106 nm and 112 nm, coinciding with the spectroscopic ellipsometer results.
The transmittance spectra of experimental and modeled broadband double-layer silica AR coating are shown in Fig. 4c. The double-layer AR coating shows high transmittance above 99% an over very wide wavelength range from 440 nm to 1130 nm and the maximum transmittance of the resultant coating was 99.80% at 825 nm. However, the experimental transmittance spectrum has a little decrease from the modeled spectrum, suggesting a little penetration between top and bottom layers. The cross-sectional SEM images of two single layers and double-layer silica coating were shown by the inset of Fig. 4c. It can be seen that the interfaces between top and bottom layers were clear and apparent, indicating the penetration should be very week. The photograph of the coated glass is shown in Fig. 4d, which indicates a significant improvement of transmittance of AR coating.

The electricity production from solar cells has increased rapidly over the years. Polycrystalline silicon solar cell has gradually exceeded the single crystalline silicon solar cell because of simple manufacturing process and relatively low cost. The efficiency of commercially available polycrystalline silicon solar cells is approximately 13–19%. Cost reduction and power conversion efficiency (PCE) development is still the research hotspot of polycrystalline silicon solar cells. An important issue is that there is more than 8% reflection at the two air–glass interfaces, which made a draw back to the efficiency of solar cells. Therefore, it is a practical demand to improve the performance of solar cells by reducing the reflection of solar cell cover glass.

Fig. 5 shows the transmittances in the band 300–2400 nm of double-layer AR coating on different substrates, overlaid with the solar spectral irradiance at the air mass 1.5 (AM1.5). The solar-weighted transmittance (TPV) according to the AM 1.5 solar spectrum was used to evaluate the total transmittance of solar irradiance. The TPV can be calculated by

Tλ is the wavelength-dependent transmittance of coated glass, Sλ is the solar irradiance intensity. The TPV, Tmax, and band of TPV >99% values are listed in Table 2. The TPV value of broadband AR coating is approximately 99.10% on quartz, 98.62% on borosilicate glass, and 98.55% on K9 glass. We compared our broadband double-layer AR coatings with some other recently reported AR coatings applied to solar cell, shown in Table 2. It is clear that the broadband double-layer AR coating had much wider band of TPV >99%, which was the most important parameter for solar cell.

Fig. 6 shows the current–voltage (I–V) and the EQE curves of the polycrystalline silicon solar cells equipped with different cover glasses. The measured photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 3. Compared with the blank substrates, coated solar cells show a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) increase from 24.3 to 25.71 mA cm−2 on quartz, 24.29 to 25.6 mA cm−2 on borosilicate glass, and, 24.08 to 25.65 mA cm−2 on K9 glass. The overall PCE (η) of solar cell increased from 18.93% to 20.16% on quartz, 18.91% to 20.22% on borosilicate glass and 18.81% to 20.18% on K9 glass. The fill factor (FF) of coated solar cell was lower than that of uncoated solar cell, which meant a higher series resistance and a lower parallel resistance in coated solar cell. From Fig. 6a–c, the power conversion efficiency was enhanced to nearly the level of bare polycrystalline silicon solar cells after using AR-coated cover glass. All of these results indicated that more photons were absorbed by the polycrystalline silicon solar cells. The EQE value of broadband AR coating coated solar cells increased about 7–9% compared with the solar cell equipped with uncoated glass in the band of 300–900 nm. Therefore, the broadband double-layer AR coating reduced greatly, the reflection on the glass surface and enhanced the photovoltaic performance of polycrystalline silicon solar cells.

The mechanical robustness of the AR coatings is an important property for the outdoor application. To test the abrasion-resistance of AR coating, the Taber Linear Abraser was used. As shown in Fig. 7, the TPV value of the AR coating before and after abrasion was only 0.2% decrease at most in the region of 300–2400 nm. The hardness of the AR coatings was also examined by the pencil hardness text. A 6H pencil hardness of the AR coatings obtained under 1 kg pressure, harder than the common AR coatings. According to the results, the double-layer AR coating presented perfect mechanical performance and may adapt the complex outdoor environment.


A broadband double-layer silica antireflective coating with refractive index gradient structure was designed by thin film design software and obtained by two different mesoporous films which used F127 and CTAB as template, respectively. The broadband antireflection was achieved over the solar spectrum with increase of solar transmittance by 5.7% on quartz and borosilicate glass, 6.7% on K9 glass. By introducing AR coatings, the efficiency of solar cell is increased about 1.3%. Besides, the broadband AR coating exhibited strong abrasion resistant. This broadband double-layer AR coating could be promising material with high potential for practical applications.
