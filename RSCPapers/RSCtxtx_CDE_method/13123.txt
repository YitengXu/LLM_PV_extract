We demonstrate the fabrication of a nanoporous titania (NP-TiO2) network structure by using a polystylene-block-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P4VP) diblock copolymer template and modifying the surface of NP-TiO2 with ionic liquids (ILs), bmim-BF4 and benmim-Cl. The effect of the molecular weight of PS-b-P4VP on the morphology of the NP-TiO2 and IL-modified NP-TiO2 are characterized by scanning electron microscopy and contact angle measurements. Subsequently, hybrid solar cells are fabricated using MEH-PPV and NP-TiO2, and the effect of IL layers and IL concentrations on device performances are evaluated under AM 1.5 G illumination. The devices containing bmim-BF4 and benmim-Cl show drastically enhanced open circuit voltages (Voc) of 1.05 V and 0.91 V, respectively, while the reference device without an IL layer exhibits a Voc of 0.60 V. Significantly improved Voc can be attributed to the change in interfacial energy levels by formation of ionic double layers at the TiO2/IL and at the IL/MEH-PPV interfaces. We also observed the trend that short circuit current decreased and Voc increased with increasing IL concentration, which is ascribed to interruption of charge transfer from MEH-PPV to TiO2 and the change in interfacial energy level by shifting the vacuum level, respectively.

Solar cells have drawn much interest due to their potential as sources of electricity for addressing the global energy crisis. In this context, the development of low cost solar cells has been intensively investigated. One of the promising next generation solar cells is organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells (HSCs), which comprise conjugated polymers and inorganic semiconductors, such as TiO2, ZnO, and CdSe nanocrystals. These HSCs have attracted scientific as well as practical attention owing to their combination of the advantages of high electron affinity and stability of inorganic semiconductors, and flexibility of polymers.

Among the inorganic semiconductor materials, TiO2 has been extensively studied as an electron acceptor for fabricating polymer-based HSCs because it is a chemically safe, environmentally stable, and cheap material. To fabricate highly efficient polymer–TiO2 HSCs, TiO2 morphologies such as mesoporous structures, bicontinuous networks, nanotube arrays, or nanofibrous networks have been controlled by a variety of approaches. Furthermore, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)∶poly(stylene sulfonate) (PEDOT∶PSS) has been introduced between the polymer and metal electrode to increase the fill factor and short circuit current. However, these devices showed efficiency of ∼1% due to the inherent incompatibility between the hydrophilic TiO2 surface and the hydrophobic conjugated polymers. Moreover, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), widely used as conjugated polymers in organic solar cells, has difficulty infiltrating into the pores of TiO2 by spin-casting or heat treatment because P3HT chains have tendency to crystallize. To improve the device performance by reducing the inherent incompatibility, surface modification methods have been introduced. These strategies utilized organic molecules for surface modification of TiO2, which have functional groups, such as carboxylate, phosphonate or sulfonate, enabling chemisorption on TiO2 surfaces. Surface modifiers at the organic semiconductor/TiO2 interface improved the interfacial energetics and surface-wetting properties, resulting in enhanced power conversion efficiency. Other strategies employed a series of organic molecules with different dipole moments for surface modification of TiO2. Molecular dipoles caused a band edge shift in TiO2, leading to slightly increased open circuit voltage (Voc) and similar device efficiency compared to the reference device without modification.
In this work, we demonstrate a simple route for fabricating interconnected nanoporous TiO2 (NP-TiO2) from polystylene-block-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P4VP) diblock copolymer and for modifying the surface of NP-TiO2 with hydrophilic ionic liquid (IL) layers via a spin-coating process prior to the deposition of the poly (2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-p-phenylene vinylene) (MEH-PPV) layer. Hydrophilic ILs such as 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (bmim-BF4) and 1-benzyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (benmim-Cl) were used to form the IL layers. Our results indicated that device performances were altered when the IL layers were used to modify the interface between MEH-PPV and NP-TiO2. The IL layers reduced the inherent incompatibility between the hydrophilic TiO2 surface and hydrophobic MEH-PPV chains, and tuned the electric field across the IL layers by formation of ionic double layers at the TiO2/IL and at the IL/MEH-PPV interface. The change in interfacial energy level by ionic double layers has a strong effect on Voc, which is an 80% enhancement in Voc compared to the reference device without IL layers.

1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (bmim-BF4) and 1-benzyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (benmim-Cl) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Molybdenum oxide (MoO3) (typically 99.999% pure ∼100 mesh) was purchased from CERAC inc. Diblock copolymers poly(stylene-b-4-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P4VP) with average molecular weight of 136000 g mol−1 and 59000 g mol−1 were purchased from Polymer Source Inc. Titanium (IV) tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) (99.999%, Aldrich Chemical Co.) was used without further purification.


Prior to the NP-TiO2 layer, a compact TiO2 layer (c-TiO2) was prepared by spin-coating from the solution of 1 wt% TTIP in isopropanol on a clean ITO substrate. For the NP-TiO2 layer, PS-b-P4VP copolymers (molecular weight = 136 kg mol−1 and weight ratio of P4VP = 0.20; molecular weight = 59 kg mol−1 and weight ratio of P4VP = 0.30; denoted as 136 K and 59 K, respectively) were used as template to fabricate the nanostructured TiO2. PS-b-P4VP solution (1 wt%) was prepared in toluene (analytical grade) by stirring for 24 h at room temperature. Subsequently, a one equivalent of TTIP to P4VP was added to prepared PS-b-P4VP solution under stirring and further stirred for a day to incorporate TTIP into P4VP chains completely. The precursor solution was spin-coated onto c-TiO2 layer, and the films were calcined at a rate of 7 °C min−1 to 450 °C in air for 2 h. The films were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) which was performed on a NanoSEM 230 (FEI) at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV without any metal coating.



Fig. 1 shows the device structure and energy level diagram of MEH-PPV∶NP-TiO2 HSCs with IL layers. The ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned stepwise in detergent, water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol under ultrasonication for 10 min each and subsequently dried in an oven overnight. To prevent direct contact between the MEH-PPV and ITO electrode, a c-TiO2 layer was formed by spin-casting TTIP solution dissolved in IPA (1 wt%) at 5000 rpm for 60 s onto a cleaned ITO surface. After being dried under N2 gas for 10 min, the NP-TiO2 precursor solution was spin-coated onto the c-TiO2 layer and dried under N2 gas for 1 h. The films were heated at a rate of 7 °C min−1 to 450 °C in air and maintained for 2 h to obtain NP-TiO2 layers. ILs (Fig. 1c) were dissolved in water with a concentration of 0.1 wt% and spin-coated onto NP-TiO2 layers, following drying at 120 °C for 10 min. IL molecules easily infiltrate into the pores of TiO2 during spin-coating of IL solutions due to the small size of IL molecules compared to the pore size. The substrate was transferred into a glove box and the MEH-PPV solution dissolved in p-xylene (0.7 wt%) was then spin-cast at 1000 rpm for 60 sec on the top of the IL layers. The sample was then heated at 200 °C for 1 h to infiltrate MEH-PPV into the pores of TiO2. Subsequently the device was pumped down in vacuum (<10−7 Torr), and MoO3 (5 nm) as a hole-transporting layer and Au (70 nm) as a hole-collecting electrode was deposited on top of the MEH-PPV layer in sequence. The deposited Au electrode area defined the active area of the devices as 13.5 mm2. Measurements were carried out with the solar cells inside the glove box by using a high quality optical fiber to guide the light from the solar simulator equipped with a Keithley 2635A source measurement unit. The J–V curves for devices were measured under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2.


PS-b-P4VP copolymers were used as soft templates for fabricating NP-TiO2 interconnected structures. TTIP was selectively incorporated into P4VP chains which have nitrogen-functional groups, and subsequently, interconnected porous TiO2 structure formed during calcination. Depending on molecular weight and P4VP composition, as-prepared TiO2 nanostructures are different. Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of pristine NP-TiO2 prepared from two different PS-b-P4VP copolymers and modified NP-TiO2 with ILs. When a high molecular weight PS-b-P4VP was used, the NP-TiO2 structure was not fully developed because the long PS chains interrupt interconnection of TiO2 during calcination. Consequently, partially interconnected and particulate films were left after removing the copolymers (Fig. 2a), whereas highly porous three-dimensional structures were shown in PS-b-P4VP having smaller molecular weight (Fig. 2d). The NP-TiO2 surfaces were observed to have negligible differences between the pristine and the IL-modified surface as shown in Fig. 2.

The NP-TiO2 surfaces were also characterized by contact angle measurements on the substrates with and without IL-modification. Fig. 3 shows the contact angles on the different TiO2 nanostructure and IL layers. Both NP-TiO2 had a low wetting angle with DI water (<6°) showing that the surface was hydrophilic. The IL-modified TiO2 surface showed an increase in contact angle which is due to the hydrophobic surface of IL-modified NP-TiO2. Since bmim-BF4 is more hydrophobic than benmim-Cl, the bmim-BF4-modified TiO2 surface had a higher contact angle in both TiO2 cases. The increased hydrophobic property enabled the hydrophobic organic semiconductor to be compatible with the surface of inorganic TiO2.

The bilayer MEH-PPV∶NP-TiO2 films incorporating ILs, bmim-BF4 and benmim-Cl were deposited on ITO substrates and characterized by UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy.


Fig. 4a and b display the UV-vis spectra for different molecular weight of PS-b-P4VP used to make NP-TiO2 films, and for different ILs as interfacial layers. The optical absorption corresponds to a superposition of the MEH-PPV (400–600 nm) and TiO2 (<400 nm). In both MEH-PPV∶NP-TiO2 films, absorption intensity of MEH-PPV slightly decreases by inserting the IL layers. This indicates that IL reduces the amount of MEH-PPV that can be penetrated in the pores by flattening the surface of NP-TiO2. We can also observe the decrease in UV-vis absorption of MEH-PPV after infiltration treatment at 200 °C for 1 h, which may be attributed to weight loss of MEH-PPV.

Fig. 4c and d show PL spectra of MEH-PPV∶NP-TiO2 (136 K) and MEH-PPV∶NP-TiO2 (59 K) films for different ILs, and the extent of PL quenching after infiltration treatment. PL measurements can be used to determine the effectiveness of photoinduced charge transfer from the polymer to the TiO2. PL emissions at 590 and 640 nm correspond the peaks of MEH-PPV. Before infiltration treatment, MEH-PPV∶NP-TiO2 (136 K) films show approximately 60% PL quenching and MEH-PPV∶NP-TiO2 (59 K) films exhibit 40% PL quenching compared to that of pristine MEH-PPV films. These data confirm that porous TiO2 plays a role as an electron acceptor in polymer∶TiO2 HSCs. Infiltration treatment to penetrate MEH-PPV chains into the pores of TiO2 by heating the MEH-PPV∶NP-TiO2 film, induces nearly 80% PL quenching of MEH-PPV in both cases. This indicates that photoinduced charge transfer effectively occurred from MEH-PPV to the TiO2. Consequently, infiltration treatment gives rise to more PL quenching of the MEH-PPV compared to the introduction of the IL layer, which implies ionic molecules within IL layers do not have a significant effect on charge transfer from MEH-PPV to TiO2.

The working principle of MEH-PPV∶NP-TiO2 HSCs can be described by the following steps: absorption of photons in MEH-PPV lead to the formation of bound electron-hole pairs (excitons). Generated excitons diffuse to the MEH-PPV/TiO2 interface and charge separation occurs. Separated electrons and holes transport to TiO2 and MEH-PPV, and finally collect at the cathode and anode, respectively. IL layers were used to modify the NP-TiO2 surface to fabricate MEH-PPV∶NP-TiO2 HSCs. Fig. 5 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of a ITO/NP-TiO2/(IL)/MEH-PPV/Au devices tested under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5 G illumination. The NP-TiO2 (59 K)-based reference device without the IL layers has a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 0.61 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.60 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.37, and an overall power conversion efficiency (η) of 0.14%. MEH-PPV∶NP-TiO2 (59 K) devices with 0.1 wt% of bmim-BF4 and benmim-Cl in water exhibits approximately ∼80% improved Voc of 1.05 V and 0.91 V, respectively. There was slightly increase in FF, which may be attributed to the reduction of inherent incompatibility between MEH-PPV and TiO2 by IL buffer layers. Although NP-TiO2 (136 K)-based reference device showed poor power conversion efficiency due to the partially interconnected TiO2 network, we also observed ∼100% increase in Voc by adding IL layers. Both NP-TiO2-based devices with IL layers showed low Jsc, which may be ascribed to a decrease in UV-vis absorption of MEH-PPV as an electron donor and hindrance to direct charge transfer from MEH-PPV to TiO2. Table 1 summarizes device performances of MEH-PPV/(IL)/NP-TiO2 devices. All devices with IL layers show significantly enhanced Voc, caused by ionic double layers in interfaces between TiO2 and MEH-PPV. Positively charged TiO2 surfaces causes anions to move toward the TiO2/IL interface, and cations remain adjacent to the IL/polymer interface. The electric field across the IL layers is redistributed into ionic double layers at the TiO2/IL interface and at the IL/MEH-PPV interface (see Fig. 6a). McGehee’s group has investigated the effect of interfacial modification with self-assembled monolayers. When the dipoles are pointing away from TiO2, the band edge of TiO2 shifts closer to the vacuum level of the polymer, and the gap between the conduction band of TiO2 and the HOMO of the polymer increases, which determines the Voc. Ionic double layers change the interfacial energy level by shifting the vacuum level at the MEH-PPV/TiO2 interface and results in improved Voc (Fig. 6b), that is ∼80% enhancement in Voc compared to reference device without IL layers.

We also investigated the relationship between performance and IL concentrations using NP-TiO2 (59 K). Fig. 7 displays the device characteristics of MEH-PPV/IL/NP-TiO2 HSCs with a different IL concentration. We observed a noticeable trend in Jsc and Voc as a function of the IL concentrations. The devices with an IL concentration of 0.01 wt% showed increased Jsc and decreased Voc, while an increase in the IL concentration to 0.1 wt% led to a decreased Jsc and increased Voc. The detailed data for device performances were summarized in Table 2. The reference device without IL layer exhibited a Jsc of 0.61 mA cm−2, an Voc of 0.60 V, and a FF of 0.37, and the calculated η was 0.14%. After the addition of 0.1 wt% of bmim-BF4 and benmim-Cl, Voc increased to 1.05 and 0.99 V, FF slightly increased to 0.45 and 0.43, while Jsc decreased to 0.36 and 0.28 mA cm−2, and the corresponding η is 0.17 and 0.12%, respectively. For the device with higher IL concentration, IL molecules form an ionic double layer with high density, which has a strong effect on the interfacial energy level and interrupts charge transfer from MEH-PPV to TiO2. On the other hand, IL molecules at the MEH-PPV/ TiO2 interface have little effect on the interfacial energy level and mediate charge transfer at lower IL concentration. Although Voc and FF increased, overall efficiencies were similar to that of the reference device due to the characteristic trade-off of Jsc and Voc in MEH-PPV/IL/NP-TiO2 HSCs.

We have prepared a NP-TiO2 structure from PS-b-P4VP diblock copolymer templates and investigated the effect of hydrophilic ILs on device performance of the MEH-PPV∶NP-TiO2 HSCs. Our procedure provides a strategy of device design to improve Voc in polymer–TiO2 HSCs. Hydrophilic ILs reduce the incompatibility between hydrophobic MEH-PPV and hydrophilic TiO2 surfaces, and also form ionic double layers, which consist of imidazolium cations and anions. The change in the interfacial energy level by ionic double layers enlarges the difference of energy level between HOMO level of MEH-PPV and conduction band of TiO2 by shifting the vacuum level at the MEH-PPV/TiO2 interface, resulting in nearly 80% improvement in Voc. In our results, the MEH-PPV∶NP-TiO2-based device with a IL layer showed a Voc of 1.05 V, but a Jsc of 0.33 mA cm−2 due to a decrease in the UV-vis absorption and incomplete charge transfer from MEH-PPV to TiO2. The effect of IL concentration on device performance was investigated in MEH-PPV/IL/NP-TiO2 HSCs. For devices with higher IL concentration, we observed decreased Jsc and increased Voc that are attributable to interruption of charge transfer from MEH-PPV to TiO2, and strong change of the interfacial energy level at the MEH-PPV/TiO2 interface by dense ionic double layers, respectively. Hydrophilic ILs are promising candidates for the surface modifier in polymer∶metal oxide HSCs due to their desirable properties of changing the interfacial energy level as well as reducing inherent incompatibility of the organic–inorganic interface.
