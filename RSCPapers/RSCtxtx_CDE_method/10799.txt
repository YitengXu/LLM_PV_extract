Iridium-based polymer PM6Ir1 as an electron donor and two nonfullerene materials N3 and ITIC-Th as electron acceptors were selected to prepare efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs). ITIC-Th was used as the third component to enhance photon harvesting and as a morphology regulator to optimize molecular arrangement and phase separation in the ternary active layer. Improvements in open circuit voltage (0.86 V vs. 0.84 V), short circuit current density (26.53 mA cm−2vs. 26.13 mA cm−2) and fill factor (75.47% vs. 74.11%) are simultaneously obtained for the PSCs with 10 wt% ITIC-Th in the acceptor mixture, leading to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) enhancement from 16.27% to 17.22%. The charge mobility and charge transport balance in the ternary active layer can be enhanced by incorporating ITIC-Th, resulting from the optimized phase separation and molecular arrangement with ITIC-Th as a morphology regulator. The positive effect of ITIC-Th incorporation on PCE improvement can be demonstrated by the relatively high external quantum efficiency values of the optimal ternary PSCs in the spectral range from 300 to 820 nm.

As the next generation of photovoltaic devices with great development prospects, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have gradually aroused extensive interest on account of their special characteristics such as light weight, easy processing, semitransparency and flexibility. Over the last few years, PSCs have achieved remarkable progress with new photovoltaic materials and device engineering. From the materials perspective, most of the work has focused on non-fullerene materials with varying halogen substitution, side-chain engineering, and fused-ring core and end group engineering, such as ITIC, Y6 and their derivatives. Tao et al. introduced low concentrations of iridium or platinum complexes into the famous PTB7 or PTB7-Th donor polymer backbone, leading to the PCE improvement of the PSCs, suggesting that the incorporation of an iridium or platinum atom into the commonly used polymer donors should be an extra efficient approach to improve the PCE of PSCs. Peng et al. proposed a strategy of platinum(II) complexation to regulate the molecular packing and crystallinity of polymer donors, optimize the active layer morphology, and improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the corresponding PSCs. Min et al. exploited a sequence of polymer donors by incorporating different amounts of iridium (Ir) complexes into a PM6 conjugated backbone. Compared with PM6:Y6 based PSCs, one of the iridium-based polymer donors, PM6Ir1, exhibits a marked enhancement in PCE when blended with Y6, resulting from the optimized packing order and charge mobility of PM6Ir1 in the blend systems. Based on the well optimized binary blend systems with one donor and one acceptor, there is still significant room to improve the PCE of PSCs by adding a third component. The appropriate third component serves multiple functions in improving the performance of PSCs, such as enhancing the efficiency of photon harvesting, minimizing the energy loss, and optimizing the molecular arrangement and phase separation morphology in the ternary blend system. The selection of the third component always obeys the principles of complementary photon harvesting, good compatibility of materials used, and complementary photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding binary devices. Although a large amount of work has been done on ternary PSCs based on two donors or two acceptors, there are few report on the preparation of ternary PSCs employing iridium or platinum-based polymer donors. Here, the typical studies on iridium or platinum-based polymer donors for achieving efficient PSCs are summarized in Table 1. It is apparent that the iridium or platinum-based polymers play a positive role in improving the PCE of binary PSCs. A ternary strategy should have great potential in further enhancing the PCE of PSCs with iridium or platinum-based polymers as donors.

In this work, a sequence of ternary PSCs were prepared with iridium-based polymer PM6Ir1 as a donor, and ITIC-Th and N3 as acceptors. The chemical structures of the materials used and the device architecture are displayed in Fig. 1a. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PM6Ir1, ITIC-Th and N3 are presented in Fig. 1b. The cascaded energy levels can offer more potential avenues for charge transfer and charge transport in the ternary blend system. The normalized absorption spectra of the neat films are shown in Fig. 1c. The neat PM6Ir1, ITIC-Th and N3 films have obvious absorption peaks at about 620, 680 and 830 nm, respectively. The absorption spectra of the blend films with different ITIC-Th contents were measured and are shown in Fig. S2. The photon harvesting of ternary blend films in the spectral range from 580 nm to 740 nm gradually increased with ITIC-Th content increment. Meanwhile, photon harvesting of ternary blend films in the long wavelength range gradually decreased, which can be well explained from the absorption spectrum of the neat N3 and ITIC-Th films. The photon harvesting of ternary blend films should be optimized by balancing the enhanced photon harvesting in the 580 nm to 740 nm spectral range and the decreased photon harvesting in long wavelength range. The PCE of binary PM6Ir1:N3 devices reaches 16.27%, which is slightly higher than the formerly reported 15.98% of PM6:N3 based PSCs, indicating that the introduction of the iridium complex into the backbone of PM6 can lead to the performance enhancement of devices. The binary PM6Ir1:ITIC-Th devices achieve a PCE of 10.39%, and exhibit complementary photovoltaic parameters in comparison with the binary PM6Ir1:N3 device. The PCE of the optimal ternary devices reaches 17.22% upon integrating two binary devices with superior photovoltaic parameters, resulting from the simultaneously elevated short circuit current density (JSC) of 26.53 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.86 V and fill factor (FF) of 75.47% with respect to the binary PM6Ir1:N3 device with a PCE of 16.27%. The JSC and FF improvements of the ternary devices should be attributed to the improved photon harvesting, exciton dissociation and charge transport in the ternary blend system. The energy-loss (Eloss) of the optimal ternary devices is reduced by incorporating appropriate ITIC-Th, contributing to the VOC enhancement of the ternary devices.

A sequence of binary and ternary PSCs were fabricated with a conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDIN/Ag, and the current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of all PSCs were measured under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2 light intensity), as presented in Fig. 2a. On the basis of the J–V characteristic curves, the detailed photovoltaic parameters of the related devices are presented in Table 2. The binary PM6Ir1:ITIC-Th devices acquire a PCE of 10.39%, along with a JSC of 15.32 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.96 V and a FF of 68.23%. The PCE of binary PM6Ir1:N3 devices reaches 16.27% with a JSC of 26.13 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.84 V and a FF of 74.11%. The VOC of the binary PM6Ir1:ITIC-Th devices is higher than that of the binary PM6Ir1:N3 devices, and the JSC and FF of the binary PM6Ir1:N3 devices are appreciably higher than those of the binary PM6Ir1:ITIC-Th devices. The two kinds of PSC with superior photovoltaic parameters may be integrated into ternary PSCs by using ITIC-Th:N3 as an acceptor. The JSCs and FFs of the optimal ternary devices are slightly raised and then reduced with the increase of ITIC-Th content in the ternary blend system, while the VOCs of the ternary devices are gradually raised as more ITIC-Th is added. A PCE of 17.22% is acquired in the optimized ternary devices with 10 wt% ITIC-Th in the acceptor mixture, owing to the simultaneous enhancement of JSC (26.53 mA cm−2), VOC (0.86 V), and FF (75.47%) in comparison with those of the binary PM6Ir1:N3 devices.

To investigate the influence of introducing ITIC-Th to boost the performance of ternary devices, the dependence of the energy-loss (Eloss) of PSCs on ITIC-Th content was studied in detail. The Eloss of PSCs can be reckoned by using the formula Eloss = Eg − eVOC, where Eg can be determined from the intersection point of the normalized absorption and emission spectra of the acceptors, as presented in Fig. S3. The Elosss of the ternary PSCs decrease at first and then increase with the increment of ITIC-Th proportion in the ternary blend system. The Eloss of the optimized ternary devices is 0.561 eV, which is lower than that (0.573 eV) for the binary PM6Ir1:N3 devices and that (0.738 eV) for the binary PM6Ir1:ITIC-Th devices. The reduced Eloss of the optimal ternary device should play a significant part in the performance improvement. To better understand the dependence of FF variation of the ternary PSCs on the ITIC-Th content in acceptors, the series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSH) were calculated from the J–V curves of the PSCs, as summarized in Table 2. The RS values of the PSCs show a decreasing and then increasing trend with the increase of ITIC-Th content, and the RSH values of the PSCs exhibit an opposite trend compared with the RS values. A minimum RS of 2.2 Ω cm2 and maximum RSH of 869.3 Ω cm2 were simultaneously obtained for the PSCs with 10 wt% ITIC-Th in acceptors, which is responsible for the highest FF of the optimal ternary PSCs. To further clarify the effect of ITIC-Th content on the performance of ternary PSCs, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of all devices were measured, as exhibited in Fig. 2b. In the wavelength range of 300–820 nm, the EQE values of the optimal ternary devices are higher than the binary PM6Ir1:N3 spectral difference (ΔEQE) between the ternary blend system and binary PM6Ir1:N3 devices. The positive ΔEQE values in the region of 300–820 nm ought to be largely ascribed to the better phase-separated morphology that is favorable for effective charge separation and transport in the ternary blend system, in accordance with the considerable FF (75.47%) of the optimal ternary devices.
To clarify the charge or exciton dynamic process between ITIC-Th and N3, photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the neat and blend films were obtained under 680 nm light excitation and are shown in Fig. 3a. Neat ITIC-Th films exhibit relatively weak and wide PL emission with an emission peak at 760 nm. The strong PL emission of the neat N3 films can be clearly observed from their PL spectra with an emission peak at 900 nm. The PL emission of N3 in the blend films is gradually quenched upon increasing the ITIC-Th content, suggesting the presence of efficient charge transfer between ITIC-Th and N3. To further confirm the charge transfer between ITIC-Th and N3, a sequence of devices were fabricated with ITIC-Th, N3 or ITIC-Th:N3 as the active layer without PM6Ir1. The J–V characteristic curves of the devices under one sun light illumination are displayed in Fig. 3b. The JSC of specific cells with ITIC-Th:N3 as the active blend layer is larger than that of specific cells with ITIC-Th or N3 as the active blend layer, further implying the charge transfer from ITIC-Th to N3. The charge transfer between ITIC-Th and N3 provides another channel for exciton dissociation in the ternary blend system, which agrees well with the JSC enhancement of the ternary device.
To further understand the process of light absorption, exciton dissociation and carrier transport/recombination in the blend system, the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective bias voltage (Veff) characteristics of typical PSCs were measured and are displayed in Fig. 4a. Assuming that all generated electron–hole pairs fully dissociate into free charges and are swept out under high Veff conditions, the Jph can be defined as the saturated current density (Jsat). The Jsat values are 27.64, 27.84 and 17.35 mA cm−2 for the binary PM6Ir1:N3 devices, optimal ternary devices and binary PM6Ir1:ITIC-Th devices, respectively. The Jsat value of the optimal ternary PSCs is relatively large, implying photon capture enhancement in the optimized ternary active layers. The exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) can be assessed on the basis of the equations of  and , where  and  refer to the Jph under short-circuit conditions and maximal-power-output conditions, respectively. The values of Jphs, ηdiss and ηcoll of the typical PSCs are presented in Table S1. The ηdiss and ηcoll values are 94.55% and 86.24%, 95.28% and 87.47%, and 91.47% and 77.69% for the binary PM6Ir1:N3 devices, optimal ternary devices and binary PM6Ir1:ITIC-Th devices, respectively. The simultaneously elevated ηdiss and ηcoll values of the ternary blend system should be ascribed to the well optimized phase separation achieved by adding an appropriate amount of ITIC-Th as the morphology regulator.
The J–V curves of typical devices were tested under AM 1.5G illumination with varying incident light intensity (Plight) to elucidate the charge recombination behavior in the blend system, as presented in Fig. S4. In accordance with the corresponding J–V curves, the VOCs and JSCs of the typical PSCs versus Plight are plotted in Fig. 4b. The relationship between JSC and Plight can be defined as JSC ∝ Plightα. The exponential factor α refers to the extent of bimolecular recombination. If the bimolecular recombination is thoroughly inhibited in the active layer, JSC has a linear dependence on Plight, with the α value equal to 1. The α value of the ternary blend system was 0.957, which was higher than that of the two binary devices (0.941 and 0.946), implying that the bimolecular recombination can be efficiently inhibited by incorporating a small amount of ITIC-Th. The correlation between VOC and Plight can be represented as VOC ∝ β(KT/q)ln(Plight), where K, T and q represent the Boltzmann constant, absolute temperature, and elementary charge, respectively. The trap-assisted recombination in the active layer will be overlooked if the β value is close to 1. The β of 1.282 for the optimal ternary devices was closer to 1 than that (1.441) for the binary PM6Ir1:N3 device and that (1.319) for the binary PM6Ir1:ITIC-Th device, implying the efficiently weakened trap-assisted recombination in the ternary blend system. The synchronously mitigated bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination is favorable for charge transport and collection, as confirmed by the improved FF of 75.47% in the optimal ternary PSCs.
To gain in-depth knowledge of the effect of ITIC-Th content on the electron transport and recombination process, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in blend systems was performed in the frequency range of 5 Hz to 5 MHz under V = VOCs of the corresponding PSCs to eliminate the direct current of the devices.Fig. 4c exhibits the Nyquist plots of the typical PSCs, and the inset displays the corresponding simplified circuit model for fitting the Nyquist plot data. The inductance (L) is adopted to nullify the effect of connecting wires under high frequency scanning. Rs is the series resistance induced by the electrode and bulk resistance in the blend systems. Rtrans and Rrec are defined as the transport resistance and recombination resistance in the devices, respectively. The capacitor (C) describes the dielectric properties of the PSCs. A capacitance-like constant phase element (CPE) indicates the nonideal behavior of the capacitor. The CPE is determined by the capacitance value (CPET) and inhomogeneous constant (CPEP) between 0 and 1, as well as angular frequency (ω), expressed as Z = (CPET)−1 (iω)CPEP. If the CPEP value approaches 1, then the CPE is equivalent to an ideal capacitor without any defects or grain boundaries at the donor–acceptor interface. The corresponding parameters on the basis of a simplified circuit model are summarized in Table S2. The binary PM6Ir1:ITIC-Th device has a relatively large Rtrans value of 189 Ω, in accordance with the fairly low FF (68.23%). The Rtrans values are decreased from 59.5 Ω for the binary PM6Ir1:N3 device to 54.9 Ω for the optimal ternary device, while the Rrec values are elevated from 62.4 Ω for the binary PM6Ir1:N3 device to 65.9 Ω for the optimal ternary device. The lower Rtrans and higher Rrec of the ternary PSCs imply that introducing an appropriate amount ITIC-Th can promote electron transport and inhibit charge recombination in the ternary blend system, facilitating the improvement of FF for ternary devices. The values of CPEP are 0.910, 0.955 and 0.859 for the binary PM6Ir1:N3 device, ternary blend system and binary PM6Ir1:ITIC-Th device, respectively. The CPEP of the ternary devices comes close to 1 compared with that of the binary PSCs, indicating that the interface capacitance is more electrically ideal after adding an appropriate amount of ITIC-Th in the blend systems.
The space-charge limiting curve (SCLC) measurement was exploited to characterize the exciton transportation in the blend systems. Fig. S5 shows the ln(Jd3/V2) − (V/d)0.5 characteristic curves of hole-only and electron-only devices. Details of the hole (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the related devices are presented in Table S3. The dependence of μh and μe values on the increment of ITIC-Th proportion in the ternary blend system is plotted in Fig. 4d. With an increase of the ITIC-Th content, both μh and μe of the blend system exhibit an initially increasing and then decreasing trend. The μh and μe values of the optimal ternary devices are enhanced to 6.97 × 10−4 and 4.59 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, indicating that the exciton transportation channel could be optimized with the introduction of a small amount of ITIC-Th. The ratios of μh/μe can be employed to assess the balance of hole and electron transport. The μh/μe ratios are 1.52, 1.62 and 2.08 for the optimal ternary and two binary active layers, indicating the adequately balanced exciton transportation in the optimized ternary blending system. The increased mobility of charges and more balanced μh/μe ratios play a significant part in promoting charge extraction and inhibiting charge recombination, in accordance with the higher FFs of the ternary blend system with the incorporation of an appropriate amount of ITIC-Th.
The two-dimensional grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) patterns were studied to further elucidate the molecular packing behaviors in the devices. Fig. 5a and b show the 2D-GIWAXS patterns and the related intensity profiles along the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) directions of the blend films, respectively. The PM6Ir1:N3 blend films present an IP (100) diffraction peak and OOP (010) diffraction peak, implying that the blend films had a preferential face-on molecular orientation. Relatively weak IP (100) and (200) as well as OOP (010) diffraction peaks were seen for the binary PM6Ir1:ITIC-Th device. Meanwhile, an OOP (100) diffraction peak was seen for the binary PM6Ir1:ITIC-Th device, implying the presence of face-on and edge-on molecular orientations in the blend films. In the optimal ternary blend system, the intensities of the IP (100) and OOP (010) diffraction peaks were simultaneously enhanced, indicating the more face-on molecular orientation in ternary blend films, which is conducive to charge transport along the normal direction of the substrate. To further analyze the influence of the incorporation of ITIC-Th on the film morphologies of the PSCs, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the blend films were obtained and are displayed in Fig. 5c. Homogeneous structures were seen in the TEM images of the binary PM6Ir1:N3 device. Considerable bright regions can be seen in the TEM image of the binary PM6Ir1:ITIC-Th device, leading to enlarged phase separation with a lack of donor/acceptor interfaces for exciton dissociation and electron transport. After adding more ITIC-Th, the TEM image of the ternary blend system showed a gradually altered morphology and pronounced phase separation, implying that ITIC-Th can be employed as a morphology regulator. A better phase-separated morphology could be formed, leading to efficient exciton dissociation and electron transport in the ternary blend system with the incorporation of an appropriate amount of ITIC-Th, which can be confirmed from the simultaneous enhancement of JSC and FF in the optimal ternary devices.

In this work, iridium-based polymer PM6Ir1 was selected as a donor and two nonfullerene materials N3 and ITIC-Th were selected as acceptors to prepare ternary PSCs. The PCE of the ternary devices reached 17.22% with 10 wt% ITIC-Th in the acceptor mixture, owing to the simultaneously enhanced VOC of 0.86 V, JSC of 26.53 mA cm−2 and FF of 75.47% with respect to the binary PM6Ir1:N3 device with a PCE of 16.27%. According to the experimental results of EIS, SCLC, 2D-GIWAXS and TEM, the molecular arrangement, charge mobility and phase separation morphology of the ternary blend systems can be well modulated via adding an appropriate amount of ITIC-Th as the morphology regulator. By employing a ternary strategy based on efficient binary PSCs while maintaining simple cell manufacturing technology, an over 5% PCE increase can be acquired. The ternary strategy shows huge promise in fabricating large-scale efficient PSCs.
