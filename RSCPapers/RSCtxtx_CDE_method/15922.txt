The method of fabricating multiple blends including two electron acceptors has been widely adopted to improve the device performances of polymer solar cells (PSCs). When two accepters are used in the active layer of a ternary blend PSC, they are often either designed to form an alloy or connected in parallel or series. These stratagems hold various advantages that contribute to the enhancement of different device parameters of PSCs. The incorporation of more than two acceptors in a PSC is obviously interesting for extending or combining the benefits from various stratagems; however, it is yet to be accomplished due to the challenge of designing and fabricating blends with an appropriate nanostructure. Herein, we introduced a new type of PSC with three parallel-series connected molecular acceptors. This unique electron transfer structure was achieved by paving one electron transfer route using a highly crystalline acceptor and connecting two other poorly crystalline acceptors in series that provide another route in parallel. This novel nanostructure combined the broad-spectrum coverage of the parallel-connected multiple blends with the efficient charge transfer process of the series-connected multiple blends, delivering an enhanced short circuit current (Jsc) while maintaining high open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). This triple-acceptor device not only delivered top power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 15.12%, but also, more importantly, charted a new path for the design of multi-component active layers of PSCs with high performances.

In polymer solar cells (PSCs), the conventional binary blend active layer, composed of one electron donor and one electron acceptor, exhibits limitations in achieving higher device performances, which are crucial for the future commercial applications of PSCs; one of the reasons is that unlike inorganic semiconductors such as silicon, a typical organic molecule or polymer can only absorb photons with their energies spreading within half an electron volt (eV). Therefore, it is challenging to cover a large portion of the solar spectrum with only one or two photoactive materials. Thus, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs from solar radiation is compromised. The introduction of additional photoactive components with complementary absorption is one of the methods to expand the solar spectrum coverage. Broader absorption of the multiple blends means more photons can be captured, which contributes directly to the short circuit current (Jsc) of the resulting PSCs. Fortunately, the recent development of non-fullerene molecular acceptors with high photon absorption coefficient and easily tunable band structures has endorsed the abovementioned concept; moreover, additional photoactive materials with different bandgaps can be utilized in another photovoltaic device that can be placed above or below the existing single-junction PSC to form a tandem device. Another approach is to add these extra materials to the photoactive layer to form multiple blend devices. This multiple blend strategy exhibits a fundamental advantage over that used for the tandem devices in terms of the ease and low cost of fabrication.

It has already been reported that multiple blend PSCs demonstrate improved device performances when compared with binary blend devices; the reported additional materials are polymer sensitizers, fullerene derivatives, non-fullerene small molecules, one-dimensional (1D) quantum dots, two-dimensional (2D) materials,etc., endowing the multiple blend PSCs with versatile tunability and potentially enhancing their performances. Among them, the multiple blend PSCs with two or more donor polymers have been found to exhibit higher PCEs of more than 10% in fullerene devices; however, the challenge of using more than one donor polymer in the active layer lies in the proper control of the ideal nanostructure and phase separation because of the sophisticated polymer chain winding. On the other hand, double-acceptor-based ternary blend PSCs (predominately with molecular acceptors) have also been reported, and their working principles are summarized in Fig. 1a. The conventional approach to incorporate two acceptors into the active layer is to form an alloy between them. In this case, the two acceptors exhibit a unified macroscopic band structure and hence can be recognized as one material to a certain extent; alloy formation is often achieved by energy transfer between acceptors, which is enabled by a good overlap of the photon emission range of one acceptor with the absorption range of the other acceptor; likely due to this reason, the absorption ranges of the two alloy components are required to significantly overlap in alloy systems. Alternatively, the two acceptors can be connected either in parallel or series. In a parallel connection, the two acceptors operate independently for extracting electrons from the donor material and then passing these electrons to the cathode; parallel charge transfer connection is often achieved by one acceptor having relatively lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) but higher highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) than the case of the other acceptor; this forbids the simultaneous exchange of both holes and electrons between them. To ensure that both parallel routes are functional, the two acceptors should be separated clearly into two percolated continuous phases connecting the donor and the cathode. Moreover, the two acceptors shall be able to collect and transport electrons efficiently. Previous studies have not suggested the introduction of charge or energy transfer between the two acceptors to impair the device performances. Hence, in parallel connection case, the energy level matching requirement of the two acceptors is not so strict, and by choosing acceptor materials with largely separated absorption ranges, the absorption spectrum of the ternary blend can be greatly expanded, thus the Jsc can be increased. In this case, the energy alignment is vital, and well-matched energy levels are necessary for realizing high device performances. Despite the strict restriction on the HOMO and LUMO levels of the acceptors, the series connection often delivers intact open circuit voltages (Voc) and outstanding fill factors (FF). In a series connection, the primary acceptor shall have good contact with the donor and the secondary acceptor shall take care of the extraction and transport of electrons to the cathode; due to the same reason, fullerene derivatives are often selected as secondary acceptors in the cascade charge transfer system because of their high electron mobility and low crystallinity, which favors percolation.
The addition of more acceptor components to the active layer is obviously attractive to extend or combine the benefits from various stratagems. However, an active layer with three or more acceptors in either parallel or series connection (Fig. 1b) has not been reported to date. This is likely because of nanostructure control, where the percolation of more than three (including the donor) phases or construction of a cascade with more than three materials in a correct sequence is challenging. To combine the advantages of the parallel- and series-connections, herein, we proposed triple-acceptor parallel-series multiple blends with one electron transfer route being paved by a highly crystalline acceptor (F8IC) and the other being paved by two poorly crystalline acceptors (f8OIC and PC71BM) connected in series. In this unique nanostructure, clear phase separation required by a parallel connection could be driven by the crystallization of the highly crystalline acceptor, which opened up its surroundings for a poorly crystalline cascade mixture to function undisturbedly in parallel. This multiple blend benefits the high spectrum coverage of the parallel connection while maintaining high Voc and FF, as found in series-connected ternary blends, and realizes the prominently improved PCE of 15.12% when compared with those of the corresponding binary (6.26% for PC71BM, 10.13% for f8OIC and 11.40% for F8IC) and ternary devices (14.31% for F8IC:f8OIC), which is the highest value reported to date for multiple blend PSCs.

Herein, single-acceptor devices with the donor/acceptor weight ratio of 1:1.4 were first fabricated and studied before the construction of triple-acceptor PSCs. The narrow bandgap acceptor F8IC was then selected in combination with the previously reported wide bandgap donor polymer PBDTSF-TZNT (Fig. 2a); the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 2b) suggested that F8IC absorbed strongly (over 50% absorbance of the maximum) from 1.3 eV (∼950 nm) up to 1.8 eV (∼690 nm), whereas PBDTSF-TZNT absorbed strongly from 2.1 eV (∼590 nm) up to 2.5 eV (∼490 nm). This combination enabled us to obtain a decent device performance, with the Voc of 0.77 V, the Jsc of 22.61 mA cm−2, the FF of 65.5% and the PCE of 11.40% (Fig. 3 and Table 1). To cover the absorption gap from 1.8 eV to 2.1 eV, a new medium bandgap acceptor, f8OIC, was designed and synthesized in this study (Fig. 2a, the synthetic details are provided in the ESI), which absorbed strongly from 1.8 eV (∼690 nm) to 2.2 eV (∼560 nm). The combination of the abovementioned three materials achieved the extraordinary broad-spectrum coverage from 1.3 eV to 2.5 eV, which covered a large portion of the solar spectrum, with the spectral irradiance brighter than 1 W m−2 nm−1 (Fig. 2b). Moreover, the binary devices containing PBDTSF-TZNT and f8OIC were found to produce decent performances, with the Voc of 0.87 V, the Jsc of 16.36 mA cm−2, the FF of 71.2% and the PCE of 10.13%. The relatively low Jsc of the devices with f8OIC as the acceptor was due to the limited photon absorption ability of f8OIC beyond 2.2 eV; this was supported by the results obtained by the measurement of its external quantum efficiency (EQE) as a function of the photon energy of the incident light (Fig. 3b).

As we expected, the ternary blend PSCs with both F8IC and f8IOC as acceptors showed significantly improved device performances when compared with both F8IC and f8OIC single-acceptor devices. By the addition of f8OIC to the active layer, an improvement in all the device parameters was observed, with the Voc of 0.80 V, the Jsc of 24.63 mA cm−2, the FF of 72.6% and the PCE of 14.31%. The total donor/acceptor weight ratio was kept the same for the ternary devices, and the optimized weight ratio between F8IC and f8OIC was determined to be 1:0.4. The Voc of the ternary device was found to lie between the Voc values of the abovementioned two binary devices. The detail evaluation against the two single-acceptor systems revealed that most of the improvements originated from the increased Jsc. The contribution of the increased Jsc was more obvious from the EQE results, where a clear increase at 1.9 eV could be observed when f8OIC was added. The photon energy range of EQE, over 50%, extended from 1.3 eV all the way up to 3.1 eV, which fully covered the solar spectrum with the spectral irradiance over 1 W m−2 nm−1 (1.4–3.1 eV).
PC71BM was then used as the third acceptor due to its suitable energy levels, high electron mobility and relatively poor tendency to crystallize during the solution process. The LUMO level of PC71BM is around −4 eV, which is lower than that of f8OIC (ELUMO = −3.73 eV), but slightly higher than that of F8IC (ELUMO = −4.08 eV, see Fig. S2 for cyclic voltammetry measurement results). The suitable LUMO assured that PC71BM would only withdraw electrons from f8OIC without affecting F8IC. The performances of the triple-acceptor devices containing PBDTSF-TZNT:F8IC:f8OIC:PC71BM in the weight ratio of 1:1:0.4:0.2 displayed further improvements, respectively. Compared with the case of the ternary blend devices without PC71BM, an identical Voc of 0.80 V and a minor increase in the Jsc to 25.28 mA cm−2 were observed in the quaternary blend devices. The EQE curve of the device with only PC71BM as the acceptor displayed higher EQE than those of the other devices around 3.5 eV likely due to the absorption of PC71BM at low wavelengths. When the EQE curves of the quaternary and ternary blend devices were carefully compared, the EQE increment was not found at 3.5 eV but at 1.9 eV, which overlapped again with the EQE of the binary blend device containing f8IOC. This suggested that the additional PC71BM did not contribute independently as a third parallel charge transfer route, but improved the performance of the electron transfer route containing f8IOC. Therefore, PC71BM extracted electrons from f8OIC, according to our design, through cascade-like LUMO levels. An increased FF of up to 74.8% was also observed, which had been reported in other series-connected ternary blend devices. Finally, the overall PCE of the triple-acceptor devices has been found to reach 15.12%, which is the highest value reported to date for multiple blend PSCs.
Device lifetime is an important parameter for the practical application of PSCs. The stability of the triple-acceptor devices was analyzed by keeping them both in the dark (D1) and under continuous illumination (L1) as per the ISOS protocols. As shown in Fig. S3,Voc was almost unchanged after 300 hours under both conditions. After the same duration, Jsc was maintained above 90% and 80% under the D1 and L1 conditions, respectively. However, FF reduced drastically over 20% within the first 100 and 30 hours under the D1 and L1 conditions, respectively. The overall PCE reduced to two-third under the D1 and half under the L1 condition. The major contribution to the degradation originated from FF; this suggested that the nanostructure stability of the triple-acceptor devices required to be improved.

A high and balanced charge transport has been proven to be necessary for lowering the charge recombination and achieving high FF and PCE. Thus, we investigated the mechanism of how PC71BM assisted f8OIC by evaluating the charge transport abilities of the active layers via space-charge-limited conductivity measurements (SCLC, Fig. S4 and Table S1). The hole/electron mobilities (μh/μe) were 3.4 × 10−4/2.3 × 10−4, 2.1 × 10−4/6.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 4.5 × 10−4/5.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 6.4 × 10−4/6.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the f8OIC single-acceptor, F8IC single-acceptor, double-acceptor and triple-acceptor devices, respectively. The severely imbalanced charge carrier mobilities of f8OIC (μh/μe = 1.47) and F8IC (μh/μe = 0.38)-based single-acceptor devices resulted in higher charge recombination probability, thus giving rise to lower FF values. By combining F8IC and f8OIC into a double-acceptor device, μh was significantly improved owing to the optimized morphology for enhanced hole transport, resulting in more balanced charge carrier mobilities (μh/μe = 0.88). Therefore, an obviously improved FF was observed in the related devices. Moreover, by adding a small amount of PC71BM to the abovementioned double-acceptor devices, the charge carrier mobilities were further improved to a more balanced status (μh/μe = 1.07), which contributed to the further enhanced FF and PCE values of the final triple-acceptor device. As PC71BM did not significantly interfere with the electron transfer process of F8IC, the increase in the overall electron mobility was a sign of a dramatic improvement in the electron transport ability through the f8IOC/PC71BM cascade.


Despite their similar chemical structures, the much higher electron mobility of F8IC as compared to that of f8OIC was may be partially due to its higher crystallinity. Clear features were visible in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the neat F8IC thin film, as shown in Fig. S5. The root-mean-square (RMS) of the surface was 1.57 nm. Strong diffractions from F8IC were also obtained by grazing-incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS, Fig. 4). A (010) π-stacking diffraction for F8IC was observed to be located at 1.8 Å−1, predominantly out-of-plane, suggesting that F8IC mostly adopted a face-on configuration on the substrate. The lamellar stacking diffraction of F8IC was observed mostly on the horizon of the GIWAXS image. It was interesting to note that not only the (100) lamellar diffraction was found at 0.4 Å−1, but a (200) diffraction was also visible at 0.8 Å−1 for the neat F8IC film. The appearance of higher-order diffraction is a clear sign of high crystallinity. When F8IC was blended with other acceptors, e.g. f8OIC or PC71BM, strong phase separation was observed, where F8IC accumulated into tall islands 100–150 nm in diameter, resulting in very high roughness. As shown in Fig. 5, the RMS of the AFM height image reached 2.01 nm and 12.7 nm when F8IC was blended with f8OIC and PC71BM, respectively. This indicated extremely poor miscibility of F8IC with the other acceptors. In stark contrast, both f8OIC and PC71BM showed much poorer crystallinity, indicated by smoother films and much low diffraction intensities (Fig S5). The RMS was found to be as low as 0.57 and 0.50 nm for the neat f8OIC and PC71BM surfaces, respectively (Fig. S5). More importantly, the blend of f8OIC and PC71BM displayed an even lower roughness (RMS = 0.48 nm) with no sign of visible phase separation. Unlike that of F8IC, the GIWAXS image of neat f8OIC was almost featureless (Fig. S6), suggesting very low crystallinity of f8OIC. The semicircle diffraction peak located at q = 0.3 Å−1 was observed for the two neat acceptor films due to the diffraction of the PEDOT:PSS layer under the thin films.

As F8IC was the only highly crystalline small molecule, when the AFM images of PBDTSF-TZNT:F8IC, PBDTSF-TZNT:F8IC:f8OIC and the quaternary blends were compared, very similar nanostructures were observed (Fig. 6). The F8IC crystals were the main visible features in all the three AFM images; however, a decrease in roughness occurred when more components were added; moreover, in all the GIWAXS images of the devices containing F8IC, almost all the diffractions could be attributed to either F8IC or the donor polymer when it was present. F8IC was found with a face-on configuration, and the donor polymer was observed to be standing edge-on on the substrate. The only trend noticed herein in the integrated diffractograms was that when more components were added, the intensities of the F8IC diffractions, including the (100), (200) and (010) diffractions, reduced. The reduction in RMS and diffraction intensity was likely due to the reduction in the F8IC percentage in these thin films. Based on these observations, it could be concluded that in the triple-acceptor devices, the crystallinity of the multiple blends not only depended on F8IC but also on f8OIC and PC71BM, as illustrated in the schematic shown in Fig. 5f.
To confirm the electron-transfer process in the parallel-series, photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL, Fig. 7) of the neat as well as blends of the acceptors was conducted. A 680 nm excitation laser was used to generate PL from both FOIC and f8OIC, and the PL spectra, normalized to the film absorption at 680 nm measured by UV-vis absorption, were obtained. When PC71BM was added to f8OIC, the PL intensities were reduced at both 1.45 and 1.7 eV, suggesting charge transfer between these two materials (Fig. 7a). This approved the ability of PC71BM to withdraw electrons from f8OIC in the cascade. On the other hand, when f8OIC was added to F8IC, the PL of f8OIC was almost extinct (Fig. 7b). Moreover, no distinguishable PL signal could be observed beyond 1.45 eV, where f8IOC emitted strongly on its own. In addition, the PL intensity of F8IC was enhanced. This suggested energy transfer from f8OIC to F8IC. The enhancement in the intensity of the PL emission was more obvious when PC71BM was added to F8IC, and the PL intensity almost doubled than that in the case of the neat F8IC acceptor. However, in the blend of all three acceptors, the PL intensity was slightly reduced, suggesting that PC71BM quenched the PL of f8IOC efficiently to hinder most of the energy transfer ways towards F8IC. Hence, no alloy formation was observed in this study when three acceptors were blended together. By comparing the alloy formation in the PBDTSF-TZNT:F8IC:f8OIC ternary blend and the parallel series in the quaternary blend, it was found that the electron cascade efficiently transferred the photo-generated electrons to the cathode, quenched the energy transfer to F8IC and improved the device performances. Hence, we believe that the parallel series connection is more efficient than the alloy system reported in our study.

The working mechanism of electron transfer between the acceptors was further confirmed by the fabrication and J–V measurements of acceptor-only devices (Fig. S7 and Table S2). A much higher Jsc was obtained for the f8OIC:PC71BM device (0.61 mA cm−2) when compared with that for the neat f8OIC (0.25 mA cm−2) or PC71BM devices (0.09 mA cm−2), supporting that charge transfer occurred between f8OIC and PC71BM. In contrast, the Jsc values of the f8OIC:F8IC (0.2 mA cm−2) and F8IC: PC71BM devices (0.12 mA cm−2) were comparable to that of the neat F8IC device (0.17 mA cm−2); this excluded the possibility of charge transfer between F8IC and f8OIC (or PC71BM). In other words, in the competition between the extinction of excitons generated within f8IOC with the emission of energy and charge generation, the insufficient charge transport ability of f8IOC favored the transfer of energy towards the F8IC molecules in the ternary blend; however, with the assistance of PC71BM, the improved charge transfer process outcompeted the exciton extinction and hence improved the overall device performances. Therefore, we concluded that the electron transfer in the triple-acceptor devices mainly occurred in the parallel-series, as illustrated in the schematic shown in Fig. 5g.

Using these insights into the nanostructure and charge transfer mechanism, further investigations were conducted on the charge generation process of the PSCs constituted with single-acceptor devices, containing either F8IC or f8OIC as an acceptor, double-acceptor devices, and triple-acceptor devices. Fig. 7c and d show the transient photocurrent and photovoltage decay kinetics. The charge extraction times calculated from the transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements were 0.97, 1.04, 0.85 and 0.74 μs for the F8IC single-acceptor, f8OIC single-acceptor, double-acceptor and triple acceptor devices, respectively. On the other hand, the carrier lifetimes calculated from the traces of transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements were 0.60, 0.52, 0.67 and 0.83 μs for F8IC, f8OIC, the double-acceptor, and the triple-acceptor devices, respectively. The faster charge extraction with higher carrier lifetime of the triple acceptor devices indicated less charge recombination. We plotted a double-logarithmic diagram of the photocurrent density (Jph = JL − JD, where JL is the current density under 100 mW cm−2 and JD is the dark current) versus the effective voltage (Veff = V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage, JL = JD and V is the applied voltage; Fig. 8a). The triple-acceptor device reached a saturation plateau at lower Veff, and its Jsat was higher than that of the other devices. The Jsat value of the f8OIC device was also found to be significantly lower than that of the other devices due to the lower current output caused by the narrower absorption spectrum. Calculating the Jph/Jsat (where Jph is the photocurrent density under short circuit current conditions), which is linked to the efficiency of charge collection, the highest value of 0.96 for the triple-acceptor device was determined, whereas 0.91, 0.89 and 0.95 were achieved for the F8IC, f8OIC and the double-acceptor device, respectively, suggesting highly efficient power generation process in the triple-acceptor device. In the multiple blend PSCs, foreign molecules, when positioned in a charge transfer route, might behave as charge traps. These traps could harm the device performances by increasing the probability of the trap-assisted recombination. Therefore, we investigated the light intensity (Plight) dependence of the Voc and Jsc of the PSC devices to obtain a more in-depth understanding of their recombination process (Fig. 8b and c). The values of n (n = Sq/KT, where S is the slope of Vocversus lnPlight, q is the electric charge of a carrier, K is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin) for the binary devices with F8IC and f8OIC separately, the double-acceptor devices and the triple-acceptor devices were determined to be 1.38, 1.31, 1.29 and 1.22, respectively. The lower n value for the triple-acceptor device suggested the reduced trap-assisted recombination. The slope (α) of lnJscversus lnPlight for these four devices was 0.971, 0.983, 0.989 and 0.992, respectively. The triple-acceptor device showed an α value closest to 1, thereby proposing the lowest probability for bimolecular recombination.

In summary, we demonstrated rationally designed triple-acceptor PSCs with two parallel electron transfer routes, one of which was constituted by two acceptors connected in series. The four photoactive materials, i.e. the donor polymer and three small molecular acceptors, provided a complementary absorption for delivering an EQE response over 50% from 1.3 eV up to 3.1 eV. This range covered the solar spectrum, with the spectral irradiance brighter than 1 W m−2 nm−1. In this multiple blend device, the electrons were withdrawn independently from the donor polymer by two acceptors, i.e. F8IC and f8OIC. F8IC formed a highly crystalline nanostructure, which conducted electrons efficiently to the cathode. f8OIC with low-mobility and medium bandgap also transferred electrons to the cathode efficiently through the third acceptor PC71BM. This unique parallel-series connected device structure displayed advantages, such as high Jsc and FF, intrinsic to both the parallel- and the series-connected ternary blend devices. The triple-acceptor devices show the highest PCE of 15.12%, which is the highest value reported to date for multiple blend PSCs. Our study demonstrated that via careful component selection, more than three photoactive materials could be incorporated in one blend to achieve the desired nanostructure, which delivered outstanding device performances. Thus, this newly proposed parallel-series working mechanism in triple-acceptor devices charts a new path for the design of high-performance multiple blend PSCs, which will also inspire other elegant multi-component active layer designs for elevating the efficiency of PSCs in the future.
