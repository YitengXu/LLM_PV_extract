Photovoltaic devices have become ideal alternatives to common energy sources due to their excellent mechanical robustness and high power conversion efficiency, which can meet the human requirements for green, inexpensive and portable electricity sources. Moreover, due to the rapid development of wearable devices, telecommunication, transportation, advanced sensors, etc., the need for green and accessible power sources for these state-of-the-art devices accompanied with appropriate mechanical stability has become a new challenge. In this regard, flexible–wearable photovoltaic platforms can be easily adapted to any device/substrate and can supply diverse electronic devices with their required energy via harvesting energy from sunlight. Similarly, photovoltaic platforms can be integrated into hybrid platforms and can be used in diverse applications. Herein, we summarize the recent approaches to developing flexible–wearable solar cells as energy sources for supplying self-powered wearable devices. In this regard, first, recent advances in transparent flexible electrodes and their diversities are reported; then, recently developed flexible solar cells and important factors for designing these platforms are summarized. Further, flexible solar cells are categorized into five different sections (i.e., perovskite, dye-sensitized, organic, fiber-shaped and textile solar cells) and their mechanisms, working principles and design criteria along with their recent advances have been discussed. Finally, novel applications of wearable sensors/devices are summarized and reported to highlight the functionality of these practical platforms.

The rapid development of electronic devices, telecommunication systems and advanced sensors along with the increasing concerns regarding global warming have highlighted the requirements for portable, lightweight and flexible sources of electricity that can supply these state-of-the-art devices in areas far from official electricity grids and can also be integrated with diverse substrates. In the current review, this requirement is addressed via providing the recent progress in flexible photovoltaic devices; we summarize the recent advances in their flexibility, mechanical robustness, transparent electrode configurations, design principles, working mechanisms, alternative material or device structures and functionality/performance under diverse circumstances. In this regard, flexible solar cells are categorized into three main groups, including perovskite, dye-sensitized and organic solar cells, while recently developed configurations are summarized and reported. Moreover, other geometric categories of solar cells in the form of fibers and fabrics are summarized and evaluated. In addition, hybrid types of these state-of-the-art energy sources with battery/supercapacitors are introduced, and recent approaches to obtain mountable sensors and meet their energy requirements are reported in this review.


Due to the rapid development of technology and increasing worldwide concern about global warming, many efforts have been made to develop green, renewable and inexpensive sources of energy that are adaptable to any surface or device. In particular, solar power-related technologies have attracted considerable attention as ideal alternatives to conventional energy sources. Earth receives about four million exajoules (1 EJ = 1018 J) of solar energy annually from the sun, of which about 5 × 104 EJ are claimed to be easily harvestable. The overall amount of received solar energy in the Earth's atmosphere is about 342 W m−2, where about 30% of the total amount of irradiation is reflected or scattered back into space and only about 70% remains (239 W m−2); thus, its total amount is variable at diverse sites on the planet. Depending on the location, the annual average of received solar power lies in the range of 60 to 250 W m−2. Despite the fact that mankind can gain all its required energy/power from sunlight, the contribution of solar energy as a global energy source is still negligible compared with conventional non-renewable energy sources. Additionally, the growth of solar energy-related technologies is facing various obstacles, such as low efficiency of solar cells, economic hindrances, shortage of well-trained manpower, lack of required infrastructure, and financial restrictions.

Among the developed devices for harvesting sunlight, flexible and wearable solar cells have become ideal candidates for the development of practical photovoltaic devices due to their flexibility, light weight, facile processability, potential integration into curved surfaces, adaptability to roll-to-roll production procedures and facile transportation and storage. Moreover, the term “flexible photovoltaic device” should be precisely defined to develop a scientific protocol to exactly examine the degree of flexibility. In most cases, designers use polymeric-based flexible substrates for fabrication of flexible photovoltaic devices; these substrates are stretchable, twistable and bendable. The bendability is frequently measured to determine the degree of flexibility through the index of the curvature radius, where practical electronic devices should maintain about 80% of their initial features after bending with a curvature radius from 10 cm to 1 mm. In this regard, we can use the term “flexible” for the developed electronic devices. Similarly, if the curvature radius declines to 1 mm or less, we can recognize the final substrate as an ultra-flexible substrate.
Additionally, photovoltaic devices can be mainly categorized into three main groups, including perovskite solar cells (PSCs), dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and organic solar cells (OSCs). In this regard, these categories of photovoltaic devices mainly consist of three parts, the anode, cathode and photoactive layer; an electron/hole transport layer is used in perovskite and organic solar cells to decrease the charge recombination, while dye-sensitized solar cells contain electrolytes for their charge transport and redox reactions. Generally, in most flexible solar cells, all fabricated parts should be flexible, especially the main electrodes of solar cells that serve as substrates for the active layers of photovoltaic devices.
In addition, flexible–wearable solar cells represent practical alternatives to common electricity sources due to their high power-per-weight ratios, ideal mechanical stability/robustness (i.e., bending and compression) and economic fabrication procedures/devices. These photovoltaic devices are future energy supplies that can be adapted with any substrate as portable power sources, which is fundamentally essential for bases, transportation devices and instruments far from the official electricity grid. More importantly, flexible solar cells can be coupled with bags, cloths, shelters, aircrafts, cars, etc. to provide them with fantastic power-per-weight ratios, with favorable production costs compared with other common technologies. In Fig. 1, an overview of these portable photovoltaic power supplies can be seen.
Furthermore, the development of hybrid platforms shows interesting potential for supplying electronic devices. In this case, the integration of diverse platforms that gather the required energy from different sources (i.e., sunlight, thermal energy and mechanical energy (e.g., wind energy, wave energy and vibration)) exhibits far better performance compared with conventional individual energy sources. For example, a hybrid platform consisting of wind, solar and chemical energy harvesters can light up 20 blue light-emitting diodes (LED), charge a supercapacitor or Li-ion battery, and even supply wearable wind speed or temperature sensors much more efficiently than its individual harvesting platforms. In fact, these hybrid platforms provide free/green sources of energy for consumers under different circumstances in diverse locations in areas where the energy grid is not available.
Herein, our aim is to review recent achievements in flexible–wearable photovoltaic devices to summarize the achieved progress and present a wide range of alternatives for designers of these practical energy sources to address the current flaws and obstacles to the development of practical portable energy sources. In this regard, firstly, advances in transparent flexible electrodes and their diversities are summarized; then, recently developed flexible solar cells are reported, and important criteria for their design, fabrication and testing are evaluated. Thereafter, flexible solar cells are categorized into five different groups, i.e., perovskite, dye-sensitized, organic, fiber-shaped and fabric solar cells, and their mechanisms, developed active layers, photovoltaic functionality, design principles and important functionality factors are examined and presented. Finally, some newly developed wearable devices are evaluated and their power requirements are checked to examine their compatibility with the photovoltaic platforms considered in this review.

Transparent conductive electrodes are among the most crucial parts of photovoltaic devices; their design, light transmittance and sheet resistance significantly affect the overall performance and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of photovoltaic devices. This vital part allows the transmittance/travel of light into the photovoltaic device and thus improves the light harvesting rate; its functionality is highly dependent on the employed deposition techniques, and these techniques should avoid/minimize damages to the underlying active layers, which mainly arises from high-temperature deposition approaches. Depending on the type of photovoltaic platform, diverse electrodes have been utilized for the development of flexible solar cells, among which transparent conductive oxides (TCO), metallic-based transparent/semitransparent electrodes, thin metallic layers, hybrid layers consisting of a dielectric-thin metallic layer-dielectric (DTD) structure, metallic grids, transparent conductive polymeric (TCP) layers and transparent nanomaterials (TNs) (e.g., graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and metallic nanowires (e.g., silver nanowires)) can be mentioned.

In addition, indium-doped thin oxide (ITO) is one of the most well-known and frequently used materials for transparent electrodes in optoelectronic/photovoltaic devices due to its ideal transparency (>80%), fine sheet resistance (>20 Ω sq−1) and excellent environmental stability. However, the limited resources of ITO, its large-scale consumption in solar panels and the increasing cost of this practical material have increased global concern for finding alternatives to ITO. Therefore, many efforts have been made to identify alternatives to ITO for the development of transparent flexible photovoltaic devices; Table 1 tabulates the most recent approaches to identify transparent flexible electrodes for these devices.

More importantly, two main specifications, namely the resistance and transparency of the sheets, are major criteria for selecting an optimum material as a transparent flexible electrode to improve the functionality/performance of photovoltaic platforms. Additionally, by neglecting surface/interface effects and considering the fully uniform material, the sheet resistance of the selected electrode (RSH) can be obtained from RSH = (σt)−1, which has an inverse relationship with the thickness of the electrode; meanwhile, the transparency (T) can be obtained via the relation T = exp(−αt), which decays exponentially with t according to the Beer–Lambert law. In the mentioned equations, σ and α are the wavelength-dependent electrical conductivity and the absorption coefficient, respectively.
Furthermore, increasing the thickness of the electrode will decrease the transparency and sheet resistance of the electrode. In addition to the thickness dependency of the transparency of the electrode and its neglected wavelength dependency, other factors related to interfaces/surface effects, such as surface roughness, optical interference and patterning traces, along with production/processing procedures play dominant roles in the determination of the transparency and sheet resistance of a material.
Polymeric substrates (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN)) modified with transparent conductive oxides have also attracted considerable attention as alternative front and bottom electrodes. However, these hybrid structures suffer from some disadvantages, e.g., brittleness, rigidness and heaviness, which adversely affects their flexibility and performance. Likewise, polymeric substrates cannot be used at high working temperatures; for example, DSSCs require either the crystal transition of titanium dioxide (TiO2) or interconnection bonding among TiO2 nanoparticles through high temperature processing at about 450 °C to 550 °C. Like DSSCs, PSCs require high working temperatures to process the TiO2 nanoparticles. To resolve this flaw, low-temperature processing of TiO2 nanoparticles and the usage of titanium foil and other surrogate nanomaterials, such as ZnO and PC61BM, have been considered as possible alternatives.
However, these modified substrates are not lightweight or flexible enough to meet the standards of an ideal flexible photovoltaic device. To address this problem, some researchers have considered flexible fiber-shaped solar cells, all of which consist of free-standing electrodes incorporated with metal wires, as alternatives for front and bottom electrodes. In this regard, two diverse metal wires are twisted together and coupled with an active material between them, which leads to the formation of a fiber-shaped solar cell. These solar cells are lightweight; however, the lower number of contact sites between the twisted metal wires decreases the contact areas between them, which can lead to increased ohmic losses and decreased photovoltaic performance of the final structure. In the next sections, these interesting photovoltaic structures will be evaluated.
More importantly, integration of mechanical robustness with ideal transparency is an under progressing and crucial matter for the fabrication of practical and efficient transparent flexible solar cells. These platforms should maintain their PCEs, sheet resistances and transparencies at optimum levels even after various mechanical deformations. In this regard, Tran et al. grew high quality graphene via plasma-assisted thermal chemical vapor deposition (PATCVD) as a highly flexible and semi-transparent bottom electrode; they then integrated this layer with a highly transparent DTD layer of AZO–Ag–AZO to fabricate a highly flexible and semi-transparent PSC with ideal PCE. A view of this PSC and the bandgaps of its layers can be seen in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively. The outcome of this work showed that the developed platform has a transmittance of about 26% at a wavelength of 700 nm along with a PCE of 14.2%. Additionally, further evaluation of this PSC showed that even after mechanical deformation, the developed device maintains its sheet resistance at an optimum level, which indicates stable transparency and functionality (Fig. 2(c)). Moreover, this platform maintained more than 90% of its total PCE even after 1000 bending cycles under a tensile strain of 1.5% and showed ideal power conversion stability even after 500 h (Fig. 2(d)–(f)).
In another attempt to integrate flexibility with transparency, Wang et al. developed a mechanically robust and highly transparent OSC using an integrated oxygen-doped Ag layer sandwiched between ZnO films applied on a PET substrate; a 3D image of this device and the respective band gaps of its layers can be seen in Fig. 3(a). In this case, the doping process of Ag with oxygen (O/Ag is 3.4%) significantly improved the nanomorphology of the Ag layer, improved the transparency to about 91% to 95% in the 400 to 1000 nm wavelength range and exhibited a sheet resistance of 20 Ω sq−1 using PET–ZnO–AgOx–ZnO as an electrode with a very low thickness of 8 nm for AgOx. Additionally, modification of the device with the newly designed electrode showed an 18% increase in the transmittance compared with a conventional ZnO–Ag–ZnO electrode and increased the PCE from 5.65% to 6.34%. Furthermore, the total performance of the developed device, including the sheet resistance and PCE, declined with a further increase in the bending radius; meanwhile, the sheet resistance of the transparent electrode decreased and then leveled off with further increase in the thickness of the electrode (Fig. 3(b)–(e)). This data showed that OSCs exhibit lower mechanical stability than PSCs and cannot maintain their full PCE/sheet resistance under continuous applied mechanical force; this is due to their weaker 3D structures.
Furthermore, the production of flexible transparent electrodes should be scalable and continuous to be applicable for the fabrication of transparent flexible solar cells. In this regard, Kang et al. introduced capillary printing technology to align Ag NWs in a preferred direction and control the percolation threshold of the Ag NWs toward the development of highly transparent conductive flexible electrodes for photovoltaic devices. In this regard, alignment of the Ag NWs improved the optical transmittance of the electrode to about 96.7% and minimized the sheet resistance to 19.5 Ω sq−1; this shows considerable improvement compared with a randomly distributed Ag NW network, which exhibited a transmittance and sheet resistance of 92.9% and 20 Ω sq−1, respectively. Moreover, the aligned network improved the luminance of light-emitting diodes (PLED) by 30%. Integration of this electrode composed of an aligned Ag NW network in a PSC showed a PCE of 8.57%, which is among the highest power conversion rates achieved for Ag NW-based PSC solar cells; a view of this production technique is shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). Additionally, in Fig. 4(c) and (d), a view of the PLED and PSC developed using the fabricated transparent electrode along with the band gaps of their deposited layers can be seen, respectively.
Additionally, while the randomly distributed network lost most of its performance during applied mechanical load, the aligned network not only improved the sheet resistance and transparency of the developed electrode, but also enhanced the luminance, PCE and mechanical resistance of the developed device. These platforms can be readily used for the production of highly stable, mechanically robust, efficient, flexible solar cells with ideal transparency that retain most of their performance even under severe mechanical loads; the performance of the modified devices with aligned Ag NW-based networks can be seen in Fig. 4(e)–(h).
The advantages of transparent conductive electrodes have been proved in diverse studies; they can enhance the performance/functionality of photovoltaic devices. To this end, a semi-transparent PSC was fabricated via a lamination procedure in which a combined electronic glue-based laminator was coupled with an interfacial modifier to serve as a one-step production procedure for the fabrication of flexible PSCs coupled with transparent conductive electrodes. The fabricated solar cell is metal-free, flexible, semitransparent, highly efficient and self-encapsulated; it presents a PCE and quantum efficiency of 3% and 70%, respectively, under 1 sun irradiation (AM 1.5). As shown in Fig. 5(a), the composition of this device consisted of ITO/Cs2CO3/polymeric blend/PEDOT:PSS/D-sorbitol/ITO, while in Fig. 5(b), the mechanism of dipole layer formation on the ITO substrate can be seen; it has a reducing effect on the function of ITO layer. In another attempt, a semi-transparent organic solar cell (OSC) was developed that was composed of ITO/ZnO/C60-SAM/PC71BM/PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag, where the hybrid MoO3–Ag layer was used as the transparent conductive electrode and the whole device exhibited tunable PCE and transparency ranging between 4.25% and 7.56% and 2% and 36%, respectively, obtained under 1.5 global illumination; a view of this device can be seen in Fig. 5(c). In other work, a visible light-transparent PSC was developed based on a Ag NW composite as the transparent top conductive electrode/TiO2/active layer/ITO/PEDOT:PSS via a solution processing technique. The active layer of this structure is less sensitive to the visible light region, harvests most of the incident solar energy from the infrared region and presents a PCE and transparency of 4% and 66% at a wavelength of 550 nm, respectively. These solar cells can be used as photovoltaic windows or building-integrated solar platforms for diverse applications; a view of this solar cell can be seen in Fig. 5(d).
In other work, a DTD transparent electrode was used to develop a flexible PSC with ideal PCE, where the structure of the flexible electrode consisted of MoOx–Ag–MoOx; it exhibited fine transparency and an ideal photo-electron conversion rate. Additionally, during the examinations, the thickness of Ag layer was set to 7 nm, while the thickness of the MoOx layers was varied to check their effects on the sheet resistance and transparency of the developed flexible electrode along with the PCE of the final device. The achieved results showed that variation of the MoOx layer thickness to 5, 10, 20 and 30 nm can change the PCE of the device to 10.9%, 11.8%, 12.9% and 9.31%, respectively, where the thickness of 20 nm showed the optimum value. These outcomes clearly showed that the optimum thickness and sheet resistance of the electrode have direct effects on the quality/performance of photovoltaic devices and should be precisely optimized. In Fig. 6(a) and (b), the composition of this platform can be seen, while Fig. 6(c) and (d) exhibit the PCE stability of the device under applied mechanical load along with the changes in the sheet resistance of DTD and the metallic–dielectric electrode over 4 weeks, respectively. As shown, the top dielectric layer protects the Ag layer from oxidation; if the electrode is developed without protecting the metallic layer, the sheet resistance will increase, which can lead to deterioration of the light harvesting rate.
Betacncur et al. developed a semi-transparent hybrid OSC consisting of PTB7:PC71BM that exhibited visible light transmittance of 30% along with PCE of 5.6%. A view of this developed platform is illustrated in Fig. 6(e); employing an ad hoc path along with a trap for near-ultraviolet/infrared beams to maximize the light harvesting rate can improve the photon-to-charge conversion to about 80%. In fact, with these structures, the emitted beams can be governed and harvested to enhance the total PCE of the device.
More importantly, in addition to the total PCE and sheet resistance of solar cells, it is fundamentally essential to develop their top electrodes so that most emitted photons pass through without adversely affecting their energy or dissipating them into heat due to ohmic losses. Fig. 7 shows some examples of these transparent electrodes. These platforms can be used in future building-integrated platforms, where they simultaneously act as a flexible/mechanically robust window and solar cell.
Along with wise material selection and structural design, the micromorphology of solar cells should also be carefully considered to avoid unwanted dissipation as a result of high temperature processing, which can deteriorate the active layers or lead to weak interfacial interactions/adhesion between deposited layers. In Fig. 8(a)–(d), SEM images of a neat MAPbI3 perovskite layer, MAPbI3 deposited on a NiOx/graphene layer, the PCBM/MAPbI3/NiOx/graphene structure and the final view of the fabricated PSC can be seen, respectively. As shown, usage of the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique led to the formation of a highly compact perovskite layer with pore sizes ranging from 500 to 700 nm. The surface morphology of the developed perovskite layer plays a crucial role in the interfacial contact and exact determination of the thickness of the other layers. Additionally, the surface roughness of the perovskite layer should be covered with a thick enough electron transport layer (ETL) to decrease shutting of the final device. As shown in Fig. 8(e) and (f), the MAPbI3 perovskite layer exhibits a very rough surface, while deposition of PCBM on its surface enhanced its morphology and improved the performance of the final composition. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 8(g), deposition of Ag NWs into the PEDOT:PSS layer led to the formation of a highly transparent laminated electrode with a thickness of 125 nm. As illustrated, the developed electrode is flat enough to be used as the top flexible transparent electrode, where Ag NWs covered about 29% of the developed film. Additionally, cross sectional images revealed that Ag NW junctions were embedded into the polymeric structure of PEDOT:PSS, which can improve their adhesion/interaction and minimize ohmic losses. This composition of the top electrode led to a better current pathway, less shutting and a decrease in the fill factor of the photovoltaic device.
Furthermore, the morphology of electrode materials can significantly affect their transparency and sheet resistance and, thus, the final PCE of the solar cell. In this case, oxidation of Ag via a minimal oxidation process to AgOx can improve the morphology of the metallic layer of DTD-type electrodes and significantly improve their transparency/sheet resistance; a view of this strategy can be seen in Fig. 9. As shown, deposition of a neat Ag layer leads to the formation of a porous layer with excess voids, which can decrease the sheet resistance and transparency and, thereby, the PCE of the device. On the other hand, oxidation of Ag to AgOx with an O/Ag ratio of 3.4% can improve the nanomorphology of the metallic layer, increase the compactness of the middle metallic layer and thus improve the interfacial interactions, decrease the sheet resistance and improve the transparency of the flexible electrode.
Furthermore, in the case of solar cell transparency, usage of transparent electrodes is fundamentally essential to develop semitransparent or transparent photovoltaic devices. Thus, for each transparent solar cell, it is necessary to investigate the transmission spectra and sheet resistance (Rs) of the bottom and top electrodes of the device. In a DTD developed by Ou et al., an ultrathin Au layer was selected and deposited as a seed layer to modulate the surface energy of the device and improve the growth conditions of the Ag layer. Additionally, two MoO3 layers were considered as dielectric layers to improve the transparency of the electrodes, while Alq3 was considered as an organic capping agent which can modify light during coupling. As shown in Fig. 10(a), the developed multilayered electrode which consisted of a b-MoO3/Au/Ag/t-MoO3/Alq3 structure presented an average light transmission (ALT) of about 88.67% (for wavelengths between 500 and 2000 nm), which exhibits significant improvement compared with Ag, Au/Ag, b-MoO3/Au/Ag and even ITO electrodes; the latter is a conventional transparent electrode with an ALT of about 68.40%. In Fig. 10(b), the sheet resistances of ITO and different Au layers can be seen, while Fig. 10(c)–(e) shows the transmittance and current density of the developed transparent electrodes. Additionally, in Fig. 10(f) and (g), diverse factors of the solar cell performance were evaluated by flexibility studies. As shown, the developed semitransparent device with a 30 nm Au electrode retained its PCE level of 88% after 100 bending cycles with a 3.9 mm bending radius; meanwhile, it did not show considerable deterioration of other parameters, such as open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). In most cases, the deterioration of the PCE of solar cells after bending tests can be attributed to the formation and propagation of small cracks within the electrodes, which can adversely affect their performance. In Table 2, the overall performance and ALT of diverse electrodes can be seen. As tabulated within this table, ITO has the highest transparency in comparison with Au layers, while further increasing the thickness of the Au layer decreased the transparency of the device by ALT.

In other work, Khadem et al. developed an ultra-thin micro-patterned structure based on single-bilayer deposition of H-free diamond-shaped carbon along with ITO. The developed film was deposited on a PET substrate via magnetron sputtering to improve the resistance of the device against wear and enhance the optical transparency of the PET layer. The outcome of their study showed that the wear resistance and transparency of the developed flexible photovoltaic device were significantly improved. In Fig. 11, a view of their production procedure can be seen.
For the development of a practical flexible solar cell, sufficient sunlight transmission is a vital factor that can significantly affect the total PCE of the device. In this case, the transparency of each layer should be examined and maintained at optimum conditions. In this case, the primary PET substrate presented a transparency of about 81% at 400 nm, which gradually increased to about 89% to 90% at a wavelength of 600 nm; this transparency rate remained steady to the end of the region, with negligible variations. The developed micro-patterned layer showed transparency, with only 1% to 1.7% deviation compared with the PET substrate; this confirms the significance of the developed micro-patterned layer to the transparency. In Fig. 12(a), laser-enhanced optical analysis of the developed micro-patterned electrode on the PET substrate can be seen. Moreover, in Fig. 12(b) and (c), the transparency of the developed samples prior to and after erosion tests can be seen. As shown, the developed device maintained its transparency at a balanced rate of 80% even after the erosion test. The performance analysis of the developed substrates can be seen in Fig. 12(d).
In other work, Lee et al. designed and developed ultrathin, multilayered highly transparent electrodes for expansion of flexible solar cells. In this case, their fabricated electrode consisted of a gallium-doped zinc oxide layer (GZO), a thin film Ag layer, and another GZO layer as an optoelectronic-controlling layer; the electrode showed superior transmittance of about 90% at a wavelength of 550 nm. The developed transparent electrode also demonstrated low sheet resistance of about 9.4 Ω sq−1 at a thickness of 100 nm. Moreover, the GZO-BL layer improved the adhesion of the Ag layer through treatment with a mixture of acetic acid:nitric acid (10:2), which enhanced the surface energy of the developed substrate. Additionally, this developed electrode can reflect back diverse colors without serious changes in the total PCE of the photovoltaic device. The obtained results showed that the final photovoltaic device presented a PCE of about 4.8% along with an average transmittance of 20%. In Fig. 13, the variations in color at different wavelengths of the developed transparent electrode can be seen.

Many attempts have been made to improve the flexibility of photovoltaic devices, where precise evaluation of flexibility was found to be fundamentally essential. In fact, among mechanical properties, flexibility is known to be the main advantage of printed modules based on semiconductors. A practical photovoltaic device must survive the rigidity of roll-to-toll deposition of semiconductor layers and remain strong against environmental factors, such as exposure to wind, snow, rain and humidity, along with thermal contraction and expansion. A flexible solar cell should present fine mechanical performance in terms of shear, impact, stretching, twisting, folding and bending, and it must meet the standard requirements of the aforementioned properties.

Additionally, the flexibility of the used materials is important; in fact, used materials in diverse layers of photovoltaic devices must store and dissipate the applied mechanical loads in a way that prevents the degradation of the device. To date, flexible photovoltaic devices have been subjected to different mechanical and flexibility evaluations to determine their mechanical strength and flexibility. In this regard, some evaluations have been employed to mechanically characterize developed photovoltaic devices, such as examination of the elasticity of the conjugated polymeric active layer and electrode materials (e.g., PEDOT:PSS), crack onset strain tests of separated layers, the single cantilever beam method (SCBM) (to study the cohesion of each module layer) and the four-point bending method along with the double cantilever method (to study the interfacial adhesion between layers of a photovoltaic device). In Fig. 14, related mechanical tests for two different modes of deformation, i.e., bending and torsion, can be seen. These tests can be used to evaluate the performance and flexibility of solar cells against real conditions that they may encounter during their function.
In addition to evaluating the mechanical performance of each layer of a photovoltaic device, it is very important to examine the whole device and subject it to various mechanical and deformation tests. In a study by Finn et al., they examined two different photovoltaic devices based on carbon-based and silver-based inks as electrode links between photocells that were used to develop solar cells. In this case, the carbon-based photovoltaic device consisted of the configuration PEDOT:PSS/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS, where the ZnO layer acts as the hole-blocking agent that enables the usage of a conductive PEDOT:PSS layer as both the cathode and anode; meanwhile, the configuration of the silver-based photovoltaic device consisted of Ag NW:ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS. The obtained results showed that the carbon-based device was much more fragile than the Ag-based device, while the Ag-based module was found to be more resilient. Additionally, one of the main differences between the carbon-based and Ag-based modules is that the thickness of the Ag-based module is greater than that of the carbon-based module; this is due to the usage of a UV filter, which improved the mechanical robustness of the Ag-based photovoltaic device.
In addition, the carbon-based module did not show any defects in the middle of the module at the climax of the bend. However, delamination of the deposited layers originated from the shear force at the end of the module, where it was sandwiched between PDMS layers. This failure, which led to delamination of the layers, typically occurred after about 5000 to 8000 bending cycles and then smoothly progressed over the course of 1000 bending cycles. In fact, this delamination led to rupture of the device stack between the PEDOT:PSS electron-blocking layer and the active P3HT layer. Surprisingly, propagation of the delamination of the deposited layers did not affect the performance of the module until the stage where the delamination covered about 75% of the width of the module, at which point the speed of the delamination process increased. In Fig. 15(a)–(d), the bending and torsion evaluations of the carbon- and silver-based modules can be seen; moreover, optical images of the degradation sites after failure of the developed photovoltaic devices can be seen in Fig. 15(e).
In addition, intelligent processing and usage of resistant layers can improve the flexibility and mechanical performance of photovoltaic devices without affecting their total PCE. In this case, mechanical examination of the carbon-based modules showed a lack of failure in 30% of them, which is due to the sectioning of each individual module from the parent roll using a 90 W CO2 laser with a speed of 4.5 m s−1. In fact, replacing conventional cutting processes with laser cutting methods can significantly improve the edge sealing and prevent delamination of the deposited layers. Similarly, another assessment showed that usage of additional layers, such as a UV-protecting layer, in photovoltaic devices can significantly improve their performance; for example, nine out of ten Ag-based modules were not delaminated before about 15000 cycles, while some others resisted up to about 2000 cycles without showing any defects or deterioration in device performance/functionality. Furthermore, most of the applied damages that can adversely affect a photovoltaic device originate from adhesive or cohesive failure of the main active materials, which can be improved through engineering the molecular weights, morphologies and molecular structures of the active materials, chiefly for OSCs.
In work by Arbab et al., they developed printable composite layers consisting of woven/nonwoven fabrics incorporated with printed multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) as flexible, wearable heating sources or cathodes for DSSCs. The printable carbon ink of MWCNTs was synthesized using the globular protein serum bovine albumin (BSA), which is an amino-rich distribution agent that can improve the dispersion of MWCNTs and produce a tubular porous carbonaceous matrix. These fabrics are electrically conductive, provide electron transport pathways, improve the electrocatalytic activity, enhance the heat dissipation and provide an ideal heating source for the consumer. Additionally, the heat generation and conductivity of the developed flexible fabric is highly dependent on its type and conductive ink uptake. This practical fabric showed low electrical resistance of about 15 to 20 Ω, low charge resistance of about 2.69 Ω (RCT) and PCE of about 8% under optimum conditions. In Fig. 16, a view of the developed carbon ink-printed fabrics (i.e., cotton woven, polyester woven, cotton nonwoven and PET nonwoven) as a cathode and heating source of photovoltaic devices can be seen.
Along with the mentioned potential of carbon ink-printed organic fabrics, these practical flexible and conductive substrates can be used as heating sources for wearable electronic devices. In Fig. 17(a), the heat generated by carbon ink-printed cotton woven fabric, polyester woven fabric, cotton nonwoven fabric and PET sheets attached to a variable DC voltage (from 5 V to 20 V) can be seen, respectively. As shown, the outcome of the temperature evaluation via thermal sensors and a thermal camera showed that increasing the applied DC voltage can considerably improve the generated heat and the dissipation of energy in the form of heat. In this regard, woven and nonwoven cotton fabrics showed rapid responses to the applied voltage, which resulted in heat generation in the range between 110 °C and 140 °C, whereas PET and polyester-derived fabrics showed a hysteresis phenomenon at lower temperatures in the range of 70 °C to 80 °C due to their thermoplastic specifications. Among the evaluated carbon ink-printed organic fabrics, the cotton woven fabric showed the highest temperature of about 140 °C at 20 V. In the organic carbon ink-printed fabric, the migration of charge carriers is accelerated with respect to the applied voltage. The generated heat results from the collision of charge carriers and phonons due to the vibration and quantum energy of the carbon crystal lattice. Therefore, by further increasing the charge-phonon collisions due to the increase in voltage, the generated temperature will also significantly increase. Cotton-based fabrics showed the highest energy dissipation and, thus, greater heat generation, while the PET sheets were rapidly degraded upon a further increase in the voltage to more than 15 V; this is due to their thermoplastic specifications and lower structural density. Thus, it can be concluded that variation of the active layers can significantly affect the thermal conductivity of carbon ink-printed organic flexible fabrics. In Fig. 17(b) and (c), the variations in the photovoltaic density and temperature of the developed carbon ink-printed fabrics can be seen.
Furthermore, plastic substrates present significant benefits for the development of flexible thin film solar cells due to their superior flexibility and light weight. In this regard, using practical strategies can overcome restrictions of plastic substrates (i.e., low melting/softening temperature and high thermal expansion). To this end, modification of a polyimide substrate with nanocone arrays can not only improve the photon management but can also afford a final structure with high flexibility. Primary evaluations showed that nanocone arrays significantly improved the performance of a photovoltaic device compared with planar substrates; meanwhile, a nanocone solar cell showed higher bending ability than a planar cell. In Fig. 18(a), a view of this modified photovoltaic device can be seen; as shown, this efficient and flexible photovoltaic device was fabricated through a multi-step procedure. In the primary step, a well-ordered anodic aluminum oxide with inverted nanocone arrays was designed and fabricated through anodization and wet-etching processes on imprinted aluminum foil. Next, a 100 nm thick SiO2 layer was deposited on the previous layer using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) at 150 °C to act as an anti-adhesion layer; in the next step, the polyimide solution was spin coated on the surface of the resulting structure. Afterward, the polyimide-coated structure was cured using a hot plate, and solidification of the polyimide solution in air was conducted by increasing the temperature to 170 °C. Then, the solidified polyimide detached from the nanocone template to afford a nanocone polyimide film with a thickness of about 100 μm. The obtained nanocone polyimide film was then cured in an oven at 350 °C for 4 h, followed by fabrication of a thin film junction consisting of a-Si:H p–i–n on a fully cured polyimide nanocone film. Additionally, the Ag layer at the bottom of the structure was used simultaneously as a reflector and bottom electrode; meanwhile, an 80 nm aluminum-doped zinc oxide layer was utilized as a buffer layer to decrease the diffusion of metals into the silicon layer.
Furthermore, the achieved results showed that the nanocone polyimide solar cell has many advantages over the planar device. In Fig. 19, the obtained results for the flexible nanocone-based device and planar device are compared with each other. As can be seen in Fig. 19(a), the interface between each used material in the developed photovoltaic device highlights the light propagation in each layer much more clearly. The obtained data showed that 0.5 and 1.0 aspect ratio nanocone photovoltaic devices presented better performance than the planar device and improved the light absorption rate in the a-Si:H layer, which is ideal for electron–hole generation and collection of sunlight energy via the developed device. Fig. 19(b) shows the integrated absorption of nanocone and planar devices to tune the incident light angle from 0° to 60° at intervals of 10°. The obtained results clearly showed that the nanocone structure is superior to the planar structure and can improve the integrated absorption rate by about 15%, depending slightly on the angle of incident light.
Moreover, as can be seen in Fig. 19(c), the nanocone structure can significantly improve the PCE from about 3.5% to 7%, which shows 100% improvement in the light harvesting rate. Similarly, evaluation of the PCE under bending showed that the nanocone device could maintain about 95% of its total optimum efficiency at a curvature radius of 4 mm and bending angle of 360°. In addition, bending evaluation of the developed devices showed that the nanocone device can maintain about 96% of its PCE after about 10000 bending cycles under an evaluation angle of 180°; meanwhile, the PCE of the planar device declined to about 64% after 10000 bending cycles, which further highlights the effectiveness of the nanocone structure. Simulations of the cross-sectional stress distribution of the planar (Fig. 19(f)) and nanocone (Fig. 19(g)) photovoltaic devices also showed that the distribution of stress after bending throughout the nanocone-based device is significantly lower than that of the planar device. These data clearly showed that by simple modification of the 3D structure, significant progress in flexibility and device functionality can be achieved.
In other work by Lee et al., they developed a highly flexible thin film solar cell based on a-Si:H coupled with a p-type PEDOT:PSS layer. In this study, PEDOT:PS was used as a p-type window, and a very thin film layer of p-type Si:H 1L was placed between the interface of the PEDOT:PSS and i-Si:H to improve the p/i-junction of the developed photovoltaic device. The a-Si:H thin film layer was synthesized through a PECVD system; then, cells were deposited on the Ga-doped ZnO layer coupled with Ag as a back reflector, which was coated with polyimide and placed on a glass substrate with about 30 nm rms roughness. Additionally, SiH4, H2, B2H6 and PH3 were used as doping gasses. Furthermore, the thicknesses of the i-Si:H and n-Si:H layers were set at 300 and 30 nm, respectively. In Fig. 20(a), a view of the developed flexible photovoltaic device can be seen. In Fig. 20(b), the aligned band via the Fermi level related to the band diagram of the a-Si:H substrate-type photovoltaic device along with the PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS/1L windows can be seen. Moreover, the efficiencies of the developed solar cells with PEDOT:PSS/1L windows on glass and polyimide substrates were found to be 7.4% and 6.52%, respectively, which showed significantly higher PCE values than devices with conventional p-type microcrystalline Si:H windows. Additionally, the degradation study of the PEDOT:PSS cell through bending tests showed that this cell is much stronger against the applied bending force than the p-type microcrystalline Si:H, mainly at bending radii lower than 10 mm. In Fig. 20(c), the relationship between the bending radius and the efficiency of the developed photovoltaic device can be seen.
In addition to considering the flexibility and wearability of photovoltaic devices, it is fundamentally essential to fabricate a device that presents high PCE along with negligible decline in efficiency after bending or application of mechanical load. Zhao et al. addressed this flaw by developing a practical flexible photovoltaic device based on an InGaP/GaAs double junction thin film solar cell (TFSC) which was placed on a flexible Cu metallic substrate though electroplating copper; in Fig. 21(a), a view of the structure of this device can be seen. The obtained data clearly showed a superior high PCE of about 29.09% under optimum conditions, compared with a conventional photovoltaic structure with an efficiency of about 28.25%; this is due to the growth of the GaAs substrate under air mass at 1.5 illumination. In Fig. 21(b), the average efficiency of the developed devices can be seen. In the case of flexibility, the developed solar cell showed ideal flexibility at 30 μm thickness; meanwhile, it was found that the efficiency of the device remained at about 90% when the strain was less than 0.1% and also declined to 45% when the strain was increased to more than 0.2%. Evaluation of the fabricated solar cells proved the mechanical stability of the TFSCs after 100 bending cycles, thus maintaining the performance of the device. In Fig. 21(c) and (d), the mechanisms of the performed tests and the results of the bending evaluations can be seen.
More importantly, a practical flexible solar cell should present ideal stretchability and maintain most of its PCE even under harsh mechanical loads. In this regard, Won et al. developed a highly flexible and stretchable helical copper NW-based electrode that presented reversible stretchability under strain up to 700%. In this study, they integrated Cu NW with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to develop a helical-structured conductor for usage in electronic devices. Fig. 22(a) shows the morphology of the developed platform coupled with un-strained and pre-strained PDMS layers under increasing strain from 0% to 50%. As shown, the surface of the Cu NWs coupled with un-strained PDMS was torn off after applying strain when the tensile strain passed the milestone of 30%; meanwhile, the pre-strained PDMS (with 40% applied pre-strain) with sheet resistance between 6 and 12 Ω sq−1 showed strong, reversible resistance against the applied strain. Fig. 22(b) and (c) exhibit the performance of the developed electrode against applied strain and stretching cycles, respectively, where the pre-strained PDMS showed stable resistance due to its reversibility and strong mechanical robustness.
To further validate the performance of the developed electrode, an LED light was assembled on the surface of Cu NW/pre-strained PDMS, and its performance under increasing strain was evaluated. As can be seen in Fig. 22(d)–(f), the LED light operated well even after stretching under a tensile strain of more than 100%, which further confirmed the superior flexibility of the developed electrode. In Fig. 22(g) and (h), the relative resistance of the fabricated electrode after stretching cycles of 100% and the final helical-structured platform can be seen, respectively. These data clearly showed that the Cu NW-based electrode exhibits excellent and reversible flexibility/stretchability, which is ideal for the development of flexible photovoltaic devices.
Moreover, a practical flexible solar cell should maintain its performance at a maximum level under repeatable compression–stretching cycles. In this regard, Zhang et al. fabricated a highly lightweight, flexible solar cell based on PbS quantum dots (QDs) that was fabricated on the surface of a naphthalate substrate with a thickness of about 1.3 μm. Additionally, the front transparent electrode was composed of Ag NWs due to their ideal transparency and low sheet resistance. The thickness of the PbS QDs was considered to be about 2 μm; the device exhibited a weight of 6.5 g m−2, a PCE of 10% and, thus, a power-per-weight of 15.2 W g−1. The developed solar cell showed superior mechanical robustness; it maintained most of its performance even under extreme deformation and after numerous compression–stretching cycles. In Fig. 23, a view of the performance/functionality of this platform under severe mechanical load can be seen. As shown in Fig. 23(a), the electrodes of this device present ideal transparency, which enables the infiltration of light into the active layers; the transparent front Ag NW-based electrode exhibited stable resistance under harsh compression, where the resistance of the electrode only increased by 15% at 60% compression (Fig. 23(b)). In Fig. 23(c)–(f), the photovoltaic performance of the developed platform and its respective layers can be seen, revealing the superior stability of the device over time and under severe compression–stretching cycles; thus, this platform is an ideal template for future ultra-flexible photovoltaic devices. In Fig. 23(g), a view of the compressibility of the device can be seen, showing its ideal mechanical robustness, while in Fig. 23(h), the 3D structure and respective band gap of each layer are illustrated in detail.

Rapid advances in smart wearable electronic devices/sensors have increased the requirement for portable and reliable power sources that can provide these state-of-the-art platforms with their required energy in any location through renewable, accessible and free approaches. To this end, flexible solar cells with superior mechanical robustness/transparency based on advanced nanomaterials have proved to be ideal candidates to address this urgent matter. These novel platforms are mainly developed in three categories, namely PSC, DSSC and OSC. These platforms present diverse PCEs and capabilities based on their features and designed structures.

In the following sections, the mechanism and working principle of each type of solar cell are investigated, and the main developed materials as active layers and junctions of these potential photovoltaic platforms are reported. Afterward, recent approaches for each aforementioned type of flexible solar cell are summarized and reported. Then, practical types of solar cells in the form of wires and woven fabrics based on the PSC, DSSC or OSC platform are examined, and their practicality in the case of real applications is highlighted and presented in detail. Additionally, the capabilities of integrated photovoltaic devices with supercapacitors and battery parts for diverse applications are examined.

Flexible photovoltaic devices based on photoactive perovskite layers have become ideal candidates for supplying energy to wearable devices. These photovoltaic devices can be flexible/transparent and can meet industrial requirements for portable, wearable and efficient green energy sources. Flexible PSCs can be used in self-powered greenhouses, photovoltaic curtains, wearable electronics and building-integrated photovoltaics. One of the main advantages of perovskite photovoltaic devices is their ability to form thin electron absorption layers and the high efficiency of perovskite layers compared with other photovoltaic mechanisms. However, production of defect-free perovskite thin films with high structural quality at low processing temperatures through solution-processed p–i–n-type photovoltaic devices is still an unsolved issue due to the variation of surface-specific interactions and the sensitivity of the material crystallization dynamics.

PSCs have high PCEs; in some research studies, their efficiency reached 25.2%. The perovskite photovoltaic platform is an ideal route for the development of flexible devices due to its fully solid-state nature and low-temperature production procedure. This efficient photovoltaic structure is a sandwich structure that can be classified in two different categories based on how the photoactive perovskite layer is sandwiched between two charge transport layers, namely n–i–p junctions (electron-transport layer (ETL)/perovskite/hole-transport layer (HTL) type) and p–i–n junctions (HTL/perovskite/ETL type). Generally, a perovskite photovoltaic device contains a photoactive layer whose main structure consists of compounds with the chemical formula ABX3, where A, B and X correspond to the monovalent cation, metal cation and halide anion, respectively. In this type of photovoltaic device, after uptake of photons, absorbed electrons are excited from the valence band of the perovskite layer to its conduction band, leaving electron holes after separation of poorly bounded excitons. Afterward, these electrons and holes will be transported through the ETL and HTL and then collect at the anode and cathode, respectively. In Fig. 24, a view of this type of solar cell mechanism can be seen. More importantly, diverse perovskite structures have been developed to date; Table 3 lists recently developed perovskite layers along with their respective bandgaps.

Due to the high efficiency of PSCs, this effective mechanism has become the basis for the development of various portable and wearable photovoltaic devices. In work by Feng et al., they developed a highly flexible PSC via modifying the perovskite junction with dimethyl sulfide as a new additive. In this study, dimethyl sulfide reacts with Pb2+ and forms a chelated intermediate that can decelerate the speed of crystallization, which leads to an increase in the grain size of the perovskite layer and enhancement of its crystalline structure. This practical additive can also decrease the trap density and improve the quality and functionality of the perovskite junction. A view of this platform can be seen in Fig. 25(a); it exhibited a PCE of about 18.40%, along with superior flexibility. Additionally, as depicted in Fig. 25(a) and (b), modification of the perovskite layer with dimethyl sulfide significantly enhanced the grain size of the MAPbI3 layer, which had significant effects on the PCE (increased from 16.90% to 18.40%) and stability of the device; a view of these examinations can be seen in Fig. 25(d)–(f). As shown in Fig. 25(d), subjecting the modified and unmodified PSCs to atmospheric conditions with 35% humidity showed that the modified platform has 1.72 times more resistance against humidity compared with the unmodified PSC; this is due to the larger grain size of the perovskite layer, which can suppress its degradation at the grain boundaries. Additionally, evaluation of the developed platform showed that it exhibits stable functionality with superior flexibility; this is a vital matter for the development of future generation wearable flexible power sources.
In other work by Huang et al., they developed a flexible PSC via improving the device composition to overcome common flaws of perovskite photovoltaic devices, including the rigidity of their counterparts, which adversely affect their flexibility. In this matter, unsuitable morphology of the electron transport layer (ETL) due to the rough surface of the previous flexible substrate is one of the main reasons for the unsatisfactory performance of planar heterojunctions. In this regard, by controlling the morphology and thickness of ETL materials such as SnO2, the reflection rate of the ITO layer coated on the substrate of polyethylene 2,6-naphthalate (PEN) decreased significantly, while the photon collection rate of the platform considerably increased. On the other hand, this strategy could also decrease the overall rate of trapped densities within the perovskite layer and decrease the charge transfer resistance, which led to an increase in the PCE of the device. As a result, a highly flexible PSC consisting of Ag/Spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite/SnO2/ITO/PEN presented a PCE and steady PCE of about 19.51% and 19.01% under optimum conditions, respectively; in Fig. 26(a)–(c), a view of the 3D structure and PCE of this device can be seen. More importantly, the developed flexible PSC showed ideal mechanical robustness and maintained about 95% of its total PCE after 6000 bending cycles with a bending radius of 8 mm. Moreover, it exhibited excellent stability of its power conversion rate and retained 90% of its total PCE after 1000 h storage in open air with 10% humidity (Fig. 26(d)). Furthermore, examination of the device morphology showed a high quality PSC with perfectly compacted thin layers that exhibited a fine crystalline morphology (Fig. 26(e)). These outcomes clearly reveal the capability and functionality of flexible PSCs as new candidates for the development of future generation wearable flexible energy sources.
Bag et al. developed a semitransparent perovskite photovoltaic device with an optimum PCE of about 12.6% along with a Voc, Jsc and FF of 0.94 V, 18.3 mA cm−2 and 73%, respectively, via employing a surface passivation procedure based on thiourea vapor deposition; this can lead to the formation of a thin film CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer up to 110 nm on top of the PEDOT:PSS with high quality and fewer structural defects. In this regard, the thiourea vapor acts as a molecular glue and improves the interaction of the perovskite layer with the PEDOT:PSS film through soft and polarizable inorganic materials such as Pb and I. One of the advantages of this technique is that the transparency of the device can be controlled, where a device with a transparency of about 34% showed a PEC of about 8.2%. Their study also showed that further increasing the thickness of the perovskite layer can considerably increase the total PCE of the device. In other work, Dagar et al. showed that by employing simple strategies, affordable solar cells with significantly high PCEs of about 26.9% are achievable. In this regard, they coupled a CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer with solution-processed layers of SnO2 and MgO as efficient electron transport layers; the samples showed significantly high power densities/PCEs of 20 μW cm−2/25% and 41.6 μW cm−2/26.9% upon exposure to light irradiation of 200 and 400 lx from an OSRAM LED lamp, respectively. This platform also showed about a 20% increase in efficiency compared with common SnO2-based solar cells.
The photoelectric performance of PSCs can be improved through thermal imprinting of pillar-shaped nanostructures. In a study by Gao et al., they deposited pillar-like nanostructures on the surface of ITO/PET substrate via thermal nanoimprinting. The outcome of this study showed that these structures can enhance the contact angle of the substrate from 73.1 to 93.4° and modify its Jsc/PCE to about 0.48 to 1.75 mA cm−2/0.34% to 0.69% as the angle of the pillar-shaped structure varied from 0 to 60°. In Fig. 27(a), a view of the structure of a photovoltaic device consisting of Au/Spiro-MeOTAD/CH3NH3PbI3/SnO2/ITO/PET can be seen; meanwhile, in Fig. 27(b), the 3D structure of the pillar-like nanostructures is illustrated. Evaluation of the device performance, including the angular reflection, reflection (%), current density and IPCE (%), can be seen in Fig. 27(c)–(f), respectively.
A practical photovoltaic device should be lightweight, mechanically stable and resilient, deformable and processable at low temperatures to be used as a reliable and economic source of energy for wearable devices. To this end, Ma et al. developed a stretchable, bendable, compressible and twistable perovskite photovoltaic device through absorption of hole-transporting polyaniline (PANi), solvothermally processable halide (i.e., (5-AVA)y(CH3NH3)1−yPbI3−xCIx or (5-AVA)y(CH3NH3)1−yPbI3) and an electron transporting agent of (6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl coupled with a 3D amphiphilic gel matrix. The PCE of the flexible PSC based on the CH3NH3PbI3 layer was found to be about 3.62%, which could be further improved to 4.51% at a bending angle of 140°, to 4.46% at an elongation of about 220%, to 5.10% at a twist angle of about 360°, or to 5.57% at a compression ratio of about 80%. Surprisingly, the developed solar cell maintained 130% of its efficiency after about hundreds of arbitrary deformation cycles. Additionally, this device is very resistant to humidity; it can remain fully functional and stable at a humidity rate of about 78%. In Fig. 28(a)–(c), the fabrication procedure of the solar cell, deformation of the developed device and contact angle along with the PCE of the device can be seen, respectively. In Fig. 29, a view of the used matrix and perovskite layer can be seen.
Development of self-powered electronic devices is an emerging idea that is expected to provide the next generation of wearable–flexible electronic devices. In this case, coupling an energy harvesting photovoltaic device with a flexible energy storage system has become an ideal alternative to common energy sources such as battery-supplied wearable devices. To this end, Li et al. developed a flexible photovoltaic device based on a perovskite layer accompanied with a photo-rechargeable lithium ion capacitor (LIC) that supplied a wearable strain sensor with its required electricity. The developed platform has an overall PCE of about 8.41% along with an output voltage and discharge current density of 3 V and 0.1 A g−1, respectively, which is sufficient to supply a wearable strain sensor. Additionally, this platform proved to be a state of the art self-powered photo-charging device by exceeding the overall PCE of about 6% even at a current density of 1 A g−1. Moreover, the developed sensor can gain energy directly from the flexible solar cell and record physiological signals with high accuracy without any external connections. In Fig. 30(a) and (b), a view of the developed PSC which acts as the electricity source for the battery and the sensor can be seen, while Fig. 30(c) shows the superior flexibility of the practical device, which can be assembled on a live beetle. Furthermore, in Fig. 30(d)–(f), SEM, STEM along with elemental mapping and HRTEM images of the LTO/rGO composite can be seen.
In addition, the photo-rechargeable device developed by Li et al. presents a stable energy density and coulombic efficiency over 200 cycles at a discharge current density of 1 A g−1 (Fig. 31(a)). Moreover, in Fig. 31(b)–(d), a view of the coupled solar cell/photo-rechargeable lithium ion-battery/strain sensor platform, the total PCE/storage efficiency of the device and the self-powered flexible wearable strain sensor can be seen. Development of these devices may create a revolution within the electronic industry and lead to the production of self-powered devices that can monitor the psychological conditions of patients under any circumstances and decrease the total cost and maintenance fees of wearable devices by enabling them to supply their own required energy.
In another attempt, Ryn et al. developed a nano-crystalline metal organic framework (MOF) based on titanium with a diameter of about 6 nm. This state-of-the-art MOF was then dissolved in alcohol and used as the electron transport layer of a PSC, processed with a spin coating procedure at ambient temperature. The developed platform showed ideal capability for transferring the injected charges from the perovskite layer to the electrodes. In this study, integration of (6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid (PCBM) with the Ti-based MOF as the ETL improved the electron transportation rate and suppressed the direct contact between the electrode and perovskite junctions. The achieved results showed that the developed PSCs on rigid and flexible substrates exhibited PCEs of about 18.94% and 17.43%, respectively. Additionally, the developed flexible PSC showed remarkable mechanical robustness and maintained most of its performance even after 700 bending cycles with a bending radius of 10 mm. In Fig. 32, the 3D structure, morphology and total performance of the developed photovoltaic device can be seen.
In another study by Wei et al., they developed a practical lead halide PSC through a scalable and affordable approach. In this regard, their developed device consisted of a uniformly coupled organic network with a hybrid organic/inorganic perovskite layer that was constructed through a one-step solution processing procedure. This device presented high performance and long-term stability, while its main structure consisted of PCBM and PEG organic networks. PEG, a long-chain insulating polymeric material, improved the stability of the device as well as its morphology. The PCBM fullerene-based part acted as the conductive charge transfer/transport channel; it can also passivate trap states on the grain boundaries. The PCBM part significantly enhanced the photovoltaic performance of the PSC and improved its total PCE to 17.1% by coupling with a PEG network.
The reported work in this section highlights the potential of PSCs as an electricity source for supplying wearable flexible electronic devices. For further investigation of these practical photovoltaic devices, a summary of recent approaches and developed perovskite solar cells is tabulated in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI).

DSSCs are among the most economic photovoltaic devices; they have attracted considerable attention due to their simple production procedures, inexpensive raw materials, usage of inexpensive equipment and employment of eco-friendly materials for their preparation. This type of solar cell was firstly reported by Grätzel in 1991, where the mechanism is mainly based on the generation of an excitation-electron–hole pair platform. Additionally, DSSCs can be highly flexible; thus, they are ideal candidates for development of flexible–wearable solar cells. In Fig. 33(a), a typical structure of a DSSC can be seen. As shown, it consists of two transparent glassy substrates covered with transparent conductive oxides (TCO) (e.g., fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) or indium tin oxide (ITO)) and contains three main parts, including a cathode, electrolyte (which may be the I3−/I− couple, Fc/Fc+ couple or Co(II)/Co(III) couple) and highly sensitized photoanode or photoelectrode. To develop the photoanode, the TCO-glass substrate should be coated with a wide-bandgap nanocrystalline metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) such as SnO2, ZnO and TiO2 to form mesoporous layers on the surface of the photoanode, whose thickness can be varied from the nanometer to micrometer range; similarly, improvement in the porosity and surface area of these materials can significantly improve the dye intake by the photovoltaic device. The developed photoanode is highly sensitized against dye molecules, and Ru-based chemical compounds are mostly responsible for the absorption of sunlight and photoelectron generation from the emitted sunlight. Moreover, a liquid electrolyte (e.g., iodide redox/triiodide) is placed between the cathode and photoanode to act as a charge mediator and carry the regenerated dye molecules. The cathode is usually made of platinized conductive glass; it is responsible for the catalytic reaction with the mediator in the electrolyte and generates charges from the external circuit.

Additionally, during the function of DSSCs, first, the photoactive dye molecules on the photoanode transfer excited electrons into the conduction band of the semiconductor layer in the photoanode under illumination; this is followed by migration of the electrons toward the external circuit. Afterward, the electrons that migrated to the external circuit will return to the redox electrolyte through the counter electrode. Meanwhile, the photoactive dye molecules are regenerated via capturing electrons from the redox electrolyte to fulfill the energy conversion cycle. Additionally, dye-sensitized photovoltaic devices suffer from some serious disadvantages; for example, the usage of liquid electrolyte adversely affects their flexibility due to the obstacle of sealing the device stably.
In Fig. 33(b), the energy harvesting mechanism of DSSCs can be seen. The mechanism of a DSSC is based on three phenomena: (1) absorption of light and separation of charges, (2) transport and collection of the newly generated charges and (3) regeneration of the oxidized dye molecules. In the first step, dye molecules are excited through absorption of light and generate excitons (i.e., electron–hole pairs). In the second part, the excitons are separated from each other, and the metal oxides transfer the electrons to the dye. In the third part, the electrons pass the mesoporous layer composed of porous metal oxides and return to the cathode. Next, a catalytic interaction occurs between the platinized TCO substrate and iodide-based electrolyte along with a redox reaction within the electrolyte, leading to regeneration of the excited dye molecules.
In addition, several processes lead to deterioration of the efficiency of DSSCs and prevent efficient separation of excitons, transportation of generated charges, collection of these charges and, finally, regeneration of dye molecules (Fig. 33(b) numbers 5–8). In this case, the four loss sources are recombination of the transferred electrons in the metal oxides through oxidized dye molecules (5) or by acceptors within the electrolyte (6), nonradiative exciton recombination prior to the charge injection (7) and reverse reaction of the transferred electrons from the TCO substrate to the redox (8). To overcome this flaw, the energy level of each chemical compound used in the photovoltaic device has a high level of importance; for efficient exciton separation and injection, the energy level of the conduction band of the employed MOS should be lower than the energy level of the lowest unoccupied orbital of the dye molecules. For further improvement of DSSCs, the Fermi levels of electrons within the MOS and the redox potential related to the electrolyte should be provided with a wider gap, which can further lead to an increase in the Voc. The reverse reaction of electrons can be also overcome through deposition of a thin layer between the TCO and the mesoporous MOS layer. In Table 4, a list of frequently used dyes for the development of DSSCs can be seen.

Recently, many attempts have been made to develop flexible DSSCs to supply wearable devices with their required electricity. Xu et al. developed a large-area, highly flexible transparent conductive CuS film via the colloidal crackle pattern technique as a counter electrode for the fabrication of flexible DSSCs. The developed transparent conductive film of CuS presents a rectangular structure which can be produced through a low-temperature procedure and adapted to any substrate. The conductivity and transmission of the developed film can be controlled through governing the shapes and sizes of the crackle patterns; under optimum conditions, a sheet resistance (Rs) and transmittance of about 60 Ω sq−1 and 90% can be obtained, respectively. Additionally, this photovoltaic device has superior resistance to temperature and pH variation; it can tolerate temperature and pH values in ranges of 0 °C to 100 °C and 1 to 13, respectively. Additionally, evaluation of a developed flexible transparent DSSC based on a CuS network that was coupled with a Pt network and PET substrate showed a PCE rate of about 4.54%; this device also maintained about 90% of its total PCE after 500 bending cycles. This photovoltaic device is an ideal dye-sensitized platform which can be adapted to any substrate to supply wearable devices. In Fig. 34, a view of its rectangular networks can be seen.
More details of the DSSC developed by Xu et al. can be seen in Fig. 35. Fig. 35(a) shows a view of the CuS production procedure, which leads to the development of a highly flexible transparent conductive electrode. Fig. 35(b) shows another view of this device, while Fig. 35(c)–(e) shows the sheet resistance of this device over 500 bending cycles, the current density of the device and the total efficiency of the solar cell over a wide range of bending cycles, respectively. The achieved results showed that this flexible device can maintain most of its efficiency after 500 bending cycles; thus, it is ideal for the development of flexible power supplies.
In a study, Lee and co-workers designed and developed an affordable technique for the fabrication of flexible transparent DSSCs through depositing a TiO2 layer via a laser-assisted nanoparticle deposition system (La-NPDS) as a photo-electrode for DSSCs. In this study, TiO2 nanoparticles were accelerated via a nozzle and deposited on a substrate at supersonic speed, while the sintering process was conducted simultaneously by laser treatment of the specimen. In this step, a highly uniform 10.55 μm thick layer of TiO2 nanoparticles (with an average size of 15 nm) was deposited on a ITO/PET layer via the La-NPDS technique. The achieved results showed that employing this production procedure can improve the total PCE of the device from 1.05% to 1.92% along with considerable improvement of the FF. A view of this production procedure can be seen in Fig. 36.
Wire-shaped DSSCs are ideal alternatives for the development of flexible, wearable self-powered devices. To this end, Tao et al. designed a wire-shaped DSSC based on aligned ZnO nanorods that were grown on the surface of a metal-plated polymeric fiber through a continuous reactor based on the mild wet process. This platform is used as the photoanode of the wire-shaped DSSC, which can significantly improve the overall performance of the developed solar cells. Fig. 37 summarizes the structure and performance of this device. As shown, in Fig. 37(a)–(c), the structure of the solar cell, a simulation of the flow velocity distribution within the reactor and the dynamic mechanism of the formed ordered platform in a diffusion-reaction based system can be seen, respectively. Additionally, Fig. 37(d) and (e) show SEM images of the aligned ZnO nanorods after completion of the reaction, while Fig. 37(f) shows the growth mechanisms of ZnO nanorods in continuous and bath-type reactors. Fig. 37(g) shows the variation in performance of the solar cells obtained by changing the synthesis conditions of the ZnO nanorods. These outcomes clearly showed that by changing the conditions of the production procedure of the ZnO nanorods, wire-shaped solar cells with selectable performance and PCE can be achieved. For further evaluation, a list of recently developed DSSCs along with their functionality is tabulated in Table S3 (ESI).

OSCs are considered to be promising platforms for the development of flexible and wearable photovoltaic devices due to their light weight, flexibility, semi-transparency and low processing temperatures. Most organic-based photovoltaic devices with high efficiency contain hetero-junctions consisting of a conjugated polymeric material or molecule as the electron donor along with fullerene-derived nanomaterials as electron acceptors. On the other hand, photovoltaic devices that utilize fullerene as an electron acceptor layer suffer from diverse obstacles, including weak light absorption rates, fixed energy levels and chemical constitutions, which may adversely affect the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current density of the developed photovoltaic devices. Moreover, these devices also have poor flexibility, brittle crystalline structures and low stretchability compared with other photovoltaic devices. Recently, great efforts have been made to improve the PCE of OSCs, where usage of solution-processed non-fullerene electron acceptors improved the PCE of organic solar cells to about 12%, showed tunable electronic and chemical features and significantly improved the stability of the device compared with fullerene-based organic photovoltaic devices.

OSCs mainly consist of a p-type electron donor and an n-type electron acceptor sandwiched between a cathode and an anode along with two charge transport layers, namely the ETL and HTL, where the ETL is placed between the cathode and the active layer and the HTL is placed between the anode and the active layer. Furthermore, during the photoexcitation process, excitons (electron–hole pairs) are produced in the p-type electron donor part of the active layer and are then transferred toward the interface between the p-type electron donor layer and n-type electron acceptor layer, by which they are separated into electrons and holes. These separated electrons and holes are then transported to the cathode and anode through the ETL and HTL layers, respectively, to generate the required voltage and current. Although these photovoltaic devices are much more investigated than other flexible photovoltaic devices, they suffer from low PCE due to their weaker structures compared with other photovoltaic platforms. In Fig. 38, the functioning mechanism of OSCs can be seen. Moreover, in Table 5, a list of recently developed organic parts of OSCs along with the respective photovoltaic performance of the developed devices can be seen.

To resolve the typical flaws of common OSCs, a group of fully polymeric organic solar cells called “all-polymer solar cells” was developed; these cells mainly consist of a polymer donor and a polymeric molecular acceptor, and they present significantly higher mechanical stability, flexibility and mechanical robustness compared with other common OSCs based on fullerene. This platform is efficient; in some cases, its PCE reached 12%. In the case of all-polymer solar cells, Ding et al. developed a fully polymeric non-fullerene photovoltaic device where ITIC as the small molecule acceptor was coupled with a PTP8/P(NDI2HD-T) polymeric layer. In this study, the combined structures consisting of ITIC/P(NDI2HD-T) with a low amount of ITIC showed fantastic compatibility with each other and reached a PCE of about 6% to 7% under the optimum conditions. This high PCE is due to the optimized morphology and broadened absorption rate of the polymeric blend, which can improve the generation of charge carriers and enhance/balance their mobility within the developed ternary polymeric blend. This platform can also be applied to other PSCs based on PTB7 and P3HT. Fig. 39(a)–(c), present the 3D structure of the developed OSC, the energy levels of the considered layers and the chemical compounds of the polymeric parts that formed the ternary polymeric blend, respectively. The highest performance was achieved at the PTP8/P(NDI2HD-T)/ITIC ratio of 1.5/0.85/0.15, which showed Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE values of about 0.976 V, 12.60 mA cm−2, 57% and 7.01%, respectively.
In another attempt, fluorinated polyethylene glycol was employed as a cathode of OSCs to improve their total efficiency. In this case, the interlayers of the OSCs played an important role in the optimization of the device performance. The organic cathode interlayer can create a dipole moment at the interface of the layers, which can decrease the functionality of metallic electrodes and decrease the contact resistance between the electrode and active layer. In most cases, the considered interlayers are deposited on the active layer through the spin coating method, which leads to random distribution of polar groups throughout the surface of the active layer; therefore, usage of a practical procedure and optimization of the production process is fundamentally essential for achieving desirable efficiency. Yang et al. addressed this flaw through a fluorination technique; their employed materials and the structure of the fabricated photovoltaic device can be seen in Fig. 40(a) and (b), respectively. In this case, by varying the organic cathode interlayer, tunable PCE was achieved, where usage of MeOH, PEG and FSO-100 as organic cathode interlayers led to PCEs of about 6.4%, 7.9% and 9.1% under optimum conditions, respectively. This achievement significantly highlighted the importance of the interlayer interactions, which can considerably affect the total PCE of the device. The high PCE achieved via usage of FSO-100 as an organic cathode interlayer is due to the alignment of fluorine atoms, which can tow the chains of the ethylene glycol in a single direction; a view of this mechanism can be seen in Fig. 40(c). When a layer of conductive electrode, such as silver, is deposited on the surface of the CIL, the FSO-100 molecules are more likely to align due to the higher hydrophilicity of the Ag layer compared with PTB7-Th:PC71BM as the active layer. Thus, the ethylene glycol chains aggregate near the Ag electrode, while the fluorinated chains are more likely to aggregate near the active layer; this forms a highly aligned structure that can significantly improve the PCE of the device.
In addition, flexibility, mechanical stability and transparency have high levels of importance in the fabrication of a practical OSC that can be integrated with wearable electronic devices. In this regard, Shin et al. fabricated a highly transparent and flexible organic photovoltaic device based on a transparent conductive graphene electrode doped with graphene quantum dots (GQD) which was coupled with silver nanowires (Ag NWs). To overcome the high sheet resistance of the graphene, first, the developed graphene electrode was doped with GQD; then, it was mixed with Ag NWs and placed on the surface of a PET substrate to obtain a highly transparent and flexible OSC. The obtained results showed that further increasing the concentration of the GQD to 0.03 g L−1 could decrease the sheet resistance of the graphene–Ag NWs electrode to about 92 Ω sq−1. Additionally, the optimum device showed a PCE of about 3.66%, while mechanical evaluation of the device showed that it can maintain 90% of its total efficiency after 1000 bending cycles at a curvature radius of 4 mm. In Fig. 41(a) and (b), the FESEM and optical transmittance of the developed electrodes at diverse concentrations of GQD can be seen, respectively; this shows that this platform is highly transparent and ideal as an electrode for OSCs. Moreover, in Fig. 41(c) and (d), the mechanical stability of the developed device is examined and presented.
In other work, Hsieh et al. fabricated a skin-attachable flexible OSC based on the buckle-on-elastomer procedure. In this study, they developed a stretchable and highly efficient OSC via coupling an ultrathin PEN layer with a 3M elastomer which was previously strained. Due to the pre-strained conditions of the elastomer part, a wrinkled substrate was formed due to the remnants of strain within the elastomer. The achieved results showed that the PCE of the developed platform can reach 5.61%; meanwhile, it can maintain about 74% of its total PCE at 30% compression as well as 64.3% of its efficiency after 50 compression–stretching cycles, which varied from 0% to 30% compression. In Fig. 42, the capability of this device and its production procedure are summarized. In addition, in Table S4 (ESI), a summary of recently developed OSCs can be seen.

Due to the rapid development of wearable devices, the requirement for long-term and reliable electricity sources to supply these state-of-the-art instruments has become a great concern. Among the recently developed photovoltaic devices, wire-shaped solar cells were found to be ideal candidates for addressing the increasing need for portable energy sources. The development of low-dimensional wire-shaped solar cells on conducting fibers has recently attracted considerable attention due to their 3D light harvesting capability, coupling with transparent conductive metal oxides, excellent bending, facile shape changing, superior flexibility and high stability in ambient conditions. Like planar solar cells, wire-shaped solar cells can be produced based on the perovskite, dye-sensitized or organic power conversion mechanisms.

To date, many attempts have been made to transform common light harvesting mechanisms into 3D wire-shaped formats, where these wire-shaped solar cells can be further processed to be transformed into woven fabrics and, thus, energy-supplying clothes. In this case, an all-solid-state wire-shaped photovoltaic device was developed based on affordable Mn wires via a wet-process production procedure at moderate pH value and at low temperature. In fact, Mn is very handy and can be easily deposited or plated on any substrate. Additionally, Mn-based wire-shaped photovoltaic platforms can reach efficiencies of about 27% and 65% after being coupled with Fe and Ti as traditional metal substrates. These platforms exhibit superior mechanical performance, high chemical stability and superior flexibility; thus, they are ideal candidates for the development of fabric solar cells.Fig. 43(a) and (b) illustrate the 3D structure and SEM image of the developed Mn-based wire-shaped solar cell.
Furthermore, wire-shaped DSSCs present superior performance, with PCEs of up to 22.95% under optimum conditions. In a study by Peng et al., they developed a highly flexible light-weight DSSC waveguide coupled with a luminescent solar concentrator (LSC); a view of this platform can be seen in Fig. 43(c). As shown, this platform consists of a wire composed of a Ti wire/sensitized layer with a Pt layer twisted around it and packed with electrolyte on the upper substrate. Variation of the specification of this mechanism led to Voc, Jsc, Pmax and PCE ranges between 0.61 and 0.70 V, 8.93 and 60.71 mA cm−2, 1.01 and 5.78 mW and 4.03% and 22.95%, respectively. In Fig. 43(d), different LSC designs can be seen. Based on the achieved results, the attachment of LSC to the black grooves does not have a considerable effect on the optical path due to their high light absorption capability. On the other hand, usage of aluminum foil led to reflection of light due to the high reflection coefficient of aluminum and improved the light harvesting mechanism via reflex. In fact, by using this reflection-assisted wire-shaped DSSC, the performance of the LSC can be considerably improved compared with the ordinary wire-shaped architecture. Fig. 43(e) shows the performance of this platform at a light incident angle of nearly 90°.
In addition, flexibility and mechanical robustness of a solar cell are vital to meet the requirements of a highly efficient solar cell fabric. Fiber-shaped solar cells can meet these requirements by engineering their flexibility and mechanical performance. To address this demand, an all-solid-state wire-shaped solar cell based on CuInSe2 (CIS) was electrodeposited on the surface of a flexible Mo wire, followed by orderly deposition of CdS, ZnO and ITO layers. The developed platform showed a PCE of about 2.31% under optimum conditions and exhibited stable PCE during bending (0 to 360°), rotation (0 to 360°) and aging (at 60 °C for 600 h) processes; thus, it is ideal for developing highly stable, mechanically robust stereoscopic cell textiles. In Fig. 44(a) and (b), a view of the production procedure of this platform and its effective light harvesting region can be seen, respectively. Additionally, in Fig. 44(c), the overall performance of the device can be seen; it showed Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE of about 0.340 V, 13.0 mA cm−2, 0.522 and 2.31%, respectively, under optimum conditions. Additionally, evaluation of the device PCE at different sites of this platform (Fig. 44(d)), during rotation and bending processes (Fig. 44(e)) and over time (Fig. 44(f)) confirmed the high flexibility, mechanical stability and ideal light harvesting stability of the device under variable conditions.
Another alternative for the development of flexible textiles is hybrid solar cells. In these devices, a wire-shaped light collector/convertor is assembled on a flat substrate to fabricate the hybrid solar cell. In Fig. 45(a) and (b), a view of vertically aligned silicon microwire cells that were prepared through electrochemical etching can be seen, where the p–n junction was fabricated via the spin-on-dopant (SOD) diffusion method. Moreover, a 50 nm thick aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) layer was deposited on the surface of silicon microarrays as a passivation and electrical contact layer through the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. In this regard, the resulting hybrid solar cell showed a PCE of about 7.1% under optimum etching and structural conditions. In another attempt, a hybrid silicon wire-planar photovoltaic device was fabricated and modified with zinc oxide nanorods as an anti-reflection agent through an all-solution-processed technique. In this regard, the well-aligned silicon wires were fabricated by combining lithography with metal-assisted etching; then, the p–n junction was induced within the silicon arrays via SOD, followed by hydrothermal production of zinc oxide nanorods on the surface of highly aligned silicon arrays. Further evaluation of the developed hybrid photovoltaic platform showed that the zinc oxide nanorods can improve the efficiency of the device by about 25% due to the decreased light reflection and enhancement of the light harvesting mechanism via the developed platform. In Fig. 45(c), a view of this hybrid platform can be seen.
One of the most frequent platforms of wire-shaped solar cells is based on the dye-sensitized mechanism. In this case, the metal wires within the structure of the DSSCs suffer from corrosion, which can significantly deteriorate their PCE and overall performance. To address this flaw, ultra-strong, highly stable and flexibly aligned CNT fibers can be used instead of metallic wires as both a catalytic counter electrode and a conductive substrate to support coupled titanium dioxide nanoparticles with dye molecules. In Fig. 46(a) and (b), a view of CNT-based dye sensitized solar cells can be seen. This platform presents a PCE of about 2.94% under optimum conditions, and its PCE is independent of the cell length and light angle; thus, it is an ideal candidate for the development of solar cell textiles. In another attempt, a wire-shaped CNT-based DSSC was coupled with an energy storage part to directly store energy harvested from sunlight within the energy storage part. This approach can be used for the development of hybrid wire-shaped platforms and, thus, hybrid textiles with fully combined harvesting and storage cycles. In Fig. 46(c) and (d), a view of this hybrid platform along with its mechanism can be seen, respectively. In fact, in this hybrid energy wire, the photoelectric conversion (PC) part is coupled with the energy storage (EC) part to simultaneously harvest energy and store it; in this particular case, modified titanium nanowires are decorated with aligned titania nanotubes and active materials and then coupled with highly aligned CNT fibers that are twisted around the modified titanium wire. The optimum PCE of this device reached about 1.5% under optimum conditions.
Numerous attempts have been made to develop 3D wire-shaped energy harvesting or energy storage devices; in Fig. 47, a view of these recently developed fiber-shaped platforms can be seen. In Fig. 47(a), a view of an organic-based flexible wire-shaped solar cell can be seen. Typically, solar cells require long-distance current transportation with the lowest possible ohmic losses; this is mostly achieved using metal oxides. In the presented platform, metal oxides were replaced with organic parts to develop a platform consisting of several phases; it can reach PCEs ranging from 2.79% to 3.27%. In Fig. 47(b), a view of the perovskite wire-shaped photovoltaic device can be seen. This efficient platform was constructed via a cathodic deposition solution method to uniformly cover the curved surface of the core-wire (here, titanium wire) with a perovskite layer. Next, the modified Ti wire was coupled with a highly aligned transparent CNT sheet to develop a coaxial perovskite wire-shaped solar cell that can reach a Voc and PCE of about 0.85 V and 7.1% under optimum conditions, respectively. In other work, a highly efficient flexible dye-sensitized wire-shaped solar cell based on multi-working electrodes was developed, where all parts were assembled into a capillary tube made of plastic; a view of this device can be seen in Fig. 47(c). This platform consisted of a core Pt microwire (as the counter electrode) surrounded with 2 to 6 titanium microwires covered with dye-sensitized titanium dioxide nanotube arrays (as the working electrode); the final device exhibited fine flexibility and high PCE compared with recently developed dye-sensitized photovoltaic devices. The obtained results showed that the higher the number of working electrodes, the higher the total PCE of the photovoltaic device. In this manner, with 6 working electrodes, the PCE can reach up to 6.6%. Additionally, treatment of titanium dioxide nanotube arrays with niobium isopropoxide solution can improve the PCE to 9.1%, which is higher than the PCEs of conventional dye-sensitized platforms. Furthermore, twisted wire-shaped high performance batteries have attracted considerable attention. In Fig. 47(d) and (e), a view of high-performance CNT-based fiber-shaped lithium ion batteries can be seen. Coupling these platforms with wire-shaped solar cells can lead to development of a hybrid fiber/textile that not only can directly harvest light beams and transform them into usable electricity, but can also store the gathered electricity by charging the battery part of the platform.
In addition, hybrid wire-shaped solar cells have opened new insights for the development of practical, multi-functional and efficient solar cells. In work by Weintraub et al., they developed a hybrid 3D wire-shaped DSSC based on optical fiber and dye-coated ZnO nanoarrays. In this platform, the role of the ZnO nanofiber is to improve the surface area of the hybrid solar cell and enhance the light harvesting mechanism at the interfaces. In this manner, illumination of fiber-shaped platform via light from one side of the fiber to another side in the axial direction caused multiple reflections within the fiber-shape platform; this can improve the light harvesting rate and thus final PCE of the photovoltaic device. Furthermore, the total PCE at full-sun power (100 mW cm−2) is about 3.3%, which is about 120% and 47% higher than those of ZnO nanowires coated on a flat surface and ZnO nanowires coupled with titanium dioxide film. A view of this hybrid platform can be seen in Fig. 48(a). Moreover, stretchable fiber-shaped solar cells are key for the development of next-generation wearable solar cells. In a recently reported protocol, a highly efficient, stretchable, flexible, mechanically robust wearable dye-sensitized wire-shaped solar cell was developed based on an electrically conductive and elastic platform. In this regard, highly aligned MWCNT sheets were wound around a rubber fiber, followed by twisting a modified titanium wire around the as-prepared MWCNT/rubber fiber. Next, the prepared platform was coated with photoactive materials to be integrated with the DSSC platform. This platform can be easily woven to create solar textiles and can reach high PCEs of about 7.13% under optimum conditions; a view of this stretchable fiber-shaped solar cell can be seen in Fig. 48(b).
Additionally, hybrid wire-shaped solar cells containing a light harvesting part and storage part can significantly improve the quality of future generation self-powered textiles. In this regard, a coaxial hybrid energy wire consisting of a solar harvesting part in the sheets and an electricity storage part at the core which used highly aligned CNT sheets as the electrode was found to be an appropriate alternative for development of hybrid harvesting/energy storing wires. This hybrid platform provides the possibility of high yield energy conversion/storage and presents superior mechanical robustness (i.e., bendable and stretchable) due to its complex hybrid structure. A view of this photovoltaic/power storage energy wire and its mechanism can be seen in Fig. 48(c) and (d), respectively. In other work, coupled Ti–TiO2 microcone arrays were fabricated through chemical and electrochemical reactions; it served as the main frame of the solar cell and provided electron transfer channels for the photoanode part of a wire-shaped DSSC. The TiO2 multilayered structure consisted of highly compact, porous light scattering layers coupled with the photoanode part and could reach a high PCE of about 8.07% with Voc, Jsc and FF of 702 mV, 16.036 mA cm−2 and 0.717, respectively, under optimum conditions.Fig. 48(e) depicts a view of this highly efficient micron wire-shaped platform.
In further attempts to develop 3D wire-shaped solar cells, Uddin et al. developed a quantum dot (QD)-sensitized solar cell coupled with CNT microarrays via usage of highly conductive and stable CNT yarn. The developed CNT yarn exhibited superior flexibility, high electrical conductivity, mechanical robustness and catalytic properties. The main structure of this platform consisted of QD-coated CNT yarn coupled with titanium dioxide microfilms twisted with another CNT fiber as the counter electrode. The developed platform showed stable photocurrent generation regardless of the direction and reached a PCE of about 5.93% under optimum conditions; a view of this platform can be seen in Fig. 49(a). In other research, a hybrid wire-shaped DSSC consisting of nanoporous TiO2/microporous TiO2, CdS/CdSe QDs and N719 dye was developed. In this platform, the dye mechanism was accompanied by the function of the quantum dots to minimize the band gap and improve the efficiency of the platform. A view of this platform and its parts can be seen in Fig. 49(b). This hybrid wire-shaped solar cell reached a PCE of 7.39% at 3.5 cm cell length.
In this section, the potential and recent advantages regarding wire-shaped solar cells and their hybrid structures were summarized and reported. These platforms can be used to develop the future generation of breathable textiles that can harvest/store the required energy for wearable devices and guarantee their function under diverse conditions. In Table S5 (ESI), a list of recently developed fiber-shaped photovoltaic devices is summarized. In the next section, transformation of these hybrid photoactive fibers into woven textiles and their advantages will be reported.

Wire-shaped solar cells are ideal candidates for the development of future smart energy clothes due to their outstanding capabilities, including superior flexibility, stretchability, mechanical robustness and ability to hybridize with diverse mechanisms (e.g., batteries and supercapacitors). These practical energy platforms can be used to supply wearable devices and revolutionize human lifestyles. Among the available green energy sources, solar irradiation is a reliable candidate due to its worldwide availability; therefore, development of woven energy fibers in the form of cloth can meet the requirements of people in diverse circumstances and supply them with wearable devices at any time.

Development of solar cells in the form of breathable fabrics is a promising advantage that can integrate the solar harvesting mechanism into textiles, which can be obtained either via weaving photovoltaic fibers or by printing technology through deposition of photoactive layers on the surface of textiles. In this regard, weaving the developed wire-shaped solar cells remains a challenge due to obstacles such as realization of economic mass-scale production procedures, incompatibility of fiber components with the used equipment and considered processes within the textile industry. An ideal wearable energy fabric should be able to be transformed into clothes and present important features of cloth, including flexibility, mechanical robustness, high performance and ability to be washed several times.
In the previous section, recent advances in fiber-shaped solar cells were discussed, and it was shown that these platforms can easily combine solar harvesting and battery parts together to present hybrid energy platforms. Recently, many attempts have been made to develop lightweight solar textiles based on wire-shaped solar cells. In this regard, in work by Wu et al., they developed an ultra-lightweight wearable polymeric solar textile based on a transparent electronic fabric. The main structure of this transparent electronic fabric is core–shell, and its composition consists of polyester/Ag nanowires/graphene, which serve as both the anode and transparent substrate; the final platform showed a PCE of about 2.27% under optimum conditions. Additionally, this platform highlighted the ability of 3D solar fabrics to be flexible, mechanically robust and deformable, along with their superior compatibility for being integrated into the form of fabric or cloth which can be used as a breathable and portable wearable energy source for supplying wearable devices. Fig. 50 summarizes the structure and performance of the developed photovoltaic fabric. In Fig. 50(a), the structure and morphology of the developed platform is presented, while Fig. 50(b)–(d) show the overall performance of the photovoltaic fabric under optimum conditions and under diverse mechanical loads.
In another attempt, the structure of common silicon-based solar cells was modified with flexible solar fabric, where the silicon-based solar cells were coupled with woven energy fabrics toward the development of hybrid photovoltaic devices. In this regard, a Schottky junction photovoltaic device was developed based on the platform of n-doped single crystal silicon coupled with graphene fabric, where the effects of the mesh size of the fabric on the final performance of the hybrid device were examined. The achieved results showed that the spare graphene fiber exhibited high optical transparency with a low photo carrier harvesting rate, while the dense graphene fiber presented ideal charge carrier collection with low photo carrier generation due to its low transparency. Additionally, optimization of the mesh size of the graphene fiber can establish a balance between the collection and generation of photo-induced charge carriers. In Fig. 51(a)–(d), a view of the device structure, the sparse to dense structures of the n-doped single crystal silicon coupled with graphene fabric, a view of the assembled device and the total performance of the photovoltaic device can be seen, respectively. As shown in Fig. 51(d), the developed platform with 120 mesh size can reach a PCE of about 10% under optimum conditions, which shows the potential of hybrid platforms in fabricating efficient solar power conversion systems.
Moreover, weaving wire-shaped solar cells together is a promising technique for the development of highly efficient photovoltaic fabrics. Meanwhile, wire-shaped PSCs show superior potential for production of highly flexible and mechanical robust solar fabrics. In this regard, a highly flexible, mechanically robust polymeric solar cell consisting of coated titanium wire with TiO2 nanoparticles incorporated with a polymeric part (PEDOT:PSS & P3HT:PCBM) and highly aligned MWCNT fiber as the electrode was developed and then woven together to form a solar cell fabric. In this platform, usage of TiO2 nanoparticles can improve the photoactivity of the materials along with their charge transport; this can improve the overall PCE of the platform by about 36% compared with the solar fiber without TiO2 nanoparticles. Additionally, usage of highly aligned MWCNT fiber can significantly improve the flexibility and mechanical properties, where the final platform can maintain its total PCE at the maximum level under bending up to 1000 cycles. A view of this platform can be seen in Fig. 52(a).
In other work, a highly flexible, transparent polymeric solar cell based on metallic and polymeric fibers woven into the form of mesh was developed. The open spaces between the mesh were filled with a transparent polymer and cured via UV irradiation; the final platform presented a high light transmission rate along with PCEs ranging from 2.2% to 3.2% based on the composition of the solar fabric. A view of the structure of this photovoltaic fabric can be seen in Fig. 52(b). In another attempt, an all-solid state highly flexible coaxial wire-shaped perovskite photovoltaic fiber was developed based on a core stainless steel wire as an anode accompanied with a perovskite layer (i.e., CH3NH3PbI3) along with hole-transport layers and highly aligned CNT arrays as the cathode. The developed platform was then woven into the form of a fabric solar cell, where the final textile showed a PCE of about 3.3% (with Voc, Jsc and FF of 0.664 V, 10.2 mA cm−2 and 48.7%, respectively) under optimum conditions. This platform and its woven fiber solar cell can be seen in Fig. 52(c).
One of the most important parts of a fabric solar cell is its electrode. An efficient electrode should be as transparent as possible and exhibit low ohmic losses. Currently, ITO is widely used as a transparent conductive electrode in flexible solar cells; however, the rapid increase in the cost of this material and the requirement for processing at high temperatures have restricted its usage in mass scale production lines. In a study, a highly flexible and transparent fabric was developed based on a polyimide coated with PEDOT:PSS with a well-defined mesh through a roll-to-roll fabrication procedure. The final platform transmitted about 95% of the emitted light and showed a very low surface resistivity of about 3 Ω cm−2; this presents nearly the same specifications as common transparent ITO electrodes. A view of this practical transparent platform and its well-defined mesh can be seen in Fig. 52(d).
Improving the weaving quality of wire-shaped solar cells can greatly increase their applicability for the development of efficient breathable solar fabrics. In this regard, Zhang et al. developed a highly flexible, lightweight and wearable polymeric wire-shaped solar cell that could be integrated into the form of textiles. In this regard, a metal textile consisting of micrometer-sized Ti fibers was considered as the cathode and was then coated with perpendicularly aligned TiO2 nanotubes as a photoactive layer through a dip-coating process. Then, two polymeric active layers consisting of P3HT:PCBM and PEDOT:PSS were coated on the surface of the as-prepared Ti wire, followed by coating highly aligned CNT sheets on both sides of the Ti textile; a view of this production procedure can be seen in Fig. 53(a). The final platform showed a PCE of 3% and maintained its full performance after 200 bending cycles (Fig. 53(b)), which shows the superior flexibility and mechanical robustness of this photovoltaic textile.
To reach the standard of textile industries for well-ordered/-shaped solar textiles, wire-shaped solar cells should be processed to form highly compressed, well-woven photovoltaic fabrics. One alternative for addressing this requirement is to develop OSCs in the form of textiles as stitchable electricity sources. In Fig. 53(c), a view of a well-shaped organic photovoltaic fabric can be seen. This platform consists of an ITO film, ZnO, P3HT:PCBM as the polymeric part, MoO3 and silver (or gold) as the electrode. This photovoltaic platform was coupled with a textile substrate to form a well-ordered photovoltaic fabric that can reach a PCE of 1.8% along with a Voc, Jsc and FF of 0.57 V, 13.11 mA cm−2 and 24%, respectively, under optimum conditions. Further details of this platform can be seen in Fig. 53(d) and (e). In fact, these platforms are key for the development of highly flexible, mechanically robust photovoltaic textiles with custom features.
In addition to the challenges of developing well-ordered woven solar textiles, it is fundamentally essential to adapt the PCE of solar textiles to the power requirements of wearable devices. In this regard, an all-solid state photovoltaic textile was developed based on Cu-coated polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), ZnO, Mn, CuI, Cu and a bottom electrode as wearable, breathable, flexible and mechanically stable solar-based electricity source to supply wearable devices. This platform can reach a PCE of 1.3%, with Voc and Jsc of 4.6 V and 7.8 mA cm−2, respectively, under standard sunlight irradiation (i.e., 100 mW cm−2). This textile can charge a 2 mF capacitor up to 3 V in a 60 s time span. Additionally, it directly provides the required energy for a digital calculator and can split water effectively. Furthermore, this platform supports a wide range of colors, which is vital to the textile industry for the development of solar textiles with custom colors and features. With these photovoltaic textiles, sunlight can be directly harvested or stored in a solar chargeable battery to supply a wearable device under any circumstances. A view of the structure and applications of this device can be seen in Fig. 54(a)–(e).
These photovoltaic textiles become more practical when they are coupled with a battery part within a fiber-shaped platform that can simultaneously harvest and store the accessible electricity from sunlight. In Fig. 54(f), a view of such a hybrid solar textile can be seen. This illustrated platform consists of a DSSC as the harvesting part and a fiber supercapacitor. The dye-sensitized part consists of Ti wire as the core, coupled with Mn, ZnO and CuI layers and accompanied with a counter electrode; meanwhile, the fiber supercapacitor part consists of a Ti wire treated with a hydrothermal process along with an ion exchange process to transform it into H2Ti2O5·H2O nanowires. Then, TiN nanowires were achieved through a nitridation process followed by a glucose-assisted hydrothermal process and a subsequent carbonization step to coat a carbon shell around the as-prepared TiN nanowires. This hybrid platform is tailorable and can be developed in custom colors. This hybrid textile can be fully charged up to 1.2 V in 17 s directly via its photovoltaic part and discharged in 78 s with a current density of 0.1 mA.
In addition, to further improve the function and efficiency of solar textiles, the energy harvesting platform was extended from an only solar-based system to a hybrid solar-mechanical energy harvesting system. In work by Chen et al., they developed a highly flexible, lightweight, sustainable and foldable solar textile capable of harvesting ambient sunshine or mechanical load. This platform can be used for the fabrication of various breathable cloths for diverse purposes. The developed platform consisted of two parts: a triboelectric nanogenerator that transforms mechanical motion into usable electricity and a solar textile that harvests sunlight. Additionally, this platform can continuously charge a 2 mF capacitor up to 2 V in 1 min under standard sun irradiation with or without mechanical excitation from human motion or blowing wind. This platform can easily charge a cell phone or supply a wearable watch from either sunlight or mechanical motion. A view of the structure, production procedure, performance and applications of this device can be seen in Fig. 55.
Furthermore, for the development of photovoltaic devices for self-powered electronic devices that are attachable to skin or surface-conforming foils, the developed platform should be highly lightweight, present fine mechanical resilience and possess a large surface area. In this regard, a highly flexible and mechanically robust polymer-based solar cell was fabricated on plastic foils with thicknesses less than 2 μm; this cell presents a PCE equal to those of glass-based photovoltaic devices. A view of this platform can be seen in Fig. 56. As can be seen in this figure, this polymeric-based solar cell consists of PET, PEDOT:PSS, P3HT:PCBM and Ca/Ag as a metal electrode and presents extremely high mechanical deformation along with unprecedented specific weight. In addition, this platform is adaptable to both PET and glass substrates; the respective Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE values for PET/glass substrates are 580/565 mV, 11.9/11.9 mA cm−2, 61%/61% and 4.2%/4.1%.
Textile-based photovoltaic devices are among the most attractive candidates for supplying wearable devices that can harvest solar energy on the order of milliwatts. A textile photovoltaic platform should possess ideal environmental stability, mechanical robustness and PCE; however, the functionality of the device after washing has not been clearly determined. In this regard, Jinno et al. addressed this requirement via developing a stretchable and waterproof OSC that is washable and can be used for the development of textile photovoltaic platforms. In Fig. 57, the composition of the developed platform can be seen. As shown, they sandwiched the developed OSC between two elastomer layers in order to protect it from water and degradative environmental factors (e.g., humidity). In this regard, the OSC was manufactured on a 1 μm thick parylene layer and then protected with another 1 μm thick parylene layer as an encapsulation strategy to afford a washable/stretchable device. Moreover, a donor–acceptor polymer blend was developed as the junction of a photovoltaic platform where a mixture of naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (NTz) (PNTz4T) with [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) was chosen as the active layer of the fabricated OSC.
The developed OSC was then subjected to diverse analyses in order to examine the effects of washing cycles on the final PCE of the device. In Fig. 58, the performance of the device under applied mechanical load prior to and after subjecting it to washing cycles is examined. As illustrated, the developed OSC showed a high PCE of about 7.9% along with 52% stretchability, which highlights the superior stability and flexibility of the solar cell. Furthermore, the 3 μm thick OSC maintained 54% of its PCE after 30 days along with 41% stretchability. Evaluation of the device after 120 min of immersion in water showed that the device only showed 20.8% degradation in its PCE; meanwhile, this deterioration rate declined to 5.4% via the encapsulation strategy using flexible polymeric substrates as protecting layers. Surprisingly, the double-side-protected OSC maintained 80% of its total PCE even after 20 compression cycles with 100 min immersion in water between each compression cycle. These outcomes clearly showed that via the encapsulation strategy, a long-term stable, flexible, mechanically robust and washable OSC can be achieved that is very strong against degradative/environmental factors.
In another attempt, Jeong et al. employed an encapsulation approach to develop a flexible/washable textile PSC. In this case, the PSC was fabricated on a textile that was pre-coated with a polymeric barrier followed by deposition of a 100 nm Ag layer as the cathode, 8 to 10 nm PFN as the ETL, 100 to 110 nm PTB7-Th:PC71BM as the active layer (donor–acceptor), 10 nm MoO3 as the HTL, 10 nm Ag as the anode and 30 nm MoO3 as the optical capping layer to protect the anode; a view of the fabrication technique of this device can be seen in Fig. 59(a). Moreover, a view of the photovoltaic stability of the developed platform upon diverse bending/washing cycles is illustrated in Fig. 59(b)–(d). As shown, the encapsulation approach suppresses moisture permeability into the flexible textile-based solar cell during the washing step via using a capping polymeric substrate based on SiO2. The superior chemical stability of the capping layer as a result of the reaction between Al2O3 and SiO2 avoids the phase transitions that are responsible for degradation of the solar cell. The outcome of the evaluations showed that the encapsulated PSC maintained most of its photovoltaic functionality even after 20 washing cycles with 10 min duration of each cycle. More importantly, the encapsulated platform showed highly stable performance even after bending with a curvature radius of 3 mm; meanwhile, it did not show considerable evidence of deterioration even after 30 days of being subjected to continuous mechanical force and washing cycles. The outcome of this study showed the ideal capability of the encapsulation process for fabricating textile-based photovoltaic platforms that are washable and strong against degradation factors, which is essential for developing long-lasting wearable power sources to supply wearable devices.
More importantly, the PCE of each photovoltaic device corresponds to the generated power per unit of area and is known as the main metric for evaluating the performance of photovoltaic devices. However, the area of a solar cell is not always the main limiting parameter. In this case, to directly meet the power requirements of wearable devices, the unit of PCE should be described as output power per specific weight in watts per gram. This term is very important in circumstances where the payload is vital, such as spacecraft, aircraft or wearable sensors/devices. Commercially available solar cells based on Si and triple junctions presented output powers per specific weight of 0.82 and 0.39 W g−1, respectively, while the presented OSC shown in Fig. 56 exhibits an output power per specific weight of 10 W g−1 with a mass per area of 4 g m−2. This significantly higher output further highlights the potential of thin film flexible solar cells for supplying wearable devices. This superior power output based on the specific weight of flexible solar cells is beneficial for diverse applications, among which the development of self-powered unmanned aircraft, balloons, wearable sensors, pack-weights for wilderness expeditions, and modern robotics (e.g., robotic insects) can be mentioned.

One of the main obstacles to the development of wearable devices is supplying their required energy via reliable and long-lasting sources. In this regard, wearable devices have been supplied by diverse electricity sources, among which solar harvesting mechanisms and transformation of mechanical motion into electricity can be mentioned. These platforms can be used to provide the required energy for therapeutic platforms in an economic and reliable way. To date, various self-powered wearable devices have been developed based on inexpensive and green electricity generation sources. One of the main advantages that can be achieved via self-powered wearable devices is real-time monitoring of the pulse or overall health condition of humans. In this regard, continuous monitoring of overall health condition factors, e.g., blood pressure, heart rate and respiration rate, can act as a personal illness warning system that can prevent an incident before it occurs. On the other hand, the capability of conventional health monitoring devices has become limited due to their high power consumption and the large size of the equipment. Self-powered wearable devices based on piezoelectric energy harvesters can meet this requirement; in recent reports, an inorganic piezoelectric sensor (based on Pb(Zrx,Ti1−x)O3 (PZT)) assembled on a flexible thin film not only provided the possibility of attachment to the complex texture of human skin, but also presented high sensitivity (about 0.018 kPa−1), a fast response time (about 60 ms) and ideal mechanical stability. More importantly, these devices can supply their own power and transfer the collected data through wireless communication to a mobile phone or any receiver that enables real-time health monitoring. Additionally, external attachment of these devices provides the possibility for integration of the device platform with a photovoltaic part. In Fig. 60, a view of such a self-powered therapeutic device can be seen.

In another attempt, a flexible wearable self-powered device was developed based on a single crystal piezoelectric generator that consisted of (1 − x)Pb(Mg1/2Nb2/3)O3–(x)Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PMN–PZT) grown via the solid-state single crystal growth (SSCG) technique on a flexible substrate. This platform can generate an open circuit voltage and short circuit current of 100 V and 20 μA, respectively, via deformation/mechanical motion and provide the required energy for a LED through walking and running (12 V and 1.3 μA output voltage and current, respectively). A view of this device and its performance can be seen in Fig. 61. This level of energy can also be easily provided via flexible solar cells and supply the as-developed wearable device.
Furthermore, the development of external lightweight self-powered wearable devices with low power consumption rates that can collect data from the body through mounting on internal (e.g., brain and heart) and external (e.g., skin) substrates of the body and transfer the data to a receiver via wireless communication has attracted considerable attention at the global level. In a recent study, a flexible battery-free wearable device capable of being attached to diverse parts of the body was developed; it could gather information for a photoplethysmogram, e.g., heart rate, information about blood oxygen and real-time heart rate variability monitoring. Wireless and real-time monitoring of this vital information can significantly improve the quality of health care and lead to treatment of illnesses that cannot be cured based on conventional treatments. More importantly, the low power requirement of these therapeutic devices/sensors shows that these state-of-the-art platforms can also be supplied via photovoltaic devices through a real-time approach. In Fig. 62, a view of a skin-attachable battery-free therapeutic platform capable of real-time pulse monitoring can be seen.

Transformation of flexible wearable devices into the bio-environment and supplying their required energy via long-lasting renewable resources provides the possibility to cure a majority of illnesses that cannot be treated through conventional approaches. For example, the requirement for additional surgery to remove discharged batteries from implantable biomedical devices has become a great concern for patients due to its risks of bleeding, infection and inflammation. Therefore, development of self-powered implantable biomedical devices is a vital matter to address this serious flaw. In this regard, a piezoelectric-supplied wireless wearable device based on PMN–PZT was developed that can harvest mechanical motion and transform it into a usable energy source that can charge a battery or run a wearable device; it can provide an open circuit voltage and short circuit current of 17.8 V and 1.74 μA, respectively, through porcine heartbeats. The developed device is also highly biocompatible; in addition to its capability for supplying wearable devices, it can deliver collected information, including the heartbeat, via wireless communication to a receiver. Moreover, the required energy level of the device is at the level of recently reviewed photovoltaic devices, and they can be considered as alternatives for external power sources. A view of this platform along with its functionality is illustrated in Fig. 63.

In another approach, a deep brain simulation (DBS) self-powered platform was developed which supplied energy via a piezoelectric energy harvester consisting of Pb(ln1/2Nb1/2)O3–Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3–PbTiO3 (PIMNT) coated on a thin film plastic substrate. This thin film piezoelectric device directly transformed mechanical motion into electricity and supplied the DBS platform; it could generate a high amount of current of about 0.57 mA by very slight bending and provide the required threshold current for real-time DBS of the motor cortex and forearm movement in mice. Moreover, this device can generate an open circuit voltage and short circuit current of about 11 V and 285 μA, respectively, under a load resistance of 200 kΩ; this matches the required power of the DBS system. Additionally, this device can induce 0.7 mW power, which is enough to light up 120 green LEDs or charge a capacitor. In Fig. 64, the performance of this device is summarized.
The required energy of this platform is also within the range of flexible solar cells and can be easily supplied via these practical devices. With these self-powered platforms, various symptoms of psychiatric and neurological disorders can be treated via the generated electric pulses of the device, among which epilepsy, essential tremor, Parkinson's disease and major depression can be mentioned. Additionally, usage of these self-powered sensors can lead to long-lasting treatment of the aforementioned illnesses and remove the requirement for replacement of the implanted battery within the brain; commercial batteries have an average life-span of about 3 to 5 years and leave high amounts of charges on the shoulders of patients. For example, a commercial DBS system requires 3 to 5 V, 130 Hz and 60 μsec pulse duration; it consumes more energy than an artificial cardiac pacemaker (2 V, 1 Hz and 400 μsec pulse duration).

Rapid development of wearable devices and portable electronic systems has increased the demand for transferable, adaptable, wearable, flexible, mechanically robust and stable sources of energy which can provide the required electricity from renewable sources. In this review study, we suggested flexible–wearable solar cells as ideal alternatives for this increasing demand to replace their common rigid counterparts. In this regard, first, recently developed transparent flexible electrodes, their diversities, used materials and design criteria were summarized/reported; then, important factors along with conducted studies on the flexibility and mechanical robustness of solar cells were highlighted and evaluated in detail. In the following parts, flexible solar cells were categorized into five main different groups, including perovskite, dye-sensitized, organic, fiber-shaped and textile solar cells. Afterward, in each respective section, the mechanism, working principles, important design factors and recently developed active layers for each type of solar cell were reported/evaluated. Thereafter, conducted studies for each type of solar cell were reported and discussed in detail. Finally, recent advantages of wearable self-powered devices and their required energy were examined and reported. The gathered information clearly highlights and confirms the capability of these photovoltaic devices as ideal alternatives for supplying the future generation of wearable electronic systems, which can lead to production of long-lasting wearable self-powered devices for diverse applications.
