Fluorination of polymer donors is a widely adopted approach to make efficient organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, four new polymer donors were synthesized by introducing a trifluoromethyl-ester group-substituted thiophene (TEST) unit with different ratios into a typical polymer donor PBDB-TF which resulted in downshifting the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy-level to −5.8 eV, thereby improving the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the corresponding OSCs from 0.86 to 0.96 V. Besides, trifluoromethylation improved the intermolecular aggregation, and consequently, PBDB-TF with a TEST unit content of 20% exhibited superior light absorption, effective charge transport, and favorable morphology, leading to the formation of efficient OSCs with a high Voc of 0.88 V, a large fill factor (FF) of 72.70% and a best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.02%. This work suggests a promising method to design efficient photoactive materials with well-optimized optoelectronic characteristics for high-performance OSCs via facile introduction of an electron-withdrawing group into polymer backbones.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) are promising photovoltaic devices because of their advantages of flexibility and low-cost production. Despite the enormous efforts made for the development of OSCs in the past years, their characteristics, such as the power conversion efficiency (PCE), remain inferior to those of their perovskite and silicon-based counterparts, when measured under the typical AM 1.5G solar standard. As a potential method for tuning the optoelectronic performance, tailoring the molecular design of active-layer materials in OSCs, for instance, through functional group modification, copolymerization, and side chain engineering, has attracted much attention. In particular, functional group modification is a widely adopted method for designing polymer donor materials due to its feasibility to selectively alter the energy-levels without perturbing the molecular skeleton.

It is acknowledged that an ideal donor material should match well with the acceptor, for broad complementary light-absorption and suitable energy-levels, which relate to the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the resulting OSCs. Researchers mostly focus on designing molecules to improve light absorption, modulate energy-levels, etc. for enhanced device performance. Fluorination of polymer donors is recognized as a promising approach that can effectively improve the aforementioned properties, thus enhancing the PCE of the corresponding devices. This strategy is based on the high electronegativity of fluorine which can withdraw the electron density from the polymer backbone through an inductive effect, and a trifluoromethyl group (–CF3) can induce a stronger impact than the fluorine atom. Furthermore, due to the electron-withdrawing effects of –CF3, trifluoromethylated semiconductors exhibit lower molecular energy-levels and narrower bandgaps than their pristine counterparts, thereby improving the Voc of OSCs. In addition, –CF3 is also used to modulate the intermolecular aggregation of photovoltaic materials through enhancing the noncovalent interactions of F⋯H and F⋯S, which helps to facilitate charge transport. Besides, trifluoromethylated compounds show higher polarization and smaller coulombic potential between electrons and holes, which is beneficial for exciton dissociation. Some molecular structures from the previous literature are shown in Fig. 1. However, previous work is based on a fixed content of –CF3. This work aims to explore the effect of different contents of –CF3, which is essential for further understanding the effect of trifluoromethylation.
In this work, a series of polymer donors are developed by introducing a trifluoromethyl-ester group-substituted thiophene unit into benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) with different TEST: BDD ratios, referred to as FF0.2, FF0.5, FF0.8 and FF1, based on a high-performance polymer donor, PBDB-TF. Compared with pristine PBDB-TF, polymers with a higher degree of trifluoromethylation exhibited a broader optical absorption range and a lower HOMO energy-level, contributing to larger Voc values of the corresponding OSCs. The optimum performance is achieved using FF0.2/IT-4F based OSCs that exhibited a high charge carrier mobility of 1.92 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, a large FF of 72.70% and a maximum PCE of 12.02%. This improvement is correlated with stronger intermolecular aggregation that originated from trifluoromethylation as well as favorable morphology with appropriate phase separation and a well-ordered network.

The chemical structures of the polymer donors are shown in Fig. 2a. The polymers are referred to as FF0 (PBDB-TF), FF0.2, FF0.5, FF0.8 and FF1, with TEST unit contents of 0, 20, 50, 80 and 100%, respectively. The polymers are prepared by adopting a synthetic route as shown in Fig. 2b, and the detailed synthetic procedures and the NMR spectra of the monomer and polymers are provided in the ESI (Fig. S1). The molecular weights of the polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with a polystyrene standard. The number-average molecular weights (Mns) of the synthesized polymers are above 60 kDa, and the polydispersity indices (PDIs) are around 1.5 (Table 1).

Good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (Td) above 350 °C was observed in the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S2) of the five polymers. The photochemical stability of the five polymers was investigated by measuring the UV-vis absorption spectra of the neat polymer films at different irradiation (100 mW cm−2) times (Fig. S3). The degradation time of FF0 and FF0.2 is more than 230 h, and that of their counterparts FF0.5, FF0.8, and FF1 is more than 100 h. These results indicate the good photochemical stability of the polymers.

The ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra of the five polymer donors (FF0, FF0.2, FF0.5, FF0.8, and FF1) measured in solution (in chloroform) and in thin-film states are displayed in Fig. 3a and b, which clearly reveal the influence of –CF3 on tuning the polymer bandgap and optical absorption. With a higher degree of trifluoromethylation, the absorption edges in both solution and film states underwent a gradual blue-shift due to an increase in bandgaps. Compared with the solution, all the films showed red shifts by ∼40 nm, illustrating the improved packing property and stronger intermolecular coupling. Of note, in contrast to FF0, the other four polymers exhibited a wider absorption range in the film state with an increase in the full width at half maximum (FWHM) (Table 1) of ∼20 nm, from 151.88 (FF0) to 172.96 nm (FF0.8). The bandgaps of the synthesized polymers are calculated from their absorption spectra in the film state (Table 1) and the corresponding energy-level diagram is shown in Fig. 3d. FF1 showed the largest bandgap (Eoptg = 1.97 eV) because of the highest content of TEST. In addition, the HOMO levels of the polymers are estimated from the cyclic voltammograms (Fig. 3b), as shown in Table 1. Notably, the polymers with a higher degree of trifluoromethylation exhibited lower HOMO levels which is ascribed to the stronger electron-withdrawing effect of the –CF3 group.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pure polymer donors and their corresponding blend films with acceptor IT-4F are shown in Fig. S4. In comparison with the strong PL intensity of pristine polymer donors, the donor/acceptor (D/A) blend films manifested significant fluorescence quenching, implying high efficiencies of exciton dissociation and a charge transfer between the donor and acceptor.

The OSC devices were fabricated with a conventional structure of indium tin oxide/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive layer/PFN-Br/Al (Fig. S5). A low bandgap non-fullerene small molecule, IT-4F (the chemical structure is shown in Fig. S6), was selected as the acceptor since it shows well-matched energy-levels with the polymer donors. Moreover, the optical absorption spectra of the polymer donors complement very well with the IT-4F acceptor (Fig. S7), thus efficiently utilizing sunlight from 400 to 800 nm for the photoactive blend film and improving the current density of the resulting solar cells.

The best photovoltaic performance was achieved by tuning the donor:acceptor (D:A) ratio, content of the solvent additive (1,8-diiodooctane, DIO), and annealing temperature of the photoactive layer. The detailed optimization processes are summarized in Tables S1–S12. The optimal D:A weight ratio is 1:1 (w:w) in the active blend layer; the DIO content is 0.5% volume; the annealing temperature for the active-layer is 100 °C to achieve the maximum performance for all the five polymer donor-based devices.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are provided in Fig. 4a and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. Fig. 3b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimized devices based on the five polymer donors. All the devices manifested a broad photoresponse in the range of 300–850 nm, indicating their effective light harvesting capacity. The calculated integrated current density values are consistent with those from the J–V curves, with a mismatch of <5%. The FF0 and FF0.2 based devices exhibited higher EQEs in the range of 470–770 nm, while the other three devices showed lower EQE values because of the blue-shifted absorption of the constituent polymers which resulted in low Jsc of these devices.

As can be observed in Fig. 4c and d, with an increase in the content of –CF3 in the polymer donors, Voc of the cells shows a gradual enhancement from 0.86 to 0.96 V which is attributed to the down-shifting of the HOMO levels of the donors; Jsc decreases due to a blue-shift in donor absorption, weaker exciton dissociation and inferior charge transport capacity. The FF values also decreased, except for the FF0.2/IT-4F based device (highest), with an increase in the –CF3 content, which could have resulted from the reduced charge mobilities and hence, led to a decreasing trend in the PCE. Among these OSCs, the FF0.2/IT-4F based device demonstrated the best photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 12.02% and a Voc of 0.88 V.
The charge carrier mobilities of the pristine donor films and those blended with IT-4F were measured using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method. As shown in Fig. 5a and b and Table 3, the hole mobilities (μhs) of the neat polymers and polymers/IT-4F blend films were obtained with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active-layer/Au. The hole mobility of FF0.2 (1.92 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is the highest, comparable to that of FF0 (1.57 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), while those of the other three films showed a smaller order of magnitude. The hole mobility of the polymer/IT-4F blend films displays a consistent trend with the results obtained for neat polymer films. The electron mobility (μe) of IT-4F is 5.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, as reported previously. The FF0.2 and FF0 based devices showed better balanced μh/μe compared with the other three polymer based devices, thereby contributing to the superior FF and PCE of the corresponding solar cells.

In OSCs, the exciton dissociation process, during which the photogenerated excitons convert to free charges, plays a key role in the photon-to-electron conversion process. Fig. 6a shows the photogenerated current density versus effective voltage of the fabricated OSCs, where Jph is defined as the difference between light current density and dark current density; Veff is given by the equation, Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage when Jph is equal to 0, and Va refers to the applied bias voltage. Under short circuit conditions, the FF0.2/IT-4F based device showed a slightly higher exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss = Jph/Jsat, where Jsat represents the saturation photocurrent density) of 98.1% than the other four devices; FF0, FF0.5, FF0.8 and FF1 containing devices exhibited Pdiss values of 96.4, 95.7, 94.1 and 87.8%, respectively, suggesting higher exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency that contribute to the improved FF.
The relationship between the Jsc/Voc values and different light intensities (Plight) is presented in Fig. 6b, revealing the charge recombination mechanism. The correlation between Jsc and Plight obeys the power law, Jsc ∝ (Plight)α, where α is an exponential factor that should be close to 1 if the bimolecular recombination is weak. As shown in Fig. 6b, the α values for the OSCs based on FF0, FF0.2, FF0.5, FF0.8 and FF1 are 0.885, 0.891, 0.878, 0.879 and 0.845, respectively, revealing the weakest bimolecular recombination in the case of the FF0.2 based device. The slope of Vocversus ln(Plight) represents the property of charge recombination under open-circuit conditions. When the bimolecular recombination is dominant, the slope will be 1.0 kT/q, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and q is the elementary charge. In the case of monomolecular Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination, a stronger dependence of Voc on the light intensity will be observed, and the slope of Vocversus ln(Plight) is close to 2kT/q. As can be seen in Fig. S8, the slopes for the OSCs based on FF0, FF0.2, FF0.5, FF0.8, and FF1 are 1.31kT/q, 1.35kT/q, 1.40kT/q, 1.83kT/q, and 1.88kT/q, respectively, indicating that FF0 and FF0.2 showed weaker trap-assisted or monomolecular recombination, and a further increase in the content of –CF3 leads to dominant RSH recombination.

The morphology of the photoactive layers in the form of neat polymers and blend films was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. All the neat polymer films showed smooth surfaces with small root-mean-square roughness (Rq) values (<1.8 nm) (Fig. S9). Interestingly, it is evident that both FF0:IT-4F and FF0.2/IT-4F blend films showed smooth and uniform surfaces with a small Rq value of 1.7 nm, substantially lower than those of FF0.5 (Rq = 3.3 nm), FF0.8 (Rq = 3.4 nm), and FF1 (Rq = 11.6 nm) (Fig. 7). In the phase pattern, interpenetrating networks were observed both in FF0 and FF0.2, which promotes the donor/acceptor contact area to facilitate exciton dissociation and charge transport. In contrast, the other three blend films exhibited a rough surface and large aggregation which hindered their efficient charge dissociation capability. In addition, the aggregates with similar shapes were observed in the blend films and corresponding neat polymer films, indicating that the phase separation morphologies of the blend films may be determined by the aggregation effect of the polymer donors. Hence, the favorable morphologies of FF0/IT-4F and FF0.2/IT-4F contributed to the improved photovoltaic performance of the corresponding devices.

The miscibility of the polymer donors and the acceptor was investigated by calculating the surface tension of the polymers and the acceptor based on contact angle measurements. The contact angles of two different solvents (water and glycerol) on the five neat polymers and neat acceptor films were measured and compared. The relevant images are provided in Fig. S10, and the parameters are summarized in Table 4. The water and glycerol contact angles of FF0.2, FF0.5, FF0.8 and FF1 were smaller than that of FF0 due to the amphiphilicity of the trifluoromethyl group. The surface tension (γ) was calculated according to the Young's equation, Wu model, and Wendt et al. model. The Flory–Huggins interaction parameter χ representing the relation between the polymer donor and acceptor is a critical index to evaluate the donor/acceptor miscibility. A low χ value means good miscibility, while a high χ value can trigger the phase separation in blend films. The χ values can be estimated using the empirical equation, , reported by Moons et al. As a result, the χ value of FF0.2:IT-4F is the highest among the studied samples, which is 15 times higher than that of FF0:IT-4F, representing the lowest miscibility of the polymer and acceptor, and thus better phase separation in the FF0.2:IT-4F device, which can also be verified by the AFM phase image. The χ values of FF0.5:IT-4F, FF0.8:IT-4F, and FF1:IT-4F are ∼3 times higher than that of FF0:IT-4F, indicating their low miscibility.

In order to investigate the crystallinity of the polymers, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out as shown in Fig. S11. FF0, FF0.2, FF0.5, and FF0.8 all showed a peak with a similar intensity, while FF1 showed no obvious peaks, indicating the weakest crystallinity of FF1, and thus the roughest morphology.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated trifluoromethylation as a promising approach to modulate the optoelectronic properties of polymers for improved photovoltaic performance. Compared with pristine PBDB-TF, the more the –CF3 content was introduced, the lower the HOMO level of the resulting polymers would be, due to its strong electron-withdrawing effect. The corresponding devices exhibited obviously larger Voc values, from 0.86 V (for PBDB-TF/IT-4F) to 0.96 V (for FF1/IT-4F). However, other characteristics, such as the mobility balance, film morphology, etc., would be inferior when the content of –CF3 is too large. The best performance was shown by the polymer with a TEST unit content of 20%. The FF0.2 based device manifested broad optical absorption, and efficient charge extraction and transport ability because of the stronger intermolecular aggregation, and favorable morphology with a well-ordered network and appropriate phase separation. Consequently, the FF0.2/IT-4F based device demonstrated the best PCE of 12.02% with a Voc value of 0.88 V, a Jsc value of 18.85 mA cm−2, and a FF of 72.70%. This study shows that introducing an electron-withdrawing –CF3 group is a potential method for the molecular design of diverse active layer materials to boost the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.
