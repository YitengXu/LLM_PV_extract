Triazole bridged novel donor–acceptor dendrimers with triphenylamine as the core and benzoheterazole as the surface unit have been synthesized by click chemistry via a convergent approach. All the dendrimers exhibited excellent optical and electrochemical properties, as supported by DFT calculations. Lower generation dendrimers exhibit better current-generating capacity and also show better power conversion efficiency than higher generation dendrimers when used as additives in dye-sensitized solar cells.

The development of new organic materials for application in molecular organic electronics, nanotechnology, and optoelectronic devices such as organic solar cells and organic light-emitting diodes is of remarkable scientific interest due to their relevance in the generation and rational use of energy. It is a great challenge to the research community to prepare low cost renewable energy sources that could also find a niche as power supplies in the emerging area of flexible optoelectronics. From more recent development, dendrimers are used as hole-transporting materials in electronics. Dendrimers are monodisperse macromolecules possessing a well-defined structure that can be precisely tailored with discrete functionalities to create multifunctional materials. These molecules, with a highly branched globular three-dimensional architecture, present multiple chains emanating from a single core. Challenges in the field of dendrimers lie in the synthesis using modern techniques and most frequently in the purification of the synthesized nano-molecules. Dendrimers have been extensively used in pioneering work by Vögtle, Tomalia, Fréchet, and Newkome. Dendrimers have received much attention in the areas of materials science and biological science such as in versatile biomimetic catalysis, drug delivery systems, sensors, solar cell additives, and efficient light-harvesting antenna, multi-valent diagnostics for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), molecular encapsulation, and in bio-conjugate chemistry. Recent work in this area focuses on the synthesis of new donor–acceptor dendrimers with a triazole bridging unit. If such a system has efficient electron transfer from the donor to acceptor upon photo-excitation of the sensitizer, the negative charge accumulated on the acceptor can be injected into the conduction band (CB) of a metal oxide semiconductor. Such a supramolecular architecture with combined donor and acceptor blocks can reduce the band gap energy also. Triphenylamine is an excellent electron-donating group with an aggregation-resistant and non-planar molecular shape which makes it an important donor in many systems. Organic glasses can be derived from highly electron-donating triphenylamine derivatives. Many factors play an important role in increasing the energy-harvesting efficiency of triphenylamine dendrimers by intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), molecular coplanarity, vibronic coupling, good stability to oxidation, and charge carrier mobility. Triphenylamine possesses a propeller-shaped, electron-rich structure which can maintain uninterrupted conjugation with the help of a lone pair of electrons at the central nitrogen atom, to enhance the electronic communication along with macromolecular chains, and make it behave as a strong electron donor, and radical cations help to enhance the electrical or photochemical stabilities for charge transfer from the donor to acceptor. Two electron acceptors can be introduced into the organic donor viz. the triphenylamine framework. The two electron acceptor groups can affect not only the absorption spectra or molar extinction coefficients, but also the HOMO and LUMO levels of the sensitizers. Research efforts to increase the power conversion efficiency in DSSCs using nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as pyrazole, imidazole, triazole, pyridine, pyrimidine, and pyrazine as additives have led to an increase in the Voc value and improvement in the efficiency. In 1991 Gratzel and O'Regan reported a DSSC capable of 10% energy conversion efficiency. Unlike the ruthenium sensitizers N719 or N3 commonly employed in DSSCs, most of the triphenylamine dyes possess one single group for TiO2 grafting. From a literature survey, there is no report on the synthesis of dendrimers through click chemistry with a benzoheterazole unit as an attractive acceptor at the periphery with an electron-donating triphenylamine unit as the central core in order to study their application in materials chemistry and biology. Thus, to fully explore the potential of the benzoheterazole unit, the synthesis of such a novel class of molecule is highly desirable. Benzoheterazole has interesting biological applications due to its anti-convulsant, anti-cancer, anti-HIV, anti-diabetic, anti-Alzheimer, anti-hypertensive, and anti-oxidant properities. Nowadays, click chemistry has emerged as an efficient tool for the rapid synthesis of triazole bridged dendrimers via Cu(I)-catalyzed Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition introduced by Sharpless and co-workers which has been widely used in the design and synthesis of optoelectronic materials and affords a good way to achieve target molecules under mild reaction conditions with high efficiency. Generally, click chemistry provides excellent regioselectivity and a high yield without any side reactions. Recently, we have used dendrimers as additives to improve the efficiency of DSSCs. In our laboratory dendrimers with dimethyl isophthalate and pyrene at the periphery have been used as additives in DSSCs. The present investigation mainly focuses on the synthesis, photophysical and electrochemical properties, and DSSC application of dendrimers 1–8 with a benzoheterazole surface group (Fig. 1).


In order to explore the utility of benzoheterazole as a surface unit in dendrimers, the dendritic wedges 13 and 14 were synthesized as outlined in Scheme 1. Our synthesis starts from the reaction of 4-methyl cinnamic acid with 2-aminophenol/2-amino thiophenol in POCl3 at 100 °C for 5 h to give 2-[4-(methyl)styryl]benzoxazole 9 and 2-[4-(methyl)styryl]benzothiazole 10 in 85% and 90% yields, respectively. In the 1H NMR spectrum of 2-[4-(methyl)styryl]benzothiazole 10, the olefinic hydrogens are cis to each other due to twisted intramolecular charge transfer from the donor 4-methylbenzene and acceptor benzothiazole, and also hydrogen bonding interaction in the presence of polar solvents changes the geometry from the trans to cis form in benzothiazole. The bromides 11 and 12 were obtained in 65% and 70% yields by the reaction of 2-[4-(methyl)styryl]benzoheterazole 9 and 10 with NBS. Azidation of 11 and 12 with 1.2 equivalents of NaN3 in a mixture of acetone/H2O (4:1) at 60 °C for 6 h gave the azides 13 and 14 in 91% and 89% yields, respectively.

We then focused our attention on the synthesis of the first generation dendritic chlorides, the building unit viz. 3,5-bis(propargyloxy)benzyl chloride 16, which was obtained as follows: the bis-propargyl derivative 15 was obtained by the reaction of methyl 3,5-dihydroxybenzoate with propargyl bromide in dry DMF in the presence of K2CO3 followed by reduction with LiAlH4 to give the corresponding alcohol, which was then reacted with SOCl2/Py in DCM to give 3,5-bis(propargyloxy)benzyl chloride 16. Reaction of the chloride 16 with 2.1 equivalents of 2-[4-(azidomethyl)styryl]benzoheterazole 13 and 14 under click reaction conditions viz. CuSO4·5H2O and sodium ascorbate in a 1:1 mixture of t-BuOH and water at room temperature, afforded the first generation dendritic chlorides (G1-Cl) 17 and 18 in 90% and 87% yields, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum of dendritic chloride 17 displays three sets of singlets at δ 4.47, 5.16, and 5.55 ppm for benzylic chloromethane, N-methylene, and O-methylene protons respectively, in addition to the signals for the aromatic protons. The 13C NMR spectrum of 17 shows signals at δ 46.0, 53.8, and 62.1 ppm for benzylic chloromethane, N-methylene, and O-methylene carbons respectively, in addition to the signals for the aromatic carbons. The dendritic chlorides 17 and 18 were further converted into the first generation dendritic azides (G1-N3) 19 and 20 in 87% and 86% yields, respectively by the reaction of the chlorides 17 and 18 with 1.2 equivalents of NaN3 in DMF at room temperature for 24 h.
The core unit diyne 25 and triyne 26 can be synthesized by a multi-step procedure as reported in the literaturevia simple bromination of triphenylamine with 2.1/3.1 equivalents of N-bromosuccinimide in DMF followed by Sonogashira coupling of 3.0/4.5 equivalents of trimethylsilylacetylene in a mixture of THF/Et3N to give the bis-silylated acetylene 23 and tris-silylated acetylene 24 in 70% and 82% yields, respectively. Removal of the TMS protecting group using K2CO3 in methanol gives the diyne 25 and the triyne 26 in 90% and 80% yields, respectively (Scheme 2).
Treatment of 1.0 equivalents of diyne 25 with 2.1 equivalents of 2-[4-(azidomethyl)styryl]benzoheterazole 13 and 14 in the presence of CuSO4·5H2O (5 mol%) and sodium ascorbate (10 mol%) in a mixture of THF and H2O (1:1) at room temperature for 12 h afforded dendrimers 1 and 2 in 65% and 70% yields, respectively (Scheme 3). In the 1H NMR spectrum, dendrimer 1 shows a four proton singlet at δ 5.60 ppm for N-methylene protons and a two proton singlet at δ 7.63 ppm for triazole protons in addition to the signals for aromatic protons. In the 13C NMR spectrum, dendrimer 1 displays an N-methylene carbon at δ 53.8 ppm in addition to the signals for the aromatic carbons. In the ESI mass spectrum, dendrimer 1 shows a molecular ion peak at m/z 846 [M + H]+. Similarly, the structure of the zeroth generation dendrimer 2 was also confirmed from spectral and analytical data.
In order to synthesize the first generation dendrimers 3 and 4, 1.0 equivalent of the diyne 25 was reacted with 2.1 equivalents of each dendritic azide 19 and 20 in 5 mol% CuSO4·5H2O with 10 mol% sodium ascorbate in a mixture of DMF and H2O (4:1) for 12 h at room temperature to afford the dendrimers 3 and 4 in 58% and 53% yields, respectively (Scheme 3). In the 1H NMR spectrum, dendrimer 3 displays three singlets at δ 5.12, 5.53, and 5.62 ppm for two types of benzylic N-methylene protons and an O-methylene proton, and two signals at δ 8.30 and 8.53 ppm for the triazole protons of two types of triazole ring systems viz. an outer one, at the dendritic wedge, and an inner one, near the core unit respectively. In the 13C NMR spectrum, dendrimer 3 displays three signals at δ 52.5, 61.5, and 79.1 ppm for two types of benzylic N-methylene carbon and O-methylene carbon in addition to the signal for the aromatic carbons. The ESI mass spectrum of 3 shows the molecular ion peak at m/z 1881 [M + H]+. Similarly the structure of the first generation dendrimer 4 was also confirmed from spectral and analytical data.
The triyne 26 was then utilized for the synthesis of dendrimers 5, 6, 7, and 8. Reaction of 3.1 equivalents of the dendritic wedge 13 with 1 equivalent of the triyne 26 under click chemistry conditions gave the dendrimer 5 in a 60% yield (Scheme 4). In the 1H NMR spectrum, dendrimer 5 shows a six proton singlet at δ 5.62 ppm for N-methylene protons and a three proton singlet at δ 7.80 ppm for triazole protons in addition to the signals for the aromatic protons. In the 13C NMR spectrum, dendrimer 5 displays an N-methylene carbon at δ 52.6 ppm in addition to the signals for the aromatic carbons. The mass spectrum of 5 shows a molecular ion peak at m/z 1146 [M + H]+. A similar method was employed for the synthesis of dendrimers 6, 7, and 8 in 67%, 55%, and 50% yields from 1 equivalent of the triyne 26 with 3.3 equivalents of the dendritic wedge 14, 19, and 20, respectively. In the 1H NMR spectrum, dendrimer 8 displays three singlets at δ 5.13, 5.54, and 5.61 ppm for two types of benzylic N-methylene protons and O-methylene protons, a singlet corresponding to six protons at δ 7.59 ppm for the triazolyl protons at the dendritic wedge adjacent to the benzothiazole unit, and a singlet corresponding to three protons at δ 8.53 ppm for the triazolyl protons near to the core unit, in addition to the signals for aromatic protons. In the 13C NMR spectrum, dendrimer 8 displays three signals at δ 52.5, 61.1, and 79.0 ppm for two types of N-methylene and one type of O-methylene carbon in addition to the signals for aromatic carbons. The ESI mass spectrum of 8 shows the molecular ion peak at m/z 2796 [M + H]+. The elemental composition also supports the molecular formula of the dendrimer 8. Similarly, spectroscopic and analytical methods were employed to confirm the structure of the dendrimers 6 and 7.

The presence of a double bond incorporated between the electron donor and electron acceptor can lead to trans to cis isomerization due to twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state formation. The trans-2-[4-(methyl)styryl]benzothiazole 10 is a push–pull aromatic olefin, which has a benzothiazole ring (acceptor) on one side of the olefin bond and a 4-methyl benzene ring (donor) on the other side. The donor and acceptor groups are perpendicular to each other in the molecular frame. Fayed et al. first reported dimethylaminostyrylbenzothiazole (DMASBT)-based intramolecular charge transfer in donor and acceptor systems evidenced by the increase in the dipole moment. Saha et al. also re-investigated the structure of trans-2-[4-(dimethylamino)styryl]benzothiazole and both experimentally and theoretically proposed that DMASBT emits from the TICT state in polar solvents. To determine the high dipole moment in the excited state with twisting of the 4-methyl benzene ring, thereby getting stabilized in polar solvents (chloroform-d, dimethyl sulfoxide-d6), the trans geometry changes to the cis form due to the interaction of the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom of the benzothiazole unit resulting in hydrogen bonding with polar solvents (Fig. 2). The dipole moment of their excited state is greater than that of the ground state. Theoretical calculations clearly suggest that the HOMO is more localized on the donor 4-methyl benzene ring and the LUMO is localized on the rest of the benzothiazole and there is a minimum overlap between these molecular orbitals. The DFT calculations predict a rotational barrier of 0.34 eV for the conversion of one geometrical isomer to the other as reported earlier by Krishnamoorthy et al. The optimized geometrical parameters for both the cis and trans isomers of 10 are compiled in Table 1. The trans form of the benzothiazole unit is most stable at room temperature. Furthermore, an energy minimization study was carried out and the energy difference between the cis and trans isomers is −6.06 kcal mol−1. The energy value of the trans one is higher than the cis value proving that the trans isomer is more stable compared to the cis isomer. This result clearly reveals that the olefinic double bond is only trans, however it gets converted to the cis form for the benzothiazole system alone in the presence of polar solvents.

The UV-vis absorption and emission spectra of dendrimers 1–8 were recorded in DMF at room temperature and the λmax values are summarized in Table 2. Dendrimers 1–8 exhibit strong absorption bands in the range of 324–346 nm. The absorption maxima observed for all the dendrimers could be due to π–π* transition. The absorption band could be due to the presence of benzoheterazole and the donor triphenylamine unit in the molecular system. In fact this observation suggests that both the chromophores involving benzoheterazole and triphenylamine could be responsible for the broad absorption bands for the dendrimers 1–8. The molar absorption coefficient increases for the bis-substituted dendritic wedges with the benzoxazole and benzothiazole group as the dendrimer generation increases. The benzoxazole and benzothiazole dendrimers 3 and 4 show an increase in their molar absorption coefficient compared with that of the zeroth generation benzoxazole and benzothiazole dendrimers 1 and 2 due to the valence effect. However in the case of tris-substituted dendritic wedges, the molar absorption coefficient decreases for both the benzoxazole and benzothiazole dendrimer as the dendrimer generation increases from the zeroth to the first generation. The molar absorption coefficient of tris-substituted benzoxazole dendrimer 7 and tris-substituted benzothiazole dendrimer 8 shows a decrease which could be due to excess molecular crowding in the tris-substituted dendritic wedges. In the fluorescence spectra, the emission values are obtained by exciting all the dendrimers 1–8 at the corresponding absorption maximum. The dendrimers 1–8 exhibit strong florescence emission in the region of 388–414 nm and the λem values for the fluorescence spectra are shown in Table 2. The emission spectra show that the benzoheterazole dendrimers show a gradual decrease in emission intensity as the dendrimer generation increases. The decreasing fluorescence intensity is due to fluorescence quenching with an increase in the number of benzoheterazole units for self-quenching and the enhancement of non-radiative transitions.

The electrochemical properties of the benzoheterazole dendrimers 1–8 were studied by recording cyclic voltammetry in DMF at room temperature at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 with n-Bu4NPF6 as the supporting electrolyte, a glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and a Pt electrode as the counter electrode. All the synthesized benzoheterazole dendrimers exhibited an electrochemical response in cyclic voltammetry and the electrochemical parameters are shown in Table 3. The redox behavior of dendrimers 1, 3, 5, and 7 and 2, 4, 6, and 8 are shown in Fig. 3a and b. The oxidation and reduction potential for all the dendrimers appears in the potential range of −2.0 to +2.0 V. In cyclic voltammetry two oxidation peaks appear between −1.51 to 1.34 V and two reduction peaks appear between −0.73 to −1.55 V for all the dendrimers. The oxidation and reduction peaks for all dendrimers 1–8 were attributed to the presence of strong electron-donating triphenylamine and electron-withdrawing benzoheterazole groups. All the dendrimers exhibit the first oxidation potential, which is attributed to the oxidation of the triphenylamine core which is quasi-reversible and benzoheterazole can undergo a quasi-reversible single electron transfer process in the cathodic scan direction. From the cyclic voltammetry in Fig. 3a it is clear that on increasing the number of benzoxazole groups at the periphery, the anodic peak potential, which is shifted towards a slightly higher positive potential in benzoxazole dendrimers 1, 3, 5, and 7, is due to the presence of a triazole and heterocyclic ring. Dendrimers 1, 3, 5, and 7 show a gradual increase in Epa from 1.20, 1.34, 1.23, and 1.34 V and Epc increases slightly from −0.73, −0.76, −0.75, and −0.81 V. For the benzothiazole dendrimers 2, 4, 6, and 8, there is no potential shift upon increasing the generation growth and the anodic peak potential abruptly decreases, which could be due to intramolecular interactions within the benzothiazole moiety. The oxidation and reduction potential of the dendrimers from cyclic voltammetry provides strong evidence for the utility of the synthesized molecules in DSSC application.

In order to characterize the optical and electronic properties, it is essential to examine the HOMOs, LUMOs, energy gaps, and oscillator strength. To gain insight into the molecular structures and electron distribution, the geometries of the triphenylamine-containing benzoheterazole unit were fully optimized and density functional theory calculations were carried out employing the B3LYP/6-31G level with the Gaussian 09 programme package. The effect of the solvents was simulated by employing DFT calculations using the polarizable continuum model (PCM). As shown in Fig. 4, for the zeroth generation dendrimers 1, 2, 5, and 6, the excited state LUMO was only localized on a heterocyclic ring and also self-charge transfer by the benzoheterazole group is observed. From the HOMO level of the zeroth generation dendrimers 1, 2, 5, and 6, the electron density is homogeneously distributed on the electron donor triphenylamine and triazole as a linker system. However in the case of dendrimers 1 and 2, the electron density is distributed to the withdrawing group of the phenyl ring due to the conjugation between the phenyl rings in the core unit. It may imply that the planar benzoheterazole blocked by triphenylamine can make the electron distribution of the HOMO similar to the electron distribution of the LUMO. The well overlapped HOMO and LUMO on the linker triazole unit suggest the inductive or withdrawing electron tendency from the triphenylamine donor unit to the benzoheterazole unit. Thus, the HOMO and LUMO excitation induced by light irradiation could move the excited electron distribution or charge transfer across the triazole bridge from the donor unit to the acceptor unit. The oscillator strength can also prove the charge transfer from the donor to the periphery, and the excitation energy values support this observation. The frontier molecular orbital of the zeroth generation dendrimers reveals that the HOMO–LUMO excitation moves the electron density distribution from the donor triphenylamine to the acceptor benzoheterazole at the periphery through the triazole bridging unit (Table 4).

The role of adsorption in device performance is based on the molecular volumes of the dendrimers. In donor–acceptor benzoheterazole dendrimers of higher generation, the low efficiency is due to the total amount of dye absorbed on the TiO2 surface which has a major influence on the solar cell performance and the summarized data are listed in Table 5. The higher generation dendrimers 3, 4, 7, and 8 can bind with the TiO2 surface and hence the molecular volume of the dendrimer increases and also the amount of dye absorbed on the TiO2 surface will play an important role in the solar cell performance in DSSCs. When the generation of the benzoheterazole dendritic acceptor increases, the molecular volume of the dyes increases about 2 to 3-fold. It is clear that the molecular volume or bulkiness of the acceptor moiety plays an important role in the dye uptake. Upon increasing from a lower to higher generation, the molecular volume of the acceptor unit increases and the amount of dye uptake decreases in the benzoxazole dendrimers in the following order: 1 (3.5 × 10−6 mol cm−2) > 5 (3.4 × 10−6 mol cm−2) > 3 (3.1 × 10−6 mol cm−2) > 6 (3.0 × 10−6 mol cm−2), and also in the case of the benzothiazole dendrimers the dye uptake gradually decreases in the following order: 2 (3.3 × 10−6 mol cm−2) > 6 (3.0 × 10−6 mol cm−2) > 4 (3.0 × 10−6 mol cm−2) > 8 (3.0 × 10−6 mol cm−2). As a result, in the higher generation dendrimers 3, 4, 7, and 8, the amount of dye adsorption on the TiO2 surface is directly proportional to the high molecular volume of the acceptor unit and weak intermolecular π–π interaction.

Dye-sensitized solar cells appear to be highly promising alternatives to more expensive solar cell technologies. The organic nitrogenous compounds have an influence on the efficiency of DSSCs which can be explained by the shift of the conduction band potential and the improvement of solar cell performance by the addition of a dendrimer additive to the redox electrolyte. Hence, we have planned and synthesized a new type of donor–acceptor triazole dendrimer, dendrimers 1–8, and employed them as additives in DSSCs. Fig. 5a and b show the current–voltage (J–V) curves for the undoped electrolyte system and the doped electrolyte system with the benzoheterazole dendrimers 1–8. The photovoltaic performance of the short-circuit current density (Jsc), the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the fill factor, and the electric energy efficiency (η) is summarized in Table 5. The present investigations mainly focus on the newly synthesized donor–acceptor triazole bridged dendrimers and the highest power conversion efficiency of 8.02% was observed when dendrimer 1 was used as an additive in the DSSC. In a donor–acceptor dendrimer system, on increasing the generation, the power conversion efficiency (η) decreases due to aggregation of the dendrimers on the TiO2 surface which enhances considerably the degree of charge recombination between the injected electrons and the oxidized dendrimers. The variation of Voc with the increase in generation is mostly associated with charge recombination between the injected electrons in the positive shift of the conduction band and electron acceptor in the electrolyte interface. The open-circuit current density increases with the increasing generation and the power conversion efficiency gradually decreases with benzoxazole dendrimers 1, 3, 5, and 7 used as additives, which could be due to back electron transfer to the semiconductor–electrolyte interface. In the case of benzothiazole dendrimers 2, 4, 6, and 8, Voc decreases with increasing generation and the power conversion efficiency increases due to cation regeneration and reduces the back current, delocalizing π electrons on the conjugated donor moiety, and the bridged triazole can generate more excited electrons under the same light excitation. It is very clear that the photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs can be affected by increasing the generation growth. The number of acceptor units increases while increasing the generation and the secondary transition progressively gains intensity and shifts to lower energy due to charge transfer from the central donor unit to the two distinct couples of branches which are simultaneously involved in the excitation. An increased dark current by planar organic molecules has been observed by Snaith et al. The formation of π-stacked aggregation and self-quenching are the major factors for the low conversion efficiency of DSSCs. The aggregation of the dendrimers may lead to intermolecular quenching or molecules residing in the system that are not attached to the semiconductor surface. Therefore, when the dendrimers are anchored on the surface of TiO2, the LUMO centered on the anchoring moiety should enhance the orbital overlap with the titanium 3d orbital and subsequently favour the electron injection to the conduction band of TiO2.


Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is performed to elucidate the interfacial charge recombination processes in DSSCs based on the eight dendrimer additives under dark conditions. The Nyquist plot for dendrimers 1–8 are shown in Fig. 6a and b and the corresponding data are listed in Table 6. The Nyquist plots have two semicircles and the larger semicircle at lower frequencies indicates charge recombination resistance at the TiO2/dendrimer/electrolyte interface, while the smaller semicircle at higher frequencies corresponds to the charge recombination processes at the Pt/electrolyte interface. The large semicircles indicate that the charge transfer behavior between TiO2 and the dendrimer electrolytes is mainly due to the increasing number of surface moieties for higher generation dendrimers. As shown in Fig. 6a and b, the radius of the larger semicircle increases for lower generation dendrimers in the order of 1 > 5 > 6 > 2 indicating that the charge recombination resistance gradually increases in the zeroth generation dendrimers compared with that of the higher generation dendrimers. The RCT values of the benzoxazole dendrimer show charge transfer resistance for the dendrimers in the following order: 1 (71.2 Ω) > 5 (56.5 Ω) > 3 (38.6 Ω) > 7 (16.2 Ω), and also the benzothiazole dendrimer exhibits charge transfer resistance in the following order: 2 (13.5 Ω) > 6 (25.3 Ω) > 4 (46.4 Ω) > 8 (21.7 Ω). The low RCT value indicates the high charge loss in the TiO2/electrolyte interface and also faster charge recombination and a larger dark current. The large value of RCT indicates more effective suppression of the recombination of the injected electrons with I−/I3− in the electrolyte. The zeroth generation dendrimers 1, 2, 5, and 6 show a significantly larger charge recombination resistance (RCT) value than that of the higher generation dendrimers, implying small charge recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, with a consequent high Voc for the lower generation dendrimers with the following order of decreasing Voc: 1 (764 mV) > 5 (745 mV) > 6 (731 mV). The recombination rate caused by backward electron transfer was estimated using the Bode-phase spectra for the DSSCs, as shown in Fig. 7a and b, and the calculated electron lifetimes are shown in Table 6. The EIS Bode plot exhibits two Bode frequency peaks for electron transfer at the TiO2/dendrimer/electrolyte interface and redox charge transfer at the counter electrode. The peak frequency at the lower frequency region is related to the charge recombination rate and the reciprocal is regarded as the electron lifetime. The peak at a lower frequency corresponds to the large semicircle in the Nyquist plot of the dendrimer which is shifted to a higher frequency when the molecular volume of the higher generation dendrimer increases. On increasing the dendritic generation, the electron lifetime gradually decreases which is shown by the dendrimer order: 2 (4.8 ms) > 6 (2.2 ms) > 4 (1.6 ms) > 8 (1.4 ms). For the benzothiazole dendrimers 2, 4, 6, and 8, the electron recombination to the I3− ions enhances the electron lifetime to confirm the better DSSC performance. The high molecular volume of dendrimers 3, 4, 7, and 8 could not prevent the I3− ions reaching the TiO2 surface, thus leading to the enlarged charge recombination or dark current and shortened electron lifetime. It is believed that having the maximum amount of dye adsorbed on the TiO2 film and a greater number of benzoheterazole units in higher generation dendrimers appears to raise the chances of the electrolyte being close to the TiO2 surface.

In conclusion, triphenylamine core dendrimers with benzoheterazole surface units and triazole bridging units were synthesized in high yields by a convergent synthetic strategy via a click chemistry approach. All the dendrimers exhibited excellent optical and electrochemical properties. The cyclic voltammetry studies revealed that the triphenylamine core unit showed quasi-reversible behavior. The zeroth generation dendrimers 1 and 5 exhibited a better power conversion efficiency of 8.0% and 7.6%, respectively when used as additives in DSSCs than the control (N719 dye/LiI/I2) did, as well as when other benzoheterazole dendrimers are used as additives. DSSC studies clearly revealed that as the number of benzoheterazole and triazole units increases from the zeroth to the first generation dendrimers, the DSSC performance decreases due to aggregation and back electron transfer to the conduction band of TiO2. Density functional theory is also supported by optical, electrochemical, as well as DSSC studies. Further studies to increases the efficiency in DSSCs with benzoheterazole dendrimers as additives are underway.


All the reagents and solvents were obtained from Sigma Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, Merck and Avra chemical companies. The known products were identified by comparison of their melting points and spectral data already reported in the literature. The melting points were uncorrected and were determined using Toshniwal melting point apparatus by the open capillary tube method. The UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Hitachi U-3210 spectrophotometer. The emission spectra were recorded on a HORIBA JOBIN YVON Fluoromax-4 spectrophotometer. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 300 MHz NMR spectrometer. The chemical shifts are reported in ppm (δ) with TMS as an internal standard and the coupling constants (J) are expressed in Hz. Elemental analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240B elemental analyzer. Electrochemical studies were carried out on a CH instrument electrochemical analyzer. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) spectra were measured with a LCQ AD mass spectrometer. The Gaussian 09 package was used for density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the polarizable continuum model (PCM). Current–voltage (I–V) measurement was performed using a Metrohm Autolab 302N potentiostat/galvanostat with an FRA32M module controlled by NOVA 1.10 software.


The nanocrystalline TiO2 photoelectrode was prepared as described earlier. The prepared TiO2 electrodes were immersed in a 1 mM solution of the sensitized dye di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) (N719 dye) in absolute ethanol for one day. The dye-coated photoelectrode was washed, dried and immediately used for the measurement of solar cell performance. A sandwich-type photoelectrochemical cell was used, which was composed of a dye-coated TiO2 photoanode. Platinum-coated fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) acted as a counter electrode. The electrolyte solution was injected into the space between the photoanode and counter electrode. The electrolyte solution was composed of lithium iodide (LiI, 0.1 M), iodine (0.01 M), and dendrimer (0.1 mM) additives in 10 mL DMF solvent. The photovoltaic properties were measured under simulated solar light at 70 mW cm−2. Current–voltage (J–V) measurement was performed using a Metrohm Autolab 302N potentiostat/galvanostat with an FRA32M module controlled by NOVA 1.10 software. The apparent cell area of the TiO2 photoelectrode was 1 cm2 (1 cm × 1 cm).


A mixture of diyne 25 and triyne 26 (1.0 equiv.) and 2-(4-(azidomethyl)phenyl)benzoheterazole 13 and 14 (2.2 equiv./3.3 equiv.) was dissolved in a mixture of THF and H2O (1:1, 20 mL) and sodium ascorbate (10 mol%) was added followed by the addition of CuSO4·5H2O (5 mol%). The reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The residue obtained after evaporation of the solvent was washed thoroughly with water and dissolved in CHCl3 (3 × 100 mL). The organic layer was washed with water (200 mL) and brine (50 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and then the solvent was evaporated to give the crude triazole product, which was purified by column chromatography (SiO2) with CHCl3 or CHCl3–MeOH as eluent to give the corresponding triazole dendrimers.
