Indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) have attracted great attention due to their potential applicability as a power source to the emerging Internet of Things (IoTs) – low power electronic devices equipped with sensors, actuators, and internet connectivity. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are well known for their environmental friendliness and high efficiency under indoor conditions, as they show strong absorbance in the visible light range. However, DSSC efficiency under one sun conditions has not shown significant improvements in the last decade. Considering this context, herein, energy loss factors in DSSCs are thoroughly investigated and the feasible efficiency limits in DSSCs are calculated based on some assumptions under outdoor and indoor conditions and compared with the SQ limit of an ideal solar cell. The feasible efficiency limit of DSSCs under these assumptions under one sun conditions is 23.78% at a band gap of 1.34 eV. However, under indoor light conditions, the maximum feasible PCE for DSSCs is 35–41% compared to 50–58% for an SQ ideal solar cell at an absorber band gap between 1.82 and 1.96 eV. The possible Jsc and Voc of DSSCs under indoor conditions are in the range of 98–317.12 μA cm−2 and 0.93–1.41 V, respectively, and are 109–352.35 μA cm−2 and 1.08–1.55 V, respectively, for SQ ideal solar cells under different light sources of illuminance 1000 lux. Furthermore, DSSCs under indoor conditions (1000 lux) could provide a maximum power intensity of >100 μW cm−2, suggesting the suitability of IDSSCs for activating IoT devices in a smart house.

When a solar cell is irradiated with light, only photons with energy higher than the band gap (Eg) of the absorber will be absorbed and generate an electron–hole pair which will be separated at the interface and transferred through the outer circuit under the built-in voltage, thus producing electricity. According to Shockley–Queisser (SQ) just over 33% of solar energy is convertible by harvesting UV-vis and near-infrared (NIR) spectra with a p–n junction solar cell of Eg 1.31 eV. Crystalline silicon solar cells are considered the best solar harvesting materials; however, the processing cost of crystalline silicon semiconductors makes them unfeasible for large-scale power generation. Current photovoltaics (PVs) like dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), polymer solar cells (PSCs), and perovskite solar cells (PrSCs) are considered low-cost PVs due to simple fabrication process. That's why, in the last few decades, chemically processed emerging PVs have been intensively investigated.

The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells is determined from the steady-state current–voltage curve of the solar cells under different operating conditions. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) depends on the Eg of the absorber, while the short-circuit current (Jsc) depends on the quantity of photon flux absorbed by the absorber. Electrical power is the multiplication of current and voltage; therefore, a compromise should be made between them. At the optimum electrical power, the incompatibility between the Eg of the absorber and the broad solar spectrum results in the loss of photons with energy below the Eg, along with the thermalization loss as the carriers, with energy greater than the band gap, move back to the conduction band edge (ECB). These two losses are considered the biggest losses in the solar to electrical power conversion. Furthermore, several loss processes limit the PCE of p–n junction solar cells under one sun illumination to 33.37%. These loss issues have been discussed in more detail in several articles.
Although DSSCs have been studied for several decades, the maximum efficiency is still not more than 13–14%. Even so, owing to the insufficient stability and promising dyes for NIR absorption, as well as the overall long-term device stability, scientists are struggling for a highly efficient DSSC panel for industrialization. In DSSCs, compared to p–n junction solar cells, there are extra pathways that promote energy loss. Hence, it is important to recognize the loss processes in DSSCs. In DSSCs, light absorption and charge carrier transportation are mediated by different substances. The overall process in a DSSC can be divided into four different fundamental steps: (i) photoexcitation of a sensitizer dye; (ii) injection of the electron into the conduction band of a semiconductor metal oxide from the excited dye and flow to the counter electrode (CE) via an external circuit; (iii) reduction of an oxidized electrolyte at the CE interface; (iv) regeneration of the dye by accepting electrons from the redox system (see Fig. 1). Due to the Frankel type exciton (spatially localized electron–hole pair, which is electrically neutral, having a large binding energy and correspondingly small radius), and heterogeneous charge transfers at the absorber and charge carrier interface, DSSCs demonstrate a considerably higher energy loss, which typically originates from the driving force for electron injection after photoexcitation and dye regeneration, combined with interfacial charge recombination loss reactions.
Excitingly, most of the dyes confirm remarkable absorption in the UV-vis zone, endowing them with a better chance to be compatible with indoor light conditions and produce better PCEs compared to group III–V and silicon solar cells. Under indoor light conditions, PV devices normally experience a voltage loss of about 0.14–0.21 V. Consequently, PV devices with a higher band gap will be capable of maintaining a large portion of their open-circuit voltage (Voc) under indoor light illumination. In this sense, DSSCs have evolved to be potential candidates for use in indoor photovoltaic (IPV) applications. Furthermore, the feeble intensity of indoor light solves the photo-bleaching problems, which are commonly a major challenge in organic dyes under sunlight, and thus unlocks a tremendous opportunity for molecular designs of new dyes for IPVs.
The sphere of IPVs is rising very quickly with an estimated market value of $850 million by 2023, which is expected to touch $10 billion in the following years. Furthermore, the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoTs) – low power electronic devices equipped with sensors, actuators, and internet connectivity – demands energy harvesting devices that work under ambient conditions and indoor DSSCs (IDSSCs) stand out as one of the most promising candidates. Thus, it is of great importance to estimate the maximum attainable efficiency of DSSCs, especially, for indoor light conditions. The SQ limit is based on the principle that radiative loss is unavoidable and only the photons with an energy above the band gap are converted into electron–hole pairs with a quantum efficiency of 100%. However, DSSCs are considerably different from ideal p–n junction solar cells and thus require a different approach to estimate the maximum attainable PCE. A decade ago, Snaith estimated a maximum attainable PCE of 20.25% for a DSSC with an optical band gap of 1.31 eV (940 nm), assuming a loss-in-potential of 0.4 eV. However, there is no report estimating the maximum attainable PCE of DSSCs under indoor light conditions. What is more, it is also of great importance to understand the process of energy loss in a DSSC for its further improvement.
In this work, we have provided an in-depth overview of energy loss factors in DSSCs and predicted the maximum attainable PCE in comparison with an ideal SQ solar cell under both one sun and indoor light conditions. Considering the different loss factors, it was found that DSSCs could provide a PCE of 23.78% with an absorber Eg of 1.34 eV under the one sun conditions and a range of PCE from 35–41% based on different indoor light sources. Furthermore, the best performing DSSC data are summarized and compared with the calculated maximum efficiency. Finally, we have discussed the practical applicability and future outlooks of DSSCs under one sun and indoor light conditions.

The photovoltaic performance of a solar cell is measured from a current density–voltage (J–V) curve as shown in Fig. 2. For a given irradiance of the incident light (Pin), PCE can be estimated as:

(1)
where
Jsc is the short-circuit current density, Voc is the open-circuit voltage, FF is the fill-factor, and Pmax is the maximum power density of the cell. Eqn (1) reveals that the PCE of the solar cell can be explained by three terms; Jsc, Voc, and FF.

The photocurrent is the extraction of photogenerated electrons. As each absorbed photon of energy higher than the band gap of the absorber is converted to one electron, the photocurrent is a function of the incident photon flux density (ΦINPh) and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the cells over energy (E) used for light absorption. It can be defined by the following equation:
(2)
Voltage is the difference of the electrochemical potentials (quasi-Fermi levels) of the electrons and holes in the materials at which the electrons and holes are extracted. Thus the Voc is lower than the band gap of the materials. The radiative Voc is obtained from the SQ diode eqn (3) at which the external current (J) is zero:
(3)
when
J = 0,

(4)
where
q is the elementary charge, V is the output voltage, n is the cell ideality factor, kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and J0,rad is the radiative saturation current density, which is given by eqn (5):

(5)
By plugging in the expressions for Jsc and J0,rad to eqn (4), Voc can be expressed as a function of energy, where ΦBBPh is the black body (BB) radiation of the cell at 300 K. The photon flux radiated by a BB at temperature T is given by the following equation:
(6)
where
h is Plank's constant, and c is the speed of light. However, in real devices, open-circuit voltage is further reduced by the broadening of the absorption edge and nonradiative recombination.

There is a compromise between the voltage and current of a solar cell. At low voltage, the extraction of the current is convenient, and the EQE of the absorber controls the current flow. Conversely, at high voltage, the recombination current, which flows against the photocurrent, rises till the power starts to fall and becomes zero at the open-circuit voltage. At this point, dark currents cancel out the photocurrent. The voltage at which the generated electrical power is maximum, which yields the cells' stated efficiency, lies in between the two extreme cases of low and high voltage. FF characterizes how effectively the photogenerated carriers can be extracted out of a photovoltaic device. This infers a drop of power concerning the product JscVoc. For a negligible effect of resistive elements on the cell performance, the fill factor can be approximated as:
(7)
where
νoc = qVoc/nkBT is the normalized voltage, for ideal solar cells n = 1, and FF can be defined as FF0. In the original work, SQ used the BB radiation spectrum at 6000 K (Fig. 3, black dotted line) with a geometrical factor to approximate the solar spectrum (Fig. 3, red dotted line). However, subsequent calculations have employed the standard solar spectrum of AM1.5G (Fig. 3) and a back surface mirror that increases the maximum attainable efficiency to 33.7% for a single-junction solar cell, which corresponds to a band gap of 1.34 eV.


The working principle of DSSCs is different from that of p–n junction solar cells, and the Voc for DSSCs cannot be estimated from eqn (4). Furthermore, eqn (7) is not appropriate to calculate FF for DSSCs, which is discussed in Section 3.3. Therefore, we need a different approach to calculate the efficiency parameters for DSSCs, which is critically discussed in this section.


In DSSCs, Voc is the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the conduction band electrons (EF,n) at mesoporous TiO2 and the redox potential (EF,redox) of the redox system. This implies that the Voc is the band gap of the sensitizer, with the subtraction of the potential loss (Vloss) resulting from the injection overpotential (ΔEinj), the recombination overpotential (ΔErec), and the dye-regeneration overpotential (ΔEreg), as shown in Fig. 1. Thus, for DSSCs, Voc can be expressed in terms of Eg using the following relationship:

Voc = (EF,redox − EF,n)/q = Eg/q − Vloss
(8)
with

qVloss = ΔEinj + ΔEreg + ΔErec
(9)
According to the Nernst equation, the redox potential of a single electron redox system can be written as:
EF,redox = E0 − kBTln(Cox/Cred),
(10)
where
E0 is the formal redox potential containing nonideality effects, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and Cox and Cred are the oxidized and reduced species concentrations in the redox system. The electron Fermi energy level within the semiconductor TiO2 can be express as:

EF,n = Ec + nkBT ln(nc/Nc),
(11)
where
nc is the conduction band electron density, and Nc is the effective density of the electronic states below the conduction band. The value of Nc for anatase TiO2 is about 1020 cm−3. Under open-circuit conditions under illumination, EF,n is determined by the nc, which depends in turn on the generation flux of injected electrons and the rate constants for electron recombination.

The potential loss in the electron injection and the dye regeneration is the requirement of the thermodynamic driving force for electron transfer (ET). According to Gerischer–Marcus, the interfacial electron transfer rate at the electrode surface is proportional to the overlap between the unoccupied acceptor energy states and the occupied donor energy states. The electron transfer rate from a donor occupied energy state to an acceptor unoccupied energy state is expressed by Gerischer–Marcus according to eqn (12):
(12)
where
κ(E) is the transfer frequency, D(E) is the unoccupied acceptor energy states, and Wdon(E) is the donor occupied excited energy state distribution function. The energy states of the donor, Wdon(E), and acceptor, Wacc(E), show a Gaussian type distribution given by eqn (13). The energy state distribution of the donor and acceptor system is governed by the interfacial electron transfer reorganization energy, which is related to the interactions between the donor or acceptor molecules and their solvation sphere:

(13)
where
E is the energy of the states, E0 is the energy of the most probable solvation state, and λ is the reorganization energy of interfacial electron transfer during the electron injection or dye regeneration. Fig. 4 shows the excited state electron injection and dye regeneration energy states in DSSCs.

In DSSCs, electron transfer occurs in the Marcus normal region. The electron injection rate increases when the ECB of the semiconductor moves to a positive potential, or the sensitizer excited state oxidation potential becomes more negative compared to the ECB of the semiconductor. However, the movement of ECB towards a positive potential decreases the Voc of DSSCs. Electron transfer becomes efficient in the Marcus optimal region where the energy difference between the ECB and the maxima of the sensitizer energy state distribution becomes equivalent to the sensitizer reorganization energy, λ, at which the energy barrier is lowest. It was found that in DSSCs, efficient electron transfer is possible from the excited states of the sensitizer to the ECB of the semiconductor when the injection driving force, ΔEinj, ≥ 0.2 eV.
In the dye regeneration process, the downward shift of EF,redox increases the Voc of DSSCs, but this decreases the overlapping of the donor (electrolytes) and acceptor (oxidized dyes) energy distribution states, which in turn decreases the electron transfers in DSSCs. The iodide redox system is considered one of the standard redox systems and a large number of Ru-based sensitizers are efficiently regenerated by the iodide, approaching a regeneration efficiency of unity with a good solar cell performance. However, due to the multistep electron transfer, a driving force above 0.6 eV is required for the regeneration of Ru-based sensitizers with the iodide redox system. This problem of high voltage loss with multistep electron transfer is bypassed by using an organic dye and a cobalt-based redox system, which could regenerate ≈95% dye with a regeneration driving force of ≈0.2 eV. However, efficient dye regeneration with a yield percentage of unity could be possible at a driving force ≤0.2 eV by using a ferrocene and copper-based redox system.
All the electrons injected into the conduction band of the semiconductor do not reach the back contact at the FTO. The injected electrons could recombine with oxidized dyes or electrolytes. As shown in eqn (11), the quasi-Fermi level of a semiconductor depends on the free electrons on the conduction bands of the semiconductor, and thus recombination certainly decreases the quasi-Fermi level and ultimately, the Voc of the DSSC. As a rule of thumb, EF,n is about 0.1 V more positive than ECB at 1 sun. At Voc, in high-efficiency DSSCs, ΔErec, which is the gap between the ECB and EF,n, is negligible compared to ΔEinj and ΔEreg, which are the largest single source for Vloss.

The Jsc of a DSSC is the integral of the product of incident photon-to-collected electron efficiency (IPCE) and ΦINPh at wavelengths λ1 to λ2:

(14)
where IPCE is limited by the four efficiency factors of DSSCs: light-harvesting efficiency (
ηLH), electron injection efficiency (ηINJ), dye regeneration efficiency (ηDR), and electron collection efficiency (ηCOL):

IPCE(λ) = ηLH(λ)ηINJ(λ)ηDR(λ)ηCOL(λ),
(15)

eqn (2) and (14) are fundamentally the same, where E = hc/λ and IPCE is the experimentally observed quantity.

Almost all of the dyes appear to show a strong absorption peak in the UV-vis region, and the incompatibility between the broad solar spectrum and dye band gap results in an immediate limit on the amount of energy that can be extracted from sunlight. Some other factors are crucial for making the light-harvesting efficiency below unity such as the optical transparency and reflection of the FTO substrate, an inefficient light scattering by TiO2, and the absorption of light by the electrolyte. Furthermore, the dye itself limits the light-harvesting efficiency when its absorption coefficient is very low, or its concentration is not enough to absorb the whole spectrum of light.
In the previous section, it has already been discussed that the electron injection and dye regeneration efficiency strongly depend on the relative overlap of occupied donor excited states with unoccupied acceptor excited states. Besides, any competing processes in DSSCs, such as radiative decay, non-radiative decay, intersystem crossing, excited-state quenching reactions, and intramolecular electron transfer processes, could decrease the injection and regeneration efficiency. When ECB moves to a positive potential and EF, redox moves to a negative potential, the energetic overlap of ECB and EF,redox with the excited states of the dye and its oxidized component, respectively, become more competent, and the injection and regeneration efficiency moves close to unity. However, this could decrease the open-circuit voltage. Furthermore, at a high short-circuit current, the slow diffusion of electrolytes could limit the regeneration efficiency of the oxidized dye.
The charge collection efficiency of DSSCs is controlled by the comparative rates of electron transportation, charge recombination (with the oxidized sensitizer or other reducible species at the interface), and surface state electron trapping. The electron transportation through the porous TiO2 film is mainly controlled by diffusion. For a competent solar cell under working conditions, electron transportation must dominate the recombination processes. To get a collection efficiency of unity, the charge recombination should be almost zero or negligible. However, in DSSCs this is not possible due to the close vicinity of electrolyte ions with the TiO2 particles, and the recombination of trap electrons in TiO2 with the oxidized electrolytes is the main recombination process. The charge recombination kinetics increases with increasing bias voltage, light intensity, and electrolyte concentration. The previous two factors increase the occupancy of the conduction band/trap states or increase the Fermi-level energy, which favors the recombination processes, and the latter factor favors the second-order kinetics of electron recombination.Fig. 5 illustrates the light-harvesting, electron injection, and electron collection processes in DSSCs.

According to eqn (1), another important parameter to estimate PCE is FF. The higher the FF, the squarer the J–V curve becomes. In the calculation of the SQ limit for ideal solar cells, only radiative recombination is considered and eqn (3) and (7) express the diode equation and FF of the ideal solar cell, respectively, where the ideality factor is considered one (n = 1). However, in the case of real devices, the parasitic loss is unavoidably associated with series resistance, Rs, and shunt resistance, Rsh.

The Rsh denotes the recombination of electrons from FTO to the redox system. The association of Rs and Rsh determines how current flows through the external load and the device. Higher Rs and smaller Rsh will increase the drop of Vmax and Jmax, respectively. Considering Rs and Rsh for the real device, the diode equation and FF for p–n junction solar cells can be expressed by eqn (16) and (17):
(16)
(17)
FFS is the fill factor of the solar cells that only have Rs and calculated from FFS = FF0 (1 − 1.1rs) + rs2/5.4, where rs and rSh are the normalized series and shunt resistance RsJsc/Voc and RshJsc/Voc, respectively. For calculating FF from eqn (17), Rs and Rsh need to be assumed as constant. However, this is not the real scenario in DSSCs. The series resistance in DSSCs originates from the sheet resistance of FTO, the transport resistance of electrons through TiO2, the mass transport resistance of the electrolyte, and the charge transfer resistance of the counter electrode/electrolyte interface. Due to the voltage and current dependence of the mass transport resistance and charge transfer resistance, Rs in DSSCs is not constant and changes over the working potential of the device. Therefore, eqn (17) does not properly fit for DSSCs. Hence, we may consider an FF of 80% for our hypothetical device, as the high-performance DSSCs show an FF in the range of 75–80%, regardless of the calculation from eqn (17).
Regarding the different loss factors, the voltage, current, fill factor, and efficiency for DSSCs are calculated and compared with the SQ limit, as shown in Fig. 6 with respect to Eg. Table 1 summarizes the parameters used to calculate theoretical and feasible efficiency limits in SQ solar cells and DSSCs, respectively. Jsc shows a non-linear reduction with some plateaus due to a non-linear spectral irradiance distribution on the earth's surface, while Voc shows a linear increasing trend with Eg, due to it being a direct function of Eg and the logarithmic ratio of Jsc and J0,rad. The difference between JSQsc and JDSSCsc is due to the IPCE loss in DSSCs, which is predominant at low Eg. Fig. 6(a) shows that there is a gap between VEoc and VSQoc which increases with increasing Eg, as a result of decreasing electron generation with increasing Eg, which in turns lowers the quasi-Fermi levels compared to ECB. Furthermore, the difference between VDSSCoc and VSQoc decreases with increasing Eg. This is because of the assumed constant ΔEinj and ΔEreg loss in DSSCs, which shows a predominant effect at low Eg, and this effect decreases with increasing Eg. At the maximum PCE point, DSSCs shows a JDSSCsc and VDSSCocof 32.03 mA cm−2 and 0.93 V, which are 35.59 mA cm−2 and 1.07 V for an ideal SQ solar cell, respectively. FFSQ increases non-linearly with the band gap. Initially, it increases very fast; however, after a certain limit of Eg, the increase is much slower. At low Eg, due to the high photo-generated current, elevated recombination is encountered. With increasing Eg, these effects are minimized, thus providing an increased FF. With all the losses in the Jsc, Voc, and FF, DSSCs deliver a maximum efficiency of 23.78% for an absorber with a band gap of 1.34 eV, which is 71% of the SQ limit (33.78%). The band gap differs slightly from the band gap value of 1.1 eV from the original work of SQ. The reason for the difference from the SQ work could be that, in this work, the solar irradiation (AM1.5G) was used instead of using eqn (6).

However, up to now, the maximum efficiency reported for DSSCs is far below, only 62% of the estimated maximum. Fig. 7(a–d) show the reported efficiency of DSSCs and the efficiency parameters in comparison with their calculated maximum (solid line) with the device band gap. The device band gap is defined as Eg = hc/λg, where λg is the fitted onset band gap wavelength (inflection point), obtained from the EQE according to eqn (18):

(18)
where
Am and λs are fitting parameters associated with the maximum EQE just after the step, and the slope during the step, respectively, and κ = ln[7 + 4 √3] ≅ 2.63 is a numeric factor.


Fig. 7(a) shows that the Jsc of most of the devices is very close to the attainable maximum. However, some devices (including certified ones) show values exceeding the feasible maximum, signifying that the occurrence of artifacts cannot be overlooked in the estimation of Jsc from the J–V curve and/or the Eg from the EQE. At a low band gap, Jsc is high, close to 20 mA cm−2, and decreases with increasing band gap, which is consistent with the calculated value. However, Fig. 7(b) shows that the Voc of the cells is significantly below the calculated value, which is predominant in the case of the iodide redox system. To circumvent the voltage loss, a cobalt redox system is used which offers comparatively higher Jsc, Voc, and PCE compared to the iodide redox system, and most of the high-efficiency devices are based on the cobalt redox system. To circumvent the further voltage losses, copper-based redox systems are used but in this case, dyes with a higher band gap are necessary for the effective driving force of electron injection, which ultimately decreases the Jsc and in turn, the efficiency of the devices. Furthermore, when cobalt and copper redox systems are used with high band gap dyes, although Voc increases, the difference from the estimated value remains constant, which does not provide a positive contribution to increasing the efficiency. Finally, Fig. 7(c) shows that the FF of most of the devices is above 70%, and in many devices it reaches close to 80%, indicating that in DSSCs, the resistive charge carrier loss and their recombination in the interfaces are not significant and are not the efficiency limiting factors. Hence, the injection and regeneration voltage loss is the crucial loss controlling the efficiency of the device. Table 3 summarizes the reported efficiency values and their corresponding parameters for DSSCs under one sun conditions.

Typically, indoor light sources provide a lower light intensity of 26–318 μW cm−2 (illuminance ∼ 100–1000 lux) as compared to that of sunlight (intensity ∼ 100 mW cm−2 and illuminance ∼ 100000 lux). Like AM1.5G (ASTM G173-03) for standard solar irradiation, there is no such standard for indoor light. Due to the different spectral ranges and shapes of the indoor light spectrum, a light source is an important factor for an indoor light energy harvesting system. Several types of light sources like, LED, fluorescent lamp (FL), incandescent (INC), and compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) bulbs are the most frequently used for indoor conditions. The spectral irradiance of the common indoor light source is shown in Fig. 8(a) and it can be seen that the LED light has a broader and uninterrupted spectral distribution compared to the fluorescent lamp, while incandescent bulbs display a progressively growing trend within the wavelength range of 300–850 nm. Furthermore, indoor light sources show different irradiance power intensities at the same luminance value. Fig. 8(b) shows the intensities of different light sources at an illuminance of 1000 lux. At 1000 lx, INC 2700 K shows the maximum intensity, while CFL 2700 K shows the minimum. This phenomenon can result in differing amounts of light energy being harvested by a solar panel working under diverse artificial light sources with a certain luminance value. Since the spectral distribution and the irradiance power of these light sources are completely different, estimating the maximum attainable efficiency under a specific indoor light helps to design dyes and redox mediators to harvest the indoor light efficiently.


The IR portion of the spectrum in AM 1.5 G only contributes to the incident power and cannot produce an electron–hole pair of sufficient energy, resulting in zero output power. The lack of the IR spectrum in indoor light sources reduces this kind of energy loss for IPVs. Furthermore, an indoor light source reduces the energy loss caused by the thermal relaxation of photons of higher energy than the band gap. Therefore, with the shrinking incident light spectrum and decreasing energy loss caused by the light intensity, the ratio between input current (Jin) and output current (Jsc) decreases, which maximizes the output power under indoor light conditions compared to outdoor light conditions, and hence the efficiency for indoor light is relatively higher compared to AM1.5 G.

According to eqn (2) and (14), the short circuit current shows a linear relationship with the incident photon flux. The linear relationship of Jsc with the incident photon flux is mainly due to the variation of the number of photons incident on the cell, which in turn changes the photogenerated electrons. The other aspects that govern the Jsc in DSSCs are the capacity of light trapping by the photoelectrode, which can be a function of light intensity, and the rate of recombination. A lower illumination intensity decreases the number of electrons in the photoanode and hence, the probability of recombination. Conversely, an equal but reverse trend is observed for the diffusion of electrons through TiO2 with decreasing illumination intensity; therefore, Jsc linearly decreases with decreasing light intensity, and vice versa. A deviation from linearity is noticed when the recombination and diffusion change at different magnitudes and orders, or the current is delimited by the mass transport limits of the electrolyte.

The quasi-Fermi level of electrons in the semiconductor is determined by the free electrons in the conduction bands of the semiconductor. With increasing the light intensity, photoelectrons are generated proportionally and fill the exponentially distributed DOS or trap states. However, charge recombination increases nonlinearly upon the electron occupancy in the trap states. A 107-fold acceleration of the recombination kinetics is observed with the change of the externally applied potential by only 600 mV. At the lower intensities of light, when the injected electrons are lower or equal to the nanoparticles of the semiconductor, the recombination kinetics does not depend on the excitation power. However, with increasing the excitation power, the conduction band/trap state occupancy with the electrons increases to a very high value per nanoparticle, and an acceleration in the rate of charge recombination is observed. At the steady-state, open-circuit voltage shows a logarithmic change with light intensity according to the following equation:

(19)

Eqn (19) implies that Voc will change by 59 mV for a 10-fold change in light intensity. Values close to 60 mV are normally found for DSSCs, but greater values have also been reported. Indoor light sources have 300 to 1000 times lower power intensity compared to one sun conditions. Therefore, indoor DSSCs would have a further voltage loss of 0.14–0.21 V due to light intensity in addition to the voltage loss under one sun. The voltage loss under room light conditions can be obtained by using the following equation:

(20)
where
Psun ≈ 100 mW cm−2 is the nominal incident power intensity of one sun illumination, θ ≈ 56.65% is its fraction in the visible wavelength (<780 nm), and Proom is the room light intensity.



Eqn (16) and (17) imply that the FF of solar cells depends on the Rs and RSh, which, in turn, depend on the light intensity. The dependency of FF on the incident light intensity of DSSCs has been reported in several studies. Under low light conditions, the generated current is very low, and the voltage drops due to Rs not being predominant; therefore, FF is highly affected by Rsh. The smaller the Rsh, the more sensitive the FF drop. Conversely, at higher light intensities, although, Rs remains constant over the light intensity, a more dominant effect is contributed by Rs due to the significant potential drop with a larger photocurrent and hence, the FF decreases.


Fig. 9 shows the theoretical maximum efficiency value of ideal solar cells (dashed line) and attainable maximum efficiency value of DSSCs (solid line) under different indoor light conditions, and the PCE parameters with respect to Eg. Similar to one sun conditions, SQ approximation was used to calculate the theoretical maximum values of single-junction solar cells. For dye-sensitized solar cells, another voltage loss is considered due to the ambient intensity of indoor light. Other researchers have also reported the theoretical maximum efficiency of ideal solar cells in indoor light. However, our estimation could vary to some extent as there is no standard indoor light spectrum. Fig. 9(a) shows that for ideal solar cells it is possible to attain a maximum Jsc of around 129.69 μA cm−2 for LED 3000 K, at the narrowest band gap of 1.46 eV of the visible wavelength. This gently decreases until Eg is close to 1.9 eV, and after that, an abrupt decrease is observed. Conversely, a comparatively large Jsc value of 352.35 μA cm−2 could be obtained for an incandescent lamp, which sharply and consistently decreases with increasing the band gap. For IDSSCs, the Jsc values are always 90% of that of ideal solar cells as IPCE for DSSCs is considered as 90%, and there is no other loss of incident photons. Voc and FF show the same and similar trends under one sun conditions except for the voltage loss due to ambient light intensity and its corresponding effect on the FF. Fig. 9(d) shows that the highest PCE of 58.29% at a band gap of 1.97 eV could be obtained under FL T8 4000k light. Due to the similar irradiance spectral pattern, a very similar PCE is possible under CFL 2700 K and CFL 6400 K light sources close to an Eg of 1.96 eV. Although, LED 6500 K does not show any shift of the maximum efficiency point, the LED 3000 K shows a redshift of the maximum efficiency point. This could be due to the change of the color temperature light spectrum peak of the LED light. LED 3000 K and LED 6500 K show a PCE of 55.85% and 54.62% at a band gap of 1.83 eV and 1.96 eV, respectively. Conversely, the maximum attainable efficiency under incandescent light is 50.75% at an Eg of 1.46 eV, indicating the lowest attainable maximum efficiency under indoor light sources as incandescent light shows a maximum light intensity at this band gap, as shown in Fig. 8(a). Note that we have only considered the visible spectrum of incandescent light. However, when the full spectrum of incandescent light is considered, the maximum attainable efficiency under incandescent light will be very low, as incandescent light shows BB-like radiation containing the NIR spectrum. DSSCs under indoor light conditions can reach over 71% efficiency of ideal solar cells. Over 28% efficiency of ideal solar cells lost in IDSSCs is due to the current and voltage loss in IDSSCs. The highest efficiency of 41.78% is possible in FL T8 4000k at an Eg of 1.96 eV, and the lowest peak efficiency of 35.39% is possible to achieve under the incandescent light source at an Eg of 1.46 eV. Under LED and CFL light, it is possible to gain a maximum PCE of over 39% and 40% for IDSSCs. Table 2 summarizes the maximum attainable efficiency value and their corresponding parameters for ideal SQ solar cells and DSSCs under common indoor light sources.

Fig. 10 shows the power consumption of portable devices and IoT protocols (during sleep and sensing modes) with the incident power intensity of different light sources in various light consumption zones, and the output power intensity of ideal SQ solar cells, in addition to IDSSCs under different light sources. It can be seen that the incident power intensity of indoor light sources is just above and below 300 μW cm−2, and in the maximum PCE state, IDSSCs could provide a power intensity of >100 μW cm−2, indicating that it is possible to run many IoT protocols with centimeter-scale IDSSCs. However, when the size of IDSSCs increases to the meter scale, almost all of the IoTs, and even some portable devices, can be operated under indoor light conditions, signifying the great importance of IDSSCs to run future IoT protocols.



Fig. 11 shows the reported PCE and corresponding parameters of IDSSCs with respect to Eg and illuminance. With increasing the illuminance, Jsc under indoor light conditions increases linearly, as the intensity is a function of illuminance. At a low illuminance ≤ 1000 lux, most of the absorbers show Jsc values smaller than 120 μA cm−2 except for some higher values, especially for the co-sensitized absorber. This is very consistent with our calculated values as shown in Fig. 9(a). The higher value of Jsc for some IDSSCs could be due to different light sources compared to what we considered in the calculation, or the light sources not being standardized. However, with increasing illuminance intensity, Jsc increases and for an illuminance intensity ≤ 3000 lux, Jsc reaches up to 300 μA cm−2, while for an illuminance intensity of 6000 lux, the Jsc value reaches up to 1000 μA cm−2.

In contrast, Fig. 11(b) shows that the Voc of IDSSCs does not increase significantly with respect to illuminance intensity and Eg, rather, Voc shows a considerable variation with the redox system. However, unlike under one sun conditions, with increasing the incident light intensity, the efficiency of DSSCs increases under indoor light conditions. This could be due to the lower number of generated electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 compared to the effective density of the electronic states, and hence recombination does not increase with illuminance intensity. The iodide based redox system shows Voc in the range of 0.5 to 0.65 V or a little higher, while the cobalt-based redox system shows a little improved Voc in the range of 0.6 to 0.7 V. Comparatively, the copper-based redox system shows higher Voc, close to 0.8 V or higher, and the maximum reported Voc with the copper-based redox system was 0.98 V. Overall, the reported IDSSC shows very low Voc compared to that of our estimated Voc, and the reported Voc is only 50–60% of the estimated Voc. Fig. 11(c) shows that the FF of almost all of the IDSSCs is higher than 60%, and most of the IDSSCs show FF very close to 80%. Fig. 11(d) shows the PCE of the IDSSC, and a great variance of PCE is observed with Eg and illuminance intensity. Near an Eg of 1.8 eV, a PCE close to 20% was attained, while it reached 34.5% near an Eg of 1.9 eV. However, further increasing Eg does not increase the efficiency. This efficiency limitation arises from the mismatch of the energy levels of the sensitizer and the redox system with a higher voltage loss. This could be overcome with a suitable redox system and sensitizer, where the regeneration overpotential will be a minimum.
With the iodide redox system, Ru-based dyes N719 give a maximum efficiency of 23.43% at 6000 lux, while the co-sensitization of MM-6 and MM-3 dyes shows the highest efficiency of 28.74% and 30.45% with an iodide based redox system at 1000 lux and 6000 lux, respectively. DSSCs with the cobalt-based redox system under indoor light conditions have seldom been studied; however, a cobalt-based IDSSC shows a maximum efficiency of 20.11% with MK-2 dye at 200 lux, while several dyes with copper-based redox systems show a great advancement in efficiency for IDSSCs. An efficiency of 24.9% and 28.40% was achieved with XY1 and L359 dyes, respectively. However, Grätzel et al. found an efficiency of 31.8% with co-sensitization of XY1b and Y123 dyes using a solid-state copper redox system. Recently, the same group used another dye, MS5, for the co-sensitization of XY1 and found an efficiency of 34.5% with the copper redox system, which is the highest reported efficiency for IDSSCs. Table 4 summarizes the reported efficiency values and their corresponding parameters for IDSSCs under common indoor light sources.

In conclusion, the large demand for renewable energy sources for future low-power utilization of the emerging Internet of Things (IoTs) will significantly stimulate the development of IPV technology. Among the emerging PVs, DSSCs show greater opportunities as a sustainable energy source for the emerging Internet of Things (IoTs), because of their simple fabrication process, low cost, and non-toxic fabrication materials. Furthermore, all of the dyes have a higher extinction coefficient at the visible wavelength, which signifies their applicability in IPVs, with a broader band gap, which assists to get an operating voltage higher than one.

In this perspective, we have thoroughly reviewed the energy loss in DSSCs and estimated the PCE for DSSCs under outdoor and indoor conditions based on our assumption, and compared it with the SQ limit of an ideal solar cell. Under one sun conditions, DSSCs could convert 23.78% of solar energy at a band gap of 1.34 eV providing a JDSSCsc and VDSSCocof 32.03 mA cm−2 and 0.93 V, respectively, with an assumed FF of 80%. However, under indoor light conditions, the feasible PCE for DSSCs is 35–41% compared to that of 50–58% for the ideal SQ solar cell at an absorber band gap between 1.82 and 1.96 eV. Due to the current, voltage, and FF loss, DSSCs could offer just above 71% efficiency of an ideal SQ solar cell. Under indoor conditions, it should be possible to obtain respectable Jsc and Voc of DSSCs in the range of 98–116 μA cm−2, and 0.93–1.41 V, whereas for ideal SQ solar cells at various illuminances, they are 109–129 μA cm−2 and 1.08–1.55 V, respectively. IDSSCs could provide a maximum power output >100 μW cm−2, signifying the suitability of IDSSCs for activating IoT devices in smart houses. Furthermore, we have reviewed the reported efficiency of DSSCs under outdoor and indoor conditions and compared it with the attainable PCE of DSSCs. This implies that the current real devices only achieved a PCE of 62% of the feasible efficiency under outdoor conditions; however, that is above 80% under indoor light conditions. The energy loss in DSSCs mainly originated from the voltage loss of injection and regeneration. Iodide and cobalt-based devices showed an efficiency above 20%, while copper-based devices showed a PCE of 34.0%.
To diminish the voltage loss in DSSCs, the structure of the dye and electrolyte should be tuned with small injection and regeneration overpotential for fast injection and regeneration to hinder the recombination when working with a low driving force. Moreover, the molar extinction coefficients of the dye should be very high in the range of absorption wavelengths to increase the incident photon-to-conversion efficiency. For outdoor applications, dyes should be designed with a narrow band gap for maximizing the absorption of the solar spectrum. Conversely, for indoor applications, the dye must have a broader band gap especially with a lower HOMO level, which can open more space for developing new electrolytes to increase the VOC and can be well-matched with the irradiance spectra of commonly used artificial light sources. For the environmentally friendly application of DSSCs under indoor conditions, the device must be leakage, toxic, inorganic, organic, and heavy metal-free. In consideration of that, the development of solid-state or quasi-solid state DSSCs with organic dyes could be the best option for indoor applications. Finally, as research in IPVs is emerging, to avoid overestimation and underestimation, researchers should pay attention to calibration with a standard lux meter.
