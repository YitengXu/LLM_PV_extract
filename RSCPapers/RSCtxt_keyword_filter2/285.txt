The photovoltaic parameters controlling the cell performance were investigated and the results were discussed as a function of anchoring groups. The obtained power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) vary from 0.18 to 1.87%, while the quantum yields are heavily dependent on both the anchoring group and type of pigments. Moreover, the effects of anchoring groups on the photoinduced electron injection dynamics from natural dye molecules to TiO2 nanoparticles were studied using time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy measurements. In these dyes, the long-hydroxyl & carbonyl-chain bearing anthocyanin, with the maximum electron transfer rate (kET), has shown the best photosensitization effect with regard to cell output. Despite the fact that their performance in DSSCs is somewhat lower or close to the metal complexes, these metal-free natural dyes can be treated as a new generation of sensitizers.
1. Introduction
The development of a dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has been recognized as a promising research field for next generation alternative energy sources due to their comparatively high efficiency with low production costs.1–3 Typically, a DSSC consists of a sandwich type structure with a light absorbing photoanode, an electrolyte containing redox couple, and a catalyzer counter electrode.2 In this architecture, the nature and absorption spectrum of the dyes as well as the adhesion of these dyes to the surface of the nano-crystalline metal oxide semiconductor are crucial parameters for harvesting solar energy. Therefore, the selection of a suitable sensitizer plays a vital part in the fabrication of highly efficient DSSCs.4 Until now, though ruthenium (Ru) complexes are seen as the best sensitizers for DSSCs owing to their extraordinary charge-transfer absorption over the entire visible range and highly efficient metal-to-ligand charge transfer,5 these dyes present several challenges, such as high cost, high toxicity, and sophisticated preparation routes. To eliminate these unfavorable aspects, the photosensitizer studies have been focused on the cost effective, highly stable, and yielding alternative dyes. In this viewpoint, a large number of works have been performed on natural dyes derived from natural sources due to their simple structure, easy preparation, lower material costs, large absorption coefficients, multicolor options, and environmental-friendly green chemistry.6–12
Although many natural dyes have been proven to be promising photosensitizer in DSSCs, there are still no satisfying solutions for two major issues of these dyes due to the presence of pigments in dye structure: (i) degradation during the extraction and (ii) long-term stability.13,14 It is commonly known that the extraction of crude and fresh extracts of natural products in a hot water with controllable heat yields a good efficiency compared to commercial and/or purified sensitizers by different extraction methods/media such as ultrasonic/microwave methods in alcoholic/acidic solutions which can easily damage the pigments in the structure.15,16 Not merely the extraction method, but storage conditions are also key parameters to high stability and corrosion resistance. In contrast to synthetic sensitizers, most of the natural dyes easily degrade and are low in stability owing to their natural pigments.17 Therefore, prevention of oxidation, corrosion, mold, and fungus, which occur during extraction and storage, is crucial. Nowadays, it is strongly recommended that spray dried dyes should be used to protect the dye when stored.18
As clearly described in ref. 6–12 works, another critical aspect of the solar cells to achieve higher PCE values is the dye material and its molecular structure. Research in the field of natural dyes for DSSCs aims to discover superior natural dyes to optimally fulfill all requirements such as: (i) to provide strong stability and corrosion protection; (ii) to absorb light across a wide range of the solar spectrum; (iii) to inject photoexcited electrons into the conduction band, and (iv) to inhibit charge recombination at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. To satisfy these four requirements, immobilization of the adsorbing dye molecules onto the semiconductor surface is a basic and fulfilling condition. The presence of anchoring (functional) groups in dye molecules helps the binding of the molecules to the semiconductor surface, thus contributing to the photovoltaic conversion efficiency. This is also crucial for setting-up of an electron transfer through the injection of electrons from the dye into the conduction band of the semiconductor.19 As a primary charge separation step in DSSCs, the electron injection rate is heavily dependent on the anchoring groups that help in the fast transfer of the excited electron from dye molecules to the conduction band of TiO2, and thereby on device efficiency. Surprisingly, few studies have directly examined the importance of electron injection as a function of anchoring groups in determining the photovoltaic efficiency of natural DSSCs. Here, our main goal is to design and test DSSCs sensitized by natural dyes having several pigments with various anchoring groups such as carbonyl, hydroxyl, and alkyl chains and to clearly understand the photoinduced electron injection kinetics of these natural DSSCs. In this regard, we report the performance of spray dried natural dyes extracted from the leaves, flowers, seeds, and shell of various plants. The effectiveness of these devices related to dye structures is also discussed in detail to broaden the scope of available sensitizers. This detailed study would be useful in selecting dyes and will lead to the scientific extraction and/or storage of dyes for DSSCs.
2. Experimental section
(a) Preparation of natural dye-sensitizers
Quercetin (D1), alizarin (D2), cyanine (D3), luteolin (D4), chlorophyll (D5), emodin (D6), beta carotene (D7), anthocyanin (D8), and juglon (D9) dyes were extracted from the leaves of Euphorbia sp., Rubia tinctoria, Morus alba, Reseda lutea, Medicago sativa, the seeds of Rhamnus petiolaris, the flowers of Beta vulgaris L. ssp. f. rubra, Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata f. rubra, and the shell of Juglon regia plants, respectively. These dyes were extracted using the hot water method as follows: the flowers, leaves, seeds, and shells of the fresh plants were first washed with water and then dried by string in an environment with air flow. The dried plants were put through a grinding mill; 1 g of the ground material was combined with 10 mL of distilled water. Finally, the plants were immersed for 1 h in hot water at 85 °C as an extracting solvent. These solids were filtered out to retain clear dye solutions. These filtered materials have been spray dried at 160 °C to enhance stability and corrosion resistance. Fig. S1† confirms the advantage of spray drying as compared to solution form. As evident in Fig. S1,† dry storage facilities have to be dehumidified for the protection of stored dyes from mold, mildew, fungus, and corrosion even when stored at 4 °C. Spray dried dyes were dissolved in deionized water at certain concentrations before being used as sensitizers. Fig. 1 shows the images of fresh plants, spray dried forms, dye adsorbed photoanodes, chemical structures,20–24 and corresponding functional groups of these natural dyes. Among these dyes, D1, D3, D4, and D6 have flavonoid pigment while D2, D5, D7, D8, and D9 have anthraquinone, chlorophyll, betalain, anthocyanin, and juglon ones, respectively.

(b) Preparation of electrodes and electrolyte solution
The TiO2 layers were prepared by doctor blade technique and thickness of the layers have been optimized as ∼10 μm. To fabricate the photoanodes, these TiO2 films were immersed in 10 mM of natural dye solutions for 18 h and then these photoanodes were rinsed in de-ionized water to remove the unadsorbed dye molecules. Pt based counter electrodes (photocathodes), and triiodide/iodide (I3−/I−) electrolyte were setup according to our previous reports.25,26
(c) The assembly of DSSCs
DSSCs were assembled based on our previous works.2,7 To describe the process briefly, the photoanode was placed face up on a horizontal surface, and a counter electrode was placed on top of the photoanode. These two opposing glass plates were offset from one another such that the counter electrode covered the entire photoanode. The electrolyte solution was placed at the edges of the plates, and the liquid was drawn into the space between the electrodes via capillary action. An epoxy adhesive was used to secure the electrodes together. The FTO/TiO2/dye/electrolyte/Pt/FTO structured DSSCs were fabricated in this manner (Fig. 2).

(d) Measurements
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) transmittance spectra of the bare and natural dye adsorbed TiO2 nanoparticles were conducted in the range of 4000–400 cm−1 using a Jasco FTIR-430 spectrometer. Ultraviolet (UV)-visible absorption measurements of dye solutions and dye adsorbed TiO2 electrodes were performed using a dual wavelength/double-beam Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) measurements of the cells were recorded with Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system using a standard solar irradiation of 300 W m−2 (Xe lamp with AM 1.5 filter) as the light source. Wavelength-dependent incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) performance was measured using an Enlitech QE-R system with a 75 W xenon arc lamp source. Dye loading measurements were conducted by desorbing the dye molecules from the dye-anchored TiO2 films in NaOH solution (1.0 M, in deionized water/ethanol, 50:50, v/v). The loading amount was calculated from the absorbance of the completely desorbed dye solutions by the spectrophotometer. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies were conducted with a BASI cell stand C3 model cyclic voltammetry in a three-electrode configuration. In CV set up, a Pt disc (1.6 mm diameter), a Pt wire, and an Ag/AgCl in 3 M NaCl (aq) solution were employed as working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. Time resolved fluorescence lifetime measurements were recorded using a Picoharp 300 (Picoquant, GmbH) photon counting instrument. The excitation source in the experiment is a nanosecond pulsed diode laser head with a wavelength of 405 nm (LDH-C-D-405 Picoquant, GmbH). In order to obtain a Gaussian beam illumination, a single mode optical fiber was selected as a waveguide (Thorlabs, S405-HP). The optical system in our experiment is based on a confocal light detection scheme via a 75 μm pinhole in the setup, which allows observing the reflected light coming from the very center of the small focused area only. In other words, the chance of getting illuminations other than from the focal center was eliminated by this pinhole.
3. Results and discussion
(a) FTIR analysis
The FTIR transmittance spectra of natural dyes and natural dye adsorbed TiO2 (with bare TiO2) in the frequency range 4000–400 cm−1 are seen in Fig. 3 and S2,† respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, each spectrum demonstrates the characteristic absorption bands of natural dye corresponding to its chemical structure. As evident in Fig. 3, the bands in the 3500–3200 cm−1 range are phenolic characteristic O–H (hydroxyl) stretch bonds while 3000–2850 cm−1 and 1320–1000 cm−1 ranges are characteristic C–H (alkyl) stretch and –CO (carbonyl) stretch bonds, respectively. Specifically, the strongest C–H bond at ∼2921 cm−1, medium –CO stretch at ∼1662 cm−1, and broadest phenolic O–H stretch at ∼3431 cm−1 have been seen for D8 dye. The peak at ∼2921 cm−1 were lower for D1, D3, and D4 due to the absence of C–H bonds (alkene functional group) (Fig. 1). The difference in shape and intensity of these peaks can be related to the respective functional groups and the chain length present in them. On the other hand, the spectra depicted in Fig. S2† demonstrate the characteristic vibration mode of Ti–O–Ti bond about 490 cm−1 and 650 cm−1 which typically arise in between the range of 450–1000 cm−1.27
 Fig. 3  Fourier transform infrared transmittance spectra of natural dyes. 
After the adsorption of dyes on TiO2 molecules, a new absorption band extending from 1320 to 1000 cm−1 ascribed to the C–O stretch vibration mode appeared for D1@T, D2@T, D3@T, D4@T, D6@T, D8@T, and D9@T samples and also another C–H bending band mode lying between 1450 and 1470 cm−1 emerged for D5@T, D6@T, D7@T, and D8@T samples,28,29 on the contrary, some peaks appearing in natural dyes spectra in Fig. 3 disappeared and/or decreased their intensity and/or shifted to higher/lower wavenumbers. These alterations strongly suggest that natural dyes adsorb on TiO2 via carbonyl, hydroxyl, and etc. functional groups.30,31
As clearly seen from Fig. 1, the anthocyanin can more efficiently form bonds with oxygen atoms on TiO2 surface through the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups. Because, the anthocyanin can adsorb on TiO2 surface through a fast reaction by combining of displacing an OH− counter ion from the Ti site with a proton provided by the anthocyanin moiety, resulting in a very strong complex of anthocyanin and TiO2, which contributes to the photocurrent achieved for the D8@T based cell.32,33
(b) UV-vis absorption spectra
Fig. 4 and its inset display the UV-vis absorption spectra of fresh dye solutions and dye adsorbed TiO2 photoanodes, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, D2, D3, and D8 dyes have extra shoulders at visible region while other dyes have absorption peaks in the UV region. Specifically, sharp absorption peaks of dyes are at 269 and 360 nm for D1, 202, 258, and 374 nm for D6, and 269 and 322 nm for D5, respectively. Each of them agrees with the characteristic absorption band of dyes.16,19,34,35 Other than the wide absorption at UV region, D2, D3, and D8 dyes have wide shoulders between 423–463 nm, 480–560 nm, and 430–510 nm ranges, respectively. This helps the cell to capture photons at two different energy regions, meaning that it has acceptable photochemical parameters. These results also agree well with the literature.10,34,35 Furthermore, it is clear that some of these natural dyes absorb light in the UV and visible regions and therefore fulfill the major criterion for their use as viable sensitizers in DSSCs. The differences and variations in the absorption characteristics of dyes are due to the respective pigments in them.

As clearly shown in the inset of Fig. 4, the absorption band of the adsorbed dye is broader compared to the absorption band of the fresh dye solution and the absorption tail lengthened up to longer wavelengths (red-shift). This wide absorption band and extended tail can be due to the strong binding of the dye molecules to the oxide surface of the photoanode.36,37 This result implies that strong binding of the sensitizer can increase the adsorbed amount of sensitizer and therefore the amount of dye loading on TiO2 which in turn can improve the photocurrent. As is evident, dyes having –CO, –OH, –COOH, and such anchoring groups may be strongly bonded to the TiO2 surface and provide an appreciable sensitization.38,39 For D8, which possesses the longest –OH and –CO chains,5 an absorption peak of photoanode is broader compared to that of the dye solution, with a shift to higher wavelengths. Also, an extra peak is shown at 430 nm. Similar behavior has also been described by Sirimanne and Soga.40 The shift towards lower energy can be due to complexation between functional anchoring groups of sensitizers and Ti4+ metal ions.37
(c) Cyclic voltammetry measurements
To evaluate the feasibility of electron transfer from the excited dye molecules to the conduction band of TiO2 electrode, redox potentials of these dyes were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) with a 20 mV s−1 scan rate and the initial scan direction is upwards (i.e. from the start potential to the upper vertex potential). Representative cyclic voltammograms are displayed in Fig. S3† and the corresponding energy level alignments are shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  The energy level diagrams of the natural sensitizers. Schematic diagram shows the calculated positions of HOMO and LUMO levels of extracted dyes, with respect to the vacuum level. 
The HOMO measurements of the present dyes varied from −4.76 to −5.01 eV. These oxidation potentials are more positive than redox potential of I−/I3− (−4.60 eV),41,42 suggesting favorable regeneration of dyes. This indicates that the resultant dye+ can be deoxidized by I− in the electrolyte. Evidently, the electrons from the LUMO level could be injected into the conduction band of the TiO2 effectively if the level of the LUMO of the dye was adequately more positive with respect to vacuum level compared to the level of the conduction band. By using first excitation transition energy (Eg) values, estimated from the absorption threshold of these dyes, the excited state potentials for sensitizing dyes (from D1 to D9) were calculated as −2.77, −3.16, −3.19, −3.22, −2.84, −2.61, −3.07, −3.39, and −3.17 eV, respectively. These values indicate adequate driving force for electron injection from the photoexcited sensitizers to the conduction band of the TiO2 electrode (no energetic barriers for the electron injection).43
As is commonly known, the dye LUMO being higher than the conduction band minimum (CBM) ​ of TiO2 is advantageous for efficient electron injection.44 However, this level variation is limited, because the electrons excited to the dye LUMO can dissipate through nonradiative processes into the lower-lying CBM of semiconductor, dramatically lowering the open circuit potential (Voc) as well as causing unfavorable energy loss. The ideal case would be that the LUMO is close to and slightly higher than the CBM to ensure both large Voc and high injection rates. The LUMO level of D8 (−3.39 eV) is more negative than others, demonstrating that D8 dye has a more efficient electron transfer (injection) rate (kET).
Furthermore, to evaluate the electrochemical stability, the most efficient dye, D8, is subjected to a multi-cycle successive CV scanning at 20 mV s−1 at the same potential range. The corresponding CV profile is shown in Fig. S4.† The curve's shape and redox peak current density are not changed significantly after 50 times cycles suggesting that the D8 has stable cathodic/anodic peak currents and is not deteriorated in redox system. This facilitates a successful and a steady electron injection from the dye into the TiO2. Although the CV test is not a direct measurement of the long-term stability of a complete DSSC; it is a useful tool in obtaining more insight into the reaction behaviour of a dye under the working conditions.
(d) Photoinduced electron transfer rate measurements
For good photovoltaic efficiency of a DSSC, an electron from the electronically excited state of the dye must be injected effortlessly into the conduction band of the semiconductor. Electron transfer kinetics of natural dye molecules can be appraised in terms of the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) theory.45,46 The theory implies that the logarithm of the electron transfer rate is a quadratic function with respect to the driving force, −ΔG0. The simplified form of the rate constant of ET, kET, is given by 
(1)where ΔG0 is the driving force, λ is the reorganization energy, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature. In the region of driving force smaller than the reorganization energy (the normal region), ET rate increases as driving force increases. Electron transfer rate attains a maximum value at −ΔG0 = λ. When the driving force for reaction is greater than λ, inverted region kinetics are observed and ET rate decreases as the driving force increases.
The driving force for electron transfer between a photosensitizer and semiconductor nanoparticles can be dictated by the energy difference between the oxidation potential of photosensitizer and reduction potential of semiconductor nanoparticles. The Rehm–Weller equation can be utilized to determine the driving force energy changes for photoinduced electron transfer process.47 This equation gives the driving force energy changes between a donor (D) and an acceptor (A) as: 
ΔG0 = e[EOxi.(D) − ERed.(A)] − ΔE*
(2)where e is the unit electrical charge, EOxi.(D) and ERed.(A) are the oxidation and reduction potentials of electron donor and acceptor, respectively. ΔE* is the electronic excitation energy corresponding to the energy gap between ground and the first excited states of donor species. In this study, natural dye molecules are used as photosensitizer and the calculated driving force energy changes between natural dye (donor) and TiO2 semiconductor (acceptor) are summarized in Table S1.† As shown in Table S1,† the needed driving force for electron transfer between a photosensitizer and semiconductor nanoparticles is the lowest for D8 (−0.61 eV) while higher energy difference is needed for D6 (−1.39 eV) dye.
The reorganization energy (λ) can be represented as the sum of two contributions: inner (λi) and solvent (λs) reorganization energy. λi is associated with the change of the intramolecular coordinates of solute due to molecular vibration and value of inner reorganization energy can be taken as 0.3 eV for rigid molecules.41,42 According the Marcus two sphere model, solvent reorganization energy depends on the radius of the donor and acceptor molecules, center-to-center separation distance between molecules, optical and static dielectric constant of the solvent.48 The value of solvent reorganization energy is usually larger than inner reorganization energy and its value is typically of the order of 0.6–0.7 eV.49 In our work, total reorganization energy of each natural dye molecules is not calculated but it can be predicted as 0.9 eV.
In the photoinduced electron transfer process, the rate constant, kET, can be calculated by comparing the fluorescence lifetimes in the presence and absence of semiconductor nanoparticles. 
(3)where λdye and λdye+TiO2 are the fluorescence lifetimes of the natural dye molecules in the absence and presence of the TiO2 nanoparticles, respectively. In this work, the time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) method was adopted for fluorescence lifetime measurements. In this method, the time between the excitation laser pulse (start signal) and the detected single photon of the fluorescence (stop signal) is measured. The measured data is plotted as a fluorescence lifetime histogram. Decay parameters are determined using the double exponential tailfit model, and the best fits are obtained by minimizing χ2 values. For multi-exponential fluorescence decay fitting, FluoFit computer program (Picoquant, GmbH) is used. The fluorescence intensity decay is recovered from the frequency-domain data in terms of a multiexponential model, 
(4)where, Ai is the amplitude of each component and τi is its lifetime. The fractional contribution of each component to the steady-state intensity is described by

The intensity weighted average lifetime is represented as

To compare the fluorescence dynamics of natural dye molecules attached to TiO2 and free dye molecules, the same dye solutions are also deposited on glasses as a film. The decay parameters collected for natural dye molecules on glass substrate are summarized in Table S2.† The decay parameters along with the fluorescence lifetimes of the D1 and D6 natural dyes were not be modeled owing to their loosely bound dye molecules, leading to slower electron injection dynamics.
The effects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles on the fluorescence decay dynamics of the natural dye molecules were examined. According to the obtained fluorescence decay curves, which are given in Fig. 6, the decay rates of the natural dye molecules interacting with their surroundings are substantially different to those of free dye molecules. Electron transfer process causes a significant reduction in the fluorescence lifetime of dye molecules. The rate of the electron transfer is calculated at using fluorescence lifetime of dye molecules. Decay parameters and calculated electron transfer rates of natural dye molecules on TiO2 were listed in Table 1. It was observed that employing a long-hydroxyl & carbonyl-chains and strong alkyl-chain such as D8, give rises to more efficient photoinduced electron transfer process.

As seen in Table S2† and Fig. 6, the fluorescence lifetime values of the natural dye molecules vary from 0.27 to 3.16 ns. It is also evident that the excited-state lifetime of D8 is longer than those of others. When the all dyes were adsorbed on TiO2 films, the fluorescence of the dyes decayed fast, especially for D8@T (from 3.16 to 1.06 ns). Moreover, the highest electron transfer rate (kET) of 0.63 × 109 s−1 was recorded for D8@T whereas the lowest values of 0.07 × 109 s−1 and 0.08 × 109 s−1 were recorded for D7@T and D5@T, respectively. These results indicate that the charge transfer from D8 to the conduction band of TiO2 may be more efficient than that in the case of other dyes. This can be ascribed to the molecular nature of the D8 and explained by the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, which quickly transfer the excited electrons from dye molecules to the conduction band of TiO2. As already known, the hydroxyl and carbonyl group can supply higher electron injection rates for its good electronic coupling between dye and TiO2 by creating a robust monodentate or bidentate linkage with Bronsted acid sites (surface bound hydroxyl groups, Ti–OH) on the TiO2 surface.50–52 On the other hand, the lowest values of kET for D5 and D7 can be attributed to several factors such as the difference in the conduction band edge potential, loosely bound dye molecules, and the aggregated form that undergo weaker electronic coupling with the Ti(3d) states of the TiO2 conduction band and therefore inject from their metal-to-ligand charge-transfer state.53
(e) Dye loading measurements
One of the reason for poor long-term stability of DSSCs is weakly bound dye molecules on TiO2 surface. Besides electrochemical stability, therefore, we have examined the dye loading capacities of dyes on the TiO2 films. The results shown in Table 2 indicate that the amount of dye adsorbed (Dads) is remarkably different, even though the same concentration (10 mM) was maintained for all dyes. This can be attributed to the difference in the adsorption rate of the dyes on the TiO2 films and the nature of anchoring groups. The lowest amount of adsorption of D6 (1.16 × 10−7 mol cm−2) is due to the weak bond between the dye molecule and the surface of TiO2 film. Whereas the dye molecules present in D8 extract easily interacts with the TiO2 surface, so largest amount of dye molecules (5.06 × 10−7 mol cm−2) are adsorbed on the surface. For this reason, D8 extract sensitized electrode shows a broader absorption than the other extract sensitized electrodes as seen in Fig. 4. The stable cathodic/anodic peak currents implying a steady electron injection in Fig. S4† also support the highest amount of dye loading on D8 dye.

(f) J–V measurements
The performance of natural dyes as sensitizers in DSSCs was examined using short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE, η). Photocurrent–photovoltage data for DSSCs is shown in Fig. 7 and listed in Table 2. The highest Jsc of 1.88 mA cm−2 was seen for DSSC sensitized by long-hydroxyl-chain bearing D8, while the highest FF value of 0.63 was demonstrated in the presence of D2. The highest value of Jsc for D8 dye which comprise anthocyanin pigment can be attributed to well adsorption of the dye to TiO2 and relatively faster electron injection from dye into the conduction band of TiO2.54 However, DSSCs sensitized by long-alkyl-chain bearing D5 and D7 have maximum Voc of 0.55 V, comparable to that of Ru based dyes (around 0.6–0.7 V). The higher Voc values of the D5 and D7 based DSSCs are largely due to the effect of the alkyl chains. This prevents the leakage of electrons from TiO2 to the electrolyte due to the strong steric hindrance. As well known, large steric hindrance play a role in blocking recombination as preventing the access of electrons to the redox electrolyte, favoring a higher Voc.55,56

The obtained results are in a good agreement with lower electron transfer rates and other decay parameters given in Fig. 6. Comparable results have been reported in the literature. For instance, while the increase in the Jsc of the DSSC sensitized by long-hydroxyl-chain bearing dye molecule has been reported by Subramanian and Wang,57 the increase in the Voc of the DSSC sensitized by long-alkyl-chain bearing dye molecule has been reported by Koumura et al.58
As commonly known, the electron trapping is responsible for lower Jsc whereas charge recombination leads to Voc lowering.57,58 The long-alkyl-chain is known to repel iodide from the TiO2 surface and therefore reduce the recombination rate. Since recombination limits both the maximum current and the maximum voltage, higher values of Jsc and Voc tend to correspond with each other. As an exception, the cell sensitized by D8 with long-hydroxyl & carbonyl-chains and strong alkyl-chain (as shown in Fig. S2†) does not only have the highest Jsc, but also one of the higher Voc's owing to its appropriate LUMO level shown in Fig. 5. Besides, D1 DSSC, with the deepest HOMO level, seems to be best suited for the reverse electron transfer process and therefore should give the lowest Voc and lead to the possible inefficient electron/dye cation recombination pathways.59 Furthermore, the lowest Jsc value was observed for D6 DSSC as 0.20 mA cm−2 lower photocurrent efficiency can be associated with the inefficient electron injection. Therefore, the decay parameters cannot be calculated for D1 and D6 dyes and therefore are not shown in Tables S2† and 1.
The J–V curves are also very similar to absorbance spectra of dyes. Higher absorption supplies higher PCE. Particularly, D2, D4, and D8 sensitized DSSCs showed acceptable photovoltaic performance, which can be associated with the higher electron transfer rate (kET) (see Table 1 and Fig. 6) from the dye molecules to the conduction band of TiO2 due to the outstanding binding ability of –OH and –CO groups to the surface of a porous TiO2 film.10,60,61 These relatively higher PCE and kET values of D2, D4, and D8 sensitized DSSCs can be also ascribed to the presence of catechol groups in their molecular structures. As well known, a catechol group exhibits a direct electron-injection pathway from the ground state of the dye to the conduction band of TiO2 via photoinduced charge-transfer excitation of the dye-to-TiO2 charge transfer (DTCT) bands.62 This type DSSCs have efficient light-harvesting capabilities over the wide spectral range of sunlight due to the direct electron injection which can lead to the creation of a new DTCT band and ease of restrictions on the LUMO levels of the catechol dyes relative to the indirect electron-injection pathway. Furthermore, anchoring by catechol moieties may also extend the light adsorption of TiO2 to the visible region as clearly seen in Fig. 4 and forms a five membered ring with Ti4+ on the surface of TiO2, giving rise to the formation of the charge transfer complex.62,63
The PCE values of the DSSCs sensitized by three of the high hydroxyl-chain bearing dyes like D2, D3, and D4 have been found as 0.65, 0.41 and, 0.52%, respectively. These values are higher than those of long-alkyl-chain bearing D5 and D7 based DSSCs. Specifically, D2 sensitized DSSC has the second highest PCE value of 0.65%. It can be ascribed to the carbonyl-chains at 1320–1000 cm−1 ranges (–CO stretch bonds) along with the long hydroxyl-chains (Fig. 1 and S2†). All these results are in good agreement with the calculated kET values in Table 1. Besides, there is a strong correlation between the Jsc values and dye loading capacities as shown in Table 2.
(g) IPCE measurements
The effectiveness of the cell to convert light of different wavelengths into electrical current was measured as the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE), defined as the number of electrons generated per number of photons incident on the cell. As depicted in Fig. 8, the IPCE values observed at the characteristic wavelengths of the dyes varied from 6% to 38% in the UV region and from 1% to 19% in the visible region, decreasing in the order D8 > D2 > D4 > D3 > etc., (with the quite similar order in PCE).
 Fig. 8  The IPCE spectra of the DSSCs sensitized by various natural dyes in the range of 300–700 nm. 
The IPCE characteristics show similar tendency to Jsc values and absorption characteristics. Both the absorption coefficient of the photosensitizer and the light scattering effect of the semiconductor improve the IPCE performance. The variation in obtained IPCE values for various natural dye-sensitized solar cells can be due to the different amounts of dye loaded onto the TiO2 surface, different level of charge carrier's recombination, and different HOMO/LUMO levels of excited dye molecules. Similar to both absorption and J–V curves, D8 sensitized DSSC has the largest percentage of charge transportation in both UV and visible regions, while D6 sensitized DSSC has the lowest one. The determined results exhibited that D2, D4, and D8, owing to their hydroxyl and/or carbonyl groups, anchor strongly with photoanode material, thereby facilitating the electron transfer from the excited state of the photosensitizers to the conduction band of TiO2, with respect to other anchoring groups.64 Especially, the anthocyanin (D8) which consists of hydroxyl, carbonyl and radical groups efficiently adsorbs on TiO2 surface due to strong interaction between its functional group and Ti and/or O atoms, resulting in fast electron transportation and lower recombination ratio. Thus, the highest IPCE value depended on Jsc was obtained for the D8 DSSC. However, low conversion responses for D1, D5, D7 and D9 may be owing to poor interaction of sensitizers with the semiconductor that restricts the electron transport from the excited dye molecules to the TiO2. These results are in good agreement with the dye loading measurements of photoanodes presented in Table 2.
4. Conclusions
This study addresses the photovoltaic characteristics and the photoinduced electron injection dynamics of DSSCs sensitized by several natural dyes having various anchoring groups. The electron injection kinetics obtained by the cyclic voltammetry observations are in good agreement with the results obtained by the photoinduced electron transfer analysis. These results show that D8 dye has the most appropriate LUMO level for rapid electron injection. The DSSC sensitized by long-hydroxyl & carbonyl-chain bearing (the combination of carbonyl and hydroxyl as anchoring groups) anthocyanin, D8, offered the best PCE of 1.87% among the nine extracts due to its higher electron injection rate (kET). However, the PCE is still lower by a factor of 4–5 compared with Ru based synthetic dyes. Nonetheless, natural dyes are quite useful for their non-poisonity, and very low cost of production opening up a perspective of feasibility for economic and environmentally friendly dye cells. Therefore, natural dyes as light harvesting elements in DSSCs can contribute to a sustainable solution in future energy production.
