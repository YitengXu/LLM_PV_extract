    , Accepted 28th October 2016First published on 29th October 2016AbstractOrganic photovoltaics (OPVs) have drawn an extensive amount of attention due to their low cost, processibility and flexibility. However, a cell based on a blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) has a limited power conversion efficiency (PCE) due to the short exciton diffusion length of ∼10 nm. We address this issue by designing a series of all-conjugated diblock copolymers, poly(3-hexylthiophene)-b-poly(3-(6-diethylphosphonatohexyl)thiophene) (P3HT-b-P3PHT), intended for use as additives to improve the performance of P3HT:PC61BM-based photovoltaic devices. The PCE of the devices improved from 3.30% to 4.03% with the addition of P3HT-b-P3PHT (3:1). The thermal stability of devices with P3HT-b-P3PHT additives improved significantly relative to that of the P3HT:PC61BM reference device, where the devices including a copolymer with a higher P3PHT content exhibited a better thermal stability. It was found that the fill factor (FF) could be regulated by simply varying the block ratio of P3HT-b-P3PHT and played a crucial role in improving both the PCE and the thermal stability. The P3HT-b-P3PHT diffused at the P3HT:PC61BM interface, improved the miscibility between P3HT and PC61BM, optimized the nanoscale morphology of the photoactive layer, and reduced the active layer roughness, all of which improved the FF and thus contributed to an improvement in device performance.
Introduction
Over the last two decades, π-conjugated polymer-based photovoltaic devices have attracted an extensive amount of attention due to their desirable properties for practical applications, including a low cost, light weight, flexibility and ease of manufacturing with solution processes.1–5 The most studied system in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) consists of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as the electron acceptor, which results in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) in the range from 3 to 5%. The PCE is proportional to the product of the short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). Most studies have focused on improving the Jsc and Voc by designing narrow-bandgap polymers6,7 and lowering the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the polymer,8,9 respectively. However, lowering the HOMO usually enlarges the bandgap, and thus there must be a compromise between improving Jsc and Voc.10
As such, effecting an increase in the third parameter, the FF, is less understood than for the others, and this is a useful and promising strategy to improve the PCE.11 The FF is affected by a range of factors, including the charge carrier mobility,12 thin-film thickness,13 nanoscale morphology of the active layer,14,15 compatibility between the donor and acceptor,16etc. Less charge recombination has been proven to be critical to achieve a good FF, and hence, it is ideal to control the phase separation between P3HT and PC61BM to form a 10 nm-scale interpenetrated network (since the short exciton diffusion length is ∼10 nm) to ensure effective dissociation of the exciton and subsequent transport to the respective electrode.17–19 Various research efforts based on this principle have proposed controlling the nanoscale phase separation within the photoactive layer with thermal annealing,20,21 solvent annealing22,23 and the use of additives,24,25 and so on. However, P3HT becomes unstable upon extended thermal or solvent annealing, and the uncontrollable macrophase separation between P3HT and PC61BM results in a dramatic decrease in the donor–acceptor interfacial contact, thus limiting the charge separation.26 Therefore, this contradiction should be solved in order to produce photovoltaic devices with a high PCE as well as long-term stability.
Another promising approach to control the nanoscale morphology and improve the thermal stability of the solar cell device consists of using P3HT-based block copolymers (BCPs) that combine the optoelectronic properties of P3HT and the fascinating self-assembly properties of BCPs. Various synthesis techniques have been developed to synthesize a variety of P3HT-based rod-coil and rod–rod BCPs.27–40 These BCPs have a tunable nanoscale morphology that enables them to be used as electron donors28,33 or surfactants34–36 in P3HT:PC61BM-based photovoltaic devices. For example, a photovoltaic device consisting of an all-conjugated poly(3-butylthiophene)-b-poly(3-hexylthiophene) BCP and PC71BM yielded an attractive PCE of 4.02%.37 The P3HT-based triblock copolymer poly(4-vinyltriphenylamine)-b-poly(3-hexylthiophene)-b-poly(4-vinyltriphenylamine) could also be used as a surfactant to improve the PCE and thermal stability of P3HT:PC61BM.38
Yet, there are still some disadvantages to using these BCPs. The coil blocks in the rod-coil systems are usually insulators that negatively impact the overall electronic properties, and the dominance of strong rod–rod interactions in rod–rod systems over the microphase separation of BCPs complicates the phase behavior and prevents the formation of well-defined nanostructures.41,42 The above problems can be overcome by developing a new all-conjugated BCP with a well-controlled microphase separation structure and reduced rod–rod interactions without the need for an insulating coil block.
To this end, we have synthesized a new class of an all-conjugated diblock copolymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene)-b-poly(3-(6-diethylphosphonatohexyl)thiophene) (P3HT-b-P3PHT), and used it as an additive in P3HT:PC61BM-based photovoltaic devices. This BCP contains only P3HT as the copolymer backbone, with P3HT as one block and its derivative with phosphonate side groups as the other block. The motivation to design P3HT-b-P3PHT is as follows. (1) It is an all-conjugated BCP without an insulating coil block, which can largely prevent the degradation of electronic properties. (2) The side chain functionalization of P3HT has been proven to be a good way to reduce the rod–rod interactions,43 and it may also enhance the thermal stability of photovoltaic devices.44,45 We will first show that P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs with a well-controlled molecular weight, various block ratios, and narrow PDI are synthesized using the Grignard metathesis (GRIM) method.46,47 Their optical properties as well as thermal, crystalline, and self-assembly behavior reveal their amphiphilic nature and reduced rod–rod interactions. When such BCPs are used as additives in P3HT:PC61BM-based photovoltaic devices, the devices with BCPs of various block ratios all exhibit better performance than the P3HT:PC61BM reference device. The improvement in the PCE is mainly due to the increase in the FF since the BCPs act as a “linker” between P3HT and PC61BM to improve the miscibility and enlarge the donor/acceptor interfacial areas, thus reducing the charge recombination rate. Furthermore, the effect that the block ratio of P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs has on the thermal stability of the device is also explored. The increase in P3PHT content reduces the PCE to some degree but significantly improves the thermal stability of the device, which indicates a balance between the PCE of the device and the thermal stability due to the addition of BCPs. The significance of this work is to demonstrate a new class of P3HT-based all-conjugated BCPs and to take a further step to realize their application in photovoltaic devices.
Experimental section
Materials and reagents
The monomers 2-bromo-5-iodo-3-hexylthiophene (M1) and 2-bromo-5-iodo-3-bromohexylthiophene (M2) were synthesized according to procedures previously described in the literature.47 Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (Mn = 78000 g mol−1, PDI < 2.2, regioregularity > 96%) was purchased from 1-material Company. Isopropylmagnesium chloride (i-PrMgCl, 2.0 M in tetrahydrofuran) and (1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)-propane)-dichloronickel(II) (Ni(dppp)Cl2) were purchased from Aldrich and were used as received. Triethyl phosphite was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Inc. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was freshly dried over sodium benzophenone ketyl, and some other solvents were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (SRC) and were used as received.
Synthesis of P3HT-b-P3PHT block copolymers
The synthetic route for P3HT-b-P3PHT is depicted in Scheme 1. The intermediate poly(3-hexylthiophene)-b-poly[3-(6-bromohexyl)thiophene] (P3HT-b-P3BrHT) was prepared via Grignard metathesis in two steps. In the first step, the P3HT block was polymerized from activated monomer 2-bromo-5-iodo-3-hexylthiophene (M1) to obtain the end living P3HT polymers. Subsequently, the other activated monomer 2-bromo-5-iodo-3-bromohexylthiophene (M2) was added to the reacting solution to obtain P3HT-b-P3BrHT. The detailed synthesis of P3HT-b-P3BrHT can be found in our previous work.48
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of P3HT-b-P3PHT diblock copolymers. 
The target P3HT-b-P3PHT was synthesized by reacting the bromohexyl side groups of P3HT-b-P3BrHT with triethyl phosphite. The P3HT-b-P3BrHT (1.0 g) and triethyl phosphite (30 mL) mixture was heated at 160 °C for 24 h. After the removal of excess triethyl phosphite under reduced pressure, the block copolymer was washed with Soxhlet extraction using hexane and then finally extracted using chloroform. The solvent was removed by evaporation to produce a purple solid.
The molar feed ratios of M1 to M2 were 75:25, 50:50 and 25:75. Two peaks at 0.91 and 4.08 ppm corresponding to the resonances of the terminal methyl group in the hexyl side chain and the methylene group in the phosphonate group were derived from the 1H NMR spectra, and the ratio of the integration areas under these two peaks was calculated to obtain the actual molar ratios of the P3HT and P3PHT blocks at 74:26, 51:49 and 33:67, which are denoted as P3HT-b-P3PHT (3:1), P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:1) and P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:2), respectively. The regioregularity of all P3HT-b-P3PHT is higher than 96%.

Photovoltaic device fabrication
The ITO substrates were sequentially cleaned in acetone, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and deionized (DI) water for 30 min via ultra-sonication and then dried in an oven at 120 °C for 10 min. The ZnO solution for the electron transport layer (ETL) was prepared by dissolving 1 g of zinc acetate dehydrate and 0.28 g of ethanolamine in 10 mL of methoxyethanol. The ETL ZnO layer was formed by spin-coating the solution at 2400 rpm for 60 s on ITO substrates and annealed at 150 °C for 1 h.
Active layer deposition consisted of P3HT:PC61BM (w/w = 1:1) as the base line composition, to which 5% P3HT-b-P3PHT BCP with different block ratios was added. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene was used as the solvent to dissolve the blends, and the solution was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 10 s, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 30 min in an N2 filled glovebox. Finally, 5 nm-thick MoO3 and 100 nm-thick Ag were thermally evaporated as the hole transport layer (HTL) and top electrode, respectively. Post-annealing was carried out after depositing the Ag electrode for the thermal stability test, and the photoactive area of the fabricated device was 0.06 cm2.
Characterization
Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was conducted using an Agilent 1100 system equipped with both G1362A refractive-index and G1314A UV detectors (eluent: THF; calibration: polystyrene standards). The 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a DMX500 MHz spectrometer in CDCl3 with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was conducted using a TA DSC Q2000 at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under an N2 flow. The UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on Perkin Elmer Lambda 35 UV-vis spectrophotometers, and the photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a fluorescence spectrometer (FLS 920). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a PANalytical X'Pert PRO X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.541 Å) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. The samples for the XRD measurements were prepared by drop-casting 10 mg mL−1 polymer solutions onto silicon wafers. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging was performed on a Tecnai G2 20, FEI electron microscope operating at 200 kV. As for the TEM analysis, the samples were prepared by drop-casting 0.5 mg mL−1 copolymer solutions on copper grids, followed by evaporation of the solvent under ambient conditions. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a Digital Instruments Dimension 3100 scanning force microscope in the tapping mode, and optical images were obtained using an optical polarizing microscope (Leica DM2500P) in the reflection mode. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using an IPCE measurement system (PEC-S20, HS technology) to analyze the incident photo-to-current efficiency. The current density–voltage (J–V) curve of the photovoltaic devices was recorded under simulated AM 1.5G light (100 mW cm−2) using a Keithley 2200 solar cell J–V measurement system. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed at the 9A U-SAXS beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL), Korea. The operating conditions were set at a wavelength of 1.119 Å with a sample-to-detector distance of 225 mm. The incidence angle (αi) varied from 0.100° to 0.130°, and the 2D GIWAXS patterns were recorded using a 2D CCD detector (SX-165, Rayonix) with an exposure time of 10–60 seconds.
Results and discussion
Characterization of the P3HT-b-P3PHT block copolymers

Fig. 1a shows the GPC profiles of the P3HT synthesized in the first step and the final target P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:1) as an example after second-stage polymerization and reacting with triethyl phosphite. The GPC profiles of the two other P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs are presented in Fig. S1.† When compared to the peaks of the P3HT obtained in the first step, the peaks of the final P3HT-b-P3PHT all shift to a higher molecular weight with the maintenance of a single peak, indicating the production of the target BCPs with little P3HT contaminant. These three P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs with different block ratios all show a relatively high molecular weight from 11400 to 16400 and a narrow PDI of 1.16–1.17, as shown in Table 1. The selected region of the 1H NMR spectra shows the disappearance of the proton signal (δ = 3.43 ppm) corresponding to the methylene linked to the bromide in the side chains of P3HT-b-P3BrHT as well as the appearance of the proton signal (δ = 4.08 ppm) corresponding to methylene in the phosphonate groups (Fig. 1b), indicating the successful synthesis of P3HT-b-P3PHT. The full region of the 1H NMR spectra is given in Fig. S2.†

The side chain substitution with the phosphonate group in P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs gives the BCPs their amphiphilic nature, with solubility in a wide range of solvents, including good solvents for both blocks such as chloroform or P3PHT-selective solvents such as methanol. The UV-vis spectra of these BCPs in the two typical solvents were also investigated (Fig. 2). In chloroform, all BCPs and the corresponding homopolymers exhibited a single peak with a maximum at 446–450 nm due to the π–π* transition of the polythiophene main chain (Fig. 2a). This suggests that these copolymers have good solubility in chloroform, exhibiting flexible coil characteristics. While in methanol, the block ratio of P3HT to P3PHT influenced the aggregated structure of the BCPs (Fig. 2b). Compared to the absorption of the P3PHT homopolymer remaining at 456 nm, a bathochromic shift was observed in the case of P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:2), with the main peak at 499 nm and two very weak vibronic peaks at 552 and 602 nm that can be attributed to the absorption of the interchain π–π interaction. This indicates that the P3HT chains begin to transform from flexible coils to rigid rods in methanol and tend to aggregate in a side-by-side manner. For the copolymer of P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:1) and (3:1), a further bathochromic shift occurred with the main peak at 518 nm, and the intensity of these two vibronic peaks increased, indicating a stronger interchain π–π interaction.

As we know, the side chain functionalization and block ratios of the BCPs can affect the crystalline structure of the BCPs.37 To gain a deeper insight into the possible changes in the P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs due to the incorporation of the phosphonate group, we further investigated their thermal and crystalline behavior via DSC and XRD. The endothermic traces of the BCPs are shown in Fig. 3, and their exothermic traces are presented in Fig. S3.† The melting and crystallization temperatures of all these samples are summarized in Table 2. The melting temperature (Tm) of the P3HT and P3PHT homopolymer was 228 and 72 °C, respectively, indicating that the incorporation of the phosphonate group into the hexyl side chains greatly decreased the melting transition temperature of the main chain. As a result, the P3PHT block became more flexible than the rigid P3HT block. A single endothermic peak was observed for the copolymer of P3HT-b-P3PHT (3:1), and it was assigned to the P3HT block (Tm = 211 °C). In contrast, the P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:2) showed a Tm at 110 °C, which was assigned to the P3PHT block at about 38 °C above the Tm of the P3PHT homopolymer. This can be attributed to the covalently bonded P3HT block that promoted the crystallization of the P3PHT block. In both cases, the Tm of the other minor block was not observed. This indicated the occurrence of interplay between the crystallization of P3HT and P3PHT in the BCPs. As a result, the major block dominated the final crystalline structure of the BCPs while the crystallization of the other minor block was depressed. These DSC results were consistent with the XRD patterns, i.e., the BCPs exhibited (100), (200), and (300) diffraction peaks of the major block while diffraction peaks were not observed for the other minor block (Fig. S4†). Although only one endothermic peak with Tm at 206 °C was observed for the P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:1) BCP with a relatively equal content of the two blocks, when annealed at 150 °C below the Tm of P3HT, it showed a endothermic peak with the Tm at 126 °C related to P3PHT (Fig. S5†). This indicated that the P3PHT block in this P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:1) BCP had a relatively weak crystalline ability. If annealed above the Tm of P3HT, the crystallization of the P3HT block restricted the subsequent P3PHT crystallization. The XRD data show (100) reflections for both the P3HT and P3PHT blocks (Fig. S4†), indicating that the P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:1) microphase separated into two P3HT- and P3PHT-rich domains, and then each domain crystallized independently.

Usually, the rigid characteristic of the rod–rod BCPs complicates the phase behavior and severely prevents the formation of well-ordered nanostructures. To elucidate the effect of the phosphonate group on the self-assembly behavior of this system, a TEM study was performed for various P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs in anisole. Since anisole is a marginal solvent for P3HT but is good for P3PHT, the major P3PHT block in P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:2) resulted in the BCP dissolving very well in anisole and forming a featureless structure (not shown here). For the P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:1), a clear densely packed, partially aligned lamellar structure with a spacing of ∼20 nm could be observed over a large area (Fig. 4a). Clearly, the phosphonate group reduced the rigid characteristic of such all-conjugated BCPs, which increased the flexibility of the system and induced a well-controlled microphase separation structure. P3HT-b-P3PHT (3:1) exhibited a mixed morphology with both a phase-separated structure and a fibrillar structure with a width of ∼20 nm (Fig. 4b). The π–π stacking for P3HT became stronger due to the higher content of P3HT, and therefore, some P3HT chains stacked into nanofibrils in anisole via π–π interactions. Overall, the above UV-vis, DSC, XRD and TEM measurements indicate that the introduction of the phosphonate group into the hexyl side chains causes the P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs to have an amphiphilic nature, a lower melting temperature, and reduced rod–rod interactions, which make them promising additives in P3HT:PC61BM-based photovoltaic devices.

P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs as additives in photovoltaic devices
The effects that the designed all-conjugated P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs had on P3HT:PC61BM photovoltaic devices were explored. Fig. 5a illustrates the schematic structures of the photovoltaic devices with the addition of P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs into the P3HT:PC61BM active layer and the proposed nanoscale organization within the active layer, which will be discussed later. Fig. 5b displays the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the P3HT:PC61BM-based photovoltaic devices blended with 5 wt% of P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters including the open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), power conversion efficiency (PCE), etc. are summarized in Table 3. The P3HT:PC61BM reference photovoltaic device exhibited a PCE of 3.30 ± 0.20% with a Jsc of 9.82 ± 0.48 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.59 ± 0.01 V and a FF of 0.57 ± 0.02. When 5 wt% of P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs with three different block ratios were added, the performance of all photovoltaic devices outperformed that of the P3HT:PC61BM reference device. The highest efficiency of 4.03% was achieved for photovoltaic devices blended with P3HT-b-P3PHT (3:1), which corresponded to an improvement of ∼22% relative to the reference device. A careful observation of each photovoltaic parameter revealed that the significant increase in the PCE is mainly due to the drastic improvement in the FF since Jsc was only increased in the device blended with P3HT-b-P3PHT (3:1), and Voc improved very slightly. In the devices blended with P3HT-b-P3PHT (3:1), (1:1), and (1:2), the FF increased to 0.63, 0.67, and 0.66, respectively. Similar trends for the change in Jsc and FF could be observed by adding 10 wt% of P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs of various block ratios (Fig. S6 and Table S1†). In these devices, Jsc decreased more obviously compared to those with an addition of 5 wt% BCP. We attributed the reduced Jsc to a higher content of the P3PHT block in the BCPs since P3PHT was less conductive than P3HT, which might impede carrier charge transport and thus lead to a lower Jsc. Surprisingly, a high FF was still obtained after the addition of 10% BCPs and improved with an increase in P3PHT content. All of the above results suggested that the output characteristics of the photovoltaic devices became much better with the addition of P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs.

FF is known to be a relatively complicated and combined parameter that is influenced by various processes, including charge carrier generation, diffusion, dissociation, transportation and collection. According to the single diode model, FF can be approximated as follows:49 (1)while (2)where rs and rsh represent the normalized series resistance and shunt resistance, respectively, which are the actual resistances Rs and Rsh divided by Voc/Jsc. voc is the normalized open circuit voltage, which is the actual Voc divided by nkT/q, where n stands for the diode ideality factor, q is the elementary charge, and k is the Boltzmann constant. FF is associated with the series resistance Rs and shunt resistance Rsh. When compared to the P3HT:PC61BM reference cell, the devices with the addition of BCPs all showed a reduced Rs and an increased Rsh, especially in the system containing P3HT:PC61BM blended with P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:1). The highest FF of 0.67 was achieved with a reduction of Rs to 7.98 Ω cm2 and increase in Rsh to 3630 Ω cm2. The reduced Rs indicated a decrease in the bulk resistance of the active layer and contact resistance with the electrode, and the increased Rsh indicated a lower leakage current with less charge loss due to trapping and recombination,50 both of which indicated a more optimized nanoscale morphology to improve the FF, as confirmed by AFM (Fig. 6). When compared to the reference P3HT:PC61BM film (Fig. 6a and b), the surface morphology of the P3HT:PC61BM film blended with 5 wt% of P3HT-b-P3PHT (3:1) (Fig. 6c and d) and (1:2) (Fig. 6e and f) exhibited continuous network fibrils with smaller P3HT and PC61BM domain sizes (10–20 nm) comparable to the exciton diffusion length (∼10 nm) that allowed for more efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. In addition, the reference P3HT:PC61BM film showed a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 2.5 nm, which was larger than 1.67 nm and 1.58 nm after the addition of P3HT-b-P3PHT (3:1) and (1:2), respectively. The smoother surface provided fewer defects and better contact with the electrode, leading to a more efficient charge transport at the active layer/electrode interface.13,51

The photoluminescence (PL) measurement substantiated less exciton recombination with the addition of P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs into the P3HT:PC61BM films, which favored an increase in the FF. Since PL is associated with the recombination of photogenerated excitons, PL quenching or a decrease is indicative of the existence of alternative pathways for excitons in addition to radiative recombination, e.g., exciton dissociation followed by charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor at an interface.52 As shown in Fig. 7a, the PL peaks at 640 nm and 690 nm correspond to the 0–0 and 0–1 singlet transitions of P3HT, respectively. The PL intensity of all samples decreased with the addition of BCPs, and the PL for P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:1) and (1:2) decreased more obviously than for (3:1), which indicated the suppression of charge recombination and was consistent with the higher FF observed in the (1:1) and (1:2) blending systems when compared to the (3:1) blending system. Overall, a high FF can be achieved by satisfying the following criteria: (1) high charge carrier mobility, (2) fine nanoscale phase-separated morphology that facilitates charge carrier transport, (3) enlarged interface area between the donor and acceptor to inhibit photogenerated exciton recombination, and (4) less contact loss between the active layer and the electrodes. In summary, the above criteria can be regulated to achieve a high FF simply by varying the block ratio of P3HT-b-P3PHT.

In a P3HT:PC61BM system with BCPs as the additive, an increase in the PCE can usually be attributed to an improvement in Jsc.34,36,53,54 However, in our system, the addition of only 5 wt% P3HT-b-P3PHT (3:1) increased Jsc to 10.56 mA cm−2 while almost unchanged with the addition of P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:1) and decreased to 8.83 mA cm−2 when P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:2) was added. The Jsc trend was consistent with that of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) since the Jsc value can be estimated by integrating the corresponding EQE curve52 (Fig. 7b). The EQE in the range from 300 to 800 nm was clearly seen to have improved for the photovoltaic devices blended with the BCP (3:1), almost unchanged with the BCP (1:1), and reduced with the BCP (1:2). For example, a maximum EQE of 80% was achieved around 550 nm for P3HT:PC61BM with P3HT-b-P3PHT (3:1) while the reference P3HT:PC61BM exhibited only 68% of EQE. The change in EQE is related to the crystallinity of P3HT. The increase in the P3HT crystallinity is generally accepted to be highly favorable to improve the device performance since light absorption increases and more excitons are consequently formed.54 In other words, a high P3HT crystallinity facilitates charge carrier generation and transportation.
DSC (Fig. S7†) and GIWAXS (Fig. 8) analyses were conducted to investigate the crystalline behavior of the P3HT:PC61BM and P3HT:PC61BM blended with 5% P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs. The melting, crystallization temperatures and crystallinity of the P3HT in each sample are summarized in Table 4. The Tm and Tc of P3HT at 228 °C and 200 °C (Table 2) decreased with the presence of PC61BM. Overall, the addition of P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs resulted in an increase in the Tc of P3HT in the P3HT:PC61BM blended with P3HT-b-P3PHT (3:1) and (1:1) and a decrease in that of P3HT:PC61BM blended with P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:2). This means that the P3HT-b-P3PHT additives influenced the P3HT crystallization. The crystallinity of P3HT (X) in each system can be calculated from X = ΔHm/ΔH0m, where ΔHm is the melting enthalpy for P3HT measured during the heating scan, and ΔH0m is the melting enthalpy of 100% crystalline P3HT. The value of ΔH0m is 99 J g−1 as reported by Nandi and Malik55 and 37 J g−1 as reported recently by Saalwächter et al.56 Both of the reported ΔH0m values were used, and the P3HT crystallinity was calculated and is presented in Table 4. The crystallinity of P3HT in P3HT:PC61BM increased with the addition of P3HT-b-P3PHT (3:1) and (1:1) and decreased with the addition of P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:2).

GIWAXS experiments were conducted to obtain further details on the crystalline structures of P3HT. (100), (200), and (300) diffraction peaks in the out-of-plane direction (Fig. 8 and S8†) and the (010) peaks at 1.634 Å−1 from π–π stacking in the in-plane direction (Fig. S8†) were observed in P3HT:PC61BM and P3HT:PC61BM blended with P3HT-b-P3PHT (3:1) and (1:1), implying the “edge on” orientation of the P3HT crystalline structure. However, a halo-like (100) diffraction peak (Fig. 8d) was observed in P3HT:PC61BM blended with a P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:2) system with a strong intensity of (100) diffraction at 0.378 Å−1 in the in-plane direction and a (010) peak arising at 1.628 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction (Fig. S8†), indicating some of the P3HT that transformed from the “edge on” into “isotropic”. A careful comparison of the scattering intensity ratio of (100), (200), and (300) diffraction peaks indicated that it slightly increased by introducing P3HT-b-P3PHT (3:1), almost unchanged with P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:1), and decreased with P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:2), which were consistent with the DSC results. The combined DSC and GIWAXS results help prove that the increase in crystallinity of P3HT in P3HT:PC61BM blended with the P3HT-b-P3PHT (3:1) system offered more charge generation, which was consistent with the improved EQE value.
Thermal stability of photovoltaic cells
Thermal annealing is effective to obtain a nanoscale interpenetrating network structure and an increase in the mobility of P3HT for the P3HT:PC61BM-based photovoltaic device. However, prolonged exposure to a high temperature usually leads to large-scale separation that reduces both the interfacial area and the charge dissociation efficiency.57 To this end, the thermal stability of the photovoltaic devices was investigated by annealing the completed devices at a fixed temperature as a function of time (Fig. 9). The relative parameters of all photovoltaic devices after post-annealing are summarized in Table S2.† The measurements indicated that all P3HT:PC61BM devices blended with P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs exhibited an improvement in their thermal stability relative to the P3HT:PC61BM reference device. The reference P3HT:PC61BM device lost its initial efficiency by over 33% after post-annealing at 150 °C for 90 min while the P3HT:PC61BM blended with different P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs remained at 78.0% (3:1), 88.0% (1:1), and 98.3% (1:2) of the initial efficiency under the same experimental conditions. This indicated that the BCP with a higher P3PHT content endowed the device with better thermal stability. Concerning the change trend of Jsc with annealing time in Fig. 9b, the decay rate was also slower in the P3HT:PC61BM devices blended with P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs with a higher P3PHT content. During post-thermal annealing, the crystallinity of P3HT did not change a lot and the Jsc was mostly influenced by the macrophase separation between P3HT and PC61BM. The BCPs with a higher P3PHT content suppressed the macrophase separation between P3HT and PC61BM more efficiently, which facilitated the charge transport and thus resulted in the slower decay of Jsc during post-thermal annealing. Fig. 9 shows the changes in each parameter, and the devices with a higher FF exhibited a better thermal stability. It is reasonable to conclude that the optimized nanoscale morphology that contributed to an improvement in the FF also favored an improvement in the thermal stability.

Optical microscopy could be applied to gain direct insight into the contrast in the thermal stability with or without the P3HT-b-P3PHT BCP (Fig. 10). In this study, P3HT-b-P3PHT (3:1) and P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:2) BCPs were chosen with different major blocks. For the P3HT:PC61BM blend, thermal annealing at 150 °C for 30 min induced the formation of many needle-like PC61BM crystals with a length of 20–40 μm, indicating the macrophase separation between P3HT and PC61BM (Fig. 10a). The large-scale phase separation between the two active components reduced both the interfacial area and the charge carrier transport, leading to a lower efficiency in the reference P3HT:PC61BM device. An increase in annealing for 24 h resulted in an increase in the size of PC61BM needles to 30–50 μm (Fig. 10b). However, the size and density of these PC61BM needles markedly decreased with the addition of BCPs as additives. No PC61BM aggregates appeared for the P3HT:PC61BM blended with P3HT-b-P3PHT (3:1) (5%) or P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:2) (5%) at 150 °C for 30 min (Fig. 10c and e). A further increase in the annealing time to 24 h resulted in the presence of a few PC61BM crystals in the P3HT:PC61BM blended with P3HT-b-P3PHT (3:1) (Fig. 10d), and fewer PC61BM needles were found in the P3HT:PC61BM blended with P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:2) (Fig. 10f). These data indicate that the presence of the P3HT-b-P3PHT BCP inhibited the PC61BM crystallization, thereby improving the miscibility between P3HT and PC61BM and enhancing the device efficiency and thermal stability. Due to the affinity of the phosphonate group of P3PHT and the methyl ester group of PC61BM, the BCP diffused at the P3HT:PC61BM interface with the P3HT block interacting with the P3HT homopolymer and the P3PHT block interacting with the PC61BM molecules (see Fig. 5a). The selective miscibility of the P3PHT block with PC61BM caused the compatibilizing effect on the device stability. The P3HT:PC61BM blended with P3HT-b-P3PHT (1:2) showed the fewest PC61BM needles, which was consistent with the highest thermal stability that could be achieved among different photovoltaic devices. These results demonstrated that P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs played a critical role in improving the device efficiency, and both a high PCE and good thermal stability could be achieved by controlling the block ratio of P3HT to P3PHT.

Conclusion
In this study, we synthesized a new class of all-conjugated diblock copolymers P3HT-b-P3PHT with different block ratios and then used them as additives in P3HT:PC61BM-based photovoltaic devices. The introduction of the phosphonate group into the hexyl side chains resulted in the P3HT-b-P3PHT BCPs having an amphiphilic nature, a lower melting temperature, and a reduction in the rod–rod interactions, as shown in the UV-vis, DSC, XRD and TEM studies. When these BCPs were used as additives, the photovoltaic performance of the P3HT:PC61BM-based devices greatly improved, which could be mainly ascribed to the improvement in the FF. The BCP diffused at the P3HT:PC61BM interface and not only optimized the nanoscale morphology of the photoactive layer but also improved the miscibility between P3HT and PC61BM. Both of these contributed to the improvement in FF, which was favorable for the device efficiency and thermal stability. Thus, the high PCE and long-term thermal stability of the photovoltaic devices could be simultaneously achieved by carefully designing BCPs with a suitable block ratio. Overall, these results demonstrated that the P3HT-b-P3PHT BCP played a critical role in forming a favorable morphology in the P3HT:PC61BM active film, leading to high-performance photovoltaic devices with improved thermal stability.
