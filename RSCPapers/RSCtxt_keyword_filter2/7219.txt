    , Accepted 29th December 2012First published on 7th January 2013AbstractA new n-type polymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene-co-benzothiadiazole) (THBT), which contains the same molar ratio of p-type (3-hexylthiophene) and n-type (benzothiadiazole) units in the main chain, was synthesized by Suzuki coupling reaction. Optical and photoelectron measurements showed that the THBT polymer features an optical band gap energy of 1.8 eV, a highest occupied molecular orbital energy of 5.7 eV and a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy of 3.9 eV. Synchrotron-radiation grazing incidence angle X-ray diffraction measurements disclosed a strong chain stacking effect in the THBT polymer film, which is similar to the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) film case, but the chain stacking distance in the THBT film was different from that in the P3HT film. The zero-field electron mobility of the THBT film was measured as ca. 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 when a space-charge limited current method was employed. Based on the characteristics of the THBT polymer, two types (normal and inverted types) of all-polymer solar cells were fabricated using the P3HT:THBT films as an active layer. The result showed that the maximum open circuit voltage reached ca. 0.86 V and the solar cell performance was found to be strongly dependent on the nanomorphology of the P3HT:THBT films upon changing the composition of co-solvents. The fill factor of the inverted solar cells was higher than that of the normal type solar cells, leading to a higher power conversion efficiency for the inverted type P3HT:THBT solar cells.
Introduction
Organic solar cells have recently been highlighted due to their encouraging improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) since the early breakthroughs.1–8 The PCEs to date have reached ca. 10.6% efficiency by employing tandem structures, as well as by harnessing more solar light from various conjugated polymers with extended light-harvesting characteristics.9–15 Although small molecule-based tandem cells exhibit quite a high PCE,15 most of the high PCE solar cells are made with bulk heterojunction (BHJ) films of conjugated polymers and soluble fullerene derivatives. However, the polymer:fullerene solar cells are in principle not perfect plastic solar cells because the small-molecular fullerene component (as an electron acceptor) is mixed with the polymer component (as an electron donor). To achieve more perfect plastic solar cells, the electron acceptor part has been replaced with an electron-accepting polymer leading to “all-polymer solar cells”.16–23
However, the PCE values of all-polymer (i.e. polymer:polymer) solar cells are still inferior to those of polymer:fullerene solar cells. The fundamental drawback of all-polymer solar cells can be ascribed to the incomplete formation of charge percolation morphology owing to the intrinsic nature of long polymer chains compared to the fullerene derivatives that have a strong tendency for aggregation and crystallization.24–26 To make better phase-separated morphology in polymer:polymer BHJ films, a variety of efforts such as controlling the thermal annealing conditions, choosing solvent types and employing a third polymer component have been tried so far.16–23,27,28 However, developing too much phase separation between electron-donating polymer phases and electron-accepting polymer phases is not desired for all-polymer solar cells because of the same disadvantages as for polymer:fullerene solar cells. We note that another sophisticated approach has been reported to improve the interfacial area between electron-donating polymers and electron-accepting polymers by imprinting a particular surface nanostructure with a silicon mold.29
Interestingly, although various electron-accepting polymers have been synthesized and applied for all-polymer solar cells, poly(3-hexylthiophene-co-benzothiadiazole) (THBT), which is one of the rather simple copolymers with an electron-accepting unit (benzothiadiazole) (BT)17,18 and an electron-donating unit (TH),3–8 has not had its synthesis and characterization reported. In particular, incorporating both BT and TH units (with equimolar ratio) into polymer main chains can make an n-type polymer with improved charge mobility, because of the positive (good charge transporting) role of the TH unit. Moreover, to date, no inverted all-polymer solar cells with the THBT polymer have been reported, even though the inverted type solar cells are widely studied for polymer:fullerene solar cells due to the potential benefit for better stability by excluding the use of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) which is acidic, leading to the corrosion of indium-tin oxide (ITO) electrodes.14,30–37
In this work, we synthesized the THBT polymer from its monomer, 2,5-dibromo-3-hexylthiophene (2Br-3HT) and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-bis(boronic acid pinacol ester) (2B-BT). After investigating the energy band diagram of the synthesized THBT polymer with optical absorption spectra and ionization potential, normal-type all-polymer solar cells were fabricated by employing regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as an electron-donating polymer and applying co-solvents. Finally, on the basis of the process conditions for the normal-type all-polymer (P3HT:THBT) solar cells, inverted-type all-polymer (P3HT:THBT) solar cells were fabricated by introducing a zinc oxide film as an electron-collecting buffer layer. Results showed that the inverted P3HT:THBT solar cells exhibited ∼0.3% PCE compared to ∼0.2% PCE for the normal P3HT:THBT solar cells. (We note that we have recently published a short conference paper for the normal-type solar cells with the P3HT:THBT films.38)
Results and discussion
The THBT polymer was synthesized from 2Br-3HT and 2B-BT in a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and deionized water via Suzuki coupling reaction (Fig. 1a). The copolymerization reaction was carried out for 72 h at 85 °C, which led to a dark reddish powder product. As shown in Fig. 1b, the 3HT units are not perfectly in the same plane with the BT unit, which indicates partly imperfect π-orbital overlapping leading to a partial conjugation along with the THBT polymer chain. The detailed synthesis methods are described in the experimental section.

(b) Energy minimized structures of the two THBT units depending on the viewing direction, which was simulated by using the MM2 program (ChemBio3D, CambridgeSoft). 
The optical properties of the THBT polymer are shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2a, the absorption edge of the THBT polymer in chlorobenzene (CB) solution reached ca. 650 nm. Interestingly, the absorption spectrum of the THBT polymer film was red-shifted leading to the absorption edge of ca. 700 nm. This red shift was also evidenced from the colour difference between the THBT solution and the THBT film (see inset images in Fig. 2a). Here we note that the peaks at around 260 nm and 870 nm originated from CB (solvent) (see Fig. S1†). The red shift in the absorption spectra did also result in a noticeable change in the photoluminescence (PL) spectra, as observed from the photographs in the inset to Fig. 2b. Considering the red shift phenomenon for both the absorption and PL spectra, the THBT polymer chains are expected to undergo a pronounced interchain stacking in a solid state as typically observed for P3HT chains (Fig. S2†).8,39 The detailed analysis for the chain stacking is followed with the X-ray analysis below.

The inset photographs in (a) were taken in normal room light, whereas a UV light (365 nm) was exposed to the solution and film samples for the photographs in (b) (the film colour in (b) looks like a dark bluish purple because of the mixing of the strong excitation UV light, the weak dark red PL from the film and just the film colour). Note that the solvent (CB) peaks at around 260 nm and 870 nm are present in the absorption spectrum of the THBT solution in (a). 
To further investigate the interchain stacking in the THBT polymer films, the synchrotron radiation grazing incidence angle X-ray diffraction (GIXD) measurement was carried out for both THBT and P3HT films. As shown in Fig. 3a, the THBT film showed a similar 2D diffraction image to the P3HT film with obvious high order diffraction patterns (Debye rings – (200) and (300)). However, the diffraction intensity of the THBT film was relatively broadly distributed over wide azimuthal angles, compared to the intense diffraction spots in the OOP direction for the P3HT film. This indicates that the THBT polymer chains were not predominantly aligned in the OOP direction, but their “a–a” alignment (stacking) was scattered between the OOP and IP directions (see Fig. S2†). After extracting 1D GIXD profiles from the 2D images, we found that the (100) peaks of the THBT film in the OOP and IP directions were shifted towards lower and higher diffraction angles from the (100) peaks of the P3HT film, respectively. In addition, the (100) peak position (diffraction angle) of the THBT film was different between the OOP and IP directions. This result informs us that the THBT chain stacking is relatively less perfect than the P3HT chain stacking, which can be attributed to the tilted 3HT units by the presence of BT units, as discussed in Fig. 1b. From the (100) peaks in the 1D profiles the d-spacing of the THBT polymer chain stacking (in films) was calculated as 1.73 nm for the OOP direction and 1.62 nm for the IP direction. The discrepancy of ca. 0.11 nm between the OOP and IP directions may be due to the imperfectness of the THBT polymer chain stacking according to the chain alignment directions. Here we note that the d-spacing of the P3HT film was calculated as 1.68 nm for both the OOP and IP directions.

Next, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy of the THBT film was measured using the photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PEYS). As shown in Fig. 4, the photoelectron yield signal was detected at around 5.43 eV (see the part labelled ‘a’) and then the slope changed at around 5.65 eV (see the part labelled ‘b’). This result may imply that two different hole carrier sources exist, indicative of 3HT and BT units in the THBT polymer chains. Anyway, from the onset point (‘a’ part), the HOMO energy was calculated as ca. 5.7 eV after calibration.40,41 The absolute value of the HOMO energy (5.7 eV) of the THBT film is considerably higher than that of the P3HT film (4.9–5.1 eV),41 but slightly lower than that of the poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT) film (5.8–6.0 eV)42 that has the same BT unit in the polymer chain. Thus we find that the presence of the BT unit in the polymer chain greatly influenced the HOMO energy shift. Finally, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy of the THBT film was calculated as 3.9 eV from the HOMO energy (5.7 eV) and the optical band gap energy (1.8 eV) of the THBT film (see the absorption band edge in Fig. 2a). The LUMO energy (3.9 eV) of the THBT film is higher than that of the F8BT (3.5–3.7 eV)42 so that the THBT polymer is expected to act as an efficient electron acceptor when it makes a bulk heterojunction film with the P3HT polymer (as an electron donor).

The inset shows the flat energy band diagram of the THBT film (note that the vacuum level is not shown here). The band gap energy (Eg) was obtained from the absorption edge (700 nm) in Fig. 2a. 
To examine the electron mobility of the THBT film, electron-only devices were fabricated as shown in Fig. 5a. Considering the large energy barrier (1 eV) between the ITO electrode and the HOMO level of the THBT polymer, no hole injection is expected from the ITO electrode to the HOMO level of the THBT polymer film. In contrast, the electrons from the calcium (Ca) electrode can easily inject into the LUMO level of the THBT film. Hence the current density in Fig. 5b was considered as the result of electron transport through the THBT polymer layer. Here we note that the electron current density as a function of electric field was quite similar for the four different thicknesses of the THBT films, which implies no significant change in the nanostructure (crystallinity or orientation) in this thickness range. From the electron current density – electric field curves, the electron mobility was calculated using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model.42–44 Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 5c, the electron mobility of the THBT film was not so sensitive to the electric field, which can be ascribed to the low dielectric constant (see Fig. S3†) of the THBT film leading to a stable charge transport feature without strong electric field-induced dipole effects. As a consequence, the electron mobility obtained at zero electric field was in the range of ca. 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is a value approximately two-orders of magnitude higher than the electron mobility of the pristine F8BT polymer.42

Based on the above characteristics of the THBT polymer, we fabricated all-polymer solar cells with the BHJ films of P3HT and THBT. As illustrated in Fig. 6a, both normal-type and inverted-type all-polymer solar cells were fabricated in order to examine the possibility of the THBT polymer as an electron acceptor. In the case of the normal-type cells the photogenerated electrons were collected from the P3HT:THBT BHJ layers to the aluminium electrode, while the ITO electrode via the zinc oxide (ZnO) layer collects the photogenerated electrons in the case of inverted-type cells (Fig. 6b). First, we applied co-solvents (mixture of chlorobenzene (CB) and p-xylene (XL)) for the preparation of the P3HT:THBT blend solutions in order to briefly examine any influence of good (CB) and poor (XL) solvents on the performance of solar cells.

As shown in the light J–V curves (Fig. 7a and b), we find that the short circuit current density (JSC) of the normal-type P3HT:THBT solar cells was greatly improved by using the CB:XL co-solvents. Interestingly, the JSC improvement was made for all co-solvents used in this work irrespective of the XL content. The extent of the JSC improvement was about 350–400% depending on the XL content (see Fig. 7d and Table S1†). This improvement can be attributed to the change of BHJ nanomorphology in the P3HT:THBT films by the influence of the poor solvent (XL). After the initial quick JSC increase at the XL content of 10 vol%, a lower value was measured at the XL content of 40 vol%. This result indicates that the BHJ nanomorphology is sensitive to the content of poor solvent (XL). In contrast, the open circuit voltage (VOC) was unchanged as 0.86 V by using the co-solvent at the XL content of 10 wt% and was slightly reduced at the XL content of 20–40 vol%. Then the VOC value was recovered to 0.86 V at the XL content of 50 vol% (see Table S1†). However, the fill factor (FF) was initially improved by using the co-solvent (XL = 10 vol%) and then showed a minimum at the XL content of 30–40 vol% (Fig. 7e). Considering both the JSC and FF improvement and the unchanged VOC at the XL content of 10 vol%, we think that the formation of charge percolation paths is one of the limiting factors to affect the performance of the present solar cells. This consideration is certainly reflected from the result that the series resistance (RS) was greatly decreased when the co-solvents were used (Fig. 7c and f). As a consequence, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was enhanced by about 375–500% by using the co-solvents (Fig. 7e).

To investigate the nanomorphology change in the P3HT:THBT films by using co-solvents, we examined the surface morphology by employing atomic force microscopy. As shown in the 3D images (Fig. 8 left), the surface of the P3HT:THBT film prepared using only the CB solvent was relatively smoother than that of the P3HT:THBT films prepared using the co-solvents. In particular, we find from the phase images (Fig. 8 right) that the phase segregation became much finer for the P3HT:THBT films prepared using the co-solvents than for the P3HT:THBT film prepared using the CB solvent (XL = 0 vol%). Interestingly, however, the surface roughness increased from 1.3 nm (CB solvent) to 2.1 nm (co-solvent, XL = 10 vol%), which is the reverse of the phase segregation trend. Therefore, we can imagine that the surface of the P3HT:THBT films prepared using the co-solvents has a relatively larger surface area (i.e., narrower and taller surface morphology) than that of the P3HT:THBT film prepared using the CB solvent. This larger surface area of the P3HT:THBT films prepared using the co-solvents is considered to contribute to the enhanced JSC.29,45,46 In addition, the charge percolation pathways might be further secured upon formation of the finer morphology in the films due to the role of the poor solvent (XL) in the co-solvents.

The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness was 1.3 nm (a), 2.1 nm (b), 1.5 nm (c) and 1.4 nm (d). 
The change in nanomorphology was further examined by measuring the polymer chain stacking trend according to the composition of the co-solvents. As shown in the 2D GIXD images (Fig. 9a), the intensity distribution of the (100) diffraction spot from the OOP point toward azimuthal angles became much narrower for the P3HT:THBT film prepared using the co-solvents than for the same film prepared using the CB solvent. This indicates that the polymer chains are relatively well aligned in the OOP direction by using the co-solvents, which may roughly prove the finer phase segregation (see Fig. 8) in the case of the co-solvents than the CB solvent. Interestingly, as seen from the 1D GIXD images (Fig. 9b and c), the (100) peaks of the P3HT:THBT films in both OOP and IP directions were measured at the same (or nearly similar) diffraction angles as for the THBT film. This result implies that the polymer chain stacking is governed by the THBT polymer chains that are expected to considerably affect the P3HT chain stacking, because the P3HT polymers were sufficiently richer than the THBT polymers (note that the weight ratio of P3HT:THBT is 7:3). Here we find that the (100) peaks (for both OOP and IP directions) were marginally shifted toward the diffraction angles of P3HT when the co-solvents were used, which might be responsible for the improved device performance because of the better P3HT chain stacking in the presence of changed phase segregation by using the co-solvents.

Note that the XL contents are directly displayed on the images and the graphs. The broken lines are guidelines that represent the diffraction peak maxima of the P3HT film. 
Based on the results of the normal-type P3HT:THBT solar cells, we chose the co-solvent composition of XL = 10 vol% for the fabrication of the inverted-type P3HT:THBT solar cells (Fig. 10). As shown in Fig. 10a, the light J–V curves showed better photovoltaic curve shapes compared to the normal-type cells discussed in Fig. 7a. The lower the thickness of the P3HT:THBT layer, the higher the JSC value (see also Fig. 10d). This result may imply that the present BHJ layer (P3HT:THBT) still has high charge-blocking resistances (see also the dark J–V curves in Fig. 10c and the RS trend in Fig. 10f),18 even though the optimized co-solvent from the normal-type solar cells was used for these inverted-type solar cells. In terms of VOC, there was a slight fluctuation between 0.74 V and 0.81 V depending on the thickness (see Fig. 10b), but it was similar to the average value of the normal-type solar cells (Fig. 10d). Hence we confirm that the photovoltage in the present devices is indeed originated from the band offset between the HOMO energy of P3HT and the LUMO energy of THBT. As a result, the inverted-type solar cells with the P3HT:THBT layers exhibited 0.3% PCE as the maximum achieved in this work, which is higher than the PCE of the normal-type solar cells. This improvement can be attributed to the relatively lower RS values when compared between Fig. 7f and 10f, indicative of the relatively better alignment of THBT components towards the ZnO side in the case of the inverted-type solar cells compared to the enrichment of THBT components toward the Al electrode in the case of normal type solar cells.

Note that the co-solvent with XL = 10 vol% was used for the preparation of the P3HT:THBT solution. 
Conclusions
The THBT polymer, which contains the same molar ratio of p-type (3HT) and n-type (BT) units in the main chain, was synthesized via the Suzuki coupling reaction. The optical band gap energy of the THBT polymer was obtained as 1.8 eV from the absorption edge of the THBT film (700 nm), while its HOMO energy was measured as 5.7 eV from the photoelectron yield measurement. A strong chain stacking effect was observed from the noticeable shift in the optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra between the THBT solution and the THBT film. The chain stacking in the THBT film was also verified from the GIXD measurement, which revealed that the (100) diffraction peak of the THBT film was shifted towards lower angles for the OOP direction and towards higher angles for the IP direction compared to the (100) diffraction peaks of the P3HT film. The zero-field electron mobility of the THBT film was ca. 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 which is approximately two-orders of magnitude higher than the electron mobility of the well-studied F8BT polymer. Considering the energy band structure of the THBT film compared to the P3HT polymer, the THBT polymer was examined as an electron acceptor for all-polymer solar cells. We found that the solar cell performance was strongly dependent on the nanomorphology of the P3HT:THBT films when the different compositions of co-solvents were applied in the case of the normal-type solar cells. As expected from the energy band diagram, the VOC value was measured in the range between 0.74 V and 0.86 V. Comparing between the normal-type and inverted-type solar cells, the fill factor was higher for the inverted-type solar cells than the normal-type solar cells. As a consequence, the maximum PCE of the inverted-type P3HT:THBT solar cells reached 0.3%, which is higher than the PCE (0.2%) of the normal-type solar cells. Finally, we expect that further performance improvement could be possible through optimization of compositions and thermal annealing/doping conditions42,47,48 and the THBT polymer might be widely used as a n-type semiconducting polymer for a variety of applications such as organic field-effect transistors, organic memory devices, organic inverters, polymer light-emitting devices etc.
Experimental section
Materials and synthesis
2,5-Dibromo-3-hexylthiophene (2Br-3HT), 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-bis(boronic acid pinacol ester) (2B-BT), potassium carbonate (K2CO3), tetrakis(triphenylphophine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4), chlorobenzene (CB), p-xylene (XL), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and other miscellaneous chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. To synthesize the THBT polymer, 2B-BT (0.933 mmol) and 2Br-3HT (0.933 mmol) were dissolved in THF under nitrogen atmosphere using a round bottom three-necked flask. To this reactant solution, the K2CO3 (1.85 mmol) solution in deionized water was added dropwise. After stirring the mixture solution at room temperature for 20 min, Pd(PPh3)4 (0.055 mmol) was added to the solution and then the mixture solution was stirred at 85 °C for 72 h. To terminate the polymerization reaction, the solution mixture was cooled down to room temperature. Next, the final product solution was diluted with chlorobenzene, followed by extraction of the catalysts using deionized water. The organic phase in the separation process was precipitated into methanol and then washed with methanol repeatedly for complete removal of the remnant catalysts or other impurities. The purified solution was solidified via repeated centrifugation and/or filtration processes. Finally, the solid THBT polymer powder was dried in vacuum at 50 °C for more than 24 hours. The dried powder was a violet colour. The final synthesis yield was 34% because of accumulated loss in the course of repeated washing/purification. The weight-average molecular weight of the THBT polymer was ∼10 kDa, while the polydispersity index was 2.2. Using the synthesized THBT polymer, blend solutions of P3HT and THBT (P3HT:THBT = 7:3 by weight) were prepared at a solid concentration of ∼15 mg ml−1 using co-solvents (CB + XL) by varying the XL volume ratio up to XL = 50 vol%. Note that the blend solutions were subject to filtration with a 0.45 μm PTFE membrane filter (Whatman) before spin-coating.
Film and device fabrication
For the measurement of optical and photoelectronic properties, the THBT film (thickness = 15–20 nm) was coated on quartz substrates by spin-coating and was dried at 50 °C for 30 min. Prior to the fabrication of devices, indium-tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates (sheet resistance = 10 Ω □−1) were patterned to have 12 mm × 8 mm ITO stripes by employing photolithography/etching techniques. The patterned ITO-glass substrates were cleaned by wet (acetone and isopropyl alcohol) and dry (UV-ozone) processes. To fabricate the normal-type solar cells, the PEDOT:PSS layer (PH 500, HC Starck) was spin-coated on the cleaned ITO-glass substrates at 2500 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 230 °C for 15 min. Then the P3HT:THBT solutions were spun on the PEDOT:PSS layer at 1500 rpm, followed by soft-baking at 60 °C for 15 min. The P3HT:THBT film (thickness = 70 nm)-coated samples were loaded into a vacuum chamber that was equipped inside an argon-filled glove box system. After pumping the vacuum chamber down to a base pressure of ∼1 × 10−6 Torr, the LiF (∼1 nm) layer and the Al (∼80 nm) top electrodes were successively deposited by thermal evaporation processes. The completed devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:THBT/LiF/Al) were thermally annealed at 150 °C for 10 min in the same glove box. For the fabrication of the inverted type solar cells, zinc oxide (ZnO) precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, Aldrich, 99.9%, 21.95 mg) and ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH, Aldrich, 98%, 0.04 ml) in 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, Aldrich, 99.3%, 0.96 ml) under vigorous stirring for 2 h at 80 °C and stirred at room temperature before spin-coating. The prepared ZnO precursor solution was spun onto the cleaned ITO-glass substrates at 2000 rpm for 30 s, followed by thermal treatment at 200 °C for 15 min in air. On top of the ZnO layer that was coated on the ITO-glass substrates, the P3HT:THBT (7:3 by weight) was spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 30 s and soft-baked at 60 °C for 15 min. Next, the PEDOT:PSS layer (thickness = 50 nm) was deposited onto the P3HT:THBT layer using the PEDOT:PSS solution that was diluted with isopropyl alcohol, followed by soft-baking at the same conditions as for the fabrication of the normal-type solar cells. The P3HT:THBT film-coated samples were loaded into the same vacuum chamber used for the fabrication of the normal-type solar cells. Finally, silver (Ag, 60 nm) top electrodes were deposited on top of the P3HT:THBT layer at the similar base pressure for the fabrication of the normal-type solar cells. The completed inverted-type solar cells (ITO/ZnO/P3HT:THBT/PEDOT:PSS/Ag) were annealed inside the same glove box. The active area of all solar cells was 0.09 cm2. For the measurement of the electron mobility of the pristine THBT film, electron-only devices (ITO/THBT/Ca/Al) were fabricated by varying the thickness of the THBT layers. The thickness of Ca (calcium) and Al electrodes was 20 nm and 80 nm, respectively.
Measurement
The weight-average molecular weight was measured using a gel permeation chromatography (GPC, GPCV 2000, Waters). Chloroform was used as an eluent, while a polystyrene standard was employed for calibration. The optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra of the THBT polymer were measured using a UV-visible spectrometer (Optizen 2120+, Mecasys Co., Ltd) and fluorescence spectrometer (FS-2, Scinco), respectively. A photoelectron yield spectrometer (PEYS, AC-2, Hitachi High Tech.) was used for the measurement of the ionization potential of the THBT film. The nanostructure (diffraction patterns) of the polymer films was measured using a synchrotron radiation grazing incidence angle X-ray diffraction (GIXD) system (9A U-SAXS, Pohang Accelerator Laboratory, Korea). The X-ray wavelength was 0.112 nm, while the incidence angle was 0.10°. The surface morphology of the P3HT:THBT films was probed using an atomic force microscope (Nanoscope IIIa, Digital Instruments) that was operated in a tapping mode. The J–V characteristics of the devices were measured using a specialized solar cell measurement system equipped with an electrometer (Keithley 2400) and a solar simulator (100 mW cm−2, model 71582, Newport-Oriel). The electron mobility of the THBT film was obtained from the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement.43,44

 	Fig. 8  AFM images (left: 3D height mode; right: 2D phase mode) of the surfaces of the P3HT:THBT films fabricated on the same substrates for the normal-type solar cells: (a) XL = 0 vol% (CB solvent), (b) XL = 10 vol% (co-solvent), (c) XL = 30 vol% (co-solvent), (d) XL = 50 vol% (co-solvent). The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness was 1.3 nm (a), 2.1 nm (b), 1.5 nm (c) and 1.4 nm (d).	 

 	Fig. 9  (a) 2D GIXD images and (b and c) 1D GIXD profiles for the P3HT:THBT films fabricated on the same substrates as for the normal-type solar cells. Note that the XL contents are directly displayed on the images and the graphs. The broken lines are guidelines that represent the diffraction peak maxima of the P3HT film.	 

 	Fig. 10  Performances of the inverted-type P3HT:THBT solar cells: (a) light J–V curves (linear scale), (b) light J–V curves (semi-logarithmic scale), (c) dark J–V curves (selected), (d–f) JSC, VOC, FF, PCE and RS as a function of the P3HT:THBT thickness. Note that the co-solvent with XL = 10 vol% was used for the preparation of the P3HT:THBT solution.
