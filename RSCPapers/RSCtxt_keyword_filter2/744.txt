    , Accepted 10th March 2015First published on 16th March 2015AbstractMolecular and supramolecular properties play key roles in the optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performances of organic materials. In the present work, we show how small changes in the molecular structure affect such properties, which in turn control the intrinsic and fundamental properties such as the p/n-polarity of organic semiconductors in bulk-heterojunction solar cells. Herein, we designed and synthesized two acceptor–donor–acceptor type semiconducting thiophene oligomers end-functionalized with oxazolone/isoxazolone derivatives (OT1 and OT2 respectively). The HOMO–LUMO energy levels of both derivatives were found to be positioned in such a way that they can act as electron acceptors to P3HT and electron donors to PCBM. However, OT1 functions as a donor (with PCBM) and OT2 as an acceptor (with P3HT) in BHJ photovoltaic cells, and their reverse roles results in either no or poor performance of the cells. Detailed studies using UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, time-correlated single photon counting, UV-photoelectron spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, X-ray diffraction, and thermal gravimetric analysis proved that both molecular and supramolecular properties contributed equally but in a contrasting manner to the abovementioned observation. The obtained results were further validated by flash-photolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity studies which showed an excellent correlation between the structure, property, and device performances of the materials.
Introduction
Organic solar cells have attracted significant scientific interest because of their easy fabrication using low cost solution processing techniques, and compatibility with light weight, large area, flexible substrates.1–5 A bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) is the most commonly used device configuration for organic solar cells, which consists of interpenetrating, bi-continuous networks of donors and acceptors, and offers the maximum internal interfacial area for efficient charge separation.6–8 Thiophene-based polymers and fullerene-based small molecules are typical examples of donors and acceptors, respectively, used in organic solar cells.9–12 It is well established that molecular properties of polymers such as absorption characteristics, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels etc. play important roles in the device performances. Such properties could be easily controlled by suitable structural changes in the conjugated backbone.13–17 In addition to the molecular properties, supramolecular interactions among and between donor polymers and fullerene acceptors also play a key role in the functionality and device performances of a bulk-heterojunction assembly.18–21 The rational choice of solvents, solvent additives and processing conditions was found to affect the supramolecular interactions, and hence the optoelectronic properties and device performances significantly.22–27 In this context, we have reported the switching of charge carrier transport properties (from n-type to ambipolar) of a bithiazole–benzothiadiazole-based polymer through supra-molecular control over structural organization induced by a solvent additive.28 Furthermore, the 12-fold enhancement of charge carrier mobility was demonstrated for the same polymer through the self-assembly on gold nanoparticles.29
Recently, small molecule/oligomer based organic semi-conductors gained importance over their polymer counterparts for photovoltaic applications.30–35 When compared to polymers, oligomers are relatively easy to synthesize in high purity, possess well-defined structures, and show no batch-to-batch variations. Moreover, recent reports suggest that a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼10% has been achieved in solution processed small molecules.36–38 Due to these advantages and recent findings, oligomers are now considered as a potential replacement for polymers in solution processed organic solar cells. However, dependence on supramolecular interactions is more pronounced in oligomers when compared to that in polymers, which demands careful molecular designing and rational fabrication techniques for obtaining optimum performances. This effect could be attributed to the limited pathways available for oligomers for charge transport; unlike polymers, where inter- and intra-polymer routes are available for charge transport,39,40 oligomers depend exclusively on intermolecular routes. This may result in significant variations in optoelectronic properties of comparable oligomers even when the structural differences between them are minimal. In this context, Yagai et al. have reported the effect of regioisomerism on the optoelectronic properties of hydrogen bonding naphthalene chromophores.41 The same group has reported a similar effect on the solid state properties and bulk heterojunction solar cell performance of indolocarbazoles end-capped with diketopyrrolopyrroles also.42 Herein, we report an excellent example illustrating the effect of small structural changes on the molecular and supramolecular properties of conjugated oligomers, which in turn affect their p/n-polarity and photovoltaic performance in a bulk-hetero-junction solar cell. We have designed and synthesized two thiophene oligomers consisting of seven thiophene rings connected with each other at 2,5-positions, and end-functionalized with oxazolone (OT1) or isoxazolone (OT2) derivatives (Scheme 1). Oxazolone and isoxazolone are positional isomers which differ in the respective positions of nitrogen atoms and the phenyl group on the 5-membered heterocyclic ring. Both of them are good electron acceptors because of the presence of electronegative heteroatoms and an electron withdrawing carbonyl group in conjugation. All thiophenes in OT1 and OT2, except the middle one, are attached with n-hexyl chains for solution processability.

Experimental
Materials
All chemicals for synthesis were purchased either from local suppliers or from Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, or TCI. Air- and water-sensitive synthetic steps were performed in an argon atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Baytron P VP AI 4083) and Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates (<15 Ω square−1) were purchased from H. C. Stark and Sanyo Shinku Corp., respectively. [6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and regio-regular poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) were purchased from Frontier Carbon Inc. and Aldrich respectively.
Measurements
Melting points were determined using a Mel-Temp-II melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a 600 MHz Bruker Avance DRX-600 Spectrometer and a DPX 500 MHz spectrometer. All the chemical shifts were referenced to (CH3)4Si (TMS; δ = 0 ppm) for 1H or residual CHCl3 (δ = 77 ppm) for 13C. High-resolution LCMS-TOF and MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded on a KRATOS ANALYTICAL SHIMADZU mass spectrometer using α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid as the matrix.

Absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. 
Electronic absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3101 spectrophotometer using quartz cuvettes with 1 cm path length. Fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Fluorolog HORIBA JOBINYVON.


Fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime. 
Fluorescence quantum yields were determined relative to standard compounds (rhodamine B in ethanol; ϕf = 0.5) using optically matching solutions. Fluorescence lifetimes were measured using an IBH FluoroCube time correlated picosecond single photon counting (TCSPC) system. Samples were excited using a pulsed diode laser (<100 ps pulse duration) at a wavelength of 375 nm (NanoLED-11) with a repetition rate of 1 MHz.


UV photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS). 
PYS measurements were performed on a Sumitomo Heavy Industry Co. PCR-202. For this measurement, thin films of the oligomers were spin-cast on an ITO-coated glass surface from chlorobenzene solution. The solvent was completely removed under vacuum before mounting onto the spectrometer. Photoelectrons emitted from the films were detected after illuminating the film with UV radiation. By increasing the photon energy at an interval of 0.1 eV, the photoelectron counts were measured.


Density Functional Theory (DFT). 
For obtaining energy minimized structures of the molecules, DFT calculations were performed using Gaussian 09.43 The B3LYP functions with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set were used. For simplicity, the n-hexyl side chains were replaced by methyl groups.


X-ray diffraction.

Thermogravimetry analysis. 
Thermal gravimetric analysis was carried out using a Perkin Elmer STA 6000 simultaneous thermal analyzer. Platinum pans were used for the measurement and as reference samples. The analysis was conducted between 50 and 600 °C at 10 °C min−1 under dry N2.


Flash-photolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity (FP-TRMC)44. 
Transient conductivity was measured by the FP-TRMC technique. A resonant cavity was used to obtain a high degree of sensitivity in the measurement. The resonant frequency and the microwave power were set at ∼9.1 GHz and 3 mW, respectively, so that the electric field of the microwave was sufficiently small not to disturb the motion of charge carriers. The value of conductivity is converted to the product of the quantum yield (ϕ) and the sum of charge carrier mobilities (∑μ), by the following equation. (1)where e, A, I0, Flight, ΔPr, and Pr are the unit charge of a single electron, a sensitivity factor [(S m−1)−1], incident photon density of the excitation laser (photons per m2), a correction (or filling) factor (m−1), a change in reflected microwave power, and a power of reflected microwave, respectively. The change in conductivity is equivalent to ΔPr/(APr). 500 nm laser light with a photon density of 6.4 × 1015 photons per cm2 was used as the excitation source. The sample was set at the highest electric field in a resonant cavity. The experiments were carried out at room temperature.


Photovoltaic device fabrication. 
The ITO coated glass was first cleaned by ultrasonication with a series of solvents from diluted detergent, water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, dried under an air stream and UV/ozone treated for 20 min. A ZnO layer was deposited on the ITO surface by using a reported sol–gel method (0.1 g mL−1 zinc acetate dihydrate and 0.028 g mL−1 ethanolamine in 2-methoxyethanol). The ZnO solution was spin-coated and annealed at 200 °C for 30 min. A hot solution (80 °C) of the oligomer and PCBM or P3HT mixture was spin-coated on top of the ZnO layer from different solvents in a nitrogen atmosphere at 25 °C. The thickness of the active layer was controlled by rotation speed and measured using a surface profiler (ULVAC model Dektak 150). After spin coating, the photoactive layer was transferred to an ultra-high vacuum chamber and waited at least for 30 min to remove the residual solvent additive. On top of the active layer 10 nm MoOx and 100 nm Ag layers were sequentially deposited using a shadow mask by thermal evaporation. The final device configuration was ITO (120–160 nm)/ZnO (30 nm)/BHJ active layer/MoOx (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm) with an active area of 7.1 mm2. Current–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a source-measure unit (ADCMT Corp., 6241A) under AM 1.5 G solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun, monitored by a calibrated standard cell, Bunko Keiki SM-250KD) from a 300 W solar simulator (SAN-EI Corp., XES-301S).

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of oligothiophene derivatives

OT1 and OT2 were synthesized according to methods reported in the literature as shown in Scheme 2. Suzuki coupling followed by dibromination reactions were employed successively to achieve thiophene oligomers with seven thiophene units. It was then functionalized with aldehyde groups at both ends by treating with a Vilsmeier reagent. Incorporation of oxazolone/isoxazolone acceptors into the thiophene backbone was carried out by the Knoevenagel condensation method. Both derivatives were obtained in good yields, and characterized by using various analytical techniques such as 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. They were found to be soluble in common organic solvents such as toluene, CHCl3, chlorobenzene, THF, DMF etc.

Photophysical properties in the solution state
The UV-vis absorption and fluorescence properties of OT1 and OT2 were studied in solvents such as cyclohexane, toluene, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at a concentration of 1 × 10−5 M (Fig. 1), and the details are summarized in Table 1. The solvent polarity increases from cyclohexane to DMF. In general, both molecules exhibited an intense broad absorption in the UV-visible region, which is typically observed for conjugated thiophene oligomers. The most intense band observed in the visible region could be attributed to the π–π* transition. Although the trend is not regular with the solvent polarity, the absorption maximum of both molecules was fairly sensitive to the solvent polarity indicating that the ground state of the molecules is slightly polarized. This could be attributed to the conjugation of electron donating thiophenes with electron withdrawing oxazolone/isoxazolone derivatives, resulting in the localization of electron clouds towards the latter. This was evident from the DFT results, which showed that HOMO is localized on the thiophene backbone, whereas the LUMO is biased towards the oxazolone/isoxazolone acceptors (see the ESI,† Fig. S1). It should be noted that the absorption maximum of OT2 is about 20 nm red-shifted, and the extinction coefficient is almost double in any solvent when compared to that of OT1 in the same solvent. Both these observations indicate that the isoxazolone derivative is a stronger acceptor than the oxazolone derivative, leading to the red-shifted absorption peak of the latter.

Emission spectra were also recorded in cyclohexane, toluene, THF, and DMF. However, in contrast to absorption, fluorescence showed high sensitivity towards the solvent polarity, as evident from the significant red-shift of the emission maximum with increasing solvent polarity. This observation revealed that the excited states of both molecules are highly polar (compared to the ground state) in nature. Both molecules were found to be non-emissive in DMF, which is the highest polar solvent among the four. In the other three solvents, OT1 exhibited good emission quantum yields, whereas OT2 was poorly emissive. Similarly, the average fluorescence lifetime was higher for OT1 than that for OT2 (see the ESI,† Fig. S2). Similar to the absorption properties, OT2 showed more red-shift than OT1 in the same solvents. Moreover, OT2 exhibited an emission maximum shift of 106 nm when going from cyclohexane to THF, whereas OT1 showed a shift of only 86 nm under similar conditions. These observations reiterate that the isoxazolone derivative is a stronger acceptor than the oxazolone derivative. OT1 showed the decrease in fluorescence quantum yield as well as lifetime (negligible in the case of cyclohexane and toluene solutions) with an increase in solvent polarity which is expected for donor–acceptor systems exhibiting charge transfer. However, such trends were not clear in OT2 due to poor emission.
HOMO–LUMO levels and optical band-gap
The HOMO levels of the oligomers were measured in the film state as ionization threshold energies using ultraviolet photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS, Fig. 2a and b). PYS measurements showed that the HOMO energy levels of OT1 and OT2 were at −5.09 and −5.32 eV, respectively. The LUMO levels were obtained by adding the value of the HOMO to the optical band gap (Eoptg), which is obtained from the onset of UV-vis absorption of the oligomers in the film state (details of film state absorption are given in the following section). The optical band gap of OT1 and OT2 was found to be 1.65 and 1.67 eV, respectively. Accordingly, the LUMO levels were found to be −3.44 and −3.65 eV for OT1 and OT2, respectively. The deeper HOMO and LUMO values for OT2 reiterate better delocalization of π-electrons due to the presence of a stronger electron withdrawing isoxazolone derivative in it. The comparison of the HOMO and LUMO of the oligomers with those of P3HT (a standard donor material; HOMO = −4.9 eV, LUMO = −2.7 eV)46 and PCBM (a standard acceptor material; HOMO = −6.0 eV, LUMO = −4.2 eV,10 where the latter is varied by the method and calibration equation47) is shown in Fig. 2c. It shows that the HOMO and LUMO levels of the oligomers are lower than the corresponding energy levels of P3HT, whereas those are higher than the corresponding energy levels of PCBM. Furthermore, the energy offset between the LUMOs of oligomers and P3HT/PCBM is high enough for exciton splitting at the interfaces. Hence, it could be assumed that both oligomers can act as donors to PCBM and acceptors to P3HT in a photovoltaic cell.

Photovoltaic properties
Though the electrochemical properties revealed that both OT1 and OT2 can act as donors to PCBM and acceptors to P3HT, the p/n-polarity of a material in BHJ solar cells depends on not only the ability to donate/accept electrons but also the ability to transport holes/electrons. To check the p/n-polarity of OT1 and OT2 in a photovoltaic cell, bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells were fabricated in the presence of P3HT or PCBM. An inverted device structure48,49 consisting of ITO/ZnO/BHJ/MoOx/Ag was used for this analysis. The active layer consisting of OT1:P3HT, OT1:PCBM, OT2:P3HT, or OT2:PCBM in a 1:1 weight ratio was prepared from chlorobenzene solution. The OT1:P3HT solar cell showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of only 0.07% (short circuit current density: JSC = 0.69 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage: VOC = 0.36 V, fill factor: FF = 0.28, Fig. S3, ESI†). On the other hand, the OT1:PCBM cell exhibited a PCE of 0.75% (JSC = 3.25 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.62 V, FF = 0.37). Under identical conditions, OT2:P3HT exhibited an efficiency of 0.19% (JSC = 0.72 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.71 V, FF = 0.36), whereas OT2:PCBM exhibited no diode characteristics. J–V curves of the OT1:PCBM and OT2:P3HT cells are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. The atomic force microscopy images of the corresponding films are shown in the insets.

Though the oligomers showed relatively low photoconversion efficiencies, the observed difference in the p/n-polarity of OT1 and OT2 in the presence of P3HT/PCBM was noteworthy. It is clear that OT1 has showed more p-type characteristics, whereas OT2 exhibited n-type characteristics. This could be partially explained by the difference in the relative HOMO–LUMO levels of the molecules. The shallower HOMO and LUMO of OT1 (compared to OT2) provide better driving force for it to donate electrons and make it function as a donor. Similarly, deeper HOMO and LUMO of OT2 are suitable for accepting electrons and make it function as an acceptor. The effect of energy offset difference between the oligomers is particularly visible when they are blended with P3HT, i.e., OT2, which has the higher energy offset showed better photoconversion efficiency than OT1. However, such logics could not explain the observed difference in photoconversion efficiency when the oligomers are blended with PCBM. OT1 showed an efficiency of 0.75% in the presence of PCBM, whereas OT2 exhibited no diode characteristics under identical conditions.
Energy minimized structure
It is well known that the supramolecular interactions and packing of the molecules in the film state play a very important role in the charge carrier generation, charge carrier transport and photovoltaic properties.41,42,50–53 Planarity of the conjugated backbone is a key factor that decides the packing ability of conjugated oligomers. In order to get an insight into the planarity of the molecules, the energy minimized structures of the oligomers were calculated using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level (Fig. 4). The conjugated thiophene backbones of both molecules looked similar, and were relatively planar. The major difference between the molecules was seen at the ends. The oxazolone derivative of OT1 was found to be coplanar with the thiophene backbone, whereas, the phenyl group on the isoxazolone derivative in OT2 was found to be out of plane. The dihedral angle between the isoxazolone and the attached phenyl ring in OT2 was about 42.75°. The out of plane geometry of the phenyl ring in OT2 could have a detrimental effect on the packing of the oligomers in the film state.
 Fig. 4  Energy minimized structures of the oligomers obtained by DFT calculation. 
Film state absorption properties
The steady state photoabsorption spectra of both oligomers were recorded in the film state by spin-casting from chlorobenzene (1 wt%) solution (Fig. 5). For comparison, the corresponding absorption in the solution state in chlorobenzene was also recorded. OT1 in chlorobenzene solution exhibits an absorption maximum at 513 nm, which was red-shifted to 621 nm in the film state. On the other hand, the absorption maximum of OT2 was at 540 nm in the solution state and 609 nm in the film state. As explained in the previous section, the higher relative red-shift of the absorption maximum for OT2 than that for OT1 in the same solvents could be attributed to the better electron accepting ability of the isoxazolone derivative. The red-shift exhibited by both molecules when going from the solution to film state indicates the planarization of the conjugated backbone. However, OT1 and OT2 exhibited a significant difference in this aspect; the relative red-shift was higher for OT1 (Δλ = 108 nm) when compared to that for OT2 (Δλ = 69 nm). Moreover, an additional shoulder band also appeared for OT1 at around 683 nm, which is absent in the case of OT2. These observations correlate well with the results obtained from DFT calculations. OT1 with a coplanar oxazolone acceptor is able to form highly ordered aggregates through supramolecular interactions, mainly π–π stacking, which is evident from the vibronic shoulder seen at 683 nm. Such ordering further improves the planarity of the conjugated backbone and electronic communication between the molecules leading to the significant red-shift in the film state. On the other hand, OT2 with an out-of-plane isoxazolone acceptor is unable to form well-ordered aggregates because of weaker π–π stacking, which is reflected from the absence of vibronic features as well as a lesser red-shift in the film state absorption.

Solid state packing and thermal stability
In order to get a better insight into the supramolecular packing, we have carried out wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) studies in the self-assembled powder state (Fig. 6a). OT1 showed sharp and intense WAXS peaks, which indicates that the molecules are relatively ordered in the aggregated state. The sharp reflection at 2θ = 5.42° corresponds to 16.3 Å, which is well correlated with the lamellar distance. The mean size of the OT1 crystallites was estimated to be 21 nm using Scherrer's relation.54 On the other hand, OT2 exhibited less intense and broad peaks, particularly in the higher angle region (corresponding to intermolecular stacking distances). The reflection at 2θ = 5.86° corresponds to 15.1 Å, which is slightly lower than the lamellar distance. The intensity of this peak is six fold less when compared to that of the corresponding peak of OT1. Since the integrated intensity is directly proportional to the volume of nanodomains, consequently, the crystallinity of OT2 is less than that of OT1. Hence it could be confirmed that the positional isomerism exhibited by the acceptors significantly affects the supramolecular interactions, which is reflected in the bulk packing. Relatively disordered packing in OT2 may provide higher free volume for the alkyl chains thus reducing the spacing between the oligomers through slight intercalation of the alkyl chains. The thermal stability of the molecules was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), which was conducted at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in the presence of nitrogen (Fig. 6b). The temperature at which OT1 loses 5% of its weight (T5 value) was 348 °C while that at which OT2 loses its weight was 261 °C. Comparison of the T5 values of OT1 and OT2 reveals that OT1 is thermally more stable than OT2, which reiterates the higher crystallinity in the former. Based on these observations, the supramolecular packing in the oligomers could be schematically represented as shown in Fig. 7.

Blend with P3HT and PCBM
In an attempt to study the effect of PCBM and P3HT on the film state packing of OT1 and OT2, a 1:1 (w/w) mixture of these compounds with PCBM/P3HT were prepared in chlorobenzene and the photoabsorbance of the blend films was recorded (Fig. 8). The absorption maximum (λmax) of the OT1/P3HT blend film was observed at 606 nm while that of OT1/PCBM was at 612 nm. It should be noted that the vibronic features of the OT1 absorption were intact even in the blend state which indicates that the supramolecular interactions in OT1 is strong enough and remains stable upon addition of P3HT or PCBM. The film state absorbance of OT2 with P3HT and PCBM was measured under identical conditions. The absorption maximum of the OT2/P3HT blend film was at 607 nm, while that of OT2/PCBM was at 563 nm. It could be assumed that the spherically shaped PCBM completely destroys the packing in OT2 resulting in the blue-shift of the absorption maximum by 48 nm when compared to the pristine film. This further proves that the supramolecular interactions in OT2 are weaker. However, no such blue-shift was observed upon addition of P3HT, but some vibrational features were observed between 500 and 700 nm in the spectrum. The vibrational features could be attributed to the crystallite formation of P3HT,55 which may not interfere with the stacking of OT2. In other words, OT2 molecules might be pushed away during the formation of P3HT crystallites in the film development process, resulting in the pure OT2 domains.

Photoconductivity analysis
Photoconductivity measurements using flash-photolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity (FP-TRMC) is an excellent method to understand the charge carrier generation and transport dynamics of organic semiconducting materials.41,42,50–53,56 FP-TRMC is an electrode-less technique, which gives information about the short-range (nanometer scale) intrinsic charge carrier transport properties, which could be quantified in terms of ϕ∑μ values where ϕ is the charge carrier generation quantum yield obtained upon excitation with laser light and ∑μ is the sum of charge carrier mobilities, i.e., the sum of electron and hole mobilities (μe and μh, respectively). Photoconductivity transients obtained from FP-TRMC usually reflect the molecular as well as supramolecular properties, and hence are helpful for correlating the structure, property, and device performance relationship.13,28,42,50,51 The photoconductivity transients of OT1 and OT2, and their blends with P3HT and PCBM in the film state are shown in Fig. 9. Both OT1 and OT2 exhibited comparable values of ϕ∑μmax (1.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively) upon excitation using a 500 nm laser. ϕ∑μmax of OT1 showed a 5-fold enhancement in the presence of P3HT (1:1 w/w) and a 24-fold increase in the presence of PCBM (1:1 w/w). This is consistent with JSC of the relevant OPV devices (OT1:P3HT – 0.69 mA cm−2 and OT1:PCBM – 3.25 mA cm−2). Significant enhancement of the photoconductivity in the presence of PCBM reiterated the p-type characteristics of OT1. On the other hand, under identical conditions, ϕ∑μmax of OT2 increased by only 4 times in the presence of PCBM, and that of 25 times upon the addition of P3HT. This gave a further proof for the n-type characteristics of OT2. We emphasize again that the FP-TRMC results are in line with the OPV devices (OT2:PCBM showed no diode output and OT2:P3HT – 0.72 mA cm−2).
 Fig. 9  TRMC transients of OT1 and OT2 films and their blends (1:1 w/w) with PCBM and P3HT drop-cast from chlorobenzene solution. 
From the above studies, it is evident that the observed p/n-polarity of OT1 and OT2 in the bulk heterojunction assembly with P3HT/PCBM could be correlated with their molecular as well supramolecular properties. The n-polarity of the molecules in the presence of P3HT could be mainly correlated with the relative HOMO–LUMO levels, which is a molecular property. However, the supramolecular effect is not completely ruled out either. In the presence of crystalline polymeric materials such as P3HT, amorphous OT2 has an advantage over crystalline OT1 due to effective nanoscale miscibility. This effect might help the former to perform well in the presence of P3HT. On the other hand, the p-polarity exhibited by the molecules could be exclusively dependent on the supramolecular interactions. OT1 with a planar geometry formed stable assembly, whereas OT2 containing non-planar end-groups formed weak assembly. As a result, the former assembly remained stable upon addition of spherically shaped PCBM and functioned as an efficient p-type material in the presence of PCBM. On the other hand, OT2 got dis-assembled in the presence of PCBM, and hence failed to function as a p-type material.
Though these molecules illustrate an interesting example of the effect of the molecular structure on the supramolecular properties and thereby their p/n-polarity in bulk-heterojunction solar cells, the device performance fell short of expectation. This could be mainly attributed to the low value of JSC, probably due to the lack of continuity in the oligomer phase resulting in hindered charge transport. As mentioned earlier, unlike polymers, oligomers exclusively depend on the intermolecular route for charge transport. Lack of continuity is detrimental to efficient charge carrier transport to the electrodes and results in poor device performances. This may also result in imbalanced charge carrier mobility and lowers the FF value.
Conclusions
In summary, two thiophene oligomers with an acceptor–donor–acceptor structure consisting of oxazolone/isoxazolone derivatives as acceptors have been designed and synthesized. The isoxazolone derivative (OT2) was found to be a stronger electron-withdrawing unit than the oxazolone derivative (OT1), as evident from the photoabsorption and emission spectroscopy. Importantly, we have shown that the positional isomerism had a significant effect on the supramolecular properties. The suitable HOMO–LUMO energy levels of OT2 favored it to act as a better n-type material in the presence of P3HT in bulk-heterojunction solar cells. On the other hand, better supramolecular interaction in OT1 helped it to form a stable bicontinuous network with PCBM, and hence acted as a p-type material, which is consistent with the FP-TRMC evaluations. Though the dependence of molecular and supramolecular properties on device performances is well established, this work clearly illustrates how delicate changes in the basic molecular structure affect the ordering and p/n-polarity of organic semiconducting materials in bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic cells.
