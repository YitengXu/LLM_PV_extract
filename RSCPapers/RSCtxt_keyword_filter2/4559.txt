    , Accepted 20th January 2014First published on 21st January 2014AbstractThree novel random conjugated terpolymers were designed and synthesized by copolymerizing a benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) donor with an electron-deficient diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (DPP) unit and a thiophene-vinylene-dithienyl-benzothiadiazole (TVDTBT) side group into a polymer backbone. By tuning the ratio of DPP and TVDTBT in the terpolymers, the optical properties and energy levels of these random terpolymers could be rationally controlled. As a result, the terpolymers exhibited a very broad absorption range of 300–900 nm with a high absorption coefficient and deep HOMO energy levels. Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells fabricated from P3 and PC61BM exhibited a promising power conversion efficiency of 5.29% without any processing additives.
Introduction
In the past few years, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant attention due to their potential application in low-cost, light-weight, large-area, and flexible photovoltaic devices.1–3 Recently, remarkable progress has been made in this field, and the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of PSCs have surpassed 10% as a result of the development of new conjugated polymers and improvements in the control over the morphologies of bicontinuous interpenetrating electron donor/acceptor nanoscale networks.4,5 However, further improvements in many factors are needed for higher performance.6–14
The PCE of a PSC is the product of its short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). Unfortunately, with a large proportion of polymers it is difficult to produce PCE over 6% due to the imbalance between Jsc and Voc.15,16 To get a high Jsc and Voc simultaneously, one of the most effective approaches is the development of low band-gap conjugated polymers with broad absorption spectra as well as high absorption coefficients and suitable energy levels that match those of the electron acceptor (fullerene derivatives).17,18 Generally, most low band gap polymers exhibit a main absorption above 600 nm because of the strong intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) that occurs between donor and acceptor, but there is also a weak absorption between 400–600 nm. This decreases the number of absorbed photons in the visible region and in turn limits the photocurrent.19,20 To obtain a broad and strong absorption across the whole visible to near-infrared band, a promising approach is to develop random terpolymers by copolymerizing two different electron-deficient units with one electron-rich unit to broaden the absorption of the solar spectrum.21,22 Therefore, strategies for the design and synthesis of ideal terpolymers with a broad absorption and suitable HOMO energy levels are worth exploring.
Among the high performance D–A polymer materials for PSCs, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) has been widely investigated and used as an electron-donating building-block, which can be attributed to its symmetric and planar conjugated structure.23–25 Additionally, diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (DPP) has also been successfully used as a acceptor unit for high-performance PSCs, because most DPP-based D–A polymers exhibit a strong ICT absorption that reaches 900 nm due to the presence of electron-deficient lactam rings.26–28This series of polymers show a very weak absorption at 300–600 nm with relatively high HOMO energy levels. In the work of several research groups and our own previous studies, it has been demonstrated that polymers containing a dithienylbenzodiathiazole (DTBT) side-group possessed an obvious strong absorption at 300–600 nm, but low HOMO energy levels due to a certain amount of distortion of the polymer backbone.29–36 Based on the above consideration, we introduced a DTBT-containing side-group into some random terpolymers, and synthesized three novel terpolymers P1, P2, and P3 (Scheme 1). These polymers exhibited very broad absorption ranges between 300–900 nm and low HOMO energy levels of −5.29 eV to −5.47 eV. As a result, the PSC device based on P3 exhibited a high PCE of 5.29% (Jsc = 14.47 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.78 eV, FF = 0.48) without any processing additives.

Experimental
Materials and methods
2,6-Di(trimethylstin)-4,8-di((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (M1) and 2,5-diethylhexyl-3,6-bis(5-bromothiophene-2-yl)pyrrolo-[3,4-c]-pyrrole-1,4-dione (M2) were purchased from Derthon Optoelectronic Materials Science Technology Co. Ltd (Shenzhen, China) and were used without further purification. All other chemicals were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were dried and distilled from sodium/benzophenone and used directly. All other solvents and chemicals used in this work were analytical grade and used without further purification. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectra were measured with a Bruker AVANCE 400 spectrometer. The UV-Visible absorption spectra of the polymers were measured with a Perkin-Elmer Lamada 25 UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer. The average molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymers were determined using Waters 1515 gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis with THF as eluent and polystyrene as a standard. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were conducted on a Netzsch TG 209 analyzer under nitrogen at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was made on a TA DSC Q10 instrument at a scan rate of 20 °C min−1. Electrochemical redox potentials were obtained by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a three-electrode configuration and an electrochemistry workstation (Zahner Zennium) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. CV was conducted on an electrochemistry workstation with a thin polymer film on a Pt plate as the working electrode, a Pt slice as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in anhydrous acetonitrile solution. All of the AFM measurements were performed with a Digital Instruments Enviro Scope in tapping mode.
Polymer solar cell fabrication
The structure of the solar cells was ITO/MoO3(20 nm)/polymer:PC61BM(∼100 nm)/LiF(0.5 nm)/Al(100 nm). The PSC devices were fabricated with indium oxide (ITO) glass as a positive electrode and LiF/Al as a negative electrode. The ITO glass was pre-cleaned and then modified with a thin layer of MoO3, which was deposited onto the ITO surface by vacuum evaporation under a pressure of 7 × 10−4 Pa. The photosensitive layer was prepared by spin-coating a blended solution of polymer and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) in 1-chlorobenzene (CB) onto the surface of the ITO/MoO3 substrate. The LiF/Al cathode was then deposited onto the polymer layer using vacuum evaporation under a pressure of 5 × 10−4 Pa. The accurate area of each device was 5.7 mm2, as defined by the overlap of the ITO and metal electrode. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2602 Source Meter under 100 mW cm−2 irradiation by a 500 W Xe lamp equipped with a global AM 1.5 filter for solar spectrum simulation. The incident light intensity was calibrated using a standard Si solar cell. The measurements for the monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) were performed using a Zolix DCS300PA Data acquisition system.
Procedure for the synthesis of the monomers and polymers
The synthetic routes for the monomers and polymers are shown in Scheme 1. The monomer, 4-(4-hexyl-2-thienyl)-7-[2-(2,5-dibromo-3-thienyl-vinyl)-4-hexyl-2-thienyl]-2,1,3-benzodiathiazole (M3) was synthesized according to the literature procedure.29

Synthesis of P1. 
To a 25 mL three-neck round bottom flask, M1 (102.7 mg, 0.133 mmol), M2 (68.3 mg, 0.100 mmol), M3 (24.5 mg, 0.033 mmol), and dry toluene (10 mL) were added. The mixture was deoxygenated with nitrogen for 30 min. Pd(PPh3)4 (15.4 mg, 0.013 mmol) was then added under nitrogen and the reaction mixture was reacted for 48 h at 110 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into 100 mL of methanol. The resulting blue precipitate was collected by filtration. The product was purified by washing with methanol and hexane in a Soxhlet extractor for 24 h. It was extracted with hot chloroform in an extractor over 24 h. After removing the solvent, a blue solid was collected (98.8 mg, 75.6%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 9.21–9.15 (br), 7.99–6.94 (br), 4.32–4.08 (br), 2.74–2.68 (br), 2.44–0.90 (br). Mn = 14.3 kg mol−1, PDI = 1.92.


Synthesis of P2. 
Using a procedure similar to that described above for P1, a mixture of M1 (102.7 mg, 0.133 mmol), M2 (45.4 mg, 0.067 mmol), M3 (48.9 mg, 0.067 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (15.4 mg, 0.013 mmol) in dry toluene (10 mL) was polymerized to give a blue-red solid (95.6 mg, 72.3%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 9.21–9.15 (br), 7.99–6.94 (br), 4.32–4.08 (br), 2.74–2.68 (br), 2.44–0.90 (br). Mn = 17.1 kg mol−1, PDI = 1.85.


Synthesis of P3. 
Using a procedure similar to that described above for P1, a mixture of M1 (102.7 mg, 0.133 mmol), M2 (22.7 mg, 0.033 mmol) M3 (73.2 mg, 0.100 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (15.4 mg, 0.013 mmol) in dry toluene (10 mL) was polymerized to give a red solid (99.4 mg, 74.3%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 9.21–9.15 (br), 7.99–6.94 (br), 4.32–4.08 (br), 2.74–2.68 (br), 2.44–0.90 (br). Mn = 16.6 kg mol−1, PDI = 2.01.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The terpolymers were synthesized via the Stille coupling of M1, M2, and M3 monomer units in anhydrous toluene with a catalytic amount of Pd(PPh3)4, then purified by Soxhlet extraction with ethanol, hexane, and chloroform. The resulting polymers exhibited excellent film-forming properties and solubility in common organic solvents, including CB, THF and chloroform at room temperature, providing convenience for characterization and device processing. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) values are 14.3 kDa and 1.92 for P1, 17.1 kDa and 1.85 for P2, and 16.6 kDa and 2.01 for P3, determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with THF as an eluent. The similar molecular weight of the polymers ensured more accurate comparisons between the polymer structure and the photophysical/photovoltaic properties.
Thermal properties
The terpolymers exhibited high decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of 378, 361, and 355 °C for P1, P2, and P3, respectively (Fig. 1). However they did not show any noticeable glass transition during differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis in the temperature range from 40 °C to 300 °C. These results indicated that the terpolymers possess good thermal and morphological stability, which are prerequisites for processing and device application.

Optical properties
The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of all three terpolymers in dilute chloroform solution (0.01 mg mL−1) and in thin film form are shown in Fig. 2 and 3, respectively. All of the random terpolymers in solution exhibited two or three obvious absorption bands (Table 1) ranging from 300 to 850 nm, a common feature of polymers based on donor and acceptor units. The first absorption band around 300–450 nm corresponds to the π–π* transition of the polymer backbone. The corresponding maximum absorption coefficients are 2.3, 3.2 and 3.7 × 104 (g/mL)−1 cm−1 for P1, P2 and P3, respectively. As the thiophene-vinylene-dithienyl-benzothiadiazole (TVDTBT) content is elevated, a new absorption band around 450–580 nm appeared, as a result of the intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) bands from BDT to TVDTBT, and became clearer from P1 to P3 (1.3, 2.4, and 4.1 × 104 (g/mL)−1 cm−1, respectively). The absorption intensity between 300 and 600 nm improved with the increasing TVDTBT content. Meanwhile, the ICT bands from BDT to DPP, around 580–820 nm (6.6, 5.5, and 3.3 × 104 (g/mL)−1 cm−1 for P1, P2, and P3, respectively), gradually decreased with the increasing content of TVDTBT. As expected, a strong and broad absorption ranging from 300–800 nm was demonstrated for the as-synthesized terpolymer P3. This broad absorption would be favorable for a high Jsc. Compared to their absorption in solution, all of the terpolymers thin films showed similar absorption peaks, but broader absorption between 300–900 nm due to stronger interchain aggregation. In addition, a trend in the absorption onset was observed with a gradual blue-shift from P1 to P3 as the TVDTBT content became higher, which was due to the weaker electron-withdrawing character of TVDTBT compared to DPP. Note that P3 with its strong and broad absorption has great potential for increasing the photocurrent of PSCs. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) of P1–P3 are 1.43, 1.47 and 1.52 eV, respectively, calculated from the onset of the film absorption. By regulating the composition of the electron-deficient units, P3 was observed to absorb between 300–820 nm, indicating that the incorporating of two different electron-deficient units into the same polymer is an effective method to control the optical band gap and broaden the absorption band.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the terpolymers were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 4 and Table 2). The potentials were referenced to the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+). The redox potential of Fc/Fc+ was assumed to be an absolute energy level of −4.8 eV relative to a vacuum, which was measured under the same conditions as the polymer sample to be 0.57 V related to the saturated calomel electrode (SCE). The corresponding HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers were calculated according to the equations: EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.23) (eV) and ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.23) (eV). The HOMO levels of the three terpolymers P1–P3 were −5.29, −5.36, and −5.47 eV, respectively. We observed that increasing the content of the weak acceptor TVDTBT could lower the HOMO energy level. As a result, P3 shows the lowest HOMO level of −5.47 eV, which is beneficial for obtaining a high Voc in PSCs and good air stability. For the LUMO levels of all three terpolymers, these were expected to be mainly governed by the strongly electron-accepting DPP unit. The LUMO levels were found to be in the range −3.70 to −3.67 eV, with the highest value of −3.67 eV observed for P3, which contained the least amount of DPP. The LUMO energy level (−3.70 eV) is 0.3 eV higher than PC61BM (−4.20 eV, measured under the same conditions), suggesting that charge transfer from the polymer to PC61BM would be effective. The electrochemical bandgaps of the three terpolymers are estimated to be 1.59, 1.67, and 1.80 eV for P1, P2 and P3, respectively, which are larger than their optical bandgaps.

Polymer photovoltaic device characteristics
BHJ solar cells constructed from the terpolymers (P1, P2, and P3) as donors and PC61BM as an acceptor were investigated using the conventional device configuration. We investigated the performance of the PSC materials under a variety of conditions (Table 3 and Table 4). To avoid the influence of water vapor on PEDOT:PSS and enhance the photovoltaic properties, the PSCs were fabricated with a ITO/MoO3(10 nm)/polymer:PC61BM/LiF(0.5 nm)/Al(100 nm) configuration.37,38 The hole mobility of the target polymers was measured by using a space charge limit current (SCLC) method. Hole-only devices were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS(30 nm)/polymer:PC61BM (1:2)/MoO3(10 nm)/Al(100 nm). The corresponding data for the terpolymers are summarized in Table 3. The weight ratio of the polymer donor:PC61BM was optimized from 1:1 to 1:4 and the optimized weight ratio for the three terpolymers and PC61BM was 1:2 (Table 4). Fig. 5 shows J–V curves of the devices incorporating the terpolymer:PC61BM blends at a weight ratio of 1:2. We observed significant differences in performance between the three terpolymers. The devices prepared from the P1–P3:PC61BM blends exhibited open circuit voltages (Voc) of 0.72, 0.74, and 0.78 eV, respectively. The short circuit current densities (Jsc) of the devices incorporating the P3 blends (14.47 mA cm−2) were greater than those of P1 and P2 (6.16 and 12.21 mA cm−2, respectively); each value is related to the difference between the HOMO energy levels of the terpolymers. The high Jsc of P3 matches well with its stronger light-harvesting ability over the range of 300 to 900 nm. Therefore, the optimized P3:PC61BM devices, prepared at a blended weight ratio of 1:2, exhibited the best PCE of 5.29% (Jsc = 14.47 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.78 eV, FF = 0.48). Additionally, no further improvement was observed when using 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as an additive and PC71BM as an acceptor (Table 4).

J–V curves of the photovoltaic cells based on the terpolymers:PC61BM (1:2, w/w). 
Spectra of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) were measured for the conventional BHJ cells with 1:2 blend ratios of the terpolymers:PC61BM (Fig. 6), which are in approximate agreement with the values obtained from the J–V characteristics. These devices exhibited significantly broad IPCE responses that extended from 300 to 900 nm, corresponding to the absorbance of the active layers. The P3 device exhibited a broad response of over 40% from 350 to 750 nm, with a maximum value of 70% at 420 nm, which is consistent with its higher photocurrent.

To gain a better understanding of the relationship between the PSCs performance and the film microstructures, we have also investigated the morphologies of the terpolymers (P1–P3):PC61BM (1:2, w/w) blends using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 7). As clearly evidenced in the AFM height images, the P3 film exhibits a smooth and featureless surface over the 3 × 3 μm2 scan area, suggesting a relatively homogeneous morphology that is obviously superior to those shown in the images of P1 and P2. From the phase images of the terpolymers, we observe a suitable phase separation in Fig. 7f. In short, by increasing the content of TVDTBT, the Jsc value of P3 can be enhanced, which correlates with the morphology and hole mobility.

Conclusions
We have designed and synthesized three random conjugated terpolymers with different contents of DPP and TVDTBT side-group units for use in PSCs. The optical and electrochemical properties of the terpolymers were optimized by varying the ratio of DPP and TVDTBT in the terpolymers. We found that, as the TVDTBT content increased, the intensity of the absorption band around 300–600 nm was improved and the HOMO level deepened. P3 exhibited a complementary and broad absorption range of 300–800 nm with a high absorption coefficient of 2.3 × 104 (g/mL)−1 cm−1 in dilute solution and a deep-lying HOMO level (−5.47 eV), which are beneficial for achieving high Jsc and Voc values, respectively. As a result, polymer solar cells based on P3:PC61BM blends (1:2, w/w) exhibited a high PCE of 5.29% (Jsc = 14.47 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.78 eV, FF = 0.48) without any processing additives, indicating that the chemical structure of this conjugated random terpolymer has great potential for increasing Jsc and Voc at the same time in bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices.
