    , Accepted 28th October 2015First published on 28th October 2015AbstractIn order to circumvent the narrow spectral response of Si quantum dots (Si QDs)-based solar cells, a novel hetero-junction cell structure containing graded-sized QDs-based multilayers was proposed. The size of Si QDs varies from 8 nm to 2 nm which corresponds with the bandgap from 1.2 eV to 2.1 eV. The graded-sized Si QDs-based hetero-junction cell exhibits an enhanced spectral response in a wavelength range from 400 nm to 1200 nm, which is obviously improved compared with that of conventional Si QDs-based cells. Furthermore, by combining the graded-sized Si QDs multilayers with Si nanowire arrays, a Si QDs/Si NWs hetero-junction solar cell was fabricated and the corresponding power conversion efficiency can be as high as 12.80%, due to the significant spectral loss suppression and optical absorption enhancement by forming nano-patterned light trapping structures.
Introduction
Recently, Si quantum dots (Si QDs) have attracted much attention due to their potential application in the next generation of solar cells, light emitting devices and memory devices.1–4 As a low-dimensional quantum material, the energy band structures of Si QDs can be well changed by controlling the dot size because of the quantum confinement effect, which provides an effective approach to modulate the bandgap of Si QDs to match the broad solar spectrum efficiently.5,6 Theoretically, the radiative efficiency of bulk Si solar cells is limited to 29%, due to the incomplete utilization of high energy photons and the transmission of photons with less energy than the Si bandgap.7 However, the efficiency of all Si-based tandem type solar cell combining Si QDs (with a bandgap of 1.7 eV) with the conventional Si p–n cell can reach 42.5%, which exceed the Shockley–Queisser limit of the single junction cell based on the Si material.8 Furthermore, the efficiency of the 3-cell with two additional solar cells with bandgaps of 1.5 eV and 2.0 eV placed on top of the bulk Si cell will be 47.5%.9
The initial effort to get Si QDs-based solar cells was made by Park et al. They designed Si QDs/c-Si hetero-junction solar cells based on Si-rich silica (SRO)/SiO2 multilayers and observed that the spectral response wavelength was red shift from 500 nm to about 700 nm with increasing size of Si QDs.10 Compared with SiO2, amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) has a lower band gap, which is helpful in enhancing the carrier transport efficiency for the performance of solar cell devices.11 Song et al. fabricated Si QDs embedded in the SiC matrix and then achieved the p-type Si QDs:SiC/n-type c-Si hetero-junction solar cell with an open circuit voltage of 462 mV and a short circuit current density of 19 mA cm−2; the PCE was 4.66%.12 In our previous work, we proposed the constrained crystallization technique to obtain size-controllable Si QDs multilayers (MLs) by annealing ultrathin amorphous Si-based stacked structures.13 By controlling the a-Si:H sublayer thickness and the post-annealing parameters, the Si QDs with high density and confirmed size distribution can be obtained.14,15 Recently, we designed and fabricated p–i–n cell devices in which ultrathin Si QDs/SiC MLs were used as the intrinsic layer embedded in n-a-Si and p-type crystalline Si substrates. It was found that the improvement in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) result for the annealed cell device can be attributed to the formation of Si QDs which enhanced the absorption of incident photons, especially in the short wavelength range and the carrier transport process. The cell had an open circuit voltage of 532 mV and a PCE of 6.28%.16
However, up to now, the used multilayers contain Si QDs with fixed size in a one cell device and in turn the corresponding bandgap and spectral response is limited in a certain wavelength range. In order to further expand the spectral response range and improve the cell performance, in the present work, we propose a novel device structure by using graded-sized Si QDs instead of the fixed-sized one in the same multilayered structure to form hetero-junction solar cells to realize the wide and efficient spectral response and give the experimental results to demonstrate the improvement of cell performance. It is found that the graded-sized Si QDs/Si hetero-junction enhances the absorption in almost the whole spectral range (300–1200 nm), which contributes to broader and higher spectral response. The corresponding cell device exhibits the large open circuit voltage and particularly, the enhanced short circuit current density. The PCE is also improved to 7.45%. Furthermore, the graded-sized Si QDs stacked layers were fabricated on the wet chemical etched Si nanowire structure. The device performance is greatly improved due to the reduced optical loss, which exhibits that the PCE can be as high as 12.80%.
Experimental
Theoretically, multiple-junction solar cells with a stack of Si QDs-based cells, in which each cell has a bandgap that is optimized for the absorption of a certain spectral region, will have a higher efficiency. We have fabricated Si QDs/SiC MLs with various dot sizes by annealing amorphous Si/SiC stacked structures with controllable amorphous Si sublayer thickness. The optical bandgaps have been deduced based on the measured optical absorption spectra according to Tauc's plots.17 The optical absorption coefficient α of Si QDs with different sizes is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Fig. 1 is the obtained optical bandgap as a function of dot sizes. It shows that the optical bandgap varies from 1.2 eV to 2.1 eV upon controlling the dot size from 9 nm to 2 nm, reflecting the quantum size effect that the energy gap gradually expanded with reducing dot size, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1. For Si QDs with 4 nm, the optical bandgap is about 1.7 eV, which is the theoretically expected bandgap for the Si QDs tandem solar cell. We have developed a modified effective mass approximation (EMA) model to estimate the band gap of Si QDs/SiC MLs instead of an infinite barrier model by considering the Coulomb effect and the correlation energy terms. Based on this model, the optical bandgap (Eoptg) can be expressed as:  in which, 1.12 is the band gap of crystalline silicon, R is the average diameter of Si QDs, 0.4512 is the Coulomb coefficient, 0.003394 is the correlation energy terms, and ΔEe,h,reduced is the decreased confinement energy related to the barrier height in the conduction and the valence band.18 The fitted curve is in good agreement with the experimental results, as shown in Fig. 1.

Based on the optical bandgaps of Si QDs with various dot sizes, the a-Si:H/SiC MLs with 6 periods were fabricated on quartz and n-Si substrates (CZ, 1.7–3.2 Ω cm) in the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system. The a-Si sublayers with 8 nm, 4 nm and 2 nm in thickness were deposited by using pure silane (SiH4), while 2 nm-thick a-SiC layers were deposited by using a gas mixture of SiH4 and methane (CH4) with the gas ratio R (R = [CH4]/[SiH4]) of 10. In order to obtain graded-sized Si QDs/SiC stacked structures, the graded thickness a-Si:H/SiC MLs were fabricated with a-Si sublayer thicknesses of 8 nm, 4 nm and 2 nm from the bottom to the top. We have systematically studied the influences of structural parameters on the cell performance containing Si QDs. It was found that both the active layer thickness and periodicity of multilayers affected the cell performance significantly. To retain the active layer thickness of the cells with various sizes of QDs means to increase the periodicity of multilayers for small-sized QDs samples (say 2 nm Si QDs); the corresponding cell exhibited the poor performance due to the strong recombination in the interfacial states introduced by increasing the periodicity of multilayers, as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). Therefore, in order to give a better comparison, we retain the same periodicity of multilayers for cells with various dot sizes and graded-sizes in the present work.
After deposition of periodic or graded-sized Si/SiC MLs on n-type Si substrates, a 10 nm boron-doped amorphous Si layer was deposited on the MLs to obtain p–i–n structures. The n-type Si wafers were additionally dipped in 2% HF solution for 10 s to remove the surface native oxide before the fabrication process. During the deposition, the radio frequency power and the substrate temperature was kept at 30 W and 250 °C, respectively. The post-treatment performed in a N2 atmosphere included dehydrogenation at 450 °C for 1 h and subsequently annealing at 900 °C for 1 h. The structural change of the Si/SiC MLs before and after annealing was evaluated by Raman spectroscopy (Jobin Yvon Horiba HR800 spectrometer). The formation of Si QDs was determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a Technai G2 operated at 200 KV. The optical absorption of the Si/SiC MLs was measured at room temperature using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer. Finally, the Al electrode was evaporated on the surface and the rear side of n-type Si wafers. The schematic diagram of a solar cell containing graded-sized Si QDs/SiC MLs is shown in Fig. 2. The active area of the device was 1 cm2. The illuminated current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the cell devices were measured under an AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination by using a Keithley 610C electrometer. The EQE spectra were collected by the spectral response measurement system in the wavelength range of 300–1200 nm. In order to further improve the photovoltaic properties of Si QDs-based solar cells, we developed a light trapping structure by a metal-assisted chemical etching technique. In our previous work, we have tried to obtain the Si NWs structures by changing the etching time and concluded that 5 min was the optimal etching time for the Si QDs/Si NWs hetero-junction solar cells. The n-type c-Si wafers were well cleaned and then immersed into the solution composed of hydrofluoric acid and silver nitrate mixtures for an anisotropic wet-chemical etching process at room temperature. After the etching processes, the tree-like silver pattern wrapping the Si samples was detached using a HNO3 solution. The formed structures were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Finally, Si NWs arrays were aligned vertically to the wafers. Similarly, all-Si based solar cells containing Si QDs/SiC MLs and the 10 nm-thick boron-doped amorphous Si layer were fabricated on the Si NWs substrate, to obtain p–i–n solar cell structures, as also plotted in Fig. 2.

Results and discussion

Fig. 3(a) is the cross-sectional TEM image of as-deposited graded sized a-Si(8, 4, 2 nm)/a-SiC(2 nm) MLs. The layered structures and smooth interfaces of Si/SiC can be clearly identified. The thickness of a-SiC sublayers is 1.95 nm and the thickness of a-Si sublayers is 8.4 nm, 4.3 nm and 2.1 nm, respectively, which is very close to the pre-designed value estimated from the deposition rate. Fig. 3(b) shows the Raman spectra of as-deposited and 900 °C annealed graded-sized a-Si(8, 4, 2 nm)/a-SiC(2 nm) multilayered samples. Only a broad band can be observed in as-deposited samples indicating their amorphous nature. After 900 °C annealing, a sharp Raman band associated with crystallized Si TO mode appears, indicating that the amorphous Si layers have been crystallized to form nanocrystallized Si. We fitted the Raman spectrum via the Gaussian deconvolution by three components, which are located at 480 cm−1 (represents the TO mode of amorphous Si), 510 cm−1 (represents the TO mode of smaller crystallized Si) and 520 cm−1 (represents the TO mode of larger one). The crystallinity ratio (Xc) is figured out as 55% by integrated Gaussian peaks of 520 cm−1 and 480 cm−1.19Fig. 3(c) is the cross-sectional TEM image of the sample annealed at 900 °C, which exhibits the formed Si QDs after annealing. The layered structures are well kept and the interfaces are still smooth. The formation of Si QDs with different sizes in a-Si layers can be identified. As a reference, periodic Si QDs/SiC multilayers with various sizes were fabricated and the corresponding high-resolution TEM images are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The dot size is around 2.5 nm, 5.0 nm and 9.0 nm, which is well kept in the graded-sized Si QDs/SiC multilayers.

Fig. 4(a) is the EQE of p–i–n device structures containing graded-sized Si QDs/SiC MLs together with the periodic ones. It is clearly shown that the EQE for periodic Si QDs/SiC MLs is gradually shifted to the short wavelength side upon reducing the dot size from 8 nm to 2 nm, which can be explained in terms of the enlarged optical bandgap on account of the quantum size effect as mentioned before. Since the size of Si QDs in our case varies from 8 nm to 2 nm, the corresponding optical bandgap is changed from 1.2 eV to 2.1 eV. In our previous work, we measured the EQE spectra of the p–i–n device sample and compared with that of as-deposited one and then gave the EQE result of the p–i–n solar cell containing Si QDs/SiC MLs by subtracting the EQE of the cell containing as-deposited one. It was found that the improved EQE is located in the spectral range of 400–800 nm with the peak at 500 nm, which can be attributed to the formation of Si QDs.16 As also discussed in the ESI,† Si QDs/SiC multilayers were fabricated on heavily doped Si substrates to form solar cell structures. The EQE result is located in the spectral range of 400–900 nm with the peak at 600 nm (please see Fig. S3, ESI†). In our case, the EQE is increased from 47.6% to 59.5% at the wavelength of 500 nm upon decreasing the size of Si QDs from 8 nm to 2 nm. Similar results were also reported in the previous work.20–23 Cho et al. fabricated solar cells consisting of phosphorus-doped Si QDs in a SiO2 matrix deposited on p-type c-Si substrates. It was found that the IQE was very high in the short wavelength region for 3 nm QDs, while there was poorer response in the high energy region for the 8 nm Si QDs device. It is interesting to find that the EQE of the solar cell containing graded-size Si QDs/SiC MLs is obviously enhanced in a wide spectral range (400–1200 nm), compared with that of the conventional periodic Si QDs/SiC ML-based solar cells. At the wavelength of 500 nm, the EQE is further increased to 64.4%. It is because that the graded-sized Si QDs-based cell has the graded optical bandgap from the top to the bottom; the incident solar photons with a short wavelength (high energy) can be first absorbed by the smaller-sized Si QDs and the photon wavelength (low energy) will penetrate the top layers and be efficiently absorbed by the following layers with gradually enlarged Si QDs and the Si substrate, which effectively reduce the heat loss and enhance the optical absorption as revealed by our results. It is worth noting that even at the wavelength of 300 nm, the EQE is also increased from 1.3% to 3.5%, compared with that of the conventional periodic Si QDs/SiC ML-based cell. As a consequence, the calculated short circuit current density is improved due to the more incident photons that can be utilized in photo-electric conversion. Fig. 4(b) shows the AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illuminated current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of p-a-Si/(Si QDs/SiC) ML/n-Si hetero-junction solar cells. It is found that the cell containing graded-sized Si QDs/SiC MLs has higher short current than the periodic one, as expected by the EQE spectra, while having almost the same open circuit voltage and fill factor. As given in Table 1, the cell containing graded-sized Si QDs(8, 4, 2 nm)/SiC(2 nm) MLs has a Voc of 510 mV, a Jsc of 28.36 mA cm−2, a fill factor of 51.5%, and a PCE is 7.45%.

It is well known that the cell performance can be obviously improved by introducing the light trapping nanostructures.24 In our previous work, we developed a nanosphere lithography technique to obtain the Si-based nanostructures with good anti-reflection characteristics.25 By depositing Si QDs/SiO2 MLs on the nano-patterned structures, both the enhanced light emission and improved efficiency of solar cells have been observed.26–28 In order to further improve the photovoltaic properties of the present graded-sized Si QDs-based solar cells, graded-sized Si QDs/SiC MLs were fabricated on the Si NWs substrate to form the radial junction cell. The cross-sectional image of the vertically aligned graded-sized Si QDs/Si NWs hetero-junction solar cells was analyzed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). As shown in Fig. 5(a), the length of Si NWs etched for 5 min is about 700 nm.

The optical transmission (T) spectra and reflection (R) spectra were measured for Si QDs/SiC MLs deposited on flat Si wafer and wafer with vertically aligned Si NWs arrays to obtain hetero-junction structures. The optical absorption (A) can be deduced by A = 1 − R − T. Fig. 5(b) is the optical absorption spectra of graded-sized Si QDs-based solar cell structures deposited on both the flat Si wafer and Si NWs wafer. The optical absorption of Si QDs/Si NWs structures is enhanced in the whole measurement range (300–1200 nm), compared with that of the flat one. The mean absorption weighted by the AM1.5G solar spectrum in the wavelength range from 300 to 1200 nm is increased from 61.3% to 86.3% by forming the present vertically aligned Si NWs arrays, which is enhanced by 40.8% compared with that of the flat cell. The significantly enhanced optical absorption in a wide spectral range (300–1200 nm) can be attributed to the light harvesting properties of Si NWs arrays as discussed in our previous work.29

Fig. 6(a) is EQE spectra of the graded-sized Si QDs/SiC ML-based cell deposited on the flat Si substrate and Si NWs structures, respectively. It is shown that the EQE is further enhanced in a wide spectral range by using Si NWs structures owing to the light trapping effect discussed before. Besides, vertically aligned Si NWs arrays will enlarge the radial junction areas, due to the high aspect-ratio, which is helpful for enhancing the carrier separation and collection efficiency to improve the device performance.30,31 In order to further understand the role of Si QDs in the present cell device, Si QDs/SiC MLs were fabricated on heavily doped n-Si substrates (∼5 mΩ cm) to form Si QDs/n++-c-Si and Si QDs/n++-Si NWs hetero-junction solar cells. The EQE results are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Further discussion is described in the ESI.† On the basis of the measured EQE spectra, Jsc can be is estimated to be 13.89 mA cm−2 for the flat Si QDs/n++-c-Si cell and is increased to 17.35 mA cm−2 for the Si QDs/n++-Si NWs cell, which can be attributed to the contribution of Si QDs/SiC MLs. Fig. 6(b) is the illuminated J–V curve of the Si QDs/Si NWs cell and the flat cell. The Si QDs/Si NWs cell has an average PCE of 12.00 ± 0.80% (a Voc of 540 ± 9 mV, a Jsc of 30.65 ± 1.08 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 72.2 ± 1.3%), and a maximum PCE of 12.80%. The performance of the device with Si NWs is generally better than that of the flat one. The increased Jsc of the Si QDs/Si NWs cell can be attributed to the enhancement of optical absorption, which is in agreement with EQE results. In addition, the Voc of the Si QDs/Si NWs cell is also increased. Theoretically, in a conventional single-junction solar cell, Voc can be expressed as32  where n is the ideality factor, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, q is the electron charge, Jsc is the short circuit current density, and J0 is the saturation current. The inset of Fig. 6(b) is the dark I–V curves of both cells. If the forward biased curve is fitted to a standard diode equation, the ideality factor of the heterojunction diode can be estimated. Si NWs increase the ideality factor from the value of the flat cell of 2.4 to 3.3 of the Si QDs/Si NWs cell. As shown in the figure, it is found that J0 of both cells are almost the same. As a result, the Voc of the Si QDs/Si NWs cell increases with increasing ideality factor and Jsc. Moreover, because contact resistance is inversely proportional to the area for carriers passing through, Si NWs arrays will reduce series resistance (Rs) of solar cells, due to their high aspect-ratio.33 The Rs value extracted by a fit to the illuminated J–V curve is 2.5 Ω of the Si QDs/Si NWs cell, which is 15 Ω in the flat cell. The reduced Rs can result in the significant improvement of the fill factor, which is determined by the junction area.

Because of those improvements, the PCE of the Si QDs/Si NWs cell is obviously enhanced. Similar work on enhanced light absorption and improved photovoltaic properties of Si QDs-based hetero-junction solar cells by forming Si nanostructures was also reported previously. Igarashi et al. fabricated Si nano-disks using an original top-down process involving a 2D array of bio-templates with a 4.5 nm-diameter iron core and damage-free neutral beam etching, which exhibit a high optical absorption coefficient. As a result, the cell achieved a short circuit current density of 31.3 mA cm−2 and 12.6% conversion efficiency.21 The present result is compatible with the reported values with other groups by using the Si QDs/SiC structure and is improved compared with that of other prominent types of Si-based hetero-junction solar cells, such as the good passivated ITO/SiOx/c-Si hetero-junction solar cell,34 the inorganic/organic hybrid radial hetero-junction solar cell,35 and the graphene/graphene oxide/silicon Schottky-barrier solar cells.36 Our results demonstrate that the graded-sized Si QDs/Si NWs cell devices prepared by the present approach offer a simple and low cost process to achieve broadband and high spectral response and in turn to improve the cell performances, especially the Jsc and PCE. It is worth noting that parameters of the present cell have not been optimized. Further device optimization such as substrate resistivity, front metallization and back-surface field will improve the photovoltaic properties.
Conclusions
In summary, we proposed and fabricated graded-sized Si QDs/SiC multilayer-based hetero-junction solar cells. The enhanced optical absorption in a wide spectral range (300–1200 nm) was demonstrated which can be attributed to efficiently match the incident solar photons and the optical bandgaps of Si QDs with various dot sizes. The cell containing graded-size Si QDs/SiC MLs exhibited a good device performance with a Jsc as high as 28.36 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 7.45%. By combining the graded-size Si QDs/SiC MLs with the Si NWs structures, the broadband optical absorption can be further enhanced to 86.3%, weighted by AM1.5G solar spectrum illumination, due to the light harvesting effect of Si NWs structures. Both the open circuit voltage and short circuit current density were improved due to the reduced series resistance and enhanced carrier collection efficiency. As a consequence, the photo-electric conversion efficiency reached to 12.80%.
