    , Accepted 12th June 2014First published on 12th June 2014AbstractHighly efficient p–i–n perovskite solar cells employing a flat and thick CH3NH3PbI3 film and a thin PCBM film are fabricated by the solution-process at low temperature. Through attainment of optimized PCBM thickness and insertion of the LiF interlayer, the unit cell shows 14.1% of overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) with a Jsc of 20.7 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.866 V, and a FF of 78.3% under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 conditions, while a larger area 10 cell serially connected module (10 × 10 cm2) shows an 8.7% PCE. These PCE values are the highest reported to date for the planar perovskite–PCBM solar cells.

Broader context
Organolead trihalide perovskites lead to fabrication of potentially low-cost and high efficiency solar cells. We report a promising approach towards a highly efficient CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell employing a low-temperature solution-process and normal organic photovoltaic architecture. In this work, we investigated the beneficial effects of reducing the PCBM thickness and inserting LiF on the device performance. A combination of a well-controlled flat surface of the perovskite film and a thin PCBM layer enabled the fabrication of efficient cells. In addition, a large scale device (10 × 10 cm2) showing outstanding PV performance of over 8% was fabricated by the same approaches.

Hybrid organic/inorganic perovskite materials with the formula CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) have received a great deal of attention because of their good intrinsic properties for photovoltaic applications, such as an appropriate band gap (1.55 eV), high absorption coefficient, long hole–electron diffusion length (∼100 nm), and excellent carrier transport.1–13 Furthermore, these materials offer the chemical and structural diversity that can be obtained by mixing in various halides (Br or Cl) or replacing the methylammonium organic species with other constituents (ethylammonium, formamidium etc.).14–17 As a result, their band gaps, crystalline phase transitions, and hole–electron diffusion lengths can all be tuned. Recently, great progress has been made in perovskite solar cells employing an electron-transport layer/perovskite material/hole-transport layer structure, which facilitates selective hole extraction to the gold electrode.9–13 Although they exhibit good performance, the formation of most electron-transport layers such as the mesoporous (mp)-TiO2 layer requires high-temperature processing. Therefore, many approaches to avoiding high-temperature manufacturing (>450 °C) for preparing a compact or mp-TiO2 layer have been examined.18,19 As one promising approach, the use of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) in perovskite solar cells has been investigated by several groups.20–24 Furthermore, the n–i–p architecture consisting of an n-TiO2/perovskite/p-hole conductor suffers from a large hysteresis with the sweep direction in the measurement.25,26
To fabricate p–i–n perovskite cells, ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) substrate and PCBM are generally used. The perovskite layer, which acts as a light absorber, is deposited by spin-coating on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer, followed by a thin PCBM layer as the electron acceptor. Then, an Al electrode is usually used as the cathode electrode. Recent efforts to increase the device performance of PCBM–perovskite heterojunction solar cells have focused on establishing a thicker perovskite film (100–350 nm) to ensure better light absorption and a higher current density.20–24 Simultaneously, a well-controlled flat surface of the perovskite film is essential for deposition of a thin PCBM layer. Reducing the thickness of the PCBM layer leads to better photovoltaic device performance by increasing conductivity in the PCBM film.27–29 However, so far, there have been some obstacles to realizing a homogeneous perovskite layer with a uniform thickness in a planar heterojunction cell by solution processing. To overcome the morphology problems associated with the roughness of the thick perovskite film, a thicker PCBM layer (>110 nm) can be used or another n-type layer (like TiOx) can be deposited on the top of a thin PCBM layer (∼50 nm) to prevent leakage due to the direct contact between the metal and the perovskite film.22,24
In early 2014, Bolink and co-workers fabricated a planar heterojunction device with an efficiency as high as 12% under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 irradiation using an evaporation method in a high-vacuum chamber.23 This result demonstrates the great potential of the perovskite–PCBM architecture. However, it still remains a challenge to improve the performance of perovskite–PCBM heterojunction devices. Moreover, it is highly desirable to develop a low-cost solution-processable solar cell with a high efficiency, a large area, and flexibility, especially one that can be fabricated at low temperatures.
Recently, we established a solvent-engineering technology employing a mixture solution of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO):γ-butyrolactone (GBL) (3:7, v/v) to create a highly uniform perovskite layer.25 The presence of DMSO helps to retard the rapid reaction between the inorganic PbI2 and CH3NH3I components of perovskite by forming DMSO–PbI2 complexes.30 This allows a smoother film to be formed upon a consecutive spin-coating process.
In this work, we report the fabrication of a highly improved MAPbI3 perovskite solar cell and the dependence of its device-performance on the thickness of the PCBM layer. The optimized device with a 55 nm-thick PCBM layer and a LiF/Al cathode showed a high efficiency of 14.1% under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 conditions, which is the highest value reported to date for perovskite solar cells using normal OPV architecture fabricated using low-temperature processing. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time a solution-processing method for the fabrication of a larger area device (10 × 10 cm2), which shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.7%.

Fig. 1a depicts the device configuration of the hybrid perovskite–PCBM heterojunction solar cell and the energy level diagram of each layer in the device. From the potential difference between the conduction band of MAPbI3 perovskite as the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the PCBM as the acceptor, we see that this configuration is suitable for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. Therefore, free charge carriers (or excitons) generated in the MAPbI3 layer can be extracted (or dissociated) by electron transfer to the PCBM. The electrodes collect the photogenerated free carriers; the ITO collects holes and the cathode (Al metal) collects the electrons. As shown in Fig. 1b, the absorption spectrum is consistent with the typical spectrum of MAPbI3 films over the entire UV and visible range up to 800 nm.7 A typical cross-sectional SEM image of the device is given in Fig. 1c. Our solvent-engineering technique can offer an extremely uniform and thick perovskite film (∼290 nm) on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate, even though the width is in the range of several tens of micrometers. Subsequently, the PCBM layer is able to be deposited using orthogonal solvent processing. The well-crystallized perovskite covers the entire surface of the PEDOT:PSS layer perfectly. We also see that the fabricated film is dark brown in color, with good transparency (see the inset of Fig. 1b).

(d) SEM image of the top surface of the CH3NH3PbI3 film on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS surface. (e) Its AFM image and roughness profile. 

Fig. 1d displays the surface morphology of the fabricated MAPbI3 film on top of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS layer. The film surface is composed of well-developed grains with sizes of a few hundred nanometers, and full surface coverage of PCBM is achieved. The homogeneous and flat morphology is different from those of other films prepared by simple spin-coating.20,22,31 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements showed that the 290 nm-thick film is very smooth with a rms (root mean square) roughness of about 10 nm in an area of 3 μm × 3 μm (see Fig. 1e). Thus, the perovskite layer formed in this work has a very low roughness, which allows a thin (<100 nm thick) PCBM layer.
To gain more insight into the effect of the thickness of the PCBM layer on the device performance, we fabricated hybrid solar cells with fixed thicknesses of the MAPbI3 layer but different thicknesses of the PCBM layer of 55, 100, 120, and 140 nm. The PCBM layer thickness was changed by varying the concentration of the PCBM spin-coating solution. Fig. S1† shows a top-view SEM image of the 55 nm-thick PCBM film deposited on ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3. It can be seen that the PCBM layer is very smooth and covers the entire MAPbI3 surface perfectly, even though it is only 55 nm-thick. From this result, it is reasonable to assume that the perovskite film can also be fully covered by PCBM layers thicker than 55 nm. Fig. 2a shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of MAPbI3–PCBM heterojunction cells with different PCBM layer thicknesses. The details of the device parameters are given in Table S1.† As the thickness of the PCBM layer decreases from 140 to 55 nm, the device efficiency greatly increases (see Fig. 2b). A similar trend is observed for the short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF). For the 140 nm-thick PCBM layer in particular, the current density and the fill factor are quite low. This is probably due to increased recombination and a resultant high series resistance when the dissociated carriers travel longer distance to reach the Al electrode. The optimal device performance is obtained for the thin PCBM layer with a thickness of ∼55 nm, which yields a PCE in excess of 12%. As compared to other MAPbI3–PCBM heterojunction devices, this device also exhibited a substantial improvement in Jsc, reaching nearly 20 mA cm−2. However, further decrease in the thickness of the PCBM layer deteriorated the device performance, greatly reducing Voc and FF (see Fig. S2†). This implies that leakage current may have occurred by the direct contact between the perovskite layer and the Al metal, when the PCBM layer becomes too thin (∼40 nm). This observation can be explained by the roughness profile of the perovskite surface in Fig. 1e. If the direct contact between the Al metal and the perovskite layer occurs because of surface defects in the PCBM layer, the device performance can worsen because of the resulting leakage current. In addition, devices with thin PCBM layers (∼40 nm) did not perform as reliably as the other devices with thicker PCBM layers. Accordingly, full surface coverage of the perovskite film by the PCBM layer is crucial to ensure the reproducibility of the device performance. Once this condition is met, a thinner PCBM layer is favorable for better device performance.

(b) Dependence of the device performance on the corresponding thickness of the PCBM layer. Each data point represents the mean from a set of 11 or more devices. 
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of devices with different thicknesses of the PCBM layer are shown in Fig. 3a. The spectra are normalized so that the amounts of charge collection in the absorption range can be compared. The shapes of the EQE in the range of 300 and 500 nm mainly originate from the transmittance spectrum of ITO/PEDOT:PSS,32,33 because the CH3NH3PbI3 absorbs 100% of its incident radiation regardless of the thickness of the PCBM. Interestingly, the EQE at 350 nm decreases as the thickness of PCBM increases, which implies that the charge collection is inefficient for a thicker PCBM layer, since the same amount of charge carriers is generated from the same amount of absorption. A similar behavior is found in the range of 600–800 nm. Thus, the EQE spectra are affected by the PCBM thickness. However, because the absorbance of the perovskite film in the range of 600–800 nm is not 100% (see Fig. 1b), a thicker film would be necessary to harvest more red and near-infrared light, which would still affect the EQE spectra. In the real device, an enhancement of EQE in the range of a thin PCBM-device might be probably caused by the additional absorption of light reflected from the Al electrode at the thin PCBM layer.

In this study, we introduced a thin LiF layer (∼0.5 nm) as a buffer layer, prior to deposition of the Al electrode in our cell. This resulted in a simultaneous improvement in the FF and Jsc, relative to those of a device without a LiF layer (see Fig. 3b). Such an effect of LiF insertion was already reported for organic solar cells, implying that the electron extraction from the PCBM to the LiF/Al is improved by the reduced energy barrier between them resulting from the generation of a dipole moment across the interfaces.34,35 By choosing the optimal thickness of the PCBM layer and inserting the LiF interlayer, we could fabricate efficient cells with PCE exceeding 14% under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 irradiation with negligible hysteresis of the J–V curve for reverse and forward scan directions (see Fig. 3c and S3†). 14.1% of PCE can be obtained with a Jsc of 20.7 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.866 V, and a FF of 78.3%. To the best of our knowledge, the 14.1% PCE indicates the best performance of a hybrid MAPbI3–PCBM heterojunction solar cell to date. The integrated current density derived from the EQE spectra in Fig. 3d is in close agreement (within nearly 5%) with the value measured under simulated sunlight. In particular, our device exhibits a relatively high FF of 74–78%, as compared with those of other previously reported devices based on the perovskite–PCBM heterojunction.22–24 Moreover, to test the stability of our devices, we stored an encapsulated device in ambient air in the dark. The encapsulated device showed good stability over one month and maintained 95% of its initial efficiency (see Fig. S4†).
Based on this unit cell, we also fabricated a large area photovoltaic module as a first step toward practical photovoltaic application. A picture of the perovskite–PCBM module and the schematic of its structure are shown in Fig. 4a and b. In ITO-coated glass (10 × 10 cm2), ten single cells are interconnected in series with an overall active area of 60 cm2. All the solution-processing steps are identical to those when the small area unit cell (with an active area of 0.09 cm2) is fabricated. As shown in Fig. 4c, the photovoltaic module yields PCE values of 8.7% and 7.0% for 55 nm-thick and 120 nm-thick PCBM layers, respectively, which are the highest efficiencies reported to date, including those of mesoscopic perovskite-modules.36 In this large-area module, the device with the thinner PCBM layer still showed better performance, as was the case of the unit cell. The device parameters of the module with the 55 nm-thick PCBM layer are Jsc = 1.9 mA cm−2, Voc = 8.1 V, and FF = 57%. These current and voltage characteristics of the series-type module with ten single cells are comparable to those (19.5 mA cm−2 and 0.84 V) of the small-area unit cell. However, the FF is much lower than that of the unit cell because of the higher series resistance, which is the main reason for the reduced PCE of the module.

Summary
In summary, we have demonstrated highly efficient p–i–n perovskite solar cells and 10 × 10 cm2 photovoltaic modules based on this unit cell. The deposition of a thin PCBM layer (∼55 nm thick) was made possible by the formation of extremely uniform perovskite layers, and the insertion of an LiF interlayer enabled the PCE to reach 14.1% for a unit cell and 8.7% for the module. These values are the highest reported to date for perovskite–PCBM planar heterojunction solar cells. Thus, this study provides new avenues for the fabrication of more efficient perovskite thin film solar cells using low-temperature solution processing and demonstrates the great potential of these technologies for achieving a large-area flexible photovoltaic device.

Organolead trihalide perovskites lead to fabrication of potentially low-cost and high efficiency solar cells. We report a promising approach towards a highly efficient CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell employing a low-temperature solution-process and normal organic photovoltaic architecture. In this work, we investigated the beneficial effects of reducing the PCBM thickness and inserting LiF on the device performance. A combination of a well-controlled flat surface of the perovskite film and a thin PCBM layer enabled the fabrication of efficient cells. In addition, a large scale device (10 × 10 cm2) showing outstanding PV performance of over 8% was fabricated by the same approaches.
