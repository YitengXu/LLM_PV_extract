    , Accepted 9th September 2014First published on 3rd October 2014AbstractThe effect of twelve different additives on organic solar cells with an active layer based on poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) has been studied in this work and tested for suitability in roll-to-roll slot-die coating. Three of the twelve additives increased the solar cell efficiency while the rest showed no effect or a negative influence on the efficiency and coatability. In cases where the additive caused an increase in performance the relation to surface topography and the structure was investigated using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), UV-Vis Spectroscopy and Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) for cells prepared with 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and 1,3-dimethyl-barbituric acid (BARB) as processing additives. The studies suggested that the use of these additives resulted in films with improved morphology and electrical properties of the active layer. The effect of the CN on structural evolution during different solvent evaporation and annealing times was further investigated with an in situ roll-to-roll X-ray study. Lifetime studies under continuous illumination were used to assess the impact of the additives on the stability of the prepared devices that had an active area of 1 cm2.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic devices based on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) have attracted wide attention in recent years due to their potential advantages of fabrication, low cost and flexibility. Yet, when manufactured with high-throughput technologies, the resulting power conversion efficiencies are as a general rule much lower. A possible cause of this could be a more limited control of the morphology formation in the active layer during large scale processing. One of the strategies that can be easily integrated into large scale production is the use of processing additives that has been included as a general method during the past decade and has seen a significant growth in the field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs), especially regarding solution processed bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) device structures. Technologies based on printing and coating of polymer solar cells have already been demonstrated to be a viable approach that merges low cost, flexibility, and fast processing, suitable for large scale production.1–3 The research however, has been mainly focused on enhancing the power conversion efficiency by optimization of cell components, in particular, the photoactive materials, reporting over 10% in terms of efficiency for small area laboratory devices.4 So far, solution processed OPVs have been prepared mostly on a laboratory scale in an inert atmosphere by either spin coating or vacuum evaporation on glass substrates. These new developments cannot be readily up-scaled or transferred to an industrial level. In fact, the reported record efficiencies for small laboratory cells are significantly higher than the performances of large area polymer solar cell modules. The possible reasons for this arise from a complex dependency between material properties, device architecture, processing conditions and parameters, which in turn, influence the morphology of the layers and their interface behavior.5,6 Modern BHJ devices are based on a photoactive film consisting of a conjugated polymer-acceptor blend forming a bi-continuous interpenetrating network with ideal feature domains of 10–20 nm.7,8 Such well-defined morphologies enhance device performance by improving charge separation, diffusion and transfer.5–7,9 Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) continue to be the most commonly studied systems due to a high degree of chemical stability, and high charge-carrier mobility. Recently, a power conversion efficiency of over 5%5,10 has been reported in the devices with this composite, while the roll-to-roll technology presents efficiencies in the range of 2–3%.1 Much effort has been devoted to improve the efficiency of solution processed P3HT:PCBM blends and a wide range of protocols for morphology manipulation have been applied, including: solvent selection,11,12 blend ratio composition,13,14 drying time,15,16 thermal17,18 and solvent annealing.19,20 and surface modifications.21,22 The control over the phase separation of the two components and the increase in the crystallinity of the film were found to be the main parameters to obtain an efficient device.5,23,24 In the case of large scale roll-to-roll coating an improved morphology is obtained mostly through an appropriate processing solvent and thermal annealing. Whereas, the first is easily incorporated, the post-production treatment adds an additional fabrication step or additional processing time, which is not convenient for large scale industrial manufacturing. The approach of incorporating a volatile additive25–33 or other non-reacting chemical compounds34–37 to the donor–acceptor solution has been employed previously using spin coating as the film forming technique. Introduction of a sufficient amount of a high-boiling solvent to the host solution alters the morphology by slowing the evaporation rate of the deposited film and by selective dissolution of either the donor or acceptor component.38–40 Although the use of additives has been beneficial in terms of morphology control, it must be selected to suit each donor–acceptor system as the effect originates from different interactions with the blend components and drying conditions.41,42 Various solvent additives for different blend mixtures have been studied.5,24–33,42 Among the various high-boiling additives, 1,8-diiodooctane and 1-chloronaphthalene have shown great increases in efficiency to over 7%.29,41,42 However, all of these tests were carried out on devices fabricated with spin coating as the deposition technique, which is not compatible with highly effective roll-to-roll technology. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of additives during the process of slot-die coating using X-ray scattering methods with emphasis on the morphology. The cell performance parameters together with optical, morphological and structural properties of the films are reported as a function of the active layer composition.
Experimental
Solar cells were manufactured on an ITO-free semitransparent electron accepting (bottom electrode) substrate known as Flextrode,43 which comprises of a conductive silver grid, a PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus Clevios PH1000) conductor and a ZnO hole blocking layer deposited on PET (Melinex ST506) in a large scale roll-to-roll process. A fully slot-die coated layer stack (top electrode) consisting of an active layer and a hole transporting layer was fabricated by slot-die coating together with silver (PV410 Dupont) grids printed by a flexographic technique on a lab scale roll-coater.
Materials
Poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) with a molecular weight of 40 kDa and a regioregularity of 96% was purchased from BASF (Sepiolid P200); phenyl-C61-butyric acid methylester (PCBM) of technical grade was obtained from Solenne BV; chlorobenzene and isopropanol of analytical grade (Aldrich 99%) were used as solvents for active and hole transporting layers; 1-chloronaphthalene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, 1,8-diiodooctane, 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid, dodecan-1-thiol, heptan-1-thiol, 1-methylnaphthalene, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N,N-dimethyl-formamide, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, and octan-1,8-dithiol used as additives were of analytical or reagent grade (Aldrich 97–99.8%). The substrate was 130 μm thick polyethylene terephthalate (PET) denominated as Melinex ST506 (Dupont); poly(3,4 ethylene dioxythiophene):poly (styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) based layers consisting of Clevios™ F-010 used by dilution with isopropanol (IPA) in 2:1 and 1:4 v/v ratios and Clevios™ P VP Al 4083 with a 1:2 dilution ratio were obtained from Clevios® whereas Orgacon EL-P 5010 was obtained from Agfa and diluted with iso-propanol (IPA) in a 10:5 w/w ratio. Thermally curable Ag (PV410) used for printing the top electrode was purchased from Dupont and used directly. A UV curable adhesive (DELO® Katibond LP 655) was purchased from DELO® and used for encapsulation of completed devices.
Device fabrication
Two different inverted geometry final cell stacks were prepared and subsequently tested for each active layer formulation. Two variations in top electrode hole transporting and conducting layer type were utilized, denominated as “PEDOT 5010” and “PEDOT 3 layer”. Both configurations are schematically represented in Fig. 1. Active layer coating ink was prepared from 30:30 mg mL−1 P3HT:PCBM chlorobenzene solution with additive percentage (in volume or weight), whereas the ink used for reference consisted of 30:30 mg mL−1 P3HT:PCBM chlorobenzene solution corrected in volume for the corresponding additive amount. The coating of the material directly on top of the Flextrode was conducted at a speed of 1 m min−1 resulting in a wet thickness of 10 μm and an estimated dry thickness of 470 nm. In the case of the “5010” stack type the conductive PEDOT:PSS layer was prepared from Orgacon EL-P 5010 and used after dilution with IPA in a 10:5 w/w ratio followed by ultrasound dispersion. This layer was coated at 0.8 m min−1 speed and subsequently dried for 20 min at a constant 70 °C temperature, resulting in approximately 1 μm dry thickness. For the second stack type three PEDOT:PSS layer formulations were used and coated on top of each other. Clevios F-010 was obtained by dilution with IPA in a 1:4 v/v ratio and used as a compatibilizer in order to enhance wetting properties. It was deposited at 1 m min−1 speed for a final 8 μm wet thickness. A successive layer prepared from Clevios PVP Al 4083 by dilution with IPA in a 1:2 v/v ratio was coated at 1 m min−1 speed obtaining a 23 μm wet thickness layer. The last deposited layer was Clevios F-010 used after dilution with IPA in a 2:1 v/v ratio and coated at 1 m min−1 speed giving a 38 μm thick wet layer. Finally, the devices were completed by flexographic printing of a silver grid electrode as above using PV410.44 All steps of the deposition were carried out at 70 °C. The specific coating parameters for each layer of the devices are summarized in Table 1, ESI.† The as prepared foil with the solar cells was baked at 80 °C for a period of 2 min in order to evaporate any remaining solvents. Single solar cells were cut out from the fully-stacked coated stripes into sections for application of a 1 cm2 printed top electrode. The cells were then encapsulated between two 15 × 15 mm glass slides with a UV curable epoxy resin (DELO LP655) adhesive and cured for 1 min under a solar simulator (1000 W m−2, AM1.5G). The as-prepared devices were annealed for 3 min at 130 °C before testing.

Testing and characterization
The J–V curves of the encapsulated solar cells were measured from −1 to 1 V with 50 mV steps by means of a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter and controlled by custom software. A solar simulator with the following parameters: AM1.5G, 1000 W m−2, 45 ± 5 °C, 40 ± 10% relative humidity, and a metal halide lamp was employed. An area-defining mask was used with a nominal area of 0.526 cm2. The accelerated degradation study with full sun simulation (without a UV filter) of the encapsulated cells was run with the following specifications: AM1.5G, 1000 W m−2, 85 ± 5 °C, 40 ± 10% relative humidity, and a metal halide lamp with a high UV-content. Fully automated J–V characterization was performed on devices under constant illumination with multiplexing systems controlled using a sourcemeter (Keithley 2400) and a 40 × 2 channel switching relay matrix (Keithley 2700). A custom built platform with a fixed positioning of 20 cells and alligator clips for connections was employed. The measurements were taken at 5 minute intervals over −1 to 1 V potential with 25 mV steps; the cells remained open circuit between measurements. Without the UV filter the devices operate for a significantly shorter time due to the UV-induced degradation. The samples for AFM, UV-Vis and X-ray characterization were prepared by slot-die coating of the active layer directly on a substrate foil (Melinex) and subsequent annealing at 130 °C for 3 min in a hot-air oven. AFM images were recorded at a scan speed of 1 line per second on an N8 NEOS (Bruker Nano GmbH, Herzogenrath, Germany) operating in a tapping mode using PPP-NCLR cantilevers (NANOSENSORS, Neuchatel, Switzerland). The images and data were analyzed with the software package SPIP 6.2.0 (Image Metrology A/S, Hørsholm, Denmark). UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy scans were performed on a Shimadzu UV-3600 PharmaSpec with 1 nm resolution and medium speed. The X-ray source was a Cu rotating anode (Rigaku H3R), focused and monochromatized by 2D multilayer optics (Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å). The anode was operated in fine focus mode at 40 kV/40 mA with the beam diameter collimated by 3 pin-holes to 1.0 mm at the sample position. The films were illuminated at an incidence angle of 0.35°. A two-dimensional area detector situated at 1000 mm was used to collect the scattering for the 3000 s per sample. In situ (SAXS) experiments during coating of the device layers were carried out on a custom made SAXS setup. The sample was illuminated at 11 and 14 cm distant positions of the coating front versus the X-ray beam while the substrate was moved from one roll to the other at a speed of 1 m min−1 across the hot plate set at 70 °C or 130 °C for 45 min, for drying and annealing analysis respectively. The annealing time was controlled by the roll speed and the length of the hot plate as the data acquisition was performed in the same, dynamic process as the coating (data comparison). The images and data were analyzed with WAXS package 9.4 software.45
Results and discussion
The effect of additives on the morphology during processing of the OPV's active layer ink was investigated in inverted geometry devices based on an ITO-free substrate (Flextrode).43,46 Slot-die coating was carried out using a laboratory scale roll-coater.44 The main aim of using an additive is to improve the efficiency and/or the stability, as has been previously demonstrated for solution processed spin-coated devices. These similar tests using slot-die coating as the film forming method were deemed necessary since these two techniques differ notably and the results cannot be expected to correlate directly. It is commonly known that the additives may change the surface energy and thus, markedly influence the ability to obtain a covering layer. Furthermore, the development of the nano-phase separation in the bulk heterojunction structure of the active layer (that critically influences device performance) may also be influenced differently for the two deposition techniques. Twelve additives were screened to judge their applicability during active layer deposition through slot-die coating on the roll coater. Two different final cell stacks, which varied in the hole transporting and conducting layer, were prepared and subsequently tested for each active layer ink formulation; both configurations are shown schematically in Fig. 1.
Solar cell performance
As a first approach, the additives were tested in a 5% v/v ratio of a 30:30 mg mL−1 P3HT:PCBM chlorobenzene solution. Control devices coated with 30:30 mg mL−1 P3HT:PCBM in pure chlorobenzene were used as a reference for comparison in each trial. Fluctuations in additive concentrations may occur in an up-scaled roll-to-roll process, therefore non-marginal additive amounts were chosen. The device preparation and specific coating parameters can be found in the Experimental section.
The impact of each additive was based on the device performance evaluated versus the reference is summarized in Table 1. The application of 1,8-diiodooctane, dodecane-1-thiol, heptane-1-thiol, octane-1,8-dithiol and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene gave defective inoperable devices due to coating defects such as de-wetting, picture framing and surface poisoning. Most of the other additives resulted in either no effect or a negative effect on the solar cell efficiency. An improved performance was found for devices employing 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid (BARB), and were therefore selected for further investigations; their effect on the solar cell parameters was tested at different concentrations. In order to eliminate random variables, the samples for the selected additives were prepared on the same Flextrode substrate. The foil is comprised of sectioned stripes, each of which was utilized for a specific concentration of an ink/additive formulation; both device configurations were fabricated on a given stripe. A representative set of 7 to 10 cell samples for each system were investigated electrically to obtain their J–V characteristics and subjected to an accelerated degradation test for stability measurements. Values of solar cell performance parameters, that is, power conversion efficiency (PCE), fill factor (FF), open circuit voltage (VOC) and short circuit current density (JSC), were normalized with respect to an average of reference cells without additives, Fig. 2.

 Fig. 2  Test results of solar cells processed with selected additives in P3HT:PCBM blends. Photovoltaic parameters (PCE, FF, VOC, and JSC) of the measured solar cells were normalized with respect to the reference values (horizontal solid lines). Data are presented as average values for the devices prepared with different additives as a function of the concentration; both cell architectures are shown for comparison purposes. Filled blue symbols: “5010” geometry, open symbols: “3-layer” geometry. 
A positive effect of an additive was found to be specific to one type of device layer stack, highlighting the importance for an optimized architecture. NMP was the least efficient additive with only a limited effect on the efficiency of the “5010” based geometry. CN and BARB on the other hand demonstrated a much more significant response on the “3 layer” based geometry increasing the PCE by about 18–25%. In all cases the fill factor was improved significantly, but this was to some degree offset by losses in the short circuit current density, while the open circuit voltage remained largely unaffected or increased slightly. As shown in Fig. 2, the positive effect of concentration is relatively constant for CN while the performance parameters decrease with an increasing amount of NMP additive. J–V curves and tabulated performance parameters are shown for representative solar cells fabricated with higher performing combinations of additives and concentrations as shown in Fig. 3 and in Table 2.

Incorporation of the additives in the processing solution resulted in a significant increase in the fill factor, which may point to improvements in the morphology. Regarding components within the active layer, the size and purity of their domains contribute to the charge transport and recombination.7,47 The degree of phase segregation (lateral and vertical) is also strongly influenced by the thermal treatment; it increases the crystallinity of P3HT and drives the phase separation of P3HT:PCBM.13,48 On the other hand, alterations in the active layer are further related to the slower evaporation rate of the solvent during the film deposition, allowing a prolonged crystallization time.40,42 In order to investigate the reasons behind the observed enhancement of photovoltaic properties the morphological, optical and structural characteristics of the photoactive layer were investigated by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), UV-Vis spectroscopy and Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). The film samples were prepared by slot-die coating of the polymeric layer directly on the substrate foil and subsequent annealing at 130 °C for 3 min in a hot-air oven.
Morphological characterization
The topography and the corresponding phase images (5 μm × 5 μm) together with 3D surface representation of the active layer/air interface of P3HT:PCBM blends processed with and without additives are shown in Fig. 1, ESI.† The topography images illustrate that the reference had a rather smooth surface with minor height variations. This is in a good agreement with the low surface root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 4.6 nm, whereas the images obtained from films coated with CN and NMP at 3% concentrations revealed a different matter. They presented coarser surfaces with broad, hill-like forms and a similar surface roughness of 16.1 and 17.1 nm, respectively, Table 2, ESI.† Roughening of the film surface may be an indication of the increased contact area with the electrode interface providing better charge collection.49 In contrast to the volatile additives, films processed with 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid appeared to have a smoother surface with a very low RMS of 2.4 nm. A uniform surface was also found to be beneficial for an improved adhesion at the interface with the electrode.50 The RMS surface roughness value became greater at a higher additive concentration for films coated with CN, while it was unaltered for films made with NMP and thus, an increase/decrease in photovoltaic efficiency cannot be directly attributed to the increased roughness. From the phase images of the films no clear indication of phase separation was found. The evaluation of the surface characteristics is in any case not representative of the overall morphology, since the distribution of the components can vary throughout the film.51,52 The top layer was found to consist primarily of P3HT when slot-die coating was employed as the technique for film deposition.53 Therefore, it was necessary to use other methods in order to determine the overall morphology of the active layer.
Optical characterization
The absorption spectra were normalized to the PCBM peak (335 nm), allowing a direct comparison of the changes introduced by either the presence of a processing additive or thermal post-treatment, Fig. 4. The UV-Vis spectra of the P3HT:PCBM blend films were highly structured, with peaks and shoulders identified at ca. 500, 550 and 600 nm. The first two indicate the length of the P3HT conjugation and the structural arrangement of the chain segments. The latter, originates from inter-chain transition in ordered structures and the intensity is related to the amount of π–π stacking.54,55
 Fig. 4  Absorption spectra of the annealed and non-annealed films of the P3HT:PCBM (1:1 w/w) blends processed without and with the additives. 
For the standard P3HT:PCBM blend, the vibronic features increase in intensity upon thermal annealing, in particular, the peak related to the conjugation length. A similar behavior was recognized for the samples prepared with volatile additives although, the increase was notably more pronounced in the case of NMP, especially at 500 nm. Nevertheless, the structure of the blends processed with NMP and CN, when compared to the reference, appeared highly ordered even without thermal treatment. Indeed, a comparison between annealed and non-annealed films revealed that the introduction of volatile additives gave rise to a higher intensity of the 550 and 600 nm shoulders, thus indicating an enhanced ordering of P3HT due to the additives, as seen in the non-annealed samples. This effect that co-solvent processing has on the structural features was shown for CN and NMP as volatile additives, whereas the opposite tendency can be seen for the non-volatile additive (BARB) where the spectra barely differ from those of the reference blend. After annealing the effect of the additive became less clear with the intensity of the 500 nm peak of the reference sample rising to the same level as that of the sample with CN.
Structural characterization
The trend in absorption spectra and the rough surface of the films are an indication that the use of solvent mixtures causes a higher degree of polymer ordering. The crystalline structure is an important factor in BHJ blends because it provides good channels for transport of positive charge carriers and a strong inter-molecular interaction responsible for better light absorption.56,57 It is generally known that the structural order, mostly determined by the donor polymer, results in a self-organized lamellar structure for P3HT. The layered stacking of P3HT backbones separated by the side chains, in an edge-on configuration, Fig. 2 ESI,† gives rise to a 100 peak in the Small Angle X-ray Scattering signal (normal to the surface plane).14,39,58,59 Analysis of this reflection reveals the degree of ordering of the lamellar stacking. Since the anisotropic conductivity in P3HT is favored along the π–π stacking direction, the orientation of the crystallites also affects the device parameters. Therefore, the P3HT ordering was evaluated with regard to relative crystallinity, crystallite size and orientation, and inter-layer spacing. The 2D X-ray scattering patterns, Fig. 3 ESI,† illustrate the signal for thermally treated (annealed) and as-cast (non-annealed) samples of the blend films processed with and without different additives. A high intensity in the direction of the surface normal was evident for all the samples, indicating preferential edge-on orientation (textured structures), whereas a weak azimuthal ring showed the presence of a minority population of randomly orientated crystallites (corresponding to an un-textured structure) of varying degree. An estimation of the amount of crystallinity as well as the distribution over the azimuthal angle was obtained from the peak area of the fitted curves extracted for textured and un-textured crystallites, Fig. 5A and C respectively. It revealed an increment in intensity for all the films coated with an additive, which was further increased after annealing.
 Fig. 5  Intensity distribution (dots) and Gaussian fitting (solid lines) for annealed and non-annealed samples of P3HT:PCBM blends processed with and without additives. The out-of-plane intensities were integrated along the QZ axis in 2D patterns and extracted to 1D profiles. The scattering data, containing the 100 peak intensity were integrated and examined in the 0.3–0.47 QZ range (Fig. 3, ESI†). The plots represents the integration over 70–110° corresponding to the textured crystallinity along QZ (A) and with respect to the azimuthal angle (B). The integrated sum of signals collected over 0–70° and 110–180° azimuthal angle (QZ axis at 90°) corresponding to the un-textured crystallinity (C). 
A larger spread in the azimuthal peak width, Fig. 5B and Table 3, corresponding to a wider distribution of the crystallite orientations with respect to the substrate plane, was observed for the reference film after the heating treatment. Conversely, narrowing of the reflections with concomitant increase in intensities was observed for NMP and BARB samples, whereas the CN was not influenced; it presented however, a texture analogous to the annealed reference film. The X-ray data of the textured structure, Fig. 5A and Table 3, did not reveal any significant shift of the peak position for either of the analyzed samples, annealed or as-cast, thus the d-spacing value remained constant and within the average range of 16.65 Å, in agreement with the literature values.60 The higher intensity, 25–35%, of the 100 reflection between annealed blends coated from NMP and BARB additives in comparison to their non-treated homologues, is ascribed to a larger fraction of preferred orientation (increased texture). A comparison in terms of intensity, between the reference and additive films, within the annealed and the non-annealed group, demonstrated a large increase of up to 40–50 %. An enlargement of the crystallite size was evidenced upon thermal treatment as well. Among structural parameters, calculated for the random orientations, Fig. 5C and Table 3, the shift of the peak position to lower values was observed for each sample; thus indicating a larger average inter-layer spacing of about 16.8 Å. This differs from previous SAXS experiments59 that found a smaller interlayer spacing for the untextured crystallites. The exact reason for this difference is not yet understood and is currently under investigation. The variation in the coherence length of the un-textured crystallites presented an increasing tendency between annealed and non-treated samples, similar to the textured structures; the actual sizes, however, were found to be lower by about 20–35 %. It appeared that the choice of the co-solvent and thermal processing significantly influence the morphology and the orientation of the crystallites within the film, which in turn, affects the efficiency of light absorption and device performance. In the combined analysis of the crystallinity, a detailed comparison of the structural aspects showed, for textured crystallites relative to un-textured crystallites, an increased density (smaller inter-layer spacing) and larger coherence length. Films prepared from high boiling co-solvents, resulted in a significant increase in the intensity of the first order lamellar peak. The additive appears to favor self-organization of crystallites, due to the slower evaporation rate, therefore enabling growth in films during the processing. The improved device performance can be ascribed to an enhanced amount of crystallinity in the edge-on orientation, but it is also related to a broader distribution of crystallite orientations. In fact, an equal contribution of oriented and random structures for both, annealed and non-annealed, CN samples indicated that the morphology of the blend film could improve without any thermal treatment requirement. Additional J–V and EQE characterization was carried out for comparison between as-cast and thermally treated devices prepared without and with 3% CN, Fig. 6 ESI and Table 4 ESI,† revealed that introduction of this additive in the absence of a post-processing treatment, increases the device efficiency to a similar level as the annealed one. The improvement is likely due to an analogous, prominent intensity of the 550 and 600 nm peak shoulders in the optical absorption spectrum, indicative of a highly ordered structure in comparison to the reference.

In situ structural characterization
In consideration of the above and the stability tests (degradation characterization), the best performing additive, 1-chloronaphthalene, was found to efficiently interact with the active layer components. The improvement in solar cell performance was related to a more extensive molecular ordering formed upon addition of 3% CN. As a high-boiling solvent it slows the evaporation rate during the film formation and therefore allows a prolonged crystallization time.42,46 The relationship between changes in crystallinity and solvent drying time impacts the structural morphology. The control over the morphology is highly desirable for large scale processing of OPV active layers if available as a general tool. In order to gain an understanding of structure formation within blends, it is necessary to characterize the dynamic process that occurs during the film deposition.61,62 With the purpose of studying the structural evolution, an experimental setup has been developed, Fig. 4 ESI,† allowing in situ GISAXS measurements on a film during its formation. The setup replicates the slot-die solution coating process that was utilized for solar cell preparation on a micro roll-to-roll coating machine placed in situ in the X-ray beam. The fast dynamics of crystallization were followed by the SAXS instrument focusing on the evolution of the P3HT 100 diffraction peak during continuous film coating for 45 min. Quantification of the development of crystallization and the correlation with drying time were performed for two evaporation stages corresponding to 6.5 and 8.5 s. The allowed time for solvent evaporation was modified by varying the distance between the initial deposition point and the X-ray beam. The films were deposited directly onto a PET foil substrate using the same coating parameters as for solar cell fabrication (thickness and temperature). For further investigation of the structural evolution after film deposition, measurements of the dried films and a subsequent series of annealing at 130 °C for 21, 78 and 135 s were made following the same, dynamic signal acquisition method (i.e. while rolling the coated foil from unwinder to the rewinder). Quantitative information of the structural parameters, the inter-layer spacing (d) and mean coherence length (L) of the 100 out-of-plane peaks was extracted, Table 3 ESI.†
The growth behavior during solvent evaporation shown in Fig. 6 and ESI 5 and Table 3 ESI† indicates that the first ordered P3HT edge-on lamella developed with fast kinetics, below 6.5 s. For the reference sample, the intensity of the textured structures, Fig. 6A, accounts for 65% of the one resulting from a completely dried film and for over 80% in the case of a longer evaporation time, 8.5 s. The scattering pattern for un-textured structures was already evident within the first drying of the reference film, whereas it stayed undetected during the coating with the additive until the drying at a longer evaporation time, where its intensity exceeds twice that of the reference. In fact, the use of a high-boiling additive which reduces the evaporation rates leads to a reduced crystallization rate as evident in the first drying analysis. The slower crystallization kinetics however provides higher final crystallinity as in the case of increased drying distance or dried film for both textured and un-textured crystallites. The initial annealing sharpened and moved the peak position of the textured structures to lower QZ values due to thermal expansion along the alkyl-staking direction, thus the average lattice length was longer for the annealed samples than for the drying or dried film. During successive annealing no further shift was observed, therefore, only 21 s of annealing had improved alignment of chains at this specific temperature revealing rapid morphology development of the composite film. In addition to the position variation, the diffraction intensity was greatly increased after the first annealing step, whereas the additional heating did not involve any significant changes. The comparison of the structural aspects of the dynamic in situ measurements with the static ex situ measurements, Table 3 and ESI 3† confirmed the tendency of a smaller inter-layer spacing and larger coherence length of the textured crystallites relative to un-textured ones. However, the in situ analysis showed that textured P3HT crystallites, Fig. 6A, form immediately during the deposition/drying process and grow according to the solvent evaporation rate, whereas the formation of un-textured crystallites, Fig. 6B, was highly influenced by processing with the high-boiling additive. The presence of the CN generates a final morphology of the un-textured structure after the complete solvent evaporation, while in the absence of the additive, the ultimate morphology evolves mainly upon thermal annealing. However, it appears that the evolution of the highly oriented crystallites of the CN processed samples is incomplete since the intensity was further increased upon thermal annealing, Fig. 6A, and when compared to the static ex situ analysis of the CN non-annealed samples, Fig. 5A. A plausible explanation is the prolonged contact with a 70 °C hot surface during sample preparation on a roll-coater (2 min) in relation to the coating during X-ray analysis where the contact with the hot plate was interrupted after a few seconds.

Degradation characterization
The studies dedicated to the stability of devices are crucial for the OPV integrity, however, the nature of the degradation mechanisms depends on all the components used in the multilayer stack of the solar cell.63–65 OPVs exhibit different degradation patterns, among which a fast initial decay within the first operating hours, known as burn-in, followed by stabilization and a much slower, later decline.3 The burn-in shows how much the initial performance of the cell decreases before reaching an operationally stable efficiency. Devices prepared with the three selected additives and reference samples without additives were investigated according to the ISOS-L2 protocol66 (continuous illumination, 1000 W m−2 at 85 °C) for over 20 hours to establish the short term degradation behavior. The aim was to find out if any increased/reduced degradation tendency of these devices compared to reference cells could be seen. The device types were chosen so that the additives had the most positive effect on the power conversion efficiency immediately after preparation. The “3 layer” structure was thus chosen for CN and BARB devices, while the “5010” layer type was selected for the NMP devices. Degradation curves of the PCE for each type of device at studied concentrations are shown in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  Representative examples of the normalized PCE degradation curves plotted over time. The sets of 7–10 glass-encapsulated devices fabricated with CN, BARB and NMP were tested and examined with regard to the reference. The accelerated degradation of chosen curves with specification for each parameter are shown in Fig. 7 ESI.† 
A general feature is that the devices with the “3 layer” structure had a more pronounced immediate drop than the “5010” type devices. This difference in degradation behavior is yet not explained, but is most likely related to the two different types of PEDOT:PSS hole transport layers. Remarkably, the CN additive has a protective effect, which correlates with its concentration. The devices with 3% CN had the lowest burn-in drop in PCE, while 5 and 7% devices stabilized at an intermediate PCE value compared to the reference sample that suffered the largest burn-in drop of about 30%. The major reason for the decrease in PCE is a similar behavior of the evolution of the short circuit current. The open circuit voltage also drops at the beginning, but recovers again to a higher degree, in particular for the 3% CN device. The BARB device prepared in the “3 layer” geometry had a similar burn-in feature of the degradation curve, but there was no significant difference compared to the reference cell. In this case the evolution of the VOC recovered after the burn-in period is in contrast to the reference, but similar to the 3% CN device behavior. This was however completely offset by a steady decline in the fill factor. The concentration effect of the NMP additive, used in “5010” geometry devices, was also evident in the degradation curves. The burn-in drop was relatively major for the reference sample, and was further increased with a higher concentration of the additive. This drop in PCE was caused by a concomitant evolution of the VOC, JSC and FF.
Conclusions
The application of different additives in slot-die processing with an active layer consisting of P3HT:PCBM has been investigated. The study aimed at reviewing this processing approach which was successfully employed on solar cells fabricated by other techniques than roll-coating. Only three out of twelve additives (1-chloronaphthalene (CN), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid (BARB)) had a positive effect on the device performance and were therefore studied in depth using firstly ex situ X-ray methods on the three best candidates and finally using in situ X-ray methods with a micro roll-to-roll slot-die coater installed in the X-ray beam of the system for the best candidate 1-chloronaphthalene. The type and concentration of the additive together with the effect of the thermal treatment on the optical and structural properties of the films were evaluated. The devices prepared with non-volatile BARB gave a 15% rise of PCE; surface and optical characteristics as well as the stability are similar to the reference with only a limited increase of crystallinity and without variation in the structural order, revealing possible improvement at the level of layer interfaces. A comparative study of the spectral and morphological properties of the blend systems processed with NMP and CN co-solvents revealed a stronger tendency to form more ordered structures than the films prepared from pure chlorobenzene. Devices prepared with NMP had an initial performance of 10% higher than the reference, due to higher surface roughness, enhanced absorption and an increased number of crystallites; however the burn-in drop was more severe than for the reference, thus equalizing the performance that can be achieved over time during energy production. The largest impact was found for CN which initially had a performance of 25% higher than the reference. In particular, the films prepared with 3% additive concentration present the highest photovoltaic performances and improved spectral absorbance and molecular ordering. The amount of crystallinity was greatly enhanced by the use of CN to the extent where thermal annealing had no influence, confirmed by the analysis for annealed and non-annealed films and devices. This finding has significant implications for large scale processing where slow annealing steps must be avoided. Remarkably, the CN additive yielded more stable devices with a lower degree of device degradation during operation. We also observed that relatively larger amounts of additive were required when using roll-coating as compared to the amounts expected based on literature data on spin coating.67

 	Fig. 2  Test results of solar cells processed with selected additives in P3HT:PCBM blends. Photovoltaic parameters (PCE, FF, VOC, and JSC) of the measured solar cells were normalized with respect to the reference values (horizontal solid lines). Data are presented as average values for the devices prepared with different additives as a function of the concentration; both cell architectures are shown for comparison purposes. Filled blue symbols: “5010” geometry, open symbols: “3-layer” geometry.	 

 	Fig. 3  Representative J–V curves of the devices (with an active area of 1 cm2) coated with the additives giving the improved photovoltaic performances; the reference curves are presented for comparison.

 	Fig. 4  Absorption spectra of the annealed and non-annealed films of the P3HT:PCBM (1:1 w/w) blends processed without and with the additives.	 

 	Fig. 5  Intensity distribution (dots) and Gaussian fitting (solid lines) for annealed and non-annealed samples of P3HT:PCBM blends processed with and without additives. The out-of-plane intensities were integrated along the QZ axis in 2D patterns and extracted to 1D profiles. The scattering data, containing the 100 peak intensity were integrated and examined in the 0.3–0.47 QZ range (Fig. 3, ESI†). The plots represents the integration over 70–110° corresponding to the textured crystallinity along QZ (A) and with respect to the azimuthal angle (B). The integrated sum of signals collected over 0–70° and 110–180° azimuthal angle (QZ axis at 90°) corresponding to the un-textured crystallinity (C).

 	Fig. 6  Intensity distribution (dots) and Gaussian fitting (solid lines) for samples of P3HT:PCBM blends processed without and with the 3% CN additive. The plots represent 1D profiles extracted from SAXS in 2D patterns (Fig. 5, ESI†) for in situ measurements of film drying for 6.5 s (Drying I) and 8.5 s (Drying II) at 70 °C; post-deposition ex situ measurements of an ultimately dried film (Dry) and three subsequent film annealing times of 21 s (Annealing I), 78 s (Annealing II) and 135 s (Annealing III) at 130 °C. Evolution of textured (A) and un-textured (B) crystallinity. Note: no data plot for the Drying I CN 3% un-textured structure.	 

 	Fig. 7  Representative examples of the normalized PCE degradation curves plotted over time. The sets of 7–10 glass-encapsulated devices fabricated with CN, BARB and NMP were tested and examined with regard to the reference. The accelerated degradation of chosen curves with specification for each parameter are shown in Fig. 7 ESI.†
