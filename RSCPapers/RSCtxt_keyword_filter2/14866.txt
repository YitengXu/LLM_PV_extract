    AbstractThis paper describes a solvothermal approach to synthesize CuInS2 quantum dots (QDs) and demonstrates their application as a potential electron accepting material for polymer-based hybrid solar cells, for the first time. The CuInS2 QDs with a size of 2–4 nm are synthesized by the solvothermal method with 4-bromothiophenol (HSPh) as both reduction and capping agents, and characterized by XRD, XPS, TEM, FT-IR, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and absorption and photoluminescence spectra. Results reveal that the CuInS2 QDs result from the solvothermal decomposition of a soluble organic sodium salt as an intermediate precursor formed by simple reactions among CuCl2, InCl3, HSPh and Na2S at room temperature; they have an ionization potential (IP) of −5.8 eV and an electron affinity (EA) of −4.0 eV and can quench effectively the luminescence of poly(2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene) (MEH-PPV). Due to the favorable IP and EA positions with respect to MEH-PPV, the CuInS2 QDs act as an effective electron acceptor for the hybrid solar cells based on MEH-PPV/CuInS2-QDs blends with a wide spectral response extending from 300 to 900 nm, by allowing the efficient charge separation for neutral excited states produced either on the polymer or on the QDs. The MEH-PPV/CuInS2-QDs solar cells exhibit a promising open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.62 V under the monochromic illumination of 15.85 mW cm−2 at 470 nm. The charge transfer processes in the solar cells are also described.
1. Introduction
Due to the quantum size effects such as the slower rates of exciton cooling and multiple exciton generation and the concentrated photogenerated carriers in the reduced dimensions, the solar cells based on semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) with radii smaller than that of the Bohr exciton of the material are predicted to have a maximum attainable thermodynamic conversion efficiency up to 66%.1 A typical strategy for photovoltaic purpose is to use the QDs (e.g., CdS, CdSe, InP, InAs and PbS) as sensitizer on metal oxide (e.g., TiO2, ZnO and SnO2) nanostructures to harvest light,2 in analogy to dye-sensitized solar cells.3 Polymer-based solar cells consisting of a conjugated polymer and nanocrystals are attractive for low-cost, large area and even flexible solar cells.4,5 Most polymer-based solar cells in a bulk architecture have been made by using (6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the electron acceptor,4 providing the organic solar cells with a power conversion efficiency (η) up to 5%; while using inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals as the electron acceptor leads to the so-called hybrid solar cells.5 The hybrid solar cells are promising for future photovoltaic devices, even though the state-of-the-art efficiency of them (η = 2–3%)5,6 is still rather lower than a polymer/PCBM system. On one hand, they combine the unique properties of inorganic semiconductors (e.g., high electron mobility, high electron affinity and good stability) with the good film-forming property of conjugated polymers; moreover, the size and shape, the crystallographic structure and the optoelectronic property of semiconductor nanocrystals can be tailored individually during the synthesis process before the organic polymer is incorporated.7 However, one of the major limiting factors leading to low efficiency of polymer-based solar cells is the narrow absorption band of conjugated polymers. Dispersion of inorganic semiconductor QDs with a small band gap in organic semiconductor polymer matrices may offer hybrid materials with complementary absorption spectra in the visible spectrum,8 which is of potential for the development of next generation photovoltaic devices.5,9 However, only a few reports on such hybrid devices are available in the cases of CdSe,8,10 PbSe or PbS11 QDs in combination with either poly(2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene) (MEH-PPV) or poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT).
Copper indium disulfide (CuInS2) has a small direct band gap of 1.5 eV that matches well the solar spectrum, a large absorption coefficient (α = 5 × 105 cm−1) and a low toxicity, and is regarded to be a promising light-absorbing material for solar cells.12 The Wannier-Mott bulk exciton Bohr radius of CuInS2 is 4 nm.13 Several methods are available for preparation of CuInS2 nanoparticles smaller than 5 nm, including thermal decomposition of a single-source precursor,14 photochemical decomposition of single-source precursors,15 microwave assistant decomposition of single-source precursors,16 solvent thermolysis of organometallic precursors,17 and surfactant-assisted chemical reactions.13,18 However, these methods generally result in chalcopyrite CuInS2. Recently, Pan and coworkers19 obtained zincblende and wurtzite CuInS2 by hot-injection of organometallic precursors, and the particle size can be tuned to around 5 nm by temperature and capping agent amounts. It is well known that a solvothermal technique is a convenient method to prepare nanocrystals, but this method generally produces the CuInS2 nanoparticles larger than 12 nm.20 Previously, we showed a solvothermal approach for the synthesis of chalcopyrite CuInS2 nanoparticles with a size of 7–10 nm.20 Herein, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, we report the synthesis of zincblende CuInS2 QDs with a size of 2–4 nm by a solvothermal strategy and demonstrate that the CuInS2 QDs can act as an effective electron acceptor for polymer-based hybrid solar cells with a wide spectral response extending from 300 to 900 nm. The data summarized in this paper show the promise of the solvothermal route to prepare CuInS2 QDs, and provide, in the long run, a potential quantum dot material candidate for low-cost and high-efficiency solar cell fabrication.
It should be identified that the solvothermal method for preparation of the zincblende CuInS2 QDs in the present study is significantly different from the one for the synthesis of chalcopyrite CuInS2 nanoparticles in our previous paper.20 Besides the different chemicals used and the different products, the crystal growth mechanisms in these two cases are quite different, that is, the growth of the CuInS2 nanoparticles20 involves the formation of Cu2+-thiourea complex, the reduction of Cu2+ produced from decomposition of the complex by H2S generated from thiourea, and the crystallization of Cu+, S2− and In3+ under the slow supply of In3+ ions; while the CuInS2 QDs are grown from the solvothermal decomposition of a soluble organic sodium salt as an intermediate precursor formed by simple chemicals at room temperature.
On the other hand, the polymer-based hybrid solar cells in the present study consist of the blends of MEH-PPV and CuInS2 QDs (i.e., MEH-PPV/CuInS2-QDs). It is necessary to give an introduction to the study on the hybrid solar cells based on the blends of CuInS2 nanoparticles and conjugated polymers. Up to now, the reports on polymer/CuInS2 nanoparticle solar cells are quite rare.21,22 Arici and coworker21 fabricated the devices using the blend of elongated chalcopyrite CuInS2 nanoparticles (7 nm × 15 nm) obtained by a colloidal route and stabilized with triphenyl phosphite (TPP), in combination with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), and obtained an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.15 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 4 μA cm−2 and an efficiency η of 0.003% at AM 1.5 illumination (80 mW cm−2); Piber and coworkers22 prepared the MEH-PPV/CuInS2 nanoparticle blend devices, using the CuInS2 nanoparticles (capped with TPP, but the size and crystalline phase of CuInS2 particles were not specified) produced by a colloidal route, and the devices exhibited the Voc, Jsc and η of 0.36–0.48 V, 2.7–46.6 μA cm−2 and 0.0004–0.011%, respectively, depending on the blend composition. Note that, known from the cited literature23 for the synthesis procedure, the CuInS2 nanoparticles in ref. 22 were synthesized by the colloidal route same to the description in ref. 21. Obviously, the MEH-PPV/CuInS2-QDs solar cells in the present study are significantly different from the similarly structured MEH-PPV/CuInS2 nanoparticle devices previously reported by others22 in the aspects of both device constructions (LiF/Al is used as a counter electrode in our solar cells but the Ca/Al electrode was used in ref. 22) and CuInS2 nanostructures.
2. Experimental
Chemicals
Copper(II) chloride (CuCl2) (Acros, 99%), 4-bromothiophenol (HSPh) (Alfa-Aesar, 98%), lithium fluoride (LiF) (Alfa-Aesar, 99.99%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) (Aldrich, 96%), PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P HC V4, H. C. Starck) and MEH-PPV (average Mn = 40000–70000, Aldrich) were commercially obtained. Other chemicals, including indium chloride (InCl3•4H2O, AR), sodium sulfide (Na2S•9H2O, AR), ethanol (AR) and chlorobenzene (AR), were purchased from the Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co, Ltd. All the chemicals were used as received without further purification, except for the distillation of chlorobenzene under reduced pressure before use.
Synthesis of CuInS2 QDs
CuCl2 (0.1 mmol) and InCl3•4H2O (0.1 mmol) were dissolved in 35 mL absolute ethanol under stirring for 5 min at room temperature, resulting in a blue solution. Then, HSPh (1.2 mmol) was added into the blue solution and stirred for 10 min, leading to the formation of a yellow dispersion. Afterwards, Na2S•9H2O (0.4 mmol) in 15 mL ethanol was added to the dispersion and stirred for 10 min, when the mixture turned into a brown-colored solution. Finally, the brown solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (capacity 60 mL) and maintained at 200 °C for 16 h. After the autoclave naturally cooled to room temperature, the product was collected by centrifugation (16000–20000 rpm, 10 min), washed several times with absolute ethanol and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 6 h.
Assembly of solar cells
Solar cells were constructed by using the CuInS2 QDs in combination with MEH-PPV. A PEDOT:PSS layer was first spin-coated on an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate (≤ 15 Ω/∀, Shenzhen Laibao Hi-Tech Co., Ltd, China) from the PEDOT:PSS suspension that was passed through a 0.8 μm filter in ambient conditions, and dried at 140 °C for 30 min in vacuum, which provided a substrate with a PEDOT:PSS layer of ca. 40 nm in thickness. Then, a MEH-PPV/CuInS2-QDs photoactive layer was deposited from chlorobenzene (with MEH-PPV content of 4 mg mL−1) over the PEDOT:PSS layer by spin-coating. Afterward, an additional thin layer of the CuInS2 QDs in ethanol (4 mg mL−1) was spin-coated over the photoactive layer, as a hole blocking layer.6 Finally, a 1.0 nm LiF and 100 nm Al film was subsequently deposited onto the CuInS2 layer by thermal evaporation. The devices were transferred into a glovebox (O2 < 1 ppm, H2O < 1 ppm) for sealing.
Characterization and instruments
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded on a MXP18AHF X-ray diffractometer with monochromated Cu-Kα irradiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were performed on a JEOL-2010 microscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed on an ESCALAB 250 XPS, using an Al Kα X-rays as the excitation source, and all the XPS peaks were calibrated by using C1s (284.60 eV) as the reference. FT-IR spectra of the samples in KBr pellets were recorded on a Nicolet Magna-IR™ 750 spectrometer with a maximum resolution of 0.1 cm−1. Cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements were performed on an IM6e electrochemical workstation (Zahner Co., Germany) in N2 atmosphere at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, with a platinum counter electrode. In the CV measurements, tetrabutylammonium perchlorate dissolved in acetonitrile (0.1 M) was used as supporting electrolyte, and the potential (E) was recorded versus Ag/AgCl reference electrode; the working electrode was prepared by drying ca. 20 μL CuInS2 QDs dispersion (10 mg mL−1) in an ethanol–water mixture (2/3 in volume) on a carbon substrate.
The film samples of MEH-PPV and MEH-PPV/CuInS2-QDs blends for study of optical properties were spin-coated (1500 rpm, 60 s) on freshly cleaned quartz substrates from chlorobenzene solutions with a MEH-PPV concentration of 4 mg mL−1, where the solutions for the blend samples were the same to those for the cell assembly. Prior to the measurements, the films were kept in vacuum overnight at room temperature. Absorption spectra were recorded under ambient conditions on a UV 2550 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu); while photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured under ambient conditions on a F–7000 spectrofluorometer (Hitachi) with an excitation at 400 nm.
The current–voltage (J–V) properties of the photovoltaic devices were measured by controlled intensity modulated photo spectroscopy (CIMPS) (Zahner Co., Germany) in ambient conditions under illumination through the ITO glass side, using a blue light-emitting diode (LED) as the light source (BLL01, λmax = 470 nm, spectral half-width = 25 nm, Zahner Co.) driven by a frequency response analyzer, and the light intensity of 15.85 mW cm−2 was controlled by the bias voltage at the LED with a proportionality factor FP = 135.7 W/(m2 V), which has been calibrated by using an IL1400A photometer with a SEL 033/W detector (International Light, Inc., USA). The effective illumination area of a cell was 0.04 cm2 and Al was used as the negative electrode.
Incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the solar cells were measured on a QE/IPCE Measurement Kit (Newport, USA), all the kit components were automatically controlled by Oriel® Tracq Basic V5.0 software. The light from a 300 W xenon lamp was focused through a monochromator (74125 Oriel Cornerstone 260 1/4 m) onto the solar cell under test, and the monochrometer was incremented through the spectral range (300–900 nm) to generate a photocurrent action spectrum with a sampling interval of 10 nm and a current sampling time of 2 s, where the light intensity and the photocurrent generated were measured with a 2931-C dual channel power/current meter and a 71675 calibrated UV silicon photodetector.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of CuInS2 QDs

Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern and TEM results of the as-synthesized CuInS2 nanocrystals. Different from the previously reported CuInS2 nanoparticles obtained by the solvothermal approach20 or by the decomposition of organometallic precursors,14–18 the powder XRD pattern of the synthesized product (Fig. 1a) does not match the chalcopyrite CuInS2 (JCPDS 85-1575), but matches well the zincblende CuInS2.19 The results of XRD analysis reveal broad diffraction peaks, for example, with the full width half maximum (FWHM) of (111) peak to be 3.1°. The size (S) of the nanocrystals is calculated to be ca. 2.6 nm by the Scherrer formula S = Kλ(Bcosθ)−1, where K is a constant (0.9), λ the wavelength of the X-ray (1.54056 Å), B the FWHM (in radians), and θ the Bragg angle of the (111) peak. The CuInS2 QDs exhibited a good solubility in common solvents such as ethanol and chlorobenzene and showed a black color due to their strong absorbance for visible light (insets to Fig. 1a). The TEM image (Fig. 1b) reveals that the nanoparticles have a diameter of 2–4 nm, which is very close to the size calculated from the XRD measurement, and the selected area electron diffraction pattern of these particles is consistent with the XRD data. The lattice fringes in the high resolution TEM image are separated by 0.32 nm, which matches the spacing distance of the (111) planes of zincblende CuInS2 nanocrystals.

The calculated XRD pattern of zincblende CuInS2 [F-43m, a = b = c = 5.523(0) Å] was based on the data in ref. 19. The insets to (a) show the obtained powder sample and its dispersion in chlorobenzene after 1 day. 
In order to get more accurate information on composition, the XPS measurements of the as-synthesized CuInS2 QDs were carried out, as shown in Fig. 2. The survey spectrum (Fig. 2a) indicates the presence of Cu, In, S, and C as well. The C is likely due to the capping agents and the contamination as a result of the sample exposure to atmosphere. Note, the binding energies of Br3d (69 eV) and Br3p (182–190 eV) were also weakly observed on the survey XPS spectrum,24 indicating the faint amount of HSPh or −SPh groups present on the QDs. The Cu2p, In3d, and S2p core levels were examined, respectively, to reveal the valence state and atomic ratio. The core level spectrum of Cu2p (Fig. 2b) is split into Cu2p3/2 (932.3 eV) and Cu2p1/2 (952.1 eV), corresponding to the Cu+ but different from the Cu2p3/2 satellite peak of Cu2+ centered at 942 eV.25 Therefore, only Cu+ exists in the QDs and the starting Cu2+ has been reduced during the course of reactions. The In3d core level spectrum (Fig. 2c) exhibits a strong In3d5/2 peak at 445.0 eV, which is related to the In3d5/2 binding energy for CuInS2.24 Moreover, the S2p core level spectrum (Fig. 2d) has two peaks at 161.9 eV for Cu–S and at 163.1 eV for In–S, which are separated by an energy difference of 1.2 eV that is the same to that for CuInS2.24 The XPS data of our sample agree well with the previous reports on CuInS2.19,26 The quantification of those peaks gives the stoichiometric ratio of Cu:In:S as 1.1:1:1.5. Based on the XRD, TEM and XPS data, it can be concluded that the zincblende CuInS2 QDs with a size of 2–4 nm have been successfully synthesized by a facile solvothermal approach.

In our experiments, the formation of a yellow dispersion was observed after the addition of 4-bromothiophenol (HSPh), and the dispersion was then changed into a brown solution upon the addition of Na2S. The color changes indicate the distinct chemical reactions occurred during preparation of the reaction mixture for the solvothermal process. It has been demonstrated that thiols can reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I),27 which was also indicated by the disappearance of the blue color of the Cu2+ solution upon addition of HSPh in our experiments and by the XPS data of the final product (Fig. 2b). In order to get insight into the mechanism for the growth of CuInS2 QDs, the products at the different stages of synthesis reactions were analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 3. The solid in the dispersion formed after addition of HSPh to the starting solution was isolated from solvent by centrifugation and washed thoroughly with ethanol, offering an intermediate (I). FT–IR spectrum of the intermediate (I) exhibits the main vibration bands of HSPh except for the vibration band of H–S group at 2564 cm−1 (curve b). Others15,18b have shown previously that thiols (HSR) can react with Cu+ and In3+ into a CuIn(SR)n complex, and the similar IR results were also observed for the CuIn(SR)n formed by dodecanethiol.18b It is believed that, in our case, the thiol (i.e., HSPh) first reduced the Cu2+ into Cu+ at room temperature, and then the excess HSPh reacted with Cu+ and In3+ into the intermediate (I) CuIn(SPh)n that was not soluble in ethanol, resulting in a yellow-colored dispersion. According to the change of the yellow CuIn(SPh)n dispersion into a brown solution, it is deduced that the CuIn(SPh)n has reacted with Na2S into another molecular intermediate (II). After drying the solution formed by the reaction between CuIn(SPh)n and Na2S, the intermediate (II) in solid state was obtained. Experimental observations revealed that the intermediate (II) is soluble in both water and ethanol, of which the FT–IR spectrum (curve c) resembles the CuIn(SPh)n complex (curve b). These results indicate that the formation of a sodium salt NaCuInS(SPh)m is very likely, as the result of the reaction between CuIn(SPh)n and Na2S. Therefore, the growth of CuInS2 QDs reasonably involves the formation of intermediates CuIn(SPh)n and NaCuInS(SPh)m, where the second soluble molecular intermediate acts as a precursor and decomposes into CuInS2 particles at the solvothermal temperature. The final CuInS2 QDs also remarkably exhibit the main vibration bands (at 1467, 1005 and 810 cm−1) of HSPh, except for the vibration band of the H–S group at 2564 cm−1 (curve d), which suggests that –SPh groups on the crystals act as capping agent to limit the growth of CuInS2 QDs into a larger size during the solvothermal process.15 The formation process of the CuInS2 QDs can be depicted by Fig. 4. This mechanism is obviously different from that for the chalcopyrite CuInS2 nanoparticles (7–10 nm) produced from different chemicals by a solvothermal route in our previous reports.20

3.2 Properties of CuInS2 QDs

Fig. 5 shows the absorption spectrum of the as-synthesized CuInS2 QDs in ethanol, typically exhibiting a broad shoulder with a trail in the long-wavelength direction, similar to the CuInS2 QDs synthesized by the decomposition of a single-source or organometallic precursors.16–19 Using the direct band gap method, that is, plotting the squared absorbance versus energy and extrapolating to zero (inset to Fig. 5a),28 the band gap of the CuInS2 QDs is evaluated to be ca. 1.74 eV, which agrees with the theoretical expectation on CuInS2 quantum dots29 and the experimental results of the CuInS2 QDs obtained by surfactant-assisted chemical reactions.18b

As a semiconductor, the optical properties of the CuInS2 QDs are of great importance for the optoelectronic applications. For example, in the polymer-based solar cells on the basis of conducting polymer/nanocrystal composites, the charge transfer between the conducting polymer and the nanocrystals is crucial for such devices, for which the bands of the polymer and the nanocrystals have to possess favorable positions. In the CV measurements of conjugated polymers, the measured oxidation potential correlates directly with the ionization potential (IP) or the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, while the reduction potential with the electron affinity (EA) or the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level.30 As long as the vacuum level potentials of the common reference electrodes are known, the band edge positions of conjugated polymers can be easily determined according to the CV data. Previous results have shown that the CV measurements are also helpful for determination of the IP and EA of nanoparticles.31 With Ag/AgCl reference electrode, it is expected that the nanoparticles have IP = −(Eox + 4.72) eV and EA = −(Ered + 4.72) eV, where Eox and Ered are the onset potentials of oxidation and reduction peaks. The value of 4.72 was obtained by the vacuum level potential of the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) (i.e., 0 V vs. NHE ≈ 4.5 eV vs. vacuum) and the potential of the Ag/AgCl electrode versus NHE (0 V vs. Ag/AgCl ≈ 0.22 V vs. NHE).32Fig. 5b shows the cyclic voltammogram of the as-synthesized CuInS2 QDs. The voltammogram exhibits an oxidation onset at ca. 1.08 V and a reduction onset at ca. −0.72 V versus Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Therefore, the IP and EA levels of the CuInS2 QDs are calculated to be −5.8 eV and −4.0 eV, respectively. The electrochemical band gap agrees well with the optical data (Fig. 5a). The HOMO and LUMO levels of macroscopic CuInS2 are about −5.6 eV and −4.1 eV,21 providing a band gap of 1.5 eV. As compared to the bulk CuInS2, the band gap of our CuInS2 QDs is blue-shifted due to the quantum size effect.29

Fig. 6 shows the absorption and PL spectra of the blends of MEH-PPV and the as-synthesized CuInS2 QDs in films, with different MEH-PPV/CuInS2-QDs weight ratios (R). The absorption spectra of these blends (Fig. 6a) show that the relative contribution of the CuInS2 absorbance increases, with comparison to the π–π* band of MEH-PPV in the 400–600 nm region, upon increasing the concentration of CuInS2 QDs in the blend. The absorption spectra are simply the sum of the absorption spectra of MEH-PPV and CuInS2 components without evidence of any additional absorption peaks in the spectral range measured (300–850 nm), which indicates that there is negligible ground-state charge-transfer between the polymer and the nanocrystals.10aFig. 6b shows the PL spectra of the MEH-PPV/CuInS2-QDs blends as a function of CuInS2 concentration in films. The PL spectra of the blends display the emission profiles similar to the pristine MEH-PPV, which suggests that the remaining the luminescence is due to the radiative decay of the excitons from the polymer; in particular, a similar conformation of the polymer is indicated for all the films, because a change in the conformation of MEH-PPV polymer chains can give rise to a variation in PL spectrum.33 The PL quenching efficiency was determined by comparing the maximum emission intensities of the blend samples to that of the pristine MEH-PPV sample. As the concentration of the CuInS2 QDs increases from 50 wt% (R = 1/1) to 83 wt% (R = 1/5), the yield of the MEH-PPV luminescence decreases substantially by from 30% to 70% in film. The emission quenching indicates an effective energy transfer from the polymer to the CuInS2 QDs.6,34,35

The presence of the –SPh capping groups may form a barrier for the energy transfer from polymer to QDs.10a The as-synthesized CuInS2 QDs were treated with TBP at 60–80 °C before incorporating with the polymer. Fig. 7a compares the quenching efficiency of the CuInS2 QDs before and after TBP-treatment at R = 1/1. The TBP-treatment results in an increase by 23% in the quenching efficiency. Fig. 7b shows the FT–IR spectrum of the TBP-treated CuInS2 QDs in comparison with that of the as-synthesized QDs, along with the spectra for TBP and HSPh. After the TBP-treatment, the major part of –SPh capping groups was removed from the dots, as is indicated by the greatly reduced vibration bands of HSPh at 1467 and 810 cm−1. On the other hand, absence of the vibration bands of TBP (e.g., at 1598, 712 and 570 cm−1) suggests that almost no TBP is adsorbed on the TBP-treated QDs. Therefore, the TBP treatment removes the major part of the –SPh groups on the dots and enhances the energy transfer efficiency at the polymer/CuInS2 interface. Note that the crystalline phase composition and morphological structure of the preformed CuInS2 QDs were not affected by the TBP treatment, as indicated by the XRD and TEM characterization (not documented here).

CIS and T-CIS represent the as-synthesized and TBP-treated CuInS2 QDs, respectively. The TBP treatment was carried out by keeping the CuInS2 QDs in an ethanol solution of TBP at 60–80 °C for 16 h, followed by washing thoroughly with ethanol and drying under vacuum at 60 °C for 6 h. 
3.3 Solar cells
PL results (Fig. 6b and 7a) have revealed that there is an effective energy transfer from MEH-PPV to CuInS2 QDs. We fabricated the MEH-PPV/CuInS2 hybrid solar cells, by spin-casting a solution of MEH-PPV and CuInS2 QDs in chlorobenzene onto indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates coated with PEDOT:PSS with aluminium as the top contact (inset to Fig. 8). Fig. 8 shows the J–V curves of such devices with a weight ratio of R = 1/1 under monochromatic illumination of 15.85 mW cm−2 at 470 nm. Table 1 presents the overall photovoltaic performance of these devices.36 The device with the as-synthesized CuInS2 QDs exhibits a Voc of 0.35 V, which is comparable to the similarly structured devices consisting of MEH-PPV and CuInS222 or CdTe37 nanoparticles, but significantly higher than the Voc (= 0.14 V) of the devices based on the Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) film of P3HT-coated CdSe quantum dots (P3HT–CdSe QDs).10d For comparison, the TBP-treated CuInS2 QDs were also used for the solar cell. After the TBP-treatment, the Voc, Jsc and IPCE values of the device are significantly improved, while its FF (≈ 23%) remains almost unchanged. The enhanced Voc value (0.62 V) is comparable to the devices based on the MEH-PPV/CdSe QDs blends under monochromatic illumination,10a to the P3HT/CdSe QDs10c and polymer/PCBM4 blends under AM 1.5 illumination, and even to the thin film CuInS2/CdS devices.38 Even though the Jsc value of 7.76 μA cm−2 is comparable to the reported MEH-PPV/CuInS2 nanoparticle devices22 and much higher than the devices of MEH-PPV/CdSe QDs blends,10a our Jsc is relatively lower than the P3HT–CdSe QDs LB film,10d P3HT/CdSe QDs blends10c and P3HT/PCBM blend39 devices under AM 1.5 illumination. The J–V characterization suggests that the removal of the –SPh groups on the surface of CuInS2 QDs improves the device performance, which agrees with the PL quenching data (Fig. 7a). In the tested range, the highest performance of the devices was obtained at the weight ratio of R = 1, which is a bit different from the normal 80 wt% PCBM in the polymer/PCBM devices.4c

J–V curves for the solar cells based on the blends of MEH-PPV and CuInS2 QDs at R = 1/1 under monochromatic illumination of 15.85 mW cm−2 at 470 nm. The inset shows the device architecture. CIS and T-CIS represent the as-synthesized and TBP-treated CuInS2 QDs, respectively. 
The photocurrent action spectrum of a photovoltaic device is normally plotted in terms of IPCE at different wavelengths. Fig. 9 shows the IPCE spectra of the MEH-PPV/CuInS2-QDs devices. The IPCE values at 470 nm for the as-synthesized (CIS, 0.038%) and TBP-treated (T-CIS, 0.101%) CuInS2 QDs are comparable to the data obtained from the J–V measurements (Table 1). The devices have a very broad spectral response extending from 300 to 900 nm, with a shape almost identical with the absorption spectrum of CuInS2 QDs (Fig. 5a). The response in the region 600–900 nm, where there is no absorption in the MEH-PPV (Fig. 6a), corresponds to the contribution from the absorption of the CuInS2 QDs; while the response below 600 nm is a combination of absorption in the MEH-PPV and in the CuInS2 QDs.8,10a,11 It is obvious that the CuInS2 QDs are photovoltaic active in the devices to expand the absorption spectrum from 300 to 900 nm for photocurrent generation.
 Fig. 9  IPCE spectra for the solar cells based on the blends of MEH-PPV and CuInS2 QDs at R = 1/1, where CIS and T-CIS have the same meanings to those in Fig. 8. The inset schematically illustrates the energy level diagram for the devices based on the MEH-PPV and CuInS2 QDs, showing the charge transfers of electrons to CuInS2 and holes to MEH-PPV, in which the exciton transfer as indicated by the blue dotted arrow represents a possible process for the energy loss of polymer exciton. 
The inset to Fig. 9 shows a schematic energy level diagram for the MEH-PPV/CuInS2-QDs devices. The IP and EA levels of CuInS2 QDs are given by the CV data (Fig. 5). The HOMO (−5.3 eV) and LUMO (−3.0 eV) for MEH-PPV, and the work function values for ITO (−4.8 eV), Al (−4.3 eV) and PEDOT:PSS (−5.1 eV) are adopted by referring to the previous reports.40 Efficient current generation in a solar cell requires the charge carriers to be collected by the device electrodes. Hence, the neutral excitons generated by photoexcitation need to be separated into free charge carriers, which are then transported through the device to the electrodes without recombining with oppositely charged carriers. It is necessary to gain an understanding of the charge transfer processes involved in the MEH-PPV/CuInS2-QDs photovoltaic devices.
Three charge transfer processes in the MEH-PPV/CuInS2-QDs devices are expected according to the energy levels and optical properties of material components and the action spectra of the devices. First, as the EA position of MEH-PPV is higher than that of the CuInS2 QDs, the MEH-PPV/CuInS2 interface is energetically favorable for the dissociation of excitons photogenerated in MEH-PPV, resulting in the energy transfer from polymer to CuInS2 QDs (Fig. 6b) with the electrons to be injected into the CuInS2 QDs as acceptor and the holes to remain in the polymer as donor, as is similar to the well demonstrated cases of polymer/TiO26 or polymer/ZnO35 interfaces. Second, as indicated by the action spectra (Fig. 9), CuInS2 QDs are excited together with the excitation of MEH-PPV, which will lead to the injection of holes onto the polymer and the electrons remaining on the CuInS2 QDs.10a Third, since there is a good overlap between the MEH-PPV emission spectrum and the absorption spectrum of CuInS2 QDs (Fig. 5a and 6), the exciton transfer from MEH-PPV onto CuInS2 QDs is possible. Considering the presence of capping agents on the CuInS2 QDs even after the TBP treatments (Fig. 7b), the exciton transfer from MEH-PPV to CuInS2 QDs is very likely by the Förster mechanism.10a,34 Following the exciton transfer, a hole is injected from the CuInS2 QDs onto the polymer with an electron remaining on the QDs, similar to the charge transfer due to the absorption consequence of the CuInS2 QDs. The various electron and exciton transfer processes that occur in the MEH-PPV/CuInS2-QDs devices are depicted by the arrows in the inset to Fig. 9.
All those transfer processes produce a charge-separated state with electrons on the CuInS2 QDs and holes on the polymer; then, the electrons are transferred through the network of CuInS2 QDs toward the Al electrode, while the holes diffuse within the polymer toward ITO. Therefore, the CuInS2 QDs act as an effective electron acceptor, as well as an electron transporter, for the MEH-PPV/CuInS2-QDs solar cells with a wide spectral response extending from 300 to 900 nm, by allowing the efficient charge separation for neutral excited states produced either on MEH-PPV or on the QDs. Obviously, due to the favorable IP and EA positions with respect to the polymers such as MEH-PPV40a and P3HT (HOMO = −5.2, LUMO = −3.3 eV),4e,41 the CuInS2 QDs are expected to access the potential polymer/CuInS2-QDs composite materials with a widely expanded absorption spectrum for polymer-based hybrid solar cells.
It should be noted that the performance of the polymer-based solar cells in this study, in particular Jsc, is not high enough. The low performance may be rationalized as follows. First, the energy transfer efficiency from the polymer to the QDs in the solid state is still rather low, as is indicated by the PL quenching efficiencies (ca. 30–60%) (Fig. 6b and 7a). Due to the high surface energy, the serious aggregation of the QDs in the polymer matrix may occur, in spite of a good dispersibility in solvents, which will reduce polymer/CuInS2 interfacial area for energy transfer and not favor the formation of interpenetrating network for charge transport as well. As indicated by the FT-IR results (Fig. 7b), there are still some –SPh groups as capping agents on the QDs even after the TBP-treatment, this will not facilitate the charge transfer from the polymer to the QDs and among the QDs.10a,42 Second, the low Jsc indicates that the collection efficiency of the photogenerated electrons may be not high. We envision that, for a higher power conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic devices based on the CuInS2 QDs, it is necessary to carry out the interfacial modification of quantum dots,42 the application of a suitable photoelectrode for charge transport and the optimization of device fabrication, as is well demonstrated in the cases of poymer/PCBM,4,43 polymer/inorganic nanocrystals5,9 and other QDs;2,10 in particular, the aligned photoelectrode2d,44 may help to realize the CuInS2 QDs photovoltaic devices with a high efficiency.
4. Conclusion
CuInS2 QDs with a size of 2–4 nm have been successfully synthesized by a facile solvothermal approach with 4-bromothiophenol (HSPh) as reduction and capping agents. Results indicate that the growth of CuInS2 QDs involves the solvothermal decomposition of a soluble molecular intermediate NaCuInS(SPh)m formed by simple chemicals (e.g., CuCl2, InCl3, HSPh and Na2S) at room temperature. The CuInS2 QDs have an ionization potential (IP) of −5.8 eV and an electron affinity (EA) of −4.0 eV, and quench effectively the luminescence of MEH-PPV. Due to the favorable IP and EA positions with respect to the MEH-PPV, the CuInS2 QDs act as an effective electron acceptor for the hybrid solar cells based on the MEH-PPV/CuInS2-QDs blends with a wide spectral response extending from 300 to 900 nm, by allowing the efficient charge separation for neutral excited states produced either on the polymers or on the QDs. The MEH-PPV/CuInS2-QDs solar cells exhibit a promising Voc up to 0.62 V under monochromic illumination, even though the short circuit current is not high enough, after a treatment of the CuInS2 QDs with 4-tert-butylpyridine which enhances the efficiency of the energy transfer from polymer to QDs and the solar cell performance by removing the major part of capping agent on the QDs. The results here demonstrate the promise of the solvothermal approach to prepare CuInS2 QDs; in the long run, this work may provide a potential QD material candidate for low-cost and high-efficiency solar cell fabrication.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  XRD pattern (a) and TEM results (b) of the as-synthesized CuInS2 nanocrystals. The calculated XRD pattern of zincblende CuInS2 [F-43m, a = b = c = 5.523(0) Å] was based on the data in ref. 19. The insets to (a) show the obtained powder sample and its dispersion in chlorobenzene after 1 day.	 

 	Fig. 2  XPS spectra of the as-synthesized CuInS2 QDs. (a) Survey spectrum, (b) Cu2p spectrum, (c) In3d spectrum, and (d) S2p spectrum. The inset to (a) is the magnified survey spectrum in the range of 40–100 eV, where the dot identifies the Br3d peak at 69 eV.	 

 	Fig. 3  FTIR spectra of (a) 4-bromothiophenol, (b) intermediate (I) [CuIn(SPh)n], (c) intermediate (II) [NaCuInS(SPh)m], and (d) the as-synthesized CuInS2 QDs.	 

 	Fig. 4  Schematic illustration for the growth of CuInS2 quantum dots.	 

 	Fig. 5  Absorption spectrum (0.04 mg mL−1 in ethanol) (a) and cyclic voltammogram (b) for the as-synthesized CuInS2 QDs. Insets to (a): the spectrum shows the determination of band gap by direct band gap method, and the image shows the CuInS2 QDs in ethanol after 1 day.	 

 	Fig. 6  Absorption (a) and photoluminescence (b) spectra of blends of MEH-PPV with the as-synthesized CuInS2 QDs at different blend ratios (R) in the solid films spin-coated on quartz substrates.	 

 	Fig. 7  (a) Photoluminescence spectra of MEH-PPV and MEH-PPV/CuInS2-QDs blend (R = 1/1) films spin-coated on quartz substrates. (b) FT-IR spectra showing the TBP-treatment effects. CIS and T-CIS represent the as-synthesized and TBP-treated CuInS2 QDs, respectively. The TBP treatment was carried out by keeping the CuInS2 QDs in an ethanol solution of TBP at 60–80 °C for 16 h, followed by washing thoroughly with ethanol and drying under vacuum at 60 °C for 6 h.	 

CIS	0.35	2.85	23.3%	0.0015	0.047
T-CIS	0.62	7.76	22.7%	0.0068	0.128

 	Fig. 8  
J–V curves for the solar cells based on the blends of MEH-PPV and CuInS2 QDs at R = 1/1 under monochromatic illumination of 15.85 mW cm−2 at 470 nm. The inset shows the device architecture. CIS and T-CIS represent the as-synthesized and TBP-treated CuInS2 QDs, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 9  IPCE spectra for the solar cells based on the blends of MEH-PPV and CuInS2 QDs at R = 1/1, where CIS and T-CIS have the same meanings to those in Fig. 8. The inset schematically illustrates the energy level diagram for the devices based on the MEH-PPV and CuInS2 QDs, showing the charge transfers of electrons to CuInS2 and holes to MEH-PPV, in which the exciton transfer as indicated by the blue dotted arrow represents a possible process for the energy loss of polymer exciton.
