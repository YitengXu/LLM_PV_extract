    , Accepted 6th July 2011First published on 30th August 2011AbstractHierarchical anatase TiO2 spheres consisting of nanorods and nanoparticles are successfully prepared via a simple acid thermal method using titanium n-butoxide and acetic acid, which will overcome the kinetic and light-scattering limitations of nanoparticles and the surface area limitations of one-dimensional nanostructures, as photoelectrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells. The as-prepared and calcined hierarchical spheres were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray powder diffraction. The DSSC based on hierarchical TiO2 spheres as the photoelectrode shows a highly efficient power conversion efficiency (10.34%) accompanied by 18.78 mA cm−2 in short-circuit photocurrent density and 826 mV in open-circuit voltage. The great improvements of photocurrent density and power conversion efficiency for hierarchical TiO2 spheres compared to P25 nanoparticle photoelectrodes are mainly attributed to a considerable surface area, a higher light scattering ability, and faster electron transport rates and slower recombination rates for the former.

Broader context
Since the breakthrough made by O'Regan and Grätzel, TiO2-based dye-sensitized solar cells have made significant achievements by using TiO2 photoelectrodes with various morphologies from nanoparticles, sub-microspheres, mesoporous TiO2 beads to one-dimensional nanostructures (nanorods/wires, nanotubes). In our work, hierarchical TiO2 spheres consisting of anatase TiO2 nanorods and nanoparticles are successfully prepared via a facile acid thermal and heat treatment process. The DSSC based on a hierarchical TiO2-sphere photoelectrode consisting of nanorods and nanoparticles shows a highly efficient power conversion efficiency of 10.34% compared to 8.10% for the P25 nanoparticle photoelectrode, which benefits from the larger surface area for more dye loading, superior light scattering ability and faster electron transport (slower electron recombination) for the former.

Introduction
Owing to its unique opto-electronic properties, TiO2 has been become one of the most investigated inorganic semiconductor oxide materials in various research areas including photochromism,1 gas sensors,2 photocatalysis,3,4 Li-ion batteries5 and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).6–9 Recently, DSSCs have made significant achievements by using TiO2 photoelectrodes with various morphologies such as nanoparticles,10 sub-microspheres,11 mesoporous TiO2 beads,12,13nanorods/wires,14,15 and nanotubes.16–21 To date, the highest overall power conversion efficiency of over 11% has been achieved by using a ruthenium complex light-harvester, volatile organic solvent electrolyte and double layer TiO2 photoelectrode consisting of a dye adsorption layer (20 nm sized TiO2 nanoparticle) and light scattering layer (400 nm sized particle).22 In a DSSC, light is absorbed by dye molecules attached to the surface of nanocrystalline, wide band gap metal oxide materials (e.g.TiO2) to generate free excited electrons to be injected into the conduction band of the semiconducting oxide, which are then transported to external loads to generate a photocurrent. As is well known, small nanoparticles (10–20 nm) have larger surface areas to adsorb dye molecules but with inefficient light scattering ability and hence result in poor light-harvesting efficiency. Although the large particles with flat surfaces possess excellent light scattering properties, they are not suitable as photoanode materials because of less dye loading ascribed from the much lower surface area. Therefore, recent bi-functional hierarchically structured materials (TiO2,12,23ZnO,24,25SnO226,27) consisting of nanoparticles have been widely investigated as photoanodes for DSSCs and exhibited enhanced power conversion efficiency owing to their superior dye-adsorption properties and light-scattering abilities.
When the photons are captured by the dye molecules and inject the excited electrons to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2, the electrons’ diffusion rate and lifetime in the TiO2 photoelectrode will be of significant influence on the photovoltaic performance. In addition to light harvesting efficiency (LHE), fast electron diffusion rates and long electron lifetimes are two key factors for a high performance DSSC. In a traditional DSSC based on a TiO2 nanoparticle film, the diffusion of electrons would be restricted by the residence time of electrons in traps,28–30 the particle networks and the interparticle contact area, which increases the length of electron diffusion.31–33 Owing to the competition between the collection of photoinjected electrons and recombination, a photoanode with high charge-collection efficiency is highly required to improve the performance of DSSCs. Recently, quasi-one dimensional (1D) or 1D nanostructures such as TiO2 nanorods, wires and nanotubes arrays34–36 have been found to enhance the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs owing to the improvement of the charge-collection efficiency which ascribes to the faster electron transport and slower recombination rate.37,38 However, the low surface area of quasi-1D or 1D nanoarrays hinders significant improvement of the photovoltaic performance owing to less dye loading. Hence, there will be much desire to design and synthesize a type of material which simultaneously has a large surface area to adsorb more dye molecules, efficient light scattering ability and fast electron transport.
Herein, we report the synthesis of hierarchical spherical anatase TiO2 consisting of nanorods and nanoparticlesvia a simple acid thermal method using titanium n-butoxide and acetic acid. The hierarchical TiO2 spheres have an average diameter of about 2.1 μm which consists of anatase TiO2 nanorods and nanoparticles. The new nanorod- and nanoparticle-based hierarchically structured TiO2 spheres are used as tri-functional materials in the DSSC application because of their high dye loading, efficient light scattering ability, and higher charge-collection efficiency (faster electron transport and longer electron lifetime) compared to the commercial P25 nanoparticles. An overall power conversion efficiency of 10.34% has been achieved by using hierarchical TiO2 spheres photoelectrode and N719 dye.
Experimental
Synthesis of hierarchical TiO2 spheres
Hierarchical Ti-complex intermediate spheres were prepared via a very simple acid thermal process containing titanium n-butoxide (TBT) and acetic acid (HAc). In a typical synthesis, 1 mL TBT was added to 30 mL HAc with stirring. After a few minutes, the mixture of TBT and HAc was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Subsequently, the autoclave was sealed and transferred to an electronic oven and maintained at 140 °C for 3–12 h. The as-prepared powder samples were washed extensively with deionized water and ethanol and finally dried in air at 70 °C. To obtain anatase TiO2 phase, the as-prepared powder samples were annealed at 500 °C for 3 h with a ramping rate of 2 °C min−1 in a muffle furnace.
Preparation of the TiO2 working electrode
Firstly, the transparent anatase TiO2 colloidal (3–5 nm in particle size) solution was prepared via heating the precursors containing titanium n-butoxide (Ti(OBu)4, 34.2 mL), acetylacetone (10.2 mL), n-butanol (37.6 mL), para-toluene-sulfonic acid (3.8 g) and H2O (18.0 mL) at 60 °C for 12 h, which has been reported before.26,39 The anatase TiO2 colloidal solution was spin-coated on the cleaned FTO glass (15 Ω/square, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) to form a compact layer on FTO glass with a thickness of about 120 nm. Secondly, the TiO2 paste was screen-printed on a compact layer coated FTO glass. The paste fabrication process has been reported in our previous paper.40 Briefly, TiO2 powder (P25 particles or hierarchical TiO2 spheres) (1.0 g) were ground for 40 min in the mixture of ethanol (8.0 mL), acetic acid (0.2 mL), terpineol (3.0 g) and ethyl cellulose (0.5 g) to form a slurry, and then the slurry was sonicated for 5 min in an ultrasonic bath, finally to form a viscous white TiO2 paste. The thickness of films can be easily controlled through repeating screen-printing times. After a heating process (325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min, and then at 500 °C for 15 min) to remove the organic substances, the TiO2 films were soaked in 0.04 M TiCl4 aqueous solution for 30 min at 70 °C to improve the photocurrent and photovoltaic performance. After sintering at 520 °C for 30 min, the TiO2 electrode films were immersed into 0.5 mM N719 dye (Ru[LL′-(NCS)2], L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid, L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-ditetrabutylammonium carboxylate, Solaronix Co.) in acetonitrile/tert-butanol (volume ratio 1:1), and sensitized for about 16 h at room temperature. Afterward, these films were rinsed with acetonitrile in order to remove physisorbed N719 dye molecules.
Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells
To evaluate their photovoltaic performance, the dye-sensitized TiO2/FTO glass films were sandwiched together with Pt coated FTO glass which was used as counter electrode. Platinized counter electrodes were fabricated by thermal depositing H2PtCl6 solution (5 mM in isopropanol) onto FTO glass. Then the counter electrode was placed directly on the top of the dye-sensitized TiO2 film sealed with thermal adhesive film (∼25 μm). The electrolyte (0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15)) was injected from a hole made on the counter electrode into the space between the sandwiched cells. The active area of the DSSC is 0.16 cm2.
Characterization
The morphology and structure of the samples were examined by powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM-6330F), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-2010 HR) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). To determine the specific surface area and pore size distribution of P25 particles and hierarchical TiO2 spheres, the N2 sorption measurements were performed by using an ASAP 2010 surface area analyzed (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation). UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectra and absorption spectra were measured on a UV/Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV, Shimadzu UV-3150) to analyse the diffuse reflectance of films and dye amounts detached from films, respectively. The thickness of TiO2 films was measured by a profilometer (Ambios, XP-1).

Intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements were carried out on a electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) with a frequency response analyzer under a modulated green light emitting diode (457 nm) driven by a source supply (Zahner, PP211), which can provide both DC and AC components of the illumination. The modulated light intensity was 10% or less than the base light intensity. The frequency range was set from 100 KHz to 0.1 Hz. The current–voltage characteristics of DSSCs were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter under one sun AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination with a solar light simulator (Oriel, Model: 91192). A 1000 W xenon arc lamp (Oriel, Model: 6271) was served as a light source and its incident light intensity was calibrated with a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell equipped with a optical filter to approximate AM 1.5 G one sun light intensity before each measurement. The incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured as a function of wavelength from 350 to 800 nm on the basis of a Spectral Products DK240 monochromator.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a is the TEM image of the as-prepared sample exhibiting a spherical morphology consisting of nanoribbons with a diameter of around 2.1 μm. After heat treatment of the as-prepared sample at 500 °C for 3 h, SEM image (Fig. 1b) shows the size of the sphere keeps constant (2.1 μm). However, TEM results (Fig. 1a and c) of the as-prepared and calcined samples clearly show that the building units of spheres changed from nanoribbons to nanorods and nanoparticles due to the decomposition of Ti-complex intermediates to TiO2, CO2 and H2O at the temperature of around 340 °C via a TG-IR measurement (see Fig. S1†). Furthermore, the HRTEM result (Fig. 1d) reveals the calcined hierarchical TiO2 spheres are composed of single crystalline anatase TiO2 (interplanar spacing of d101 = 3.5 ± 0.1 Å) nanorods and nanoparticles.

Fig. 2 compares the XRD patterns of as-prepared and calcined (500 °C for 3 h) hierarchical spheres. It reveals that the as-prepared Ti-complex intermediate spheres with an unknown crystal phase converts to anatase TiO2 (JCPDS No.65–2900, a = 3.785 Å, b = 3.785 Å, c = 9.514 Å) through an annealing process. The FTIR spectra of as-prepared and calcined hierarchical spheres are shown in Fig. S2†. For the as-prepared Ti-complex intermediate, the signal at 2983 cm−1 is assigned to the C–H bond stretching mode in Ac− and BuO− ligands. The signals from 1700–1730 cm−1 are attributed to the H-bond or CO stretching mode. The C–C stretching modes appear at a lower intensity signal at 1029 cm−1 and the C–O stretching mode appears at 1276 cm−1. The lower wavenumbers at 772 and 672 cm−1 correspond to the bonds of Ti–O (Ti–Ac) and Ti–O (Ti–O–Bu), respectively.41

The signal at 1526 cm−1 and signals at 1430, 1460 cm−1 are the asymmetric mode and symmetric stretching modes of carboxylate binding modes, respectively. However, a small difference in the two modes (less than 100 cm−1) rules out the presence of unidentate ester linkages, but a mode of bidentate bridging, which could provide evidence for the formation of the hexaprismane-shaped Ti6O6(Ac)6(OBu)6−n(OH)n (0 ≤ n ≤ 6) Ti-complex intermediate.41,42
In the present system, the reaction between TBT and HAc would firstly form a six-coordinated complex, Ti6O6(Ac)6(OBu)6 (R1). Then, the product H2O could further react with the complex of Ti6O6(Ac)6(OBu)6 to produce Ti6O6(Ac)6(OBu)6−n(OH)n (0 ≤ n ≤ 6) (R2), the subsequent condensation reaction may form the 1D macromolecules, namely, nanoribbons. 6Ti(OBu)4 + 18HAc → Ti6O6(Ac)6(OBu)6 + 6BuOH + 12BuOAc + 6H2O(R1) Ti6O6(Ac)6(OBu)6 + nH2O → Ti6O6(Ac)6(OBu)6−n(OH)n + nBuOH(R2)
Time-dependent experiments were performed to observe the formation process of hierarchical TiO2 spheres. As shown in Fig. S3, nanoparticles were initially obtained after a 3 h acid thermal reaction (Fig. S3a). With the prolongation of reaction time (Fig. S3b, 6 h), the nanoribbons were formed which finally lead to the hierarchical spheres (Fig. S3c, 12 h). Scheme 1 illustrates the possible formation process of the hierarchical TiO2 sphere consisting of nanorods and nanoparticles based on these SEM, TEM, TG-IR and FTIR analyses. Numerous nanocrystallites of Ti-complex intermediates are formed at the initial hydrolysis of TBT in the presence of HAc, which will form the nanoribbons through an oriented attachment process.43 With further prolongation of reaction time, hierarchical Ti-complex intermediate spheres consisting of nanoribbons will be obtained through the assembly of the nanoribbons. Finally, the hierarchical TiO2 spheres consisting of anatase TiO2 nanorods and nanoparticles are obtained via a heat treatment process (500 °C, 3 h) of the as-prepared nanoribbon-based hierarchical Ti-complex intermediate spheres.

The novel nanorod- and nanoparticle-based hierarchical anatase TiO2 spheres (HTS) are further used as a photoanode in DSSCs. For comparison, three kinds of films (I: P25, II: P25 + HTS, III: HTS) with similar thicknesses were screen printed onto the FTO glass with a pre-coated TiO2 compact layer.26 The cross-sectional SEM images (shown in Fig. 3) clearly show the films I, II, and III with around 15 μm thick P25 nanoparticles, 7.5 μm P25 + 7.5 μm HTS, and 15 μm thick HTS, respectively.

The photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs based on the three films (cell I: film I; cell II: film II and cell III: film III) are shown in Fig. 4, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1, the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of the DSSCs based on the three films don't have significant variations. However, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) increases from 14.75, to 16.21 to 18.78 mA cm−2 as the film varied from I, to II to III, leading to the power conversion efficiency (η) improving from 8.23, to 9.10 to 10.34%. It's worth noting that the most efficient photovoltaic performance of 10.34% is achieved for cell III with only hierarchical TiO2 spheres, exhibiting 18.78 mA cm−2 in Jsc, 827 mV in Voc and 0.67 in FF. Furthermore, both the Jsc and η of the DSSCs based on film III (HTS) improve by ∼28% compared to those of film I (P25), which will be discussed later in detail.

The specific BET surface area of the nanorod and nanoparticle-based hierarchical TiO2 spheres and P25 nanoparticles are 63.73 and 59.89 m2 g−1, respectively, obtained from the N2 adsorption–desorption measurements. The isotherm (Fig. S4) of HTS with a sharp capillary condensation step at high relative pressure (P/P0 = 0.8–1.0) suggests a mesoporous hierarchical structure. According to the BJH model, this hierarchical material shows a wide pore size distribution of 10–40 nm calculated from the adsorption branch of the isotherm (inset in Fig. S4).
It is well known that the photocurrent is strongly related to the dye loading on the TiO2 photoelectrode. The amounts of dyes adsorbed on the three films were obtained by measuring the UV/Vis absorption spectra of solutions containing dyes detached from the films in H2O (3 mL) with 0.1 M NaOH (Fig. S5). It is found that the dye amount on film III (149.85 nmol cm−2) is higher than films I and II (121.14 and 133.84 nmol cm−2, respectively), as shown in Table 1, which will lead to more photogenerated electrons and higher photocurrents for the former. This is well in agreement with the J–V data.
Hierarchical spheres/octahedra with submicron size consisting of nanoparticles have been proven to enhance the light scattering effect, hence leading to higher photocurrent and photovoltaic performance. In order to investigate the light-scattering property of the three films,24,26,44 the UV/Vis reflectance spectra were further characterized and shown in Fig. 5. The reflectance of the hierarchical TiO2 sphere film (III) is about 60% in the range of 400–800 nm, which is much higher than the other two films (I and II). Film III, consisting of hierarchical TiO2 spheres (2.1 μm in diameter), shows higher diffuse reflection capabilities in the visible and near infrared regions compared to film I, consisting of P25 nanoparticles (25 nm in diameter), suggesting that the incident light was significantly scattered within film III, which will definitely result in a higher photocurrent for the DSSC based on film III. The similar phenomenon for the enhancement of light scattering and photocurrent has also been obtained for the hierarchical TiO212 or ZnO sphere,24,44 or SnO2 octahedra composed of nanoparticles.26 Hence, both higher dye loading and superior light scattering ability of hierarchical TiO2 spheres (film III) compared to P25 nanoparticle (film I) contributed to the higher light harvesting efficiency to enhance the photocurrent density and power conversion efficiency.

Fig. 6 displays the incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra as a function of wavelength for those three cells. Compared to the cell made of P25 film (cell I), the IPCE of the cell for hierarchical TiO2 spheres (cell III) increased from 79% to 88% at around 520 nm. The higher IPCE of cell III over a wide range (350–800 nm) contributed to the increase in the efficiency of light harvesting (larger dye molecular loading and higher light-reflectance), which could lead to a higher short-circuit current density. It is worth noting that the IPCE data of cell III shows an obvious red-shift to a longer wavelength (600–750 nm) compared to the cell I due to the better light-scattering ability for the former (Fig. 5).

Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) have been proven as powerful techniques for investigating the electron transport and charge recombination in nanostructured films. To further elucidate the influences of the three films on the photovoltaic parameters, the IMPS and IMVS responses45 of the three cells are measured under an illumination of a LED light source (λ = 457 nm) with different light intensities from 30 to 150 W m−2. The transport time (recombination time) can be calculated from the expression τd= 1/2πfd (τr = 1/2πfr), where fd (fr) is the characteristic frequency minimum of the IMPS (IMVS) imaginary component. The transport and recombination times of the DSSCs based on the three films as a function of light intensity and open circuit voltage at various light intensities,46,47 are shown in Fig. 7a and 7b, respectively. The transport time (τd) and recombination time (τr) of the three cells decrease with the increasing light intensity. At higher light intensities, deep traps are filled and electron trapping/detrapping involves shallower levels, so that transport is faster. Furthermore, τd of cell III is smaller than that of cells I and II showing a fastest electron transport rate in film III (Fig. 7a). The electron diffusion coefficient (Dn) in TiO2 films can be obtained by fitting the frequency-dependent response using the analytical expression (Dn = d2/(4 × τd), d is film thickness) for the IMPS given originally by Dloczik,29 which shows the Dn of cell III is a factor of 2 larger than cell I under 90 W m−2 illumination (Fig. S6).
 Fig. 7  Incident light intensity dependent transport time constant (a) and recombination time constant (b) as a function of open-circuit voltage for DSSCs based on films I, II and III measured at 457 nm LED illumination. 
The lifetime or recombination time τr (Fig. 7b) of electrons with I3− ions in cell III is the largest among the three cells, which means the hierarchical spheres exhibit a significantly longer electron lifetime than the that of the reference nanocrystalline mesoporous TiO2, agreeing with the results of Sauvage48 and Qu.49 Except the faster electron transport, the longer electron lifetime of film III can be also associated with the higher dye density (8.58 × 10−8 mol mg−1) compared to film I (dye density: 6.15 × 10−8 mol mg−1), which could decrease the contact area between electrolyte and semi-conductive materials, hence reducing the electron recombination. In addition, the effective electron diffusion length (Ln) can be easily obtained from Dn and τr using a relationship Ln = (Dn × τr)1/2. As shown in Fig. S6, the Ln (45.5 μm) of cell III at a light intensity of 90 W m−2 is thicker than that of cell II (36.6 μm) and cell I (24.6 μm), respectively. It reveals that the HTS film can be much thicker than the P25 nanocrystalline film for a given recombination loss.
It is well known, the photocurrent density (Jsc) can be calculated by the following expression:20 Jsc = qηlhηinjηccI0(1)where q is the elementary charge, ηlh is the charge harvest efficiency of a cell, ηinj is the charge-injection efficiency, ηcc is the charge-collection efficiency, and I0 is the light flux. ηlh is commonly determined by the amount of adsorbed dye and light-scattering of films; ηcc is largely determined by the competition between the charge collection and recombination; and ηinj, here for these three cells, is assumed to be the same because of the same dye (N719) adsorbed on the same semiconductor material (TiO2). Obviously, not only the light harvest efficiency (dye loading and light scattering of the film) but also the charge-collection efficiency can influence the photocurrent density (Jsc).
The charge-collection efficiency (ηcc) can be further estimated by IMPS and IMVS measurements via the following equation:50,51 (2)
According to Fig. 7, at a constant light intensity (90 W m−2), the charge-collection efficiency estimated by eqn (2) shows that ηcc for cell III (97.6%) is 1.5% and 6.6% larger than that for cell II and cell I, respectively. The higher ηcc of cell III compared to cell I and II also contributed to the higher Jsc and power conversion efficiency (η) for cell III (Fig. 4 and Table 1). Hence, the higher dye loading, superior light scattering effect and faster electron transport (slower electron recombination) of film III (hierarchical TiO2 spheres) compared to films I and II are together responsible for the higher Jsc and η of cell III.
Conclusions
In summary, hierarchical TiO2 spheres consisting of anatase TiO2 nanorods and nanoparticles are successfully prepared via a facile acid thermal process. The DSSC based on a HTS photoelectrode shows a highly efficient power conversion efficiency (10.34%) accompanied by 18.78 mA cm−2 in Jsc and 826 mV in Voc. The great improvements (∼28%) in photocurrent density (Jsc: from 14.75 to 18.78 mA cm−2) and power conversion efficiency (η: from 8.10 to 10.34%) for the HTS film compared to the P25 nanoparticle photoelectrode are mainly attributed to a considerable surface area (63.73 for HTS vs. 59.89 m2 g−1 for P25 nanoparticles), a higher light scattering ability (reflectance: about 60% at a range from 400 nm to 800 nm) and faster electron transport rate and slower recombination rate for the former. The electron diffusion coefficient and effective diffusion length derived from IMPS/IMVS measurements for HTS materials (3.75 × 10−4 cm2s−1 and 45.5 μm, respectively) are obviously superior than those of P25 nanoparticles (2.0 × 10−4 cm2s−1 and 24.6 μm, respectively) under illumination at 90 W m−2. Further study of the tri-functional materials for the solid-state DSSC and quantum dot sensitized solar cells are under investigation.

Broader context
Since the breakthrough made by O'Regan and Grätzel, TiO2-based dye-sensitized solar cells have made significant achievements by using TiO2 photoelectrodes with various morphologies from nanoparticles, sub-microspheres, mesoporous TiO2 beads to one-dimensional nanostructures (nanorods/wires, nanotubes). In our work, hierarchical TiO2 spheres consisting of anatase TiO2 nanorods and nanoparticles are successfully prepared via a facile acid thermal and heat treatment process. The DSSC based on a hierarchical TiO2-sphere photoelectrode consisting of nanorods and nanoparticles shows a highly efficient power conversion efficiency of 10.34% compared to 8.10% for the P25 nanoparticle photoelectrode, which benefits from the larger surface area for more dye loading, superior light scattering ability and faster electron transport (slower electron recombination) for the former.
