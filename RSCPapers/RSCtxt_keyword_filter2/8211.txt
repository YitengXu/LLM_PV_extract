    , Accepted 30th June 2019First published on 2nd July 2019AbstractAll-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) with a p-type conjugated polymer as a donor and an n-type conjugated polymer as an acceptor have attracted increasing attention recently due to their good film-forming properties, excellent flexibility and high morphological stability. Herein, we synthesized a new n-type conjugated copolymer LA03 based on naphthalene diimide (NDI) and benzotriazole (BTZ) with thiophene π-bridges, which is a structure modification of N2200 by inserting a benzotriazole unit between its two thiophene units. Compared with N2200, LA03 exhibits blue-shifted absorption and a higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level. The LA03-based all-PSCs with wide-band-gap polymer PBDB-T as a donor, achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.49%, with a high open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.937 V, which is improved in comparison with the PBDB-T:N2200-based all-PSCs with a PCE of 5.85% and a Voc of 0.812 V. The higher Voc of the LA03-based devices is benefitted from the up-shifted LUMO energy level of the LA03 acceptor. The results indicate that inserting a benzotriazole unit into the main chain of N2200 is an effective way to upshift its LUMO energy level and increase the Voc of the all-PSCs.
1. Introduction
Solution processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) as a new renewable energy technology have attracted enormous attention because of their potential application in low-cost, flexible and semitransparent solar cells.1–6 The active layer of the PSCs is composed of a blend of p-type conjugated polymer as a donor and n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) as an acceptor. If the acceptor is an n-type conjugated polymer, the devices are called all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). The all-PSCs have attracted increasing attention recently due to their good film-forming properties, excellent flexibility and high morphological stability.7–14 However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the all-PSCs lags behind the PSCs with the low bandgap non-fullerene n-OS as acceptors, because of the lack of high performance n-type conjugated polymer acceptors and difficulties in controlling the morphology. Therefore, design and synthesis of high performance polymer acceptors are crucial for the further development of all-PSCs.15–20
To date, the main polymer acceptor materials used in the all-PSCs are the D–A copolymers based on perylene diimide (PDI) and naphthalene diimide (NDI) electron-accepting units, and the most representative polymer acceptor is N2200.21–24 N2200 is based on an NDI unit copolymerized with bithiophene, and it is a narrow bandgap polymer with broad absorption. However, the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the N2200-based all-PSCs needs to be further improved due to the relatively low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of N2200. Here we modified the molecular structure of N2200 by inserting a benzotriazole unit between its two thiophenes to synthesize a new polymer acceptor LA03 to upshift the LUMO level of the polymer, by weakening the intrachain D–A interaction and improving the steric effect through the alkyl chain of benzotriazole. As expected, LA03 shows blue-shifted absorption and an up-shifted LUMO energy level compared to that of N2200. The photovoltaic performance of an LA03 polymer acceptor was studied by using a wide bandgap polymer PBDB-T as a donor, and compared with those of the N2200-based devices. The all-PSCs based on PBDB-T:LA03 with 1% 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) additive treatment demonstrated 6.44% power conversion efficiency (PCE) with a high Voc of 0.937 V, while the optimized N2200-based devices showed a PCE of 5.85% with a lower Voc of 0.812 V. The higher Voc of the LA03 based all-PSCs is benefitted from the up-shifted LUMO level of an LA03 polymer acceptor. The results indicate that the photovoltaic performance of N2200 could be further improved by rational molecular design.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and thermal stability of LA03
The polymer LA03 was synthesized by Stille-coupling polycondensation, as shown in Scheme 1, and the monomers were synthesized according to literature reports.25 The detailed synthetic processes were described in the ESI.† Molecular weight of LA03 was measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of LA03 is 92 kDa with PDI of 1.46. The polymer acceptor shows good solubility in chloroform and dichlorobenzene. The thermal stability of LA03 was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† The thermal decomposition temperatures (Td) at 5% weight loss is 450 °C (Table 1), which reveals that the polymer acceptor LA03 possesses good thermal stability for application in PSCs.

2.2 Absorption spectra and electronic energy levels

Fig. 1a shows the absorption spectrum of LA03 film. There are two absorption peaks at ca. 420 nm and ca. 700 nm respectively for the LA03 film with the absorption edge at 754 nm, corresponding to the optical band gap of 1.64 eV. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO energy levels of these polymers were measured by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) with Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode. Fig. 1b shows cyclic voltammograms of the polymers with the potential values converted to that versus Fc/Fc+. From the onset oxidation and reduction potentials (Eox/red) obtained from the cyclic voltammograms, the corresponding energy levels were calculated according to the equations: EHOMO/LUMO = −e(Eox/red + 4.8) (eV), and the corresponding HOMO and LUMO energy levels are listed in Table 1. The LUMO values of the polymer acceptors N2200 and LA03 are −3.84 eV and −3.71 eV, respectively. The HOMO/LUMO values of PBDB-T were measured to be −5.37 and −3.61 eV according to CV measurement results. For a clear comparison, the energy level diagrams of PBDB-T, N2200 and LA03 are shown in Fig. 1c, from which the energy levels of the polymer acceptors N2200 and LA03 matched well with the polymer donor PBDB-T. Therefore, efficient exciton dissociation could be expected to occur in the D–A interfaces. What is more, the higher LUMO level of LA03 than that of N2200 means that a higher Voc could be expected since the Voc is proportional to the difference between the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor.

2.3 Photovoltaic properties
All-PSCs were fabricated using a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer donor:polymer acceptor/PDINO/Al (Fig. 1d), where PBDB-T (Mn = 27.21, PDI = 1.73, Table S1, ESI†) is used as a polymer donor, and N2200 (Mn = 111.26, PDI = 1.65, Table S1, ESI†) or LA03 are used as a polymer acceptor. The active layer was spin-coated from chloroform solution of the polymer donor and acceptor with 1% 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) (v/v) additive, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 5 min. PDINO was selected as the cathode buffer layer in considering its good performance in PSCs.26 The photovoltaic performance of the all-PSCs was optimized by using different D/A weight ratios of the polymer donor and polymer acceptors (N2200 or LA03) from 3:1 to 1:1 (Fig. S2 and Table S2, ESI†) and by changing different volume percentage of CN additive from 0.5% to 2% (Fig. S3 and Table S3, ESI†). The optimized weight ratios of PBDB-T:polymer acceptors (N2200 or LA03) are 2:1 with a total blend concentration of 10 mg mL−1 in chloroform, and the optimized additive treatment condition is the 1% CN additive treatment. Therefore, the D/A weight ratio of 2:1 with 1% CN was utilized in the following studies of the all-PSCs.

Fig. 2a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the all-PSCs (2:1, w/w) under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 and Table 2 lists the photovoltaic performance parameters of the corresponding all-PSCs for a clear comparison. The all-PSCs based on PBDB-T:N2200 demonstrated a PCE of 6.00% with a Voc of 0.812 V, a Jsc of 11.4 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 63.22%. However, the device based on PBDB-T:N2200 with an additive of 1% CN showed a poorer PCE of 4.36% with a Voc of 0.879 V, a Jsc of 7.15 mA cm−2 and an FF of 69.34%. In the PBDB-T:N2200 system, the use of additive CN results in smaller phase separation and serious bimolecular recombination, resulting in a sharp decrease in current density of the all-PSCs. The all-PSCs based on PBDB-T:LA03 showed a PCE of 5.41% with a Voc of 0.931 V, a Jsc of 11.38 mA cm−2 and an FF of 50.67%, while the PCE of the devices based on PBDB-T:LA03 with 1% CN additive treatment reached 6.49% with a Voc of 0.937 V, a Jsc of 11.28 mA cm−2 and an FF of 61.34%. In the PBDB-T:LA03 system, the use of additive CN enhances the crystallinity of the polymer acceptor in the blend, which is conducive to charge transfer, so that the FF is improved. We can clearly see that compared to the all-PSC based on the PBDB-T/N2200 blend, the device based on the PBDB-T/LA03 blend exhibits a higher Voc, owing to the higher ELUMO (−3.71 eV) of LA03 than that of N2200.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) can evaluate the accuracy of the Jsc values measured from J–V curves. Fig. 2b shows the EQE spectra of the all-PSCs with or without 1% CN additive treatment which exhibited a broad photovoltaic response in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm for all the devices. The Jsc values integrated from the EQE spectra are similar to those values obtained from the J–V curves (Table 2), indicating the reliability of the measurement of the photocurrent.
Charge carrier mobilities of the all-PSCs were measured using a space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S4 and Table S4, ESI†). The hole mobilities (μh) were measured with the hole-only device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:polymer acceptor/Au, and the electron mobilities (μe) were measured with the electron-only device structure of ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:polymer acceptor/PDINO/Al.27,28 For the as cast PBDB-T:N2200 blend film, the hole and electron mobilities are calculated to be 1.69 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.41 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μe/μh ratio of 0.56. While after 1% CN treatment the μh and μe values were decreased to 3.02 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.34 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with the μe/μh ratio of 0.44. For the as cast PBDB-T:LA03 blend film, the μh and μe values are calculated to be 6.23 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.96 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with the μe/μh ratio of 0.31, While with 1% CN treatment, μh and μe values were increased to 4.28 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.89 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with the improved μe/μh ratio of 0.9. The better photovoltaic performance of the all-PSCs based on PBDB-T:LA03 with 1% CN additive treatment could be ascribed to the higher and more balanced charge carrier mobilities of the devices, which is helpful for facilitating charge transport, controlling the carrier recombination and improving the photovoltaic performance.29
Light intensity dependence of Jsc can be used to further understand the charge recombination behavior which is considered to be one of the decisive factors affecting fill factor.30 The Jsc follows the power-law dependence versus light intensity (P), which can be expressed as Jsc ∝ Pα. In general, when α is equal to 1, bimolecular recombination can be neglected. For the all-PSCs based on PBDB-T:N2200, PBDB-T:N2200 with 1% CN, PBDB-T:LA03 and PBDB-T:LA03 with 1% CN, the fitted α values are 0.945, 0.915, 0.948 and 0.983, respectively (Fig. 2c). The results suggest that bimolecular recombination was significantly decreased in the PBDB-T:LA03-based all-PSCs with 1% CN additive treatment (α value of 0.983 is close to 1), while the bimolecular recombination was increased in the PBDB-T:N2200-based all-PSCs with 1% CN additive treatment (α value of 0.915 is more farther from 1), which agrees with the different changes in their photovoltaic performance after the additive treatment.
In order to further study charge generation and charge collection, we also measured the relationship between photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff). Jph can be defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark respectively. Veff is given by Veff = V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is zero; V is the applied voltage.31 Therefore, the saturation photocurrent density is mainly determined by the number of charges generated rather than the charge collection ability. All excitons are separated into free carriers at Veff = 2 V where the photocurrent reaches saturation (Jsat).32–36 Thus, the Jph/Jsat ratio can be used to judge the exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency. As shown in Fig. 2d, under the short-circuit conditions, the calculated Jph/Jsat ratios for the all-PSCs based on PBDB-T:N2200, PBDB-T:N2200 with 1% CN, PBDB-T:LA03 and PBDB-T:LA03 with 1% CN are 97%, 91.8%, 95.8% and 98% respectively, indicating a higher exciton dissociation efficiency in the devices based on PBDB-T:LA03 with 1% CN. The lowest Jph/Jsat value of 91.8% can account for the lowest Jsc of 7.15 mA cm−2 in the all-PSCs based on PBDB-T:N2200 with 1% CN. The high exciton generation rate and efficient exciton dissociation result in the high Jsc and FF in the all-PSCs based on PBDB-T:LA03.
2.4 Morphology characterization
The morphology of the active layer plays an important role for device performance in the PSCs. So we studied the phase separation morphology of the polymer blend films by atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), grazing incident wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GIWAXS) and Resonant and soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) respectively. The morphologies of the blend films and the surface root-mean-square (RMS) roughness were measured by AFM (Fig. 3a–d). The RMS roughness of the blend films of PBDB-T:N2200, PBDB-T:N2200 with 1% CN, PBDB-T:LA03 and PBDB-T:LA03 with 1% CN are 2.46 nm, 1.94 nm, 2.89 nm, 2.08 nm respectively. Among these devices, the blend film of PBDB-T:LA03 with 1% CN possesses a moderate and appropriate RMS roughness value of 2.08 nm. The real space image of the phase separated morphology of the blend film of the all-PSCs could be obtained through TEM. As shown in Fig. 3e–h, the blend film of PBDB-T:LA03 with 1% CN exhibited nanoscale phase separation with the appropriate nano-size, which was favorable for efficient charge separation and transport, beneficial for higher PCE.
 Fig. 3  AFM and TEM images of blend films of (a and e) PBDB-T:N2200, (b and f) PBDB-T:N2200 1% CN, (c and g) PBDB-T:LA03 and (d and h) PBDB-T:LA03 1% CN. 
GIWAXS37 was carried out to evaluate the molecular-scale packing and orientation texture of the neat polymer donor/acceptor and their blend films (Fig. 4a and b). Both the neat polymer donor and acceptor films exhibited distinct (010) scattering peaks along the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and (100) peaks in the in-place (IP) direction, implying favorable face-on oriented packing relative to the substrate. The corresponding π–π stacking coherence lengths (CL010) are 23, 37, and 37 Å for PBDB-T, N2200, and LA03, respectively. Upon blending, both the PBDB-T:N2200 and PBDB-T:LA03 films retain the preferential face-on orientation with comparable CCL010 values of ∼27 Å. After introducing CN as an additive, the CL010 values were slightly increased to ∼33 Å. And the highest integrated intensity of the (010)OOP peak was realized in the PBDB-T:LA03 1% CN film, indicating a relatively high volume fraction of crystalline domain in the solid state. The results are consistent with the RMS values of film surfaces measured by AFM (Fig. 3). Moreover, RSoXS38–40 measurement was conducted to further investigate phase separation in the blend films. Note that the optimized PBDB-T:LA03 1% CN film exhibited relatively small domain size while maintaining a higher domain purity compared to the neat blend, which is beneficial for obtaining efficient exciton generation and charge transport, and thus a higher FF value in the devices. Our results provide important enlightenment to develop high efficiency all-PSCs based on the naphthalene diimide-containing polymer acceptors.

In conclusion, we insert a benzotriazole unit between two thiophenes in the famous polymer N2200 and synthesized a new n-type conjugated polymer LA03, for improving photovoltaic performance of the polymer acceptor in all-PSCs. Compared with N2200, LA03 possesses upshifted LUMO energy level. Photovoltaic performance of the polymer acceptor LA03 was studied by using a p-type wide bandgap conjugated polymer PBDB-T as a donor, and compared with that of N2200. The optimized all-PSCs based on PBDB-T:LA03 (2:1, w/w) with 1% CN additive treatment demonstrated a higher PCE of 6.49% with a high Voc of 0.937 V, which is improved in comparison with the optimized devices based on PBDB-T:N2200 with a PCE of 5.85% and a Voc of 0.812 V. The improved PCE of the LA03-based devices is mainly benefitted from its higher Voc which results from the up-shifted LUMO energy level of an LA03 acceptor. The results indicate that inserting a benzotriazole unit in the main chain of N2200 is an effective way to upshift its LUMO energy level and increase Voc of the all-PSCs.
