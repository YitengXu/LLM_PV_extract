    , Accepted 3rd December 2014First published on 5th December 2014AbstractTwo conjugated polymers with benzodithiophene derivatives as the donor unit and planar difluoro-substituted dibenzo[a,c]phenazine as the acceptor unit P1, P2-L and P2-H were designed, synthesized, and used as the donor material in polymer solar cells. P2-H exhibits the highest hole mobility of 1.54 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a blend of P1:PC71BM (1:1.5, by weight) as the active layer show the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.0% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.74 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 12.50 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.65.
Introduction
The characteristics of polymer solar cells (PSCs) such as light weight, flexibility, and being able to be produced by low cost inkjet printing and roll-to-roll processes have made PSCs a unique member of the solar cell family.1–3 Intensive research on designing new materials,4–7 device innovation,8–10 and interfacial modification11–14 in the last decade has rapidly enhanced the power conversion efficiency of PSCs up to 11%.15 The intrinsic properties of conjugated polymers have a great influence on the performance of PSCs, and the creation of new polymer donor materials has greatly contributed to the rapid development of PSCs.4,16–19 Research on developing new materials mainly focuses on the synthesis of new donor–acceptor (D–A) type small band gap polymers that can harvest more sunlight to generate higher short-circuit current density (Jsc).20
Quinoxaline derivatives with two electron-withdrawing imine nitrogen atoms have been widely used as the acceptor units for the synthesis of D–A polymers, and their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has reached more than 8%.21–24 The solubility and electronic properties of quinoxaline derivatives can be tuned by the variation of the substituents.25–28 D–A polymers with a planar quinoxaline acceptor unit exhibit much better photovoltaic performance than the corresponding less planar quinoxaline acceptor unit.29–32 Dibenzo[a,c]phenazine has been used to construct many D–A alternating conjugated polymers.33–36 In addition, the introduction of fluoro substituents on the acceptor units has been demonstrated to be a very efficient strategy to improve the PCE of PSCs, and fluorine substituents can lower the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the resulting conjugated polymers to afford higher open circuit voltage (Voc), increase the intramolecular polymer chain interaction to obtain higher hole mobility, and reduce the charge recombination to achieve higher efficiency.37–40 Here, we have designed and synthesized two D–A alternating conjugated polymers P1 and P2 with a planar polyaromatic quinoxaline derivative, 11,12-difluorodibenzo[a,c]phenazine, as the acceptor unit and benzodithiophene derivatives as the donor unit. The influences of side chains on the benzodithiophene unit and the molecular weight of polymers on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs were investigated. P2-H exhibits the highest hole mobility of 1.54 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a blend of P1:PC71BM (1:1.5, by weight) as the active layer show the highest PCE of 6.0% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.74 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.50 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.65.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
The syntheses of monomers and polymers are outlined in Scheme 1. Compound 1 was synthesized according to the literature procedure.41 The reduction of compound 1 with zinc dust in hot acetic acid afforded the corresponding diamine, which was used for the next step without further purification. The condensation of the diamine with phenanthrene-9,10-dione afforded compound 2 in a total yield of 61%. Bromination of compound 2 with Br2 in CH2Cl2 afforded M1 in a yield of 91%. The polymerization of M1 with M2 and M3 afforded P1 and P2, respectively. P2 was fractioned into low molecular weight fraction (P2-L) and high molecular weight fraction (P2-H) according to their solubility in chloroform. P2-L can be dissolved in hot chloroform. P1 and P2-H exhibited limited solubility in common chlorinated organic solvents such as CB, DCB, and TCB at room temperature, but could be fully dissolved in these solvents at elevated temperature. Molecular weights and their distributions were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using TCB as an eluent at 150 °C with narrowly distributed polystyrenes as the calibration standards, and the results are summarized in Table 1. These three polymers are of good thermal stability as indicated by thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements. The 5% decomposition temperatures of P1, P2-L, and P2-H are also shown in Table 1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements from 20 to 300 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere showed that there is no obvious glass transition for these polymers. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out to investigate the packing of polymer chains in the solid state. As shown in Fig. 1, XRD diffraction patterns of P1 exhibited two diffraction peaks. The first peak at the small angle region, which reflects the distance between the polymer backbones separated by the flexible side chains, is located at 2θ of 5.14°, corresponding to a distance of 17.2 Å.42 The second peak at the wide angle region reflects the π–π stacking distances between the polymer backbones, and is located at 2θ of 22.6°, corresponding to a distance of 3.9 Å.42P2-L and P2-H exhibit only a broad peak in the wide angle region, which is located at 20.9°, corresponding to a distance of 4.3 Å. For P2, the lack of a diffraction peak in the small angle region indicated that P2 formed a less ordered packing in the solid state as compared with P1. Compared with P1, the larger π–π stacking distance of P2 in the solid state indicates that the two 4,5-didecylthienyl substituents at the 4,8-position of benzodithiophene can prevent the close and ordered packing of polymer chains in the solid state. The results are consistent with the photovoltaic device results.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of P1, P2-L, and P2-H were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell. As shown in Fig. 3, these three polymers exhibited irreversible redox processes. The onset oxidation potentials of P1, P2-L, and P2-H are 0.59, 0.80, and 0.80 V, respectively. The HOMO levels of P1, P2-L, and P2-H were determined using the equation EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.71), to be −5.30, −5.51, and −5.51 eV, respectively. The LUMO levels of P1, P2-L, and P2-H were therefore calculated according to the equation ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg,opt to be −3.64, −3.81, and −3.81 eV, respectively. The data are also summarized in Table 2.

Optical properties
The optical properties of P1 and P2 in solutions and as thin films are investigated by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and shown in Fig. 2. The optical properties of low and high molecular weight polymer P2 are exactly the same, so we did not differentiate P2-L and P2-H here. UV-vis absorption spectra of P1 and P2 in dilute DCB solutions and as thin films are shown in Fig. 2. In solution both P1 and P2 exhibit a broad absorption with two peaks in the visible region. The absorption peaks are located at 431 and 614 nm for P1 and 421 and 591 nm for P2. Compared with their solution absorption spectra, the corresponding film spectra were red-shifted due to the aggregation of polymer chains in the solid state. All the solution and film optical absorption data are summarized in Table 2. The film absorption onsets (λedge) of P1 and P2 are 747 and 729 nm, respectively. The optical band gaps (Eg,opt) of P1 and P2 were therefore calculated to be 1.66 and 1.70 eV, respectively, according to the equation: Eg,opt = 1240/absorption onset.

Transport properties
Hole mobility up to 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 is usually required for polymer donors in order to obtain balanced electron and hole mobilities for the polymer and PCBM blends, and balanced mobility is very crucial for achieving high performance polymer solar cells. Transport properties of polymers were therefore investigated by fabricating field effect transistors (FETs). Bottom-contact devices were fabricated on Si/SiO2 substrates with low resistance Si as gate and SiO2 (500 nm) as gate insulator. Hole mobility (μ) was deduced from the derivative plots in the saturated regime through the equation IDS μ(W/2L)Ci(VG − VT)2 where IDS is the drain current, W is the channel width, L is the channel length, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer (SiO2, 500 nm, Ci = 11 nF cm−2), and VG and VT are the gain voltage and threshold voltage, respectively. Hole mobilities, VT, and on/off ratios are summarized in Table 3, the detailed data are shown in Table S1.† Transfer characteristic and output characteristic of polymers are shown in Fig. S1.† The hole mobilities of these polymers are close to the electron mobility of PC71BM.

Photovoltaic properties
Photovoltaic properties of polymers were evaluated using the device configuration ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The performance of devices was optimized by varying the weight ratio of the polymer to PC71BM, the concentration of blend solution, and the spin-coating speed. J–V curves of PSCs based on these three polymers are illustrated in Fig. 4(a). For P1, devices fabricated with the blends of P1 and PC71BM in a weight ratio of 1:1.5 in DCB solutions gave the best device performance with a PCE of 6.0%, a Voc of 0.74 V, a Jsc of 12.50 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.65. Devices fabricated with the blends of P2-L and PC71BM in a weight ratio of 1:1.5 in DCB solutions gave the best performance with a PCE of 1.7%, a Voc of 0.93 V, a Jsc of 4.54 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.40. For P2-H, a PCE of 2.8% with a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 5.90 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.50 can be achieved with a device fabricated under the same conditions as P2-L, and the data are summarized in Table 4. Ten devices were fabricated to give the average value of PCEs, and the detailed results are shown in Table S2.† The use of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the solvent additive for the processing of the active layer was also tried, but the photovoltaic performances were inferior to those of DIO free solvents.

As shown in Fig. 4(b), external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) were measured to examine the accuracy of Jsc, and the devices were fabricated under the best conditions for each polymer. For P1, the EQE value approached 0.6, leading to a high short circuit current for the devices. In comparison with P1 based devices, P2 based PSCs exhibited lower EQEs. The EQE value of P2-H based devices is higher than that of P2-L based devices. As observed for many conjugated polymers, high molecular weight materials usually gave high hole mobility and efficiency.
Film morphology
Usually, the extension of lateral conjugation of conjugated polymers can give higher photovoltaic performance;19 therefore, P2 with two thienyl substituents on the benzodithiophene unit was anticipated to afford high PCE. To understand why P1:PC71BM based PSCs gave much higher PCE than P2:PC71BM based PSCs, nanostructures of blend films were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the TEM images are shown in Fig. 5. TEM investigations revealed that P1:PC71BM blend films are homogeneous with nanoscale phase separation, whereas P2-L:PC71BM and P2-H:PC71BM blend films show apparent phase separation with the domain size of approximately 100 nm. The large domains are probably formed by the aggregation of PC71BM, indicating poor miscibility between P2 and PC71BM. The formation of large isolated spherical aggregations of PC71BM is detrimental to the transportation of electrons to the collecting electrode.

Conclusions
We have designed and synthesized two conjugated polymers based on difluoro-substituted dibenzo[a,c]phenazine and benzodithiophene derivatives. The two as-synthesized polymers were carefully characterized and used as the donor material in the BHJ PSCs. P1 gave the best device performance with PCE of 6.0%, a Voc of 0.74 V, and a Jsc of 12.50 mA cm−2. Both the main chain and side chain play important roles in the performance of polymer solar cells. The optical properties are mainly determined by the main chain structures, whereas the side chains can significantly influence the morphology of blend films. If the polymers have similar optical properties, their photovoltaic performance can be enhanced by optimizing the morphology of blend films through changing different side chains. The influences of side chains and the molecular weight on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs were also investigated. Compared to P1, P2-H with two lateral 2,3-didecylthiophene on the benzodithiophene unit has high molecular weight and better solubility in commonly used organic solvents. The formation of large aggregations in the P2-H:PC71BM blend films made the photovoltaic performance of P2-H inferior to that of P1.
