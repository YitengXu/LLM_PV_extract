    , Accepted 8th May 2013First published on 8th May 2013AbstractGraphene–Si Schottky junction solar cells are promising candidates for high-efficiency, low-cost photovoltaic applications. However, their performance enhancement is restricted by strong carrier recombination and relative low barrier height. Here, we demonstrated the successful construction of high-efficiency graphene–planar Si solar cells via modification of the Si surface with a molecule monolayer as well as tuning the interface band alignment with an organic electron blocking layer. Methylated Si showed the capability to effectively suppress the surface carrier recombination, leading to a remarkable improvement of device efficiency. The recombination was further reduced by inserting a thin P3HT organic layer; the unique band alignment could prevent electron transfer from n-Si to the graphene anode so as to minimize the current leakage. These methods, along with careful control of the graphene doping level and layer number, gave rise to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 10.56%. The scalability of the devices was further investigated by studying the device area dependent photovoltaic performance.
1 Introduction
Traditional wafer based silicon (Si) photovoltaic devices (p–n or p–i–n junction solar cells) usually need high temperature diffusion and costly ion implantation processes to form junctions for an efficient extraction of light-generated charge carriers. The complex fabrication processes and expensive equipment lead to the high cost of the photovoltaic devices. Thus, there has been a significant interest in exploring photovoltaic devices with high-efficiency and cost-effective manufacturing methods.1–3 Schottky-type solar cells possess simple device architecture and can be readily fabricated by depositing thin layers of metals or oxides on a Si wafer. Under light irradiation, the photogenerated carriers are separated by the built-in electric field at the Schottky junction, resulting in a photocurrent in the external circuit. However, the interface diffusion/reaction and small work function difference seriously restrict the stability and efficiency of this type of solar cell.4 With the rise of graphene, graphene based transparent conductive electrodes have attracted considerable attention due to their extraordinary properties like high optical transmittance, outstanding mechanical flexibility, and low sheet resistance.5–7 Graphene also possesses excellent chemical and physical stability with a tunable work function,8,9 avoiding interface diffusion and offering the capability to tune the Schottky barrier height as well. Recently, a new type of Schottky junction solar cell has been developed by combining graphene and Si together.10,11 Evidently, the use of graphene–Si Schottky structures can simplify the device structure, and facilitate light absorption as well as carrier separation/transport. In light of this, much attention has been focused on the study of graphene–Si hybrid solar cells and considerable progress has been made in the past two years. For instance, Li et al. reported few-layer graphene (FLG)–planar Si solar cells.10 In addition, by oxidating the Si surface and modifying graphene, Miao and co-workers demonstrated graphene–planar Si solar cells with improved performance.12 Besides planar Si, Si nanostructures such as nanowires (NWs) have been utilized to enhance the light absorption in the cells.13–16 However, the severe surface charge recombination in Si nanostructures arising from the large surface area-to-volume ratio impedes any further increase in efficiency.
In spite of the large amount of progress in the development of graphene–Si solar cells, their efficiencies are still not high enough to impose a substantial impact on the current photovoltaic techniques. The drawbacks of the traditional Schottky-type photovoltaic devices more or less exist in the current graphene–Si devices. One of the major concerns is the low Schottky barrier height, which is only 0.6–0.7 eV for the graphene–Si junction and much lower than that for the conventional Si p–n junction (1.12 eV). Although the work function of graphene could be enhanced via doping or by using multi-layer graphene,17,18 the available junction height is still too low and responsible for a large current leakage, leading to inferior device performance.19,20 On the other hand, unpassivated Si usually has a large velocity of charge recombination. Si oxidation in air is effective to reduce recombination, as described in a previous report,21 but the continued oxidation may result in a large tunnelling barrier and is harmful for the long-term stability of the devices.
In this work, Si surface passivation as well as interface band engineering were utilized so as to enhance the photovoltaic performance of the graphene–planar Si Schottky junction solar cells. A thin layer of organic film was inserted into the graphene–Si interface as an electron blocking layer, preventing charge recombination in the graphene anode. Meanwhile, methylation on Si was conducted to suppress the surface recombination and tune the band alignment near the Si surface as well. These methods, together with the use of graphene with the optimum number of layers and doping level, ensure the fabrication of graphene–planar Si solar cells with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 10.56%. Our results manifest the importance of surface passivation and interface band engineering for achieving high-efficiency graphene–Si solar cells.
2 Experimental details
2.1 Surface modification of planar Si
N-type Si substrate (orientation <100>, resistivity 1–10 Ω cm−1) with a 300 nm thick SiO2 insulating layer was used in our experiments. The surface of the SiO2–Si substrate was first protected by an adhesive tape with an opening window of 2 × 2 mm2, which defined the effective work area of the solar cell. The SiO2 insulating layer within the window was then removed by buffered oxide etch (BOE) solution. The hydrogen-terminated Si (denoted as H-Si) substrates were obtained by further immersing the SiO2–Si substrate into an aqueous HF (5 M) solution with gentle shaking for 10 min, followed by cleaning in deionized water for 1 min. The substrate was then dried by a stream of nitrogen gas and the adhesive tape on the substrate was peeled off. The H-Si was directly exposed to air for 1.5 h to allow spontaneous oxidation of the Si, forming the silicon oxide terminated Si (denoted as SiOx-Si).21 The thickness of the oxide layer was determined to be ∼1.5 nm by a spectroscopic ellipsometer (J. A. Woollam). Methyl-terminated Si (denoted as CH3-Si) was prepared following a two-step chlorination/alkylation method and the details were described in previous reports.22–25 Briefly, the H-Si was first immersed into a saturated PCl5 solution in chlorobenzene for 50 min at 90 ± 10 °C under a protective N2 atmosphere in the glovebox to transform the Si–H bonds to Si–Cl bonds. And the Cl-terminated Si was rinsed sequentially with chlorobenzene and tetrahydrofuran three times. Then the substrate was treated with CH3MgCl (1 M) solution in tetrahydrofuran for at least 8 h at 70 ± 10 °C and rinsed with tetrahydrofuran. Eventually the CH3-terminated Si was formed after this process.
2.2 Graphene preparation and characterization
Large-area monolayer graphene (MLG) films were prepared at 1000 °C by using a mixed gas system of CH4 (40 sccm) and H2 (20 sccm) via a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method and 25 μm thick Cu foil was used as the catalytic substrate during the synthesis process.26 After growth, 5 wt% polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) in chlorobenzene was spin-coated on the MLG films, and then the underlying Cu foils were removed in Marble's reagent solution (CuSO4:HCl:H2O = 10 g:50 ml:50 ml). The resulted MLG films were cleaned in deionized water several times. The MLG films were characterized by Raman spectroscopy (Jobin Yvon/Labram HR800) with a 633 nm laser at a beam size of 2 μm. The sheet resistances and transmittances of the graphene films with different stacking layer number were measured by a digital four-probe tester (JG/ST-2258A) and a spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer/Lambda 750) equipped with an integrating sphere, respectively.
2.3 Device construction and evaluation
To construct the graphene–planar Si Schottky solar cells, a Ti/Au (10 nm/50 nm) electrode, which served as the electrical contact for graphene, was first deposited on the SiO2–Si substrate near the exposed Si window by using a shadow mask via electron-beam evaporation. Then the PMMA-supported MLG films were directly transferred onto the top of the substrate. Graphene would then be in contact with the exposed Si, forming the Schottky junction. After drying at 100 °C for 10 min, the residual PMMA on the MLG film was removed by acetone. By repeating this process, FLG films consisting of 1–6 MLG layers could be fabricated. An indium–gallium (In–Ga) alloy was then pasted on the rear side of the Si substrate as the ohmic contact for the Si. For the devices with an electron blocking layer, the organic layer was deposited on Si within the window area by spin-coating a P3HT solution in chlorobenzene at 3000 rpm for 1 min. After that, the substrate was baked in a nitrogen atmosphere at 150 °C for 30 min. Then the P3HT layer outside the window was removed by a ethanol dipped cotton swab. The thickness of the P3HT layer was controlled by adjusting the solution concentration. P3HT layer thicknesses of ∼5, ∼10, ∼20, and ∼40 nm corresponded to P3HT concentrations of 0.5, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene, respectively. The precise P3HT layer thickness was determined by a spectroscopic ellipsometer. Finally, the graphene–P3HT–planar Si devices were finished by transferring a FLG film onto the top of the P3HT layer.
The structure of the graphene–P3HT–planar Si solar cell was investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN). The photovoltaic characteristics of the solar cells were evaluated by a Keithley 2612 source meter in an ambient environment. A Newport 91160 solar simulator equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp and an air mass (AM) 1.5 filter was used to generate simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation. The irradiation intensity was 100 mW cm−2 calibrated by a Newport standard Si solar cell 91150.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Device structure

Fig. 1(a) shows the schematic illustration of a graphene–planar Si Schottky junction solar cell with a P3HT electron blocking layer inserted between the graphene and Si layers. In order to gain a deeper insight into the structure of the practical device, a cross-sectional HRTEM investigation on the 5-layer FLG–10 nm P3HT–CH3-Si device was performed, as shown in Fig. 1(b). It is clear that the device has a layer stacked structure; the single crystalline planar Si is covered by ∼10 nm amorphous P3HT, while the continuous FLG film consisting of ∼5 layer MLG films is in close contact with the P3HT layer. Raman spectra tests on an individual MLG reveals a 2D-band to G-band intensity ratio of I2D:IG ≈ 3.3 (ESI, Fig. S1†), indicating the high crystal quality of the monolayer graphene film.27 The distance between adjacent MLG layers in the HRTEM image is around 0.36 nm, which is slightly larger than the interplanar spacing of graphite (0.335 nm). The methyl-termination groups on Si are not observed in the HRTEM image due to the single molecular thickness. Notably, the interfaces between CH3-Si and P3HT as well as P3HT and FLG appear sharp, and there is no evidence of interface mixing and physical damage to the layers resulting from the spin coating of P3HT and wet-transfer of the FLG film.

Fig. 2 shows the energy band diagrams and the corresponding charge transportation under light irradiation of the graphene–Si solar cells with and without a P3HT layer. From Fig. 2(a), it can be seen that a space charge region is established at the graphene–n-Si interface as a result of the difference in their Fermi energy levels. The space charge region is mainly located at the n-Si side due to the ultra-thin thickness and semi-metallic properties of graphene. Upon light irradiation, electron–hole pairs generated in the n-Si side within one diffusion length from the edge of the space charge region will diffuse to the space charge region and subsequently be separated by the built-in electric field; electrons drift to the n-Si, collected by the bottom In–Ga alloy cathode, while holes drift to the graphene anode, transferring through the graphene layer and are finally collected by the Ti/Au electrode (solid lines in Fig. 2(a)). This process results in the generation of a photocurrent. The built-in electric field also represents a barrier to the electrons, preventing their diffusion from n-Si to graphene and thus reducing the carrier recombination at the anode (dashed line in Fig. 2(a)). However, the relative low Schottky barrier height (Φb) between graphene and n-Si (∼0.6–0.7 eV) will inevitably lead to a large current leakage and consequently a high reverse dark-saturation current density. As a result, the device shows a degradation in performance. Therefore, in order to achieve high-efficiency graphene–Si solar cells, the existence of an electron blocking layer at the anode is highly desired to reduce the unfavorable carrier recombination. We note that a similar strategy has been widely used in the study of organic photovoltaics (OPV) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) already.28,29 In this study, a thin conductive polymer layer, P3HT, was inserted between the graphene and planar Si layers (Fig. 2(b)). The conduction band minimum (EC) and valence band maximum (EV) of n-Si are 4.05 eV and 5.17 eV, respectively, compared to 3.2 eV and 5.1 eV for the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of P3HT.30 It is noted that the LUMO of P3HT is much higher than the EC of Si. The EC–LUMO offset (∼0.8 eV) thus presents a large barrier for electron transportation from Si to graphene, minimizing recombination in the graphene side by confining the electrons in Si. Meanwhile, the HOMO of the organic layer is close to the EV of Si. The small EV–HOMO offset allows the efficient transport of holes from Si to graphene. Also, the use of p-type P3HT can form an organic–inorganic hybrid heterojunction with the n-type Si. The strong built-in electric field at the organic–inorganic interface can facilitate the carrier extraction from Si and further reduce the recombination. We note that the P3HT layer can be readily fabricated by a cost-effective spin-coating method at room temperature, hence the use of a P3HT layer in the graphene–Si devices won't significantly increase the device process complexity.

3.2 Surface passivation on Si
Unpassivated Si with a large number of surface dangling bonds always leads to a poor photovoltaic performance due to the rapid surface carrier recombination. Appropriate surface passivation is critical to achieve high-efficiency Si based photovoltaic devices. In traditional Si solar cells, inorganic thin films, such as SiO2, Al2O3, and SiNx, were widely used as the passivation layers on Si.31 However, thick oxide or nitride layers will block the carrier transport and therefore are not suitable for graphene–Si solar cell applications. In a previous report, spontaneous oxidation of fresh Si in air for 1–2 h was adopted to generate an ultrathin SiOx passivation layer on it, allowing the tunnelling transport of carriers.12,21 However, it is clear that the thickness of the oxide layer seriously depends on the crystal orientation of Si, as well as the environmental conditions (e.g., humidity). This may reduce the reliability and reproducibility of the SiOx-terminated Si photovoltaic devices. As an alternative, surface modification with a single-molecule layer appears to be a promising method and might be particularly useful for graphene–Si solar cells. Among various surface modifications, hydrogen-terminated Si is easy to obtain but its surface recombination velocity is still too high (∼500 cm s−1), and its chemical stability over time is poor.32 Other molecule monolayers, such as methyl,33 alkyl,34 and CH2CH–(CH2)8–C(O)–O–CH3,35 exhibit the capability to reduce the surface recombination of Si. In particular, the surface recombination velocity for CH3-Si is as low as 45 cm s−1,32 leading to a remarkable performance enhancement in Si–organic hybrid solar cells after methyl modification.22
In order to clarify the effects of surface modification, in this work, we constructed graphene–P3HT–Si Schottky junction solar cells with different surface modifications. The layer number of FLG film and the P3HT thickness were tentatively optimized to be 4 layers and 10 nm, respectively. Fig. 3(a) shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the graphene–P3HT–Si devices with various surface modifications in the dark. By the virtue of the formation of Schottky junctions, all the devices exhibit excellent rectifying behaviors. It is noted that the SiOx-Si device displays a much lower forward current compared to the other devices due to the existence of the insulative Si oxide, which acts as a tunnelling barrier and increases the series resistance in the circuit. In contrast, a large forward current is observed for the CH3-Si device, implying an effective carrier transport through the molecule monolayer. Based on the dark lnJ versus voltage (lnJ–V) curves (inset in Fig. 3(a)), the diode ideality factors (n) for H-Si, SiOx-Si and CH3-Si based junctions are estimated to be 2.26, 1.99 and 1.80, respectively. The minimum value for CH3-Si indicates the lower recombination current within the space charge region after surface CH3 modification. Under AM 1.5 G illumination, pronounced photovoltaic characteristics were observed for the devices, but the performance of the CH3-Si device is much superior to others (Fig. 3(b)). The PCEs of the H-Si and SiOx-Si devices are 1.41% and 1.76%, respectively, while the PCE is remarkably enhanced to 4.42% for the CH3-Si device, which is more than 3 times that of the H-Si device. In addition, the short circuit current density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) increase dramatically from 15.40 mA cm−2, 0.35 V, and 0.263, respectively, for the H-Si device to 27.26 mA cm−2, 0.43 V, and 0.377, respectively, for the CH3-Si device. This result is mainly attributed to the lower surface recombination velocity of CH3-Si, while the optimized energy offset at the methylated Si surface is another reason. According to a previous report,22 the offset of surface electron affinity for CH3-Si and SiOx-Si was +0.35 eV and +0.15 eV, respectively, with respect to the Si without surface modification, while it is −0.12 eV for H-Si. Therefore, the built-in electric field in graphene–P3HT–CH3-Si junction could be greatly strengthened compared to other device counterparts, resulting in an obvious performance enhancement.

(d) EQE spectra of the H-Si, SiOx-Si and CH3-Si based cells before and after HNO3 doping. 
After performing graphene doping in HNO3 vapor for 3 min, all the devices exhibit much improved photovoltaic performances (Fig. 3(b)), while the tendency is unchanged. The PCEs of the H-Si, SiOx-Si and CH3-Si devices are significantly enhanced to 5.88%, 6.88% and 9.70%, respectively, indicating the positive effect of HNO3 doping. Table 1 shows the key parameters of the graphene–Si devices with different surface modifications. It is worth noting that the JSC of the CH3-Si device is much larger than that of the H-Si and SiOx-Si devices regardless of HNO3 doping, verifying the effect of CH3-termination on suppressing the carrier recombination. On the other hand, the promotion of the VOC after doping could be ascribed to the increase of the FLG work function.36 The dark J–V curves of the CH3-Si device before and after HNO3 doping are plotted in Fig. 3(c). It is seen that the forward current is substantially improved, while n decreases from 1.80 to 1.67 after doping due to the decrease in the sheet resistance of the FLG film. Fig. 3(d) shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of these devices. After doping, the EQE of the CH3-Si device is increased to above 70% over a wide wavelength range from 400 to 750 nm, in contrast to the small EQE of ∼60% in a narrow spectrum range from 500 to 700 nm for the H-Si and SiOx-Si devices. The larger EQE of the CH3-Si device further identifies that the carrier transfer and collection are more efficient in the CH3-Si device. Besides HNO3 doping, AuCl3 doping on FLG was also performed and gave rise to a similar device performance (ESI, Fig. S2†). So, it is possible that the volatile oxidant doping could be replaced by a more persistent doping method in future studies.

3.3 P3HT thickness

Fig. 4(a) depicts the P3HT thickness dependent photovoltaic characteristics of 4-layer FLG–P3HT–planar Si solar cells. All the devices were doped with HNO3 vapor for 3 min before measurements. It is clear that the device without a P3HT layer (thickness 0 nm) yields the worst performance, while the performance is substantially improved after the insertion of a P3HT layer. This result is in accordance with the expectations based on the energy band analysis mentioned above (Fig. 2). With increasing P3HT thickness, JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE increase remarkably from 21.85 mA cm−2, 0.38 V, 0.510, and 4.24% for the device without a P3HT layer to 28.99 mA cm−2, 0.50 V, 0.669, and 9.70% for the device with a 10 nm P3HT layer. The maximum efficiency is achieved at a P3HT thickness around 10–20 nm, while a further increase of the P3HT thickness to 40 nm leads to an obvious performance degradation. Moreover, the EQE in Fig. 4(b) displays the same behaviour as that in Fig. 4(a); a P3HT thickness of 10–20 nm yields the highest EQE of around 80%, in contrast to ∼60% for the devices without or with thick P3HT layers.

(d) Semi-logarithmic plots of the photovoltaic characteristics of 4-layer FLG–CH3-Si solar cells with different P3HT layer thicknesses in the dark. 
P3HT serves as an electron blocking layer in the FLG–Si solar cells. However, if the P3HT layer was too thin, which was the case for 5 nm P3HT, FLG might be in direct contact with n-Si because of the existence of pinholes in the polymer layer. The large leakage current thus leads to a poor device performance. On the contrary, if P3HT was too thick (>40 nm), the inferior conductivity of P3HT would prevent the efficient hole transport from n-Si to FLG and also result in a poor device performance. It is known that light absorption in a thin P3HT layer (<20 nm) is negligible and the carriers are mainly generated in n-Si. However, P3HT absorption would become more pronounced with a thick P3HT layer; the strong carrier recombination in P3HT could lead to degradation of the device performance. Hence, there is a trade-off between the P3HT thickness and device performance. The best device performance is expected to be achieved at such a P3HT thickness that it is equal or close to its carrier diffusion length (∼10 nm),37–39 which is in good agreement with the optimized value obtained in this work.
In order to elucidate the underlying reason for the increase in VOC and FF as a result of the insertion of a P3HT layer, we further analyzed the J–V characteristics of the devices in the dark. Fig. 4(c) displays the equivalent circuit model of a solar cell. Under open circuit conditions, and by assuming a large shunt resistance (Rshunt) and a small series resistance (Rseries), the following relationship could be obtained:40,41 (1)where Jph is the photocurrent density, Jo is the reverse dark-saturation current density, q is the elementary charge, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and A is the active area of the device. From this equation, it is suggested that a decrease in Jo should result in an increase in VOC for the device. From Fig. 4(d), it is seen that Jo decreases obviously with increasing P3HT thickness, indicating that the carrier recombination is suppressed with the insertion of a P3HT layer. Accordingly, the VOC increases dramatically from 0.38 V for 0 nm P3HT to 0.47–0.50 eV for P3HT > 10 nm. In addition, the insertion of the P3HT layer also turned out to be effective to enhance the Rshunt value and rectification ratio (Table 2). As a result, the FF value is increased due to the reduction in the leakage current and suppression of the carrier recombination.42,43

3.4 Graphene doping time and layer number
From Fig. 5(a), it is shown that the device performance increases immediately after 1 min of HNO3 vapor doping and reaches its maximum value at 3 min doping. Further prolonging the doping time leads to a slight decrease of the device performance. This is likely caused by the strong acid damaging the organic layer. By fixing the doping time at 3 min, the impact of the FLG layer number was also studied, as shown in Fig. 5(b–d). Significantly, it is found that the device performance strongly depends on the FLG layer number; VOC slightly increases from 0.45 V for MLG to 0.48 V for 5-layer FLG, while JSC and FF are dramatically enhanced from 19.97 mA cm−2 and 0.463 for MLG to 32.83 mA cm−2 and 0.670 for 5-layer FLG. As a result, the PCE of the 5-layer FLG device reaches 10.56%, which is more than twice that of the MLG device (4.16%). This performance enhancement can be attributed to the increase in sheet conductivity as well as the work function of the multi-layer graphene films (ESI, Fig. S3(a)†). Nevertheless, the device based on 6-layer FLG exhibits an obvious degradation of performance. The lower optical transmittance of the thick FLG film may account for this result; the transmittance of the MLG film is higher than 95%, while it is lower than 82% for the 6-layer FLG film (ESI, Fig. S3(b)†). EQE curves in Fig. 5(d) also verify the tendency of the layer number dependent performance. It is noted that 5-layer FLG device has a highest EQE up to ∼80% in the wavelength range 500–750 nm.

(c) Plots of VOC, JSC, FF and PCE as functions of the FLG layer number. (d) EQE values of the FLG–CH3-Si solar cells with different FLG layer numbers. The P3HT thickness was fixed at 10 nm in the above devices. 
It is worth mentioning that the use of graphene as a top electrode is crucial to achieve high-efficiency solar cells. In a control experiment, the FLG film was replaced by a thin metal film, which is often used in P3HT–Si hybrid solar cells (ESI, Fig. S4(a) and (b)†). It is noted that the metal electrode based device shows a much worse performance as compared to the device with the FLG electrode. The poor light transmittance of the metal electrode is an important reason that accounts for this result (ESI, Fig. S4(c)†). Also, it is suggested that the graphene film can offer better electrical contact with the P3HT layer, as disclosed by the HRTEM investigation shown in Fig. 1(b). Additionally, the metal film has high chance of penetrating the organic layer and then directly contacting or forming an alloy with the Si substrate, resulting in a large leakage current and consequently lowering the device efficiency. Table 2 summarizes the photovoltaic parameters of the FLG–Si solar cells studied in this work. To the best of our knowledge, the efficiency of 10.56% is the highest efficiency value for graphene–Si solar cells up to now.
3.5 Device area
In previous works, a relative small device area of less than 10 mm2 was often adopted,12,13 while the device area dependent performance was rarely investigated. Considering the relative large sheet resistivity of graphene, which remains >65 Ω □−1 for 5-layer FLG even after HNO3 doping (ESI, Fig. S3(a)†), the device area should play an important role in determining the device performance. Here, we further evaluated the photovoltaic characteristics of 5-layer FLG–CH3-Si solar cells with various device areas from 4 to 100 mm2, and both 10 and 20 nm P3HT electron blocking layers were adopted in this study, as shown in Fig. 6. It is noted that all the device parameters decrease with increased device area. The degradation of the device performance can be attributed to the increased internal resistance associated with the larger-sized FLG films. Also, the interface recombination will become more severe since holes have to travel a longer distance from graphene to the outer electrode for effective collection. On the other hand, it is noted that the performance variation is not identical for different P3HT thickness. At a small device area of 4 mm2, the 10 nm P3HT layer based device exhibits close or even superior performance to the 20 nm P3HT layer based device. However, with increasing device area, the performance decline of the former is steeper than the latter. The PCE of the 10 nm device decreases from 10.56% at 4 mm2 to 3.62% at 100 mm2, while the 20 nm device shows a gentler decrease from 10.41% at 4 mm2 to 4.74% at 100 mm2. It is known that impurities and defects at the graphene–Si interface can serve as short-circuit channels and lead to current leakage. Predictably, the current leakage will be more evident at a larger device size. In comparison to the thin P3HT layer, a thick P3HT layer can offer better coverage to impurities and defects and thus is conducive to the decrease of the current leakage. In future studies, it is expected that the performance of large-size graphene–Si solar cells could be further improved by means of enhancing the sheet conductivity of graphene, eliminating the interface defects, adding a mesh electrode on graphene and so on.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated the important roles of surface passivation and interface band engineering in tuning the device performance of graphene–planar Si Schottky junction solar cells. It was found that high-efficiency solar cells could be achieved by modifying the Si surface to suppress carrier recombination as well as introducing an organic film as an electron blocking layer at the interface. The effects of various Si surface modifications, electron blocking layer thickness, and graphene doping level and layer number were systematically studied and an optimum PCE of 10.56% was achieved for 5-layer FLG–P3HT (10 nm)–CH3-Si. In addition, the device area dependent photovoltaic characteristics indicated a performance degradation at larger device areas because of the relatively large sheet resistance of graphene. Even so, the device still showed a moderate efficiency of 4.74% at a large device area of 100 mm2, revealing the great potential of the graphene–Si solar cells for large scale photovoltaic applications.
