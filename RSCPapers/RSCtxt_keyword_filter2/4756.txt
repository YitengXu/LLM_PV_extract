1. Introduction
Solution processable conjugated polymers possessing low bandgaps have been the subject of intensive research in the field of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices.1 Incorporation of transition metals into conjugated polymer structures has been an intriguing strategy in order to obtain organic materials with novel properties characteristic of metals.2 Among various transition metal complexes, Pt(II) complexes are unique for intrinsically adopting square planar geometries and can serve as building blocks for linear long-chain structures.3 These complexes typically show strong spin–orbital coupling effects that induce formation of long-lived triplet excitons, which have been considered beneficial for OPV operations.4 Thus, Pt containing conjugated polymers have recently attracted significant attention in OPV research.5 A variety of conjugated polymers containing Pt(II)-diacetylenide building blocks have been prepared and studied in detail.6 Promising efficiencies over 4% have been observed in some devices applying such polymers possessing low bandgaps.7
Pt-containing polymers applied in OPVs to date exclusively have the basic structures as shown in Scheme 1. The trans-bis(trialkylphosphine)platinum diacetylenide building blocks serve as structural scaffoldings that connect various organic and organometallic chromophores to form linear conjugated polymer chains. Electronic and photophysical properties of the resulting polymers, including bandgaps, frontier energy levels and triplet yields, are mainly determined by the nature of these chromophores. Typical low bandgap Pt polymers contain organic chromophores featuring several electron-rich and -poor aromatic moieties connected in series.7 Low bandgaps are resulted from intra-molecular charge transfer excitation. In such donor–acceptor design, chromophores typically contain several aromatic rings side-by-side and are relatively long in length. The increased chromophore sizes can potentially dilute Pt induced spin–orbital coupling effects and lower triplet generation yields.4c

Boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes are a unique class of organic chromophores, possessing compact sizes, high stability, large fluorescence quantum yields and tunable chemical/physical properties through well-established reactions.8 BODIPY dyes and conjugated polymers containing BODIPY building blocks have recently been applied in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs and promising performances have been identified.9 Interestingly, Zhao et al. have recently reported bis-platinated BODIPY small molecule derivatives that displayed long-lived room temperature phosphorescence and were applied in photosensitized up-conversion through triplet–triplet annihilation.10 Thus, combining BODIPY and Pt-acetylenide building blocks into polymer structures, which has not been reported previously, provides new opportunities in OPV research.
We report herein the synthesis and photovoltaic properties of a novel low bandgap, solution processable conjugated polymer based on Pt-diacetylenide scaffolds and BODIPY chromophores.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and general methods
All reagents and solvents were used as received from Sigma-Aldrich or VWR unless otherwise noted. Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was purchased from American Dye Source. trans-Dichlorobis(tri-n-butylphosphine)platinum(II) (Pt1) was synthesized according to previously reported procedures.11 Anhydrous THF was distilled over Na/benzophenone prior to use. Anhydrous dichloromethane was obtained by distillation over CaH2 and degassed through several freeze–pump–thaw cycles. 300.13 MHz 1H, 75.48 MHz 13C, 96.25 MHz 11B, 121.5 MHz 31P, and 282.4 MHz 19F NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III Solution 300 spectrometer. All solution 1H and 13C NMR spectra were referenced internally to tetramethylsilane and 11B, 31P and 19F NMR spectra were referenced by using external standards Et2O·BF3 (0 ppm), H3PO4 (0 ppm) and C6F6 (−164.9 ppm), respectively. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analyses were performed in chloroform with 0.5% (v/v) triethylamine (1 mL min−1) using a Waters Breeze system equipped with a 2707 autosampler, a 1515 isocratic HPLC pump and a 2414 refractive index detector. Two styragel columns (Polymer Laboratories; 5 μm Mix-C), which were kept in a column heater at 35 °C, were used for separation. The columns were calibrated with polystyrene standards (Varian). Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Alpha-P instrument, using powder samples in ATR mode. Ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2401 PC spectrometer over a wavelength range of 240–1100 nm. Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained using a Varian Cary Eclipse Fluorimeter. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed on a Mettler Toledo DSC STARe system with a ca. 10 mg sample and at a scan rate of 10 °C min−1. The results reported are from the second heating cycle. Cyclic voltammetry was performed at 25 °C on a CH Instrument CHI604xD electrochemical analyzer using a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode calibrated using a ferrocene redox couple (4.8 eV below vacuum). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken on a JEOL 2010 EX HREM with an Oxford-Link EDS Gatan Digital Micrograph equipped with a slow scan CCD camera. Samples were prepared by soaking solar cell devices employing PEDOT:PSS as anode interfacial layers in water and fishing out floating active layers with carbon coated TEM grids. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was performed on a Waters/Micromass LCT Premier system operating under electrospray ionization (ESI) mode. Elemental analysis was performed by ALS Life Sciences Division located in Tucson, Arizona.
2.2 Solar cell fabrication and testing

P1/PCBM blend solutions were prepared by dissolving P1 and PCBM at predetermined weight ratios in chlorobenzene at a polymer concentration of 0.5 wt% and stirred at 80 °C overnight in a nitrogen glove box (Innovative Technology, model PL-He-2GB, O2 < 0.5 ppm, H2O < 0.5 ppm) before device fabrication. Solar cell devices were fabricated according to the following procedure: ITO-coated glass substrates (China Shenzhen Southern Glass Display Ltd., 8 Ω □−1) were cleaned by ultrasonication sequentially in detergent, DI water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, each for 15 min. These ITO-coated glass substrates were further treated by UV-ozone (PSD Series, Novascan) for 60 min before being transferred to a nitrogen glove box (Innovative Technology, model PL-He-4GB-1800, O2 < 0.1 ppm, H2O < 0.1 ppm) for MoO3 deposition. MoO3 (10 nm) was deposited using an Angstrom Engineering Åmod deposition system at a base vacuum level of <7 × 10−8 Torr. The polymer/fullerene blend solution was first filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE filter and spin-coated on top of the MoO3 layer at 900 rpm for 45 s. Al (100 nm) was thermally evaporated through patterned shadow masks as anodes. Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source-measuring unit under simulated AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−3) generated by a Xe arc-lamp based Newport 67005 150 W solar simulator equipped with an AM1.5G filter. The light intensity was calibrated using a Newport thermopile detector (model 818P-010-12) equipped with a Newport 1916-C Optical Power Meter.
2.3 Synthesis details

Hexyl 4-formylbenzoate (2). 
In a 100 mL flask, 1.50 g of 4-formylbenzoic acid (10.0 mmol) and 2.76 g of potassium carbonate (20.0 mmol) were dissolved in 30.0 mL dry DMF and then 4.20 mL 1-bromohexane (30 mmol) was added through a syringe. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight at 70 °C. After cooling to r.t., the mixture was washed with H2O and extracted with Et2O 3 times. The organic phases were combined and washed with brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After removal of all solvents under reduced pressure, the product was purified by vacuum distillation (180 mTorr, 90–93 °C) as a colorless oil (1.98 g, 80% yield). 1H NMR (300.13 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = 10.10 (s, 1H), 8.18 (d, 2H), 7.96 (d, 2H), 4.35 (t, 2H), 1.79 (m, 2H), 1.33–1.48 (m, 6H), 0.91 (t, 3H). 13C NMR (75.48 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = 191.5, 165.5, 139.0, 130.0, 129.4, 65.6, 31.3, 28.5, 25.6, 22.4, 13.9.


BODIPY (3). 
Compound 2 (1.20 g, 5.00 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (300 mL) to which was added 2,4-dimethylpyrrole (1.00 mL, 10.0 mmol) and the mixture was degassed by three vacuum-N2 refill cycles. A few drops of trifluoroacetic acid (ca. 0.05 mL) were then added and the reaction was stirred at room temperature overnight. The solution color gradually changed from yellow to deep wine-red over the course of the reaction. DDQ (1.14 g, 5.00 mmol) was then added into the solution. After stirring for 1 hour, 10.0 mL triethylamine (57.0 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for another 20 min. Finally, 10.0 mL boron trifluoride etherate (79.0 mmol) was added and the reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 2 h. Solvents were removed under reduced pressure and the residue was first washed with H2O and then extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phase was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. Compound 2 was purified by silica gel chromatography with hexane–ethyl acetate as a dark red solid (0.850 g, 37.8% yield). 1H NMR (300.13 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = 8.18 (d, 2H), 7.40 (d, 2H), 5.99 (s, 2H), 4.36 (t, 2H), 2.56 (s, 6H), 1.81 (m, 2H), 1.47 (m, 6H), 1.38 (s, 6H), 0.91 (t, 3H). 13C NMR (75.48 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = 166.0, 155.9, 142.8, 140.2, 139.6, 131.1, 130.9, 129.9, 128.3, 121.4, 65.5, 31.4, 28.6, 25.7, 22.5, 14.5, 13.9.


2,6-Diiodo-BODIPY (4). 
BODIPY 3 (452 mg, 1.00 mmol) was dissolved in 18.0 mL dichloromethane and the flask was purged with N2. A solution of N-iodosuccinimide in anhydrous DMF which had been degassed for 20 min was slowly added to the flask via a syringe. The reaction mixture was vigorously stirred overnight at room temperature. After the reaction finished, dichloromethane was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was washed with H2O and extracted with ethyl ether. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. BODIPY 3 was purified by silica gel chromatography with hexane–dichloromethane as a red solid (370 mg, 52.5% yield). 1H NMR (300.13 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = 8.22 (d, 2H), 7.38 (d, 2H), 4.37 (t, 2H), 2.65 (s, 6H), 1.81 (m, 2H), 1.50 (m, 6H), 1.39 (s, 6H), 0.92 (t, 3H). 13C NMR (75.48 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 165.8, 157.3, 145.1, 139.9, 139.3, 131.7, 130.8, 130.5, 128.2, 65.7, 31.4, 28.6, 25.7, 22.5, 17.1, 16.0, 14.0.


2,6-Bis(trimethylsilylethynyl)BODIPY (5). 
BODIPY 4 (176 mg, 0.250 mmol) was placed in a pressure vessel equipped with a magnetic stir bar. The flask and its contents were transferred to a glove box under an argon atmosphere. Pd(PPh3)4 (14.4 mg, 5.00 mol%) and CuI (10 mg, 20.0 mol%) were added to the pressure vessel under argon. Triethylamine (1.50 mL, 10.0 mmol), trimethylsilylacetylene (0.100 mL, 0.700 mmol) and toluene (5.00 mL) were then added to the vessel. The pressure vessel was sealed and taken out of the glove box. The reaction was carried out at 90 °C for 6 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. BODIPY 5 was purified by silica gel chromatography with hexane–dichloromethane as a red solid (147 mg, 91.7% yield). 1H NMR (300.13 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = 8.21 (d, 2H), 7.37 (d, 2H), 4.37 (t, 2H), 2.63 (s, 6H), 1.81 (m, 2H), 1.43 (s, 6H), 1.37 (m, 6H), 0.94 (t, 3H), 0.20 (s, 18H).


2,6-Diethynyl-BODIPY (M1). 
BODIPY 5 (147 mg, 0.230 mmol) was dissolved in THF (4.00 mL), purged with N2 and the solution was cooled to −78 °C. A solution of tetrabutylammonium fluoride in THF (1 M, 1.15 mL, 1.15 mmol) was added dropwise via a syringe. The reaction mixture was then removed from the cooling bath and stirred at room temperature for 3 h. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the crude product was washed with H2O and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. M1 was purified by silica gel chromatography with hexane–dichloromethane as a red solid (34.5 mg, 30% yield). 1H NMR (300.13 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = 8.22 (d, 2H), 7.40 (d, 2H), 4.37 (t, 2H), 3.32 (s, 2H), 2.65 (s, 6H), 1.81 (m, 2H), 1.39 (s, 6H), 1.37 (m, 6H), 0.91 (t, 3H). 13C NMR (75.48 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = 165.8, 159.3, 145.2, 138.8, 131.6, 130.5, 128.1, 115.4, 84.3, 75.6, 65.7, 31.4, 28.6, 25.7, 22.5, 14.0, 13.5, 13.4. 11B NMR (96.25 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = 0.198 (t, JB–F = 29.3 Hz). 19F NMR (282.4 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = −144.4 (q, JF–B = 31.0 Hz).

Polymer P1. 
BODIPY M1 (300 mg, 0.600 mmol), trans-[PtCl2(P(C4H9)3)2] (Pt1, 402 mg, 0.600 mmol), CuI (22.8 mg, 0.120 mmol) and Et3N–CH2Cl2 (90.0 mL, 1:2, v/v) were charged in a pressure vessel under argon and sealed before taken out of the glovebox. After stirring at room temperature overnight, the reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness. The residue was purified by Soxhlet extraction sequentially using methanol, acetone and chloroform. After concentration of the chloroform solution, the purple solid was collected by precipitation into a large excess of methanol. Subsequent washing with copious methanol and drying under high vacuum gave the targeted polymer (P1) as a purple solid (590 mg, 89.6% yield). 1H NMR (300.13 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = 8.14 (2H), 7.35 (2H), 4.36 (2H), 2.60 (6H), 1.99 (14H), 1.80 (2H), 1.34–1.47 (45H), 0.84 (26H). 13C NMR (75.48 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = 166.3, 157.4, 140.4, 139.1, 137.7, 130.8, 130.3, 130.0, 128.6, 121.7, 65.7, 31.4, 28.6, 26.3, 25.7, 24.3, 24.2, 24.1, 23.8, 23.6, 23.4, 22.5, 13.9, 13.8, 13.4. 11B NMR (96.25 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = 0.369. 31P NMR (121.5 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = 3.75 (JP–Pt = 2366 Hz). 19F NMR (282.4 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = −145.3.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis of monomers and the BODIPY–Pt alternating polymer P1 is summarized in Scheme 2. The trans-dichlorobis(tri-n-butylphosphine)platinum(II) (Pt1) was prepared according to reported procedures.11 All synthetic intermediates were fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy and the chemical structure of M1 was further confirmed by high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). The reaction of an equal molar amount of M1 and Pt1 in Et3N–CH2Cl2 mixed solvents (1/2, v/v) at room temperature in the presence of a catalytic amount of CuI led smoothly to P1 within 12 h. P1 was isolated as a purple powder after precipitation from the reaction mixture to methanol and purified by sequential Soxhlet extraction steps with methanol, acetone and chloroform. The molecular weight of P1 was estimated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC, Fig. S1†) against polystyrene standards to be 27300 (Mn) with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.1, corresponding to on average ca. 25 BODIPY or Pt units along the polymer main-chain.
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of monomers and polymer P1. 
The chemical structure of P1 was fully characterized by multi-nuclear NMR spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 1. The 1H NMR spectrum of P1 appears approximately as a superposition of spectra of M1 and Pt1, except that signals of the polymer are broader, less resolved and slightly up-field shifted. Complete disappearance of the acetylenic signals at 3.32 ppm, which are observed in the spectrum of M1, indicates successful polymerization. Integration of the P11H NMR spectrum leads to a 1/1 ratio between BODIPY and (nBu3P)2Pt units along the polymer main-chain, suggesting the absence of alkyne homo-coupling reactions during polymer formation. 11B NMR measurement of M1 gave a triplet at 0.2 ppm with a 1JB–F constant of ca. 32 Hz (Fig. 1A). Upon polymerization, the 11B signal for P1 becomes broad and slightly shifted to 0.4 ppm. Both chemical shifts are typical for tetra-coordinated boron species,12 suggesting a lack of unwanted side-reactions at these boron centers during polymerization. Similar trends are observed in the 19F NMR spectra (Fig. 1B). A quartet having a 1JF–B constant of ca. 31 Hz is observed at −144.57 ppm for M1, while the signal for P1 up-field shifts to −145.34 ppm and becomes unresolved. Furthermore, the 31P NMR spectrum of Pt1 has a pseudo triplet at 5.05 ppm with a large 1JP–Pt constant of ca. 2380 Hz, while the 31P signal for P1 is observed at 3.76 ppm with a similar 1JP–Pt constant of ca. 2366 Hz (Fig. 1C). These chemical shifts and coupling constants are consistent with reported values in the literature.11c,13

Inset: (A) 11B NMR (96.25 MHz, CDCl3) spectra of P1 and M1; (B) 19F NMR (282.4 MHz, CDCl3) spectra of P1 and M1; and (C) 31P NMR (121.5 MHz, CDCl3) spectra of P1 and Pt1. All scales are in ppm. 
Polymerization was also confirmed by IR measurements as shown in Fig. S2.† The sharp absorption peak at ca. 3275 cm−1 due to C–H symmetric stretching mode of terminal alkynes in M1 completely disappears in the spectrum of P1. The signal due to the carbon–carbon triple bond stretching mode in M1 is very weak and appears at 2103 cm−1. After polymerization, this signal in the spectrum of P1 is significantly enhanced and shifted to 2092 cm−1, presumably caused by the attachment of heavy Pt atoms. Thermal properties of P1 were assessed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and no apparent transitions could be observed in the temperature range from −50 °C to 250 °C, suggesting the amorphous nature of the polymer, which is consistent with other literature reports on conjugated polymers containing Pt-diacetylenide building blocks bearing nBu3P ligands.
3.2 Electronic properties
Absorption and emission spectra of M1 and P1 both in solutions and as thin films are shown in Fig. 2. M1 in dilute CHCl3 solution has an absorption maximum (λmax) at 545 nm and emission maximum (λem) at 560 nm when excited at λmax. A quantum efficiency of ca. 23% was estimated for M1. Sharp absorption and emission profiles, small Stoke's shift and high quantum efficiency of M1 are typical of BODIPY dyes.8 Upon polymerization, λmax and λem of P1 in dilute CHCl3 solution became broader and significantly red-shifted to 677 nm and 693 nm, respectively, due to elongated conjugation and delocalization along the polymer main-chain. λmax of P1 is also larger than those of similar bis-platinated BODIPY compounds bearing nBu3P ligands as reported by Zhao et al. (λmax = 643 nm and λem = 671 nm),10b indicating certain electron delocalization through the Pt-diacetylenide centers in P1. Resemblance of both absorption and emission spectra of P1 with those of M1, as well as the relatively small Stoke's shift (Δλ = 16 nm), suggests that electronic transitions in P1 are intra-ligand (IL) in nature. Fluorescence quantum yield of P1 is greatly suppressed to ca. 0.3%, possibly caused by enhanced inter-system crossing due to the presence of Pt centers. However, no room temperature phosphorescence could be observed in deaerated solutions, which can be explained by the low bandgap of P1 and the energy gap law,14 and is consistent with observations in the other Pt-containing low bandgap polymers reported in the literature.7a,b Only a slight red-shift in both absorption and emission spectra is observed in thin films of P1 (λmax = 685 nm and λem = 706 nm) with similar line-shapes to those of solution profiles, which is consistent with the amorphous nature of the polymer as suggested by DSC measurements. From the absorption edge, a bandgap of ca. 1.7 eV is estimated for P1. Cyclic voltammetry measurement on thin films of P1 revealed a non-reversible multi-step oxidation event and a very small non-reversible reduction peak (Fig. S3†), from the onset of which a HOMO energy level of ca. −5.3 eV and a LUMO energy level of ca. −3.5 eV are estimated. This leads to an electrochemical bandgap of ca. 1.8 eV for P1, slightly larger but consistent with the observed optical bandgap.

3.3 Solar cell performance
BHJ solar cells were initially fabricated employing P1 and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) using a conventional device geometry of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Al. Different weight ratios between P1 and PCBM were tested in order to optimize the device performance and the results are summarized in Table 1. The best device power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.21% was achieved using a P1/PCBM ratio of 1/3. A relatively low open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.57 V and a fill factor (FF) of 32% were recorded. We suspected that the anode interfacial layer, PEDOT:PSS, having a work function of ca. −5.0 eV (0.3 eV higher than the HOMO of P1)15 might not be optimal in terms of energy level alignment and Ohmic contact formation. We thus turned into thermally evaporated MoO3, which has been extensively studied as an anode interfacial layer in OPVs and work functions matching or below the HOMO of P1 have been reported.16 Indeed, by using 10 nm MoO3 as the anode interfacial layer, VOCs of all devices significantly increased. A very high VOC of 0.92 V is observed in the P1/PCBM (1/2) devices but the overall PCEs are limited by low short circuit current (JSC) and FF. The best performances were observed in devices employing P1/PCBM at 1/3 weight ratio, giving a high VOC of 0.86 V and an average PCE of 0.91% (Fig. S4†). The VOC enhancement of ca. 0.3 V correlates well with the difference between the work function of PEDOT:PSS and HOMO of P1, suggesting an Ohmic contact formation using MoO3. PCEs are still limited by the relatively small JSC (2.2 mA cm−2) and FF (48%). Some possible reasons are an unfavourable morphology and poor charge transport due to the polymer's amorphous nature. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of active layers from the best performing devices using PEDOT:PSS (Fig. S5†) show no discernible phase separation. Furthermore, thermal annealing seemed to have no significant, sometimes negative, effects on device performance, presumably due to high polymer fullerene miscibility and low polymer crystallinity. The large, cone-shaped nBu3P ligands can effectively prevent polymer chain close-packing and are thus most likely responsible for the polymer's amorphous nature. By using planar ligands that are still capable of forming stable complexes with Pt-diacetylenides, more crystalline polymers and better performing devices are expected. Another possibility to account for the low PCEs is non-optimal energy level alignment between donor triplet states and acceptor molecules and unfavourable charge transfer dynamics. Detailed photophysical studies on P1 at ambient and cryogenic conditions, as well as investigations on charge generation/separation phenomena at the organic/organic interfaces, are currently underway.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully prepared a novel BODIPY and platinum containing conjugated polymer, P1, possessing low bandgaps. OPV devices employing P1 and PCBM were fabricated and evaluated. Commonly applied anode interfacial layer PEDOT:PSS was found to be non-optimal due to the deep lying HOMO level of P1 at −5.3 eV, while thermally evaporated MoO3 formed ohmic contact and high VOCs were obtained. Detailed studies on photophysical properties of the polymer and charge generation mechanisms in polymer/fullerene blends are currently being carried out. Replacing nBu3P ligands on Pt centers with less sterically demanding ones is expected to increase crystallinity of these platinum-containing polymers in order to improve device performances.
