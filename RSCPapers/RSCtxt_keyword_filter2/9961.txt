    , Accepted 7th September 2012First published on 10th September 2012AbstractA solution-processed vanadium oxide (s-VOx) anode buffer layer on an indium-tin-oxide (ITO) electrode was used instead of PEDOT:PSS for improving the stability and photovoltaic performance of the polymer solar cells (PSCs). The s-VOx layer was prepared by spin-coating a vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) isopropyl alcohol solution on the ITO electrode and then thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min. The s-VOx oxide layer is highly transparent in the visible range and shows effective hole collection property. The photovoltaic performance of the s-VOx buffer layer was studied by fabricating the PSCs based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as an electron donor and four soluble fullerene derivatives, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM), [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM), indene-C60 bisadduct (IC60BA), and indene-C70 bisadduct (IC70BA), as electron acceptors. The PSCs with the s-VOx buffer layer show improved performance in comparison with the traditional devices with the PEDOT:PSS buffer layer on ITO, no matter which fullerene derivative was used as an acceptor. The power conversion efficiency of the PSC based on P3HT:IC70BA (1:1, w/w) with the s-VOx anode buffer layer reached 6.35% under the illumination of AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction structures present the most promising architecture in polymer solar cells (PSCs) because excitons photo-generated in conjugated polymers and fullerenes can efficiently dissociate at the donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces throughout the bulk heterojunction, yielding high short circuit current and overall power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–3 However, the interpenetrating network of the donor and acceptor phases may result in both entities being in simultaneous contact with hole-collecting and electron-collecting electrodes.4–14 Charge recombination can take place at the contacts, resulting in a reduced open circuit voltage (Voc) and a significant loss of PCE.8–14
To minimize contact localized recombination, charge selective interfacial buffer layers are added between both hole- and electron-collecting electrodes and the photoactive layer, which result in an improved current–voltage rectification and a balanced rate of hole and electron collection.4–7 Recent studies on organic photovoltaic materials and devices have confirmed that interfacial materials can establish both thermodynamic and kinetic constraints on charge collection.8–14
In selection of the buffer layer materials, wettability and compatibility of the contact with organic active layers, and energy barriers for the charge collection should be considered. The most popular anode buffer layer is PEDOT:PSS. But there is some stability problem with PEDOT:PSS, since PEDOT:PSS is acidic which is corrosive to an ITO electrode. And PEDOT:PSS could also cause the problems of interfacial instability in the presence of humidity.4 Therefore, other anode modification layers were developed instead of PEDOT:PSS.5–7 And recently transition metal oxides, especially vanadium oxides, have been introduced as the hole-selective interfacial materials.15–25 Vacuum thermally deposited V2O5 has been utilized in traditional15 and inverted16–19 PSCs to enhance hole selectivity and prevent the recombination of the charge carriers at the active layer/electrode interface, leading to an increased photovoltaic performance. However, a vacuum evaporation technique could detract from the advantages of the ease of PSC fabrication. There is a report on solution-processed V2O5 for a PSC anode interfacial layer by using V2O5 powder suspended in isopropanol with ultrasonic agitation.20 Unfortunately, the obtained V2O5 films show small islands instead of uniform film, which made it less effective in comparison with the vacuum deposited V2O5 used in the inverted PSCs.22 Very recently, solution-processed V2O5 from precursor vanadium-oxitriisopropoxide have been reported as hole extraction buffer layers in conventional21 and inverted22–25 PSCs. However, the precursor needs water or exposure for a long time (1 hour) in an ambient atmosphere for hydrolysis. Except for the vanadium-oxitriisopropoxide, there is no report on the solution processed vanadium oxides for PSC application. Therefore, high efficiency solution-processed high-work-function buffer layer on the ITO electrode still needs to be developed for high performance and stable PSCs.
Here, we prepared the vanadium oxide buffer layer from a vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) isopropyl alcohol solution by spin-coating on the ITO electrode and then thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min. The solution-processed vanadium oxide (hereafter named s-VOx) layer is highly transparent in the visible range and shows effective hole collection property. The s-VOx anode buffer layer demonstrated improved photovoltaic performance than the traditional PEDOT:PSS anode buffer layer. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSC based on P3HT:IC70BA (1:1, w/w) with the s-VOx anode buffer layer reached 6.35% under the illumination of AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2, which is among the best values in the P3HT-based PSCs.
2. Experimental aspects
2.1. Materials
A patterned ITO glass with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω sq−1 was purchased from CSG HOLDING Co., LTD (China). Vanadyl acetylacetonate was purchased from Alfa Aeser. P3HT was purchased from Rieke Metals. PC60BM and PC70BM were purchased from Nano-C. IC60BA26 and IC70BA27 were synthesized according to literatures. PEDOT:PSS (Clevious P VP AI 4083) was purchased from H. C. Stark company. All these commercial available materials were used as received without further purification.
2.2. Instrumentation
The transmittance spectra of ITO, ITO–PEDOT:PSS and ITO–s-VOx were measured using a Hitachi U-3010 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The PEDOT:PSS film was prepared by spin-coating (2000 rpm) PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution on the pre-cleaned ITO glass. XPS data were obtained using an ESCA Lab220i-XL electron spectrometer from VG Scientific using 300 W Al Kα radiation. The base pressure was about 3 × 10−9 mbar. The binding energies were referenced to the C1s line at 284.8 eV from adventitious carbon. XRD patterns were obtained using a Siemens D5005 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 20 mA.
2.3. Device fabrication
Eight types (Devices A–H) of PSCs are designed. The device structure is: (A) ITO–P3HT:PC60BM–Ca–Al, (B) ITO–PEDOT:PSS–P3HT:PC60BM–Ca–Al, (C) ITO–s-VOx–P3HT:PC60BM–Ca–Al, (D) ITO–s-VOx–P3HT:PC70BM–Ca–Al, (E) ITO–P3HT:IC60BA–Ca–Al, (F) ITO–PEDOT:PSS–P3HT:IC60BA–Ca–Al, (G) ITO–s-VOx–P3HT:IC60BA–Ca–Al, and (H) ITO–s-VOx–P3HT:IC70BA–Ca–Al. The ITO glass was cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. The pre-cleaned ITO substrate was treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Ultraviolet Ozone Cleaner, Jelight Company, USA) for 20 min. PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter and spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 60 s on the ITO electrode. Subsequently, the PEDOT:PSS film was baked at 150 °C for 10 min in air. The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS was around 30 nm. The s-VOx film was prepared by spin-coating (4000 rpm) vanadyl acetylacetonate isopropanol solution (1.5 mg mL−1) on the pre-cleaned ITO glass, and then baked in air at 150 °C for 10 min to complete the transformation into s-VOx. Subsequently, the substrate was transferred to the nitrogen-filled glove-box and the photosensitive blend layer was prepared by spin coating (800 rpm) the 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution of P3HT and fullerene derivatives (PC60BM, PC70BM, IC60BA, or IC70BA) (1:1 w/w, a polymer concentration of 20 mg mL−1) on the modified ITO electrode for 30 s then dried in covered glass petri dishes for slow growth of the active layer. The thickness of the active layer was around 240 nm. Finally, the substrate was transferred to a vacuum chamber and a 10 nm of Ca and 100 nm of Al was thermally deposited on the photo active layer under a base pressure of 5 × 10−5 Pa. The active area of the device is ca. 4 mm2.
2.4. Device characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) measurement of the devices was conducted on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit (SMU). Device characterization was done in a glove-box under simulated AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (from Newport Co., LTD). The IPCE was measured using a Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and a 500 W xenon lamp. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell. All the measurements were performed under an ambient atmosphere at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Chemical components of s-VOx
The chemical change of VO(acac)2 films before and after thermal annealing was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, as shown in Fig. 1. For the as-prepared VO(acac)2 (see Fig. 1(a)), the characteristic peak of the stretching vibrations of the VO, the vanadyl bond is observed at 997 cm−1. The broad band at around 3387 and 1112 cm−1 as well as a strong peak at 797 cm−1 attribute to C–H vibration. The IR peaks at 2927, 1420, and 1020 cm−1 attribute to the vibration of –CH3 in acetylacetonate rings. The strong peaks at 1562 and 1375 cm−1 are assigned as stretching vibrations of delocalized CO in acetylacetonate rings, The strong absorptions at 1526 and 1287 cm−1 are the stretching vibration of delocalized C–CC in acetylacetonate rings. The IR peaks at 939 and 425 cm−1 are the characteristic vibrations of C–CH3. The peaks at 686, 657 and 608 cm−1 attribute to the deformation vibration of acetylacetonate rings. The peaks at 560, 486, and 463 cm−1 are assigned as the stretching vibration of the VO4 group. The IR spectra of VO(acac)2 observed in our study are in good agreement with that reported in literatures.28–30 Compared with the as-prepared sample, after annealing at 90 °C for 10 min, all the characteristic peaks of the VO(acac)2 sample concerning the acetylacetonate ring and the VO group keep unchanged (see Fig. 1(b)), indicating there is no decomposition of the VO(acac)2 sample. However, the IR peaks of the sample after annealing at 150 °C for 10 min (Fig. 1(c)) are dramatically different from that of the as-prepared sample (Fig. 1(a)), although there still remain IR absorptions at 1700–1200 cm−1 due to residual segments from decomposition and a fraction of undecomposed precursor. The characteristic peaks of C–CH3 (939 and 425 cm−1) and acetylacetonate rings (686, 657 and 608 cm−1) become very weak and nearly invisible, indicating the decomposition of VO(acac)2 into vanadium oxide as shown in Scheme 1.

 Scheme 1  Decomposition of VO(acac)2 in air by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min. 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a powerful tool for analyzing and investigating the structure and components of a thin film. XPS studies of the s-VOx layer provide a rough estimate of the concentration of residual carbon on the order of 12 at% originating from segments from decomposition and a fraction of undecomposed precursor. This result is in agreement with evidence observed in FTIR as shown in Fig. 1(c). Fig. 2 displays the O 1s, V 2p1/2 and V 2p3/2 lines of the VO(acac)2 sample after thermal annealing in air at 150 °C for 10 min. The V 2p3/2 spectrum can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 516.9 and 517.9 eV for +4 and +5 oxidation states, respectively. Our observation agrees with previously reported binding energies of 516.5–517.1 eV for V+4 and 517.5–518.2 eV for V+5 oxidation states.31,32 The XPS O 1s spectrum was analyzed in two components. The first component with a binding energy of 532.8 eV is assigned to the oxygen atoms in acetylacetonate rings of the undecomposed precursor.33 The second component observed at 531.0 eV can be assigned to O atoms in VOx structures.31,32,34 The energy difference between the O 1s and V 2p3/2 lines can be used as a measure for an (effective) “average oxidation state” Veffox.35 For well-defined VOx samples, a linear relation Veffox = 13.82–0.68 [Eb(O 1s)–Eb(V 2p3/2)] has been reported,32,35 which would yield a value of Veffox ≈ 4.8 for our sample, where Eb (O 1s) and Eb (V 2p3/2) is 531.0 and 517.8 eV, respectively.

3.2. Transmittance, crystallization, and hole mobility of s-VOx
The obtained s-VOx layer is highly transparent in the visible range as shown in Fig. 3(a), especially in the wavelength above 500 nm, where the transmittance of s-VOx is little higher than that of the PEDOT:PSS layer, and this will benefit light harvesting in the longer wavelength region. The s-VOx layer has an amorphous structure as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (see Fig. 3(b)). In spite of the amorphous nature of the s-VOx layer, the hole transportation property is excellent. The hole mobility of the s-VOx film, measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method,36 reached ca. 6.9 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 3(b) inset). We can expect that the high hole mobility of the s-VOx buffer layer will benefit charge transportation and increase Jsc in the PSCs.

The solid line is the fit to the experimental points. 
3.3. Structure design of the PSCs
The sandwiched structure of ITO–s-VOx–P3HT:fullerene–Ca–Al is employed in the fabrication of the PSCs, with ITO as a positive electrode, s-VOx as an interfacial buffer layer, P3HT:fullerene blends as photoactive layers, and Ca–Al as a negative electrode. To investigate the general suitability of the s-VOx buffer layer in the PSCs, we selected four soluble fullerene derivatives, PC60BM, PC70BM, IC60BA, and IC70BA as electron acceptors. The device structure of PSC is given in Fig. 4(a), and the molecular structures of P3HT, fullerene derivatives, and VO(acac)2 precursor are shown in Fig. 4(b).

Energy levels of the materials involved in the PSCs are given in Fig. 4(c). The electronic energy levels of VOx,23 P3HT,37 PC60BM,26 PC70BM,27 IC60BA26 and IC70BA27 were taken from the literatures. When light irradiates on the photoactive layer of the PSCs through the ITO glass, the photoactive layer will absorb photons to produce excitons, and the excitons will diffuse towards and dissociate at the P3HT–fullerene interface into electrons in the LUMO (the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of the acceptor and holes in the HOMO (the highest occupied molecular orbital) of the donor P3HT. Since the work function of s-VOx (−5.10 eV) is only 0.34 eV lower than the HOMO of P3HT, holes can easily transfer from the P3HT HOMO level to the s-VOx, and then to the ITO electrode.23,38,39 Thus, from the viewpoint of energy levels, the device could show high charge collection efficiencies.23,38,39
3.4. Morphology of the thin films
The tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) image at the 5 μm × 5 μm scan size of the bare ITO is illustrated in Fig. 5(a). The root mean square (rms) roughness of the ITO surface is 4.8 nm. After modified with the s-VOx layer as shown in Fig. 5(b), the surface becomes more flat and the rms roughness is decreased to 2.4 nm, which is comparable with that (1.8 nm) of the PEDOT:PSS modified ITO substrate. Fig. 5(c) shows the AFM height image of the surface of the P3HT:PC60BM active layer on the s-VOx modified ITO substrate with an rms roughness of 12.8 nm. While the rms roughness of the P3HT:IC60BA active layer on the s-VOx modified ITO substrate is only 9.9 nm (shown in Fig. 5(e)). It can be seen that the photoactive layer (P3HT:PC60BM or P3HT:IC60BA) has much larger roughness than that of the substrate, regardless the substrate was modified with s-VOx or not. The increase in roughness is attributed to P3HT self-organization and phase separation of the blend as shown in Fig. 5(d) and (f). P3HT chains self-organizing into ordered structure can significantly enhance the hole mobility. Meanwhile, the aggregation of fullerene molecules can form separate paths for electron transport.40 The nanoscale phase separation can finally result in the enhancement of Jsc of the PSCs.40

3.5. The effect of the s-VOx buffer layer on the performance of the PSCs
To investigate the effect of the s-VOx buffer layer on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, we select four soluble fullerene derivatives and construct eight types of devices structures: (A) ITO–P3HT:PC60BM–Ca–Al, (B) ITO–PEDOT:PSS–P3HT:PC60BM–Ca–Al, (C) ITO–s-VOx–P3HT:PC60BM–Ca–Al, (D) ITO–s-VOx–P3HT:PC70BM–Ca–Al, (E) ITO–P3HT:IC60BA–Ca–Al, (F) ITO–PEDOT:PSS–P3HT:IC60BA–Ca–Al, (G) ITO–s-VOx–P3HT:IC60BA–Ca–Al and (H) ITO–s-VOx–P3HT:IC70BA–Ca–Al. Devices A and E are control samples without an interfacial buffer layer, Devices B and F are control samples with the PEDOT:PSS interfacial buffer layer.

Fig. 6(a) shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices in the dark, and the rectification ratio of the devices was calculated based on the J–V curves at ±1.0 V. For Devices A and E without a buffer layer, the rectification ratio is 1.9 × 102 and 2.6 × 102, respectively. While that of Devices C and G with the s-VOx buffer layer reached 1.5 × 104 and 1.0 × 104, respectively, two orders higher than that of the devices without the buffer layer. These values are also higher than that of Devices B and F with the PEDOT:PSS buffer layer (7.9 × 103 and 5.6 × 103 for Device B and Device F, respectively). The higher rectification ratio of the s-VOx modified devices could result from the higher injection current at the positive voltage and lower leakage current at the negative voltage.3,38,41

J–V curves of Devices A–H under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 6(b) and the device performance parameters (average of 16 devices) are summarized in Table 1. Device A without the buffer layer shows a PCE of 2.16% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 9.48 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.40 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 56.9%. In contrast, the four parameters, Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE, of Device C with the s-VOx buffer layer are all increased to 0.58 V, 11.42 mA cm−2, 66.9%, and 4.42% (PCE is double of Device A), respectively. In comparison with the PEDOT:PSS modified Device B, the Voc is just changed little, while the Jsc and the FF are all increased, resulting in an increased overall PCE by 17.5%. This trend is also seen in the Device D based on P3HT:PC70BM with the s-VOx buffer layer. The four parameters of Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE for Device D reach 0.59 V, 11.77 mA cm−2, 66.9%, and 4.55%, respectively.

As for the PSCs with IC60BA or IC70BA as an acceptor. Device E without the buffer layer shows a PCE of 4.41%, a Jsc of 9.66 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.84 V, and an FF of 55.4%. As expected, Device G and Device H with the s-VOx buffer layer show dramatically enhanced performance. The Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE for Device G are 0.85 V, 10.23 mA cm−2, 71.3%, and 6.20%, respectively, and that for Device H are 0.85 V, 10.62 mA cm−2, 70.3%, and 6.35%, respectively. These values are among the best in the P3HT-based PSCs. In comparison with Device F with the PEDOT:PSS buffer layer (the Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE is 0.85 V, 9.52 mA cm−2, 74.9%, and 6.06%, respectively), the Voc is unchanged and the FF just change little, while the Jsc increases significantly and the overall PCE is improved. The increased Jsc of the s-VOx modified devices could be ascribed to the improved hole mobility of s-VOx (Fig. 3(b) inset) and enhanced charge collection at the s-VOx/P3HT interface since the photo-generated holes can tunnel from P3HT to s-VOx through a reduced energy barrier (Fig. 4(c)).23,38,39 The increased FF of the s-VOx and PEDOT:PSS modified devices could result from the greatly decrease in series resistance (Rs) and the increase in parallel resistance (Rp) as shown in Table 1.
We compared the incident photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices A–H in Fig. 6(c). It should be pointed out that the higher IPCE of the C70 derivatives (PC70BM and IC70BA)-based devices at longer wavelength (650–750 nm) should result from the stronger absorption of C70 derivatives than C60 derivatives at the longer wavelength.27 The IPCE results agree well with the Jsc of the PSCs mentioned above. The higher IPCE of the devices with the s-VOx buffer layer could also be ascribed to the enhanced transmittance of the ITO–s-VO3 (as shown in Fig. 3(a)) and the suitable aggregated morphology of the active layer as shown in Fig. 5.
4. Conclusions
We demonstrate efficient polymer solar cells using solution-processed vanadium oxide (s-VOx) as an anode interfacial buffer layer. The s-VOx layer was obtained by spin-coating vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) isopropyl alcohol solution on an ITO electrode and then thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min. The FTIR and XPS study indicate that the precursor vanadyl acetylacetonate transformed into vanadium oxide by annealing at 150 °C for 10 min in air. The s-VOx layer shows high hole mobility and high light transmittance. The PSCs based on P3HT as a donor with the s-VOx anode buffer layer show enhanced performance in comparison with the PEDOT:PSS modified devices no matter which fullerene derivative is used as an acceptor. The PCE of the PSC based on P3HT:IC70BA with the s-VOx anode buffer layer reached 6.35% under the illumination of AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2, which is among the best values in the P3HT-based PSCs. In addition, the s-VOx buffer layer is easy to be prepared and suitable for the application in flexible devices benefited from the low thermal annealing temperature (150 °C). This work gives a new option for the selection of a solution-processed anode buffer layer in designing higher efficiency and more stable PSCs.
