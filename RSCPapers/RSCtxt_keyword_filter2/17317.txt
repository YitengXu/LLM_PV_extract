    , Accepted 11th January 2016First published on 11th January 2016AbstractWe have designed and synthesized a series of simple cost-effective ‘push–pull’ Zn(II) porphyrin dyes containing various electron donors such as 2-thienyl, pyrenyl, phenyl, 4′-bromophenyl, 4′-tbutylphenyl and 4′-carboxyphenyl acceptor moieties in three steps. Their optical absorption spectra, electrochemical redox and photovoltaic properties have been investigated in detail. The overall power conversion efficiencies (η) of DSSCs based on these dyes are in the range of 2.1 to 4.2% and highly depend on their donor moiety. The incorporation of trans-10,20-dimesityl groups is highly beneficial for preventing the π–π aggregation among the porphyrin moieties, thus favorably suppressing the charge recombination and intermolecular interaction. Among all, pyrenyl appended Zn(II) porphyrin has exhibited a higher power conversion efficiency of 4.2% under 1 sun illumination due to the extended π-conjugation and electron donating ability of the pyrenyl moiety.
Introduction
Development of a sustainable society and growing global energy consumption demand clean and renewable energy resources. Several environmental issues have been aroused by the consumption of a large amount of fossil fuel in recent years. Artificial photosynthesis and photovoltaics technologies are desirable to harvest substantially inexhaustible solar energy. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC)1 is one of the promising alternatives to conventional photovoltaic devices based on silicon which can convert sunlight efficiently to electricity owing to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE), ease of fabrication and potential low cost compared with traditional silicon-based solar cells. In this respect for the past two decades, polypyridyl ruthenium complexes1c,2 have been utilized to achieve an electric power conversion efficiency of up to 11% due to their broad absorption spectrum through metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT), the longer exciton lifetime, and their long-term chemical stability.3 Despite their overwhelming performance, Ru–polypyridyl sensitizers encounter several drawbacks2a–c such as the high cost of noble metal ruthenium, the requirement for careful synthesis, hefty purification steps, toxicity to the environment and low molar extinction coefficients in the red region of the visible spectrum which hamper their large-scale application in DSSCs.
Organic dyes4 such as coumarin, indoline, oligoene, thiophene, triarylamine, perylene, cyanine, fluorine, merocyanine and hemicyanine derivatives are of great interest owing to their modest cost, ease of synthesis, structural modification, large molar absorption coefficients, and satisfactory stability.5 Some organic dyes with the conversion efficiencies in a range of 5–9% have been prepared.4 Recently, carboxy anchoring dye, LEG4 collaboratively working with alkoxysilylether dye, ADEKA1, exhibited 14.3% power conversion efficiency (PCE) under one sun illumination.4t However, porphyrins and phthalocyanines are the best dyes due to their high thermal and photochemical stability, strong absorption in the visible region as well as their intriguing optical, photophysical and electrochemical properties can be tuned by peripheral substitutions.6,7 The most efficient porphyrin sensitizers feature ‘push–pull Donor–π–Acceptor (D–π–A)’ structures and/or π-extensions that made porphyrins panchromatic in visible and even near infrared regions.7 Consequently, porphyrin sensitizers have exhibited power conversion efficiencies that are comparable to or even higher than those of well-established highly efficient DSSCs based on ruthenium complexes. For example, a remarkable power conversion efficiency (η) of 12.3%, was achieved by the Zn(II) porphyrin sensitizer (YD2-o-C8) co-sensitized with an organic dye (YD123) using a cobalt-based electrolyte which is superior to that based on Ru complexes.8
Recently, a class of ‘push–pull’ porphyrins with an electron-donating diarylamino group and an electron-withdrawing carboxyphenylethynyl anchoring group, GY50 and SM315, have revealed remarkable high efficiencies of 12% and 13% with the cobalt electrolyte under standard one sun illumination.9 However, synthesis of these bridged conjugated ‘push–pull’ porphyrin sensitizers involves multistep synthesis involving expensive metal (Pd)-catalyzed C–C and C–N coupling reactions under stringent reaction conditions leading to the overall low yield of the final product. All these aspects demand a simple and efficient synthetic methodology to address the practical future applications of porphyrin-based DSSCs. He and co-workers reported a power conversion efficiency of 5.1% using a simple architecture having trans-mesityl groups and meso-acrylic acid substituted zinc porphyrin sensitizers.10 However, the synthesis of meso-bromosubstituted porphyrin followed by Pd[0]-catalyzed Heck coupling to introduce the acrylic acid anchoring group involves multistep synthesis in an inert and dry environment leading to high cost DSSCs. These findings encourage us to develop simple, efficient sensitizers involving fewer synthetic steps.
Herein, we report five simple trans-mesityl A2BC porphyrin Zn(II) complexes having different donor groups and carboxylate as the anchoring group (Chart 1). A benzene ring between carboxylic acid and the porphyrin ring functions as a spacer. To prevent dye aggregation, usually alkyl and alkoxy chains have been introduced on the meso-phenyl rings of porphyrinic sensitizers leading to high cell performance.11 Bulky trans-meso-dimesityl groups are introduced to provide the oxidative stability12 to porphyrins and to suppress the self-quenching by dye aggregation between the neighboring molecules adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface by the steric hindrance around the porphyrin core and also provides an effective shielding to electron recombination with the electrolyte.10 This leads to an increase of electron injection efficiency (φinj). The overall power conversion efficiencies (η) of DSSCs based on these dyes are in the range of 2.1 to 4.2% and highly depend upon their donor moiety. Among all, pyrenyl appended Zn(II) porphyrin has exhibited a higher power conversion efficiency of 4.3% under 1 sun illumination which is attributed to strong π-conjugated character of pyrene13 that interacts with porphyrin effectively.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization

Trans-A2BC-esterporphyrins (1a–1e) were synthesized via modified MacDonald [2+2] condensation between 5-mesityl dipyrromethane and two different types of aromatic aldehydes viz. aryl aldehyde (B) having different donor groups (R–CHO) and 4-carbomethoxybenzaldehyde (C) to afford monoester porphyrins in good yields. Then monoester porphyrins (1a–1e) were subjected to base hydrolysis to afford the corresponding carboxyporphyrins (2a–2e) (Scheme 1) in quantitative yields. The subsequent metallation using Zn(OAc)2·2H2O yielded the target porphyrinic dyes RA-191-Zn, RA-192-Zn, RA-193-Zn, RA-194-Zn and RA-195-Zn in 90–92% yield. Detailed synthetic procedures are given in the experimental section. All the intermediates and final Zn(II) porphyrin dyes were characterized by UV-Vis, fluorescence and 1H NMR spectroscopic techniques (Fig. S1–S10 in the ESI†) and mass spectrometry (Fig. S11–S24, ESI†). Furthermore, the electronic, photophysical, structural properties and computational studies of these dyes were investigated by optical absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, density functional theory (DFT), cyclic voltammetry and photocurrent–voltage measurements.

Optical absorption and emission spectral properties
The UV-Vis spectra of the synthesized Zn(II) porphyrin dyes were recorded in distilled CH2Cl2 at 298 K and the absorption data are listed in Table 1. Representative absorption spectra of dyes RA-191-Zn and RA-195-Zn are shown in Fig. 1. All these synthesized dyes exhibited an intense Soret band in the range of 400–450 nm and moderate absorbing two Q bands in the range of 525–625 nm, which are attributed to the π–π* electronic transitions. Dyes containing 2-thienyl and pyrenyl as donor groups (RA-Zn-193 and RA-Zn-195) showed a marginal red shift (3–4 nm) in Soret and Q bands compared to those of RA-191-Zn, RA-192-Zn and RA-194-Zn.

 Fig. 1  Electronic absorption spectra of dyes RA-191-Zn (9 μM) and RA-195-Zn (9 μM) in CH2Cl2 at 298 K. 
The synthesized dyes were also characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy to elucidate the role of different donor groups. Fig. 2 represents the steady state emission spectra of Zn(II) porphyrin dyes in CH2Cl2 at 298 K and the emission data are listed in Table 1. No significant shifts in emission bands were observed for these dyes except RA-193-Zn which exhibited a red shift of 4 nm in emission bands compared to RA-191-Zn. However, the fluorescence quenching was observed for RA-192-Zn which leads to the decrement in the quantum yield due to the heavy atom effect of the bromo group.

The UV-Vis absorption spectra of porphyrin RA-191-Zn to RA-195-Zn adsorbed on TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 3. All of these porphyrins show broadened and red shifted Soret and Q bands after adsorption on TiO2 films as compared to corresponding absorption spectra in solution. The observed red shifted bands provide an indication of J-type aggregation of the porphyrinic dyes onto the TiO2 surface.14a Notably, these dyes after adsorption onto the TiO2 film exhibit stronger absorption in the Q band region, indicating strong electronic coupling between the porphyrin ring and the TiO2 conduction band and alteration of porphyrin geometry14b as well as an enhanced light harvesting capacity of the low energy photons, which are highly desirable for efficient sensitizers in DSSCs. Among all, RA-195-Zn exhibited broader absorption spectral features possibly due to the extended π-conjugation which leads to higher light harvesting capacity.

Cyclic voltammetric (CV) studies
The electrochemical properties of these Zn(II) porphyrinic dyes (RA-191-Zn-to-RA-195-Zn) were investigated by cyclic voltammetric studies in CH2Cl2 containing 0.1 M TBAPF6 with a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1 at 298 K as shown in Fig. 4 and the data are listed in Table 2. The reduction potentials of these Zn(II) dyes are 20–80 mV cathodically shifted indicating the influence of electron donor moieties as compared to ZnTPP where oxidation potentials are anodically shifted (10–40 mV). Among all, tert-butylphenyl and pyrenyl appended porphyrins showed a larger cathodic shift of 50–80 mV in their reduction potentials indicating their effective donor ability. Among all, pyrenyl appended porphyrin (RA-195-Zn) showed a cathodic shift of 40 mV indicating the possibility of extended conjugation from the pyrenyl moiety to the porphyrin π-system.6a,bFig. 5 depicts the HOMO–LUMO energy levels of Zn(II) porphyrin dyes and compared with the conduction band of TiO2 and the electrolyte which clearly indicate the feasibility of electron transfer (down-hill process).

Photovoltaic studies
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were prepared using trans-A2BC Zn(II)-porphyrin-dyed 12 μm thick TiO2 photoanodes (0.16 cm2) assembled into standard sealed sandwiched cells with the Pt sheet counter electrode, and the iodide/triiodide electrolyte was introduced into the space between the photoanodes. Fig. 6 shows the typical I–V characteristics of the dye-sensitized solar cells using various Zn(II) porphyrin dyes using the iodide/triiodide electrolyte. Table 3 lists the photovoltaic parameters of Zn(II) dyes under AM 1.5G solar light illumination (power 100 mW cm−2) with an active area of 0.16 cm2. We have obtained the photon-to-current efficiency (PCE) in the range of 2.1 to 4.2%. Among all, the best performance was obtained with RA-195-Zn after soaking for 20 hours. RA-195-Zn exhibited Voc, Jsc and fill factor values of 560 mV, 10.8 mA cm−2 and 0.70, respectively, with the PCE value of (η) 4.23% at AM 1.5G full sunlight illumination. Similar open circuit voltage (Voc) was observed for these dyes, as expected since they have a similar electronic configuration whereas a much higher short circuit current density (Jsc) was observed for RA-195-Zn due to the extended π-conjugation between pyrene and Zn(II) porphyrin.6a,b The power conversion efficiency (η) of these dyes follows the order:phenyl (η = 2.11%) < 4′-tert-butylphenyl (η = 2.19%) < 4′-bromophenyl (η = 3.07%) < 2′-thienyl (η = 3.13%) < pyrenyl (η = 4.23%)The variation in η values clearly indicates the effect of extended π-conjugation and donor ability of R groups appended on the porphyrin π-skeleton. Furthermore, we are trying to probe for the possibility of enhanced charge separation and broad absorption of pyrenyl dye (RA-195-Zn) on the TiO2 surface. The attempts to improve the efficiencies of these dyes by appending various efficient electron donors are in progress.

 Fig. 6  The typical I–V characteristics of the DSSCs using various Zn(II) porphyrin dyes. 
The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured using a Newport IPCE system. The IPCE was performed as a function of incident wavelength to evaluate the photovoltaic performance. The IPCE spectra of fabricated solar cells are shown in Fig. 7 which resemble the absorption spectra of the Zn(II) porphyrins adsorbed on TiO2 films (Fig. 3), exhibiting characteristic peaks of moderate intensity in the 400–470 and 500–650 nm regions. The IPCE values are listed in Table 3. Among all, the solar cell RA-195-Zn exhibited good IPCE response (52%) in Q band region which is consistent with a higher Jsc value (Table 3) as compared to other dyes. RA-192-Zn and RA-193-Zn possess moderate while RA-191-Zn and RA-194-Zn exhibit lower IPCE values at the Soret and Q absorption bands which is consistent with the trends of the corresponding Soret and Q absorption bands. The I–V curves under standard AM 1.5G illumination are in qualitative agreement with the photo-action spectra of these porphyrin dyes. Notably, RA-195-Zn exhibited a high plateau in Soret and Q band regions as compared to other dyes which are responsible for the highest current density of RA-195-Zn. This observation may be ascribed to the enhanced conjugation by the pyrene moiety to the porphyrin π-system which obviously led to red-shift and broadened absorption bands and thus enhanced the current density.

DFT studies
We have optimized the geometries of synthesized Zn(II) porphyrin dyes using the B3LYP functional and the LanL2DZ basis set. All these porphyrins are exhibiting a planar confirmation of the porphyrin core. The meso-substituents (mesityl, different donor moieties and carboxyphenyl) are nearly perpendicular to the porphyrin plane. Fig. S25 and S26 in the ESI† depict the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of synthesized Zn(II) porphyrin dyes having various donor moieties. In general, these porphyrins show typical TPP (having acceptor groups) type molecular orbitals a1u, a2u and eg, i.e. the HOMO is a2u, HOMO−1 is a1u, and LUMO and LUMO+1 are eg orbitals, respectively (Fig. S25 and S26, ESI†). Furthermore, LUMO+2 represents the acceptor carboxy phenyl moiety. This study clearly indicates that there could be the possibility of charge transfer from the HOMO (porphyrin core) to LUMO+2 (carboxyphenyl moiety).
Conclusions
We have designed and synthesized a new series of trans-A2BC porphyrins having various donor groups in three steps with good yields. These porphyrins were characterized by UV-Visible, fluorescence and 1H NMR spectroscopic techniques and mass spectrometry. CV studies revealed the cathodic shift in reduction potentials as compared to ZnTPP indicating electron donation from R groups. These dyes exhibited the power conversion efficiency from 2.1 to 4.2% which depend upon the electron donating ability of the R group. Among all, pyrenyl appended porphyrin (RA-195-Zn) exhibited 4.2% power conversion efficiency possibly due to the extended π-conjugation. The systematic studies to support extended π-conjugation between the porphyrin π-system and the pyrenyl moiety are in progress. The attempts to improve the efficiencies of these dyes by appending various efficient electron donors are in progress.
Experimental section
Chemicals and materials
All aromatic aldehydes employed in the present work were purchased from Alfa Aesar, India and used as received. Silica gel (100–200 meshes) used for column chromatography was purchased from Rankem, India and used as received. TBAPF6 used in cyclic voltammetric studies was obtained from Alfa Aesar, India and recrystallized twice from ethanol followed by drying under vacuum at 60 °C for 10 h.
Instrumentation and methods
UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured in distilled CH2Cl2 using an Agilent Cary 100 spectrophotometer with a pair of quartz cells of 10 mm path length and the fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a Hitachi F-4600 spectrofluorometer using a quartz cell of 10 mm path length. Elemental analysis was carried out using an ElementarVario EL II instrument. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AVANCE 500 MHz and JEOL ECX 400 MHz spectrometers using CDCl3 as a solvent containing 0.03% TMS (v/v). MALDI-TOF-MS spectra were measured using a Bruker UltrafleXtreme-TN MALDI-TOF/TOF spectrometer using HABA as a matrix and the ESI mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker Daltanics microTOF mass spectrometer in positive ion mode using acetonitrile as the solvent. DFT studies were carried out using the B3LYP functional with the LANLD2Z basis set using Gaussian 03 software package. Cyclic voltammetric measurements were carried out using a CHI 620E instrument in triple distilled CH2Cl2 containing 0.1 M TBAPF6 as a supporting electrolyte under an argon atmosphere. A three electrode assembly was used consisting of a Pt disk working electrode, Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode and a Pt-wire as a counter electrode. UV-Vis absorption spectra of Zn(II) porphyrins on TiO2 films were recorded on an Analytik Jena spectrophotometer (model specord 210). IPCE was measured using a 150 W Xe lamp (ORIEL) fitted with a monochromator (Corerstone 260) as the monochromatic light source.
The fabrication of DSSCs
Fluorine-doped SnO2 glass (TEC-15, 2.2 mm thickness, Solaronix) was used for transparent conducting electrodes. The substrate was first cleaned in an ultrasonic bath using a detergent solution, acetone and ethanol, respectively (each step was 20 min long). The FTO glass plates were immersed into a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. A screen-printed double layer film of interconnected TiO2 particles was used as the mesoporous negative electrode. A 7 μm thick film of 20 nm-sized TiO2 particles was first printed on the fluorine-doped SnO2 conducting glass electrode and further coated by a 5 μm thick second layer of 400 nm sized light scattering anatase particles.
The TiO2-coated electrodes (active area 0.16 cm2) were gradually heated under air flow at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 15 min. After the sintering process, the TiO2 film was treated with 40 mM TiCl4 solution, and then rinsed with water and ethanol. The electrodes were heated at 500 °C for 30 min and after cooling (80 °C) were immersed for 16 h into sensitizing baths containing EtOH/THF (volume ratio: 4/1) solutions of the porphyrin in 0.2 mM concentration and when required 0.4 mM of 3a,7a-dihydroxy-5b-cholic acid (CDCA) (Solaronix, Switzerland) was added. After washing with THF and drying by air flow, electrolyte (AN-50, Solarnix, Switzerland) solution was introduced into the space between the photoanodes and the Pt-sheet counter electrode.
Synthetic procedures
5-Mesityldipyrromethane was prepared using literature methods.15 5 g of mesitaldehyde (0.034 mol) was taken in 300 mL of 0.18 M aqueous HCl. To this, 7 mL of pyrrole (0.101 mol) was added. The reaction mixture was purged with argon and then stirred in the dark for overnight at room temperature. At the end of this period, the reaction mixture was extracted with CHCl3, washed with water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The product was purified by the silica column using CHCl3 as the eluent. The yield of the desired product was found to be 4.5 g, 0.017 mol (50% yield).

The reaction mixture was purged with argon for 20 minutes followed by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid (2.26 mmol). The resulting reaction mixture was stirred in the dark for 3 hours. At the end of this period, DDQ (3.78 mmol) was added and allowed to stir for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was neutralized with triethylamine, concentrated to a small volume and loaded on the silica column, eluted using the 1:1 hexane/chloroform mixture. The desired product was obtained as the second fraction which was further recrystallized from the CHCl3/CH3OH mixture (1:3, v/v). The yield was found to be 10–12%.

General procedure for the synthesis of 2. 
Monoester porphyrin (0.10 mmol) (1a–1e) was dissolved in 20 mL of THF. To this, KOH (10 mmol) in 0.5 mL of water was added and heated at 80 °C for 24 h. At the end of this period, THF was removed under vacuum. The crude porphyrin was treated with 15 mL of 2N HCl affording green precipitate which was filtered and washed with excess of water thrice and dried. The product was purified by silica gel column chromatography using 3% methanol in chloroform as the eluent. The yield of the product was found to be quantitative.
