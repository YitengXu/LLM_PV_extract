    , Accepted 29th January 2015First published on 25th February 2015AbstractWe have successfully synthesized MoBi2(Se0.5Te0.5)5 thin films by using the self-organised arrested precipitation technique (APT) on ultrasonically cleaned glass and FTO-coated glass substrates. In the present investigation, we have synthesized MoBi2(Se0.5Te0.5)5 thin films and studied the effects of the surfactants sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and tri-n-octyl phosphine oxide (TOPO). The effects of the different surfactants on the opto-structural, morphological, compositional and electrical properties of the MoBi2(Se0.5Te0.5)5 thin films were investigated by using UV-visible-NIR spectrophotometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electrical conductivity (EC) and thermoelectric power (TEP) measurements. Optical study revealed that the as-deposited, SDS-assisted and TOPO-assisted thin films exhibited band gap energies of 1.46, 1.51 and 1.62 eV, respectively. XRD study confirmed that the surfactant-assisted thin films have broad and intense diffraction peaks compared to the as-synthesized thin film, indicating a more crystalline nature. SEM images confirmed that all the thin films are well adherent without containing any cracks, and that the different surfactants play a vital role in engineering of the surface morphology. The AFM study clearly showed that the surface roughness decreases for the surfactant-assisted thin films. The TEM and SAED patterns demonstrated that all samples are nanosized with porous surface morphology. The EDS and XPS measurements confirmed nearly stoichiometric thin film formation. The electrical study showed that all samples are semiconducting in nature with n-type conductivity. Finally these prepared electrodes were tested for their photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance in polysulphide electrolyte and promising results were obtained.
1. Introduction
Nowadays the fast consumption of present energy sources is a large issue, and to meet the demand for essential energy sources the photovoltaic solar cell is one of the most convenient energy resources. So, a large number of researchers are engaged in the fabrication of cost-effective, high-efficiency thin-film-based solar cell devices. Solar energy is the most promising energy source, which converts light into electricity in a cost-effective approach.1 Thin-film-based PEC solar cells1 have wide applications due to their low fabrication cost, high throughput processing technique and ease of junction formation with a redox electrolyte. VIB–VIA, VA–VIB or VIB–VA–VIA group chalcogenide materials have been extensively studied for solar cell applications, due to their unique properties and their optical band gap energy, which lies in the range of the visible region of the solar spectrum. Additionally, nanostructured thin films offer many advantages in solar cells. Nanostructured thin films show maximum light absorption for effective energy conversion and storage properties due to their large surface area and favourable charge transfer.2 That's why many researchers construct nanostructured materials and are concerned with the development of efficient nanosized thin films for solar cell applications.
Furthermore the incorporation of organic surfactants in the precursor solution is extremely important, due to their influence on the morphological and structural properties. The organic compound SDS (Scheme 1) is an anionic surfactant. It is an organosulphate consisting of a 12 carbon chain (single hydrophobic tail) attached to a sulphate group (hydrophilic). The chemical structure of TOPO (Scheme 2) is especially responsible for its excellent complexing properties, due to the presence of a phosphine group (PO). It acts as a surface-active amphiphilic molecule containing a hydrophilic head and three hydrophobic tails. It contains a lone pair of electrons, which is useful for the formation of complexes with metal ions. It also plays an important role in the separation and purification of metals, which is also applicable in the preparation of high quality microstructures.3 Many authors have reported that the synthesis of nanocrystals with controllable size by using SDS and TOPO surfactants is due to their ability to control particle size and enhance particle stability.4–6

There are many methods available for the synthesis of chalcogenide-based thin films, such as electrodeposition, spin coating, spray pyrolysis, chemical bath deposition (CBD), molecular organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD).7–9 However, these methods require various costly instruments, toxic reducing agents and demanding experimental conditions. In the present investigation, we have successfully deposited MoBi2(Se0.5Te0.5)5 thin films by using APT. APT can be described as a modified chemical bath deposition technique which works by the controlled release of metal and chalcogen ions. The technique has advantages like simple formulation, ease of setup, low temperature requirement, and suitability for large-area thin film deposition, and has the potential to replace energy-intensive and equipment-intensive techniques. Overall, the intention of the present report is to develop new nanostructures for effective light harvesting and study the imperative role of surfactants such as SDS and TOPO on the opto-structural, morphological, electrical and PEC properties of MoBi2(Se0.5Te0.5)5 thin films. A stepwise growth mechanism for SDS and TOPO surfactants has also been discussed in this work.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and method
All chemicals used in this work were analytical reagent grade (AR) and were used without further purification; these are: ammonium molybdate (Mo7O24·6(NH4)·4H2O, 99% pure, SD Fine-Chem), bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 99% pure, SD Fine-Chem), selenium metal powder (Se, 99% pure, SD Fine-Chem), tellurium metal powder (Te, 99% pure SD Fine-Chem), tri-ethanolamine (TEA) (N(CH2–CH2–OH)3, 99% pure, Merck), aqueous ammonia (NH3, 28–30%, Merck), anhydrous sodium sulphite (Na2SO3, 99% pure, SD Fine-Chem). Ammonium molybdate, bismuth nitrate, and selenium and tellurium metal powder acted as the sources of Mo4+, Bi3+, Se2− and Te2− metal and chalcogen ions respectively. TEA was used as a complexing agent to obtain Mo–TEA and Bi–TEA complex solutions. Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and tri-n-octyl phosphine oxide (TOPO) were used as surfactants.
2.2 Synthesis
Generally, the formation of thin films depends highly on the preparative parameters. Therefore, all parameters such as pH, concentration of precursor, temperature and deposition time were optimised beforehand. In a typical synthesis of the MoBi2(Se0.5Te0.5)5 thin films, the precursor concentrations (Mo, Bi, Se and Te ions) were taken in appropriate stoichiometric proportion viz. 1:2:5. MoBi2(Se0.5Te0.5)5. The thin films were deposited on ultrasonically cleaned glass and FTO-coated glass substrates by using APT. The overall optimized experimental procedure was carried out as per our previous report.10 The pH of the solution in the chemical bath was maintained at 9.5 by adding ammonia solution. The temperature of the bath was maintained at 55 °C. The as-deposited MoBi2(Se0.5Te0.5)5 sample is designated as ‘M’. The concentrations of the SDS and TOPO surfactants were optimised at 0.05% each in the as-deposited MoBi2(Se0.5Te0.5)5 sample with respect to the uniformity and adherence of the synthesised film. The films deposited by using SDS and TOPO as the surfactant are designated as ‘M-SDS’ and ‘M-TOPO’ respectively. For all samples, the optimized deposition time was 3 hours. After the desired deposition time, all samples were taken out of the reaction bath, washed with double-distilled water and dried at room temperature. Further characterization of the samples was then carried out.
2.3 Characterization
The terminal thickness of the thin films was determined by using a surface profilometer (AMBOIS XP-1). The structural properties of the thin films were studied using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS D8 Model) using Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation. A UV-visible spectrophotometer (Model: Shimadzu UV-1800) was used to record the absorption spectra of the as-deposited and surfactant-assisted thin films in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm. The surface morphology and elemental analysis were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyser (JEOL-JSM-6360A). The topography and roughness of the films were measured by using a JSM-5200 atomic force microscope (AFM). The particle shape, size and crystal structure were determined by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (TECHNAI G2 20U) equipped with a field emission gun. The sample was prepared by dispersion of the powder scraped from the film in ethanol and drop coated onto carbon-coated Cu-grids. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a VG Multilab 2000-Thermo Scientific, USA, K-alpha spectrometer. DC electrical conductivity was measured by the two probe method in the range 300–500 K. Thermoelectric power measurement was carried out under the condition of maximum temperature difference and minimum contact resistance. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were recorded using a semiconductor characterization system (SCS-4200 Keithley, Germany) using a standard two electrode configuration. 0.5 M polysulphide (0.5 M NaOH + 0.5 M Na2S + 0.5 M S) was used as a redox electrolyte. The as-deposited and surfactant-assisted thin films were used as photoelectrodes, and graphite was used as the counter electrode. Measurements for the power output characteristics were made at fixed intervals after waiting a sufficient amount of time for the system to reach equilibrium (both in the dark and under illumination). All PEC measurements were done at room temperature in air.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Growth mechanism
The precipitation and desired thin film formation of metal chalcogenide in APT occurs only when the ionic product of the ions (both anion and cation) exceeds the solubility product of the metal chalcogenides.11,12 Usually, the released metal and chalcogen ions combine to form nuclei on the substrate surface as well as in the solution, and precipitation occurs. APT is based on the Ostwald ripening law. According to this law, the rate of reaction between metal ions and chalcogen ions can be controlled by using a stable complexing agent (TEA). Smaller nuclei or embryos come towards each other to form less stable crystals, which readily convert into large stable crystals. Film growth takes place by means of slow ion-by-ion condensation followed by a multinucleation process on the substrate surface. Formation of the thin film occurs when the ionic product (Kp) exceeds the solubility product (Ksp) of the metal ions, and a multinucleation process follows the ion-by-ion condensation of metal ions onto the substrate surface. The possible reaction mechanism behind the formation of the ‘M’ thin films has been explained in detail in our recent report.10 After the addition of SDS and TOPO as surfactants, we observe different growth mechanisms for each surfactant. SDS contains a single hydrophobic tail structure, which is clearly shown in Scheme 1. So, SDS shows specific directional growth for possible thin film formation (M-SDS). In accordance with this specific mechanism, in the case of M-SDS thin films, formation occurs through the development of a specific dendrite star fish like surface morphology. On the other hand, TOPO contains three hydrophobic tails and has a less directional structure. As a result, the synthesized M-TOPO films exhibit a nanothread with flakes like surface morphology. These developed TOPO-assisted thin films have a non-directional surface morphology and a comparatively large surface area for effective light absorption. Fig. 1 depicts a schematic representation of the possible growth mechanisms for the deposition of nanostructured M, M-SDS and M-TOPO thin films.

3.2 Optical absorption studies
The terminal thickness of the M, M-SDS and M-TOPO thin films was measured to be 308 nm, 304 nm and 301 nm, respectively. The optical absorption studies were carried out to determine the optical band gap values of the materials under investigation. The optical absorption spectra for M, M-SDS and M-TOPO thin films were measured in the wavelength range of 300–1200 nm. Fig. 2 demonstrates the variation in the optical absorption with wavelength, and the inset of Fig. 2 shows the plot of (αhν)2vs. photon energy (hν) for the M, M-SDS and M-TOPO thin films. The fundamental absorption, which corresponds to the electron excitation from the valence band to the conduction band, can be used to determine the value of the optical band gap energy. The optical data were calculated by using the following absorption expression, eqn (1),13 (1)where A is a parameter that depends on the transition probability, h is the Planck constant, Eg is the optical band gap energy of the material, and the exponent n depends on the type of transition. The values of n for direct allowed, indirect allowed, direct forbidden and indirect forbidden transitions are 1/2, 2, 3/2 and 3, respectively.13 The inset of Fig. 2 shows the optical band gaps of the M, M-SDS and M-TOPO thin films. The linear nature of all the plots suggests that the materials possess the direct allowed type of transition. The optical band gap was obtained by extrapolating the straight line portion of the graph of (αhν)2vs. photon energy (hν) to α = 0 on the energy axis. From this plot (inset Fig. 2), optical band gap energies of 1.46 eV, 1.51 eV and 1.62 eV for the M, M-SDS and M-TOPO thin films were calculated, respectively. After the addition of surfactant the band gap energy increases. This increase in the band gap energy may be due to the synthesis of smaller nanoparticles on the substrate surface.14 Also, due to the surfactant specific role in thin film formation, the nucleation process and growth kinetics are hindered in the bath solution during the reaction process.15 The blue shift observed in the absorption edge may be occurring due to a decrease in crystallite size caused by the use of surfactants.

3.3 Structural studies
X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies are generally carried out to determine the crystal structure of solid state materials. Fig. 3 shows the XRD spectra of the M, M-SDS and M-TOPO thin films. The diffraction peaks of the M thin film at 2θ values of 23.20°, 27.60°, 29.36°, 30.54°, 32.84° and 43.63° correspond to the lattice planes (101), (211), (003), (300), (012) and (440), respectively. The diffraction peaks for the M-SDS and M-TOPO thin films are found at 2θ values of 27.68°, 29.33°, 32.16°, 40.32°, 43.65° and 53.46° corresponding to the lattice planes (015), (113), (012), (312), (10) and (413), respectively. The standard and observed θ values with respect to their (hkl) planes are tabulated in Table 1.

The plane indices are obtained by comparing the intensity and position of the peaks with those of the Bi2Te3, Bi2Se3, MoTe2 and MoSe2 binary systems, which are given by JCPDS card no. 08-0027, 72-2123, 23-1257 and 72-1420 respectively. The average crystallite size in all the samples was calculated by using the Scherrer formula.16,17 The XRD patterns reveal that the M, M-SDS and M-TOPO thin films exhibit pure rhombohedral crystal structures. The M-TOPO thin film demonstrates broader peaks in the XRD spectrum as compared to those obtained from M-SDS. The presence of a broad XRD peak is an indication of the nanocrystalline nature of the thin films.18,19 This clearly indicates that the average crystallite size in the M-TOPO thin film is smaller than in the case of the M-SDS thin film. The calculated average crystallite sizes for M, M-SDS and M-TOPO are 35.7, 29.2 and 25.1 nm respectively. Since no other peaks are observed in the XRD patterns, they confirm that all the deposited samples are pure phase. Comparatively, the surfactant-assisted thin films show more intense and broader diffraction peaks than the as-synthesized thin film, and effective decrement in crystallite size is observed. Such a crystalline nature is essential to decrease the electron–hole pair recombination in the redox electrolyte. This decrease in the recombination rate is highly beneficial for solar cell performance.
3.4 Morphological studies
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies were carried out to determine the surface morphologies of the thin films. Fig. 4 shows the SEM micrographs of the M, M-SDS and M-TOPO thin films at low and high resolution. From the low resolution SEM image (Fig. 4(M1)), an overall fibrous reticulate framework is observed for the M thin film. The high resolution SEM image (Fig. 4(M2)) of the as-deposited thin film shows the formation of interconnected reticulates with a homogenous framework. Fig. 4(M–SDS1) shows the low resolution SEM image of the M-SDS thin film. After the addition of SDS as a surfactant, the formation of a pinhole-free surface is observed. SDS addition changes the surface morphology into the dendrite star fish like morphology, which is clearly demonstrated in Fig. 4(M–SDS2). Comparison between Fig. 4(M2) and (M–SDS2) clearly confirms the effective progression in the surface morphology from an interconnected reticulate framework to a dendrite star fish like morphology. SDS is a peculiar surfactant which acts like a template and catalyzes the self-assembled growth of lamellar nanostructures.21 The low resolution SEM image (Fig. 4(M–TOPO1)) of the TOPO-assisted thin film shows that nanothreads are irregularly grown with good adhesion on the substrate surface. The high resolution SEM image indicates that those nanothreads are grown irregularly, to some extent containing irregular nanothreads with flakes on the surface (Fig. 4(M–TOPO2)) of film. The presence of the irregular surface morphology and the effective decrement in particle size is due to the use of TOPO as a surfactant. The growth of smaller particles observed in M-TOPO may be due to the particles’ particularly slower nucleation and appropriate growth mechanism.22 Generally, in presence of TOPO, nucleation occurs slowly because of the strong complex formation of TOPO with surface nanoparticles. This surface morphology is highly beneficial for light absorption phenomenon.20

The surface roughnesses of the M, M-SDS and M-TOPO thin films were recorded by AFM. Fig. 5 shows typical two dimensional (2D) and three dimensional (3D) AFM images of the M, M-SDS and M-TOPO thin films. All AFM images confirmed that the as-deposited and surfactant-assisted thin films are uniformly deposited on the entire substrate surface without cracks on the film surface. These results are well consistent with the observed SEM results. The roughness values 2.48, 1.89 and 1.29 nm were measured for the M, M-SDS and M-TOPO thin films, respectively. The observed change in roughness corroborates well the morphological changes observed in the SEM studies. In the 3D images, the intensity scale is shown, which indicates the height of surface grains along the z axis.

TEM studies were carried out to confirm the crystal structure, orientation and lattice parameters of the thin films. A magnified TEM image and its selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern are shown in Fig. 6. The TEM micrograph of the M thin film shows a surface containing small nanocrystalline grains embedded in a matrix having a fibrous reticulate framework. Those of the M-SDS and M-TOPO samples show the effect of the surfactants, as a disturbed fibrous reticulate framework and irregular shaped particles. These surface properties are also consistent with the observed SEM images. The SAED pattern of the sample M showed a diffraction spot and four prominent diffraction rings corresponding to the (101), (211), (003) and (012) planes. The SAED patterns for M-SDS and M-TOPO exhibited only four prominent diffraction rings corresponding to the (015), (012), (113) and (413) planes. These results are in agreement with the X-ray diffraction analyses for the same samples.

3.5 Compositional analysis
The quantitative analysis for EDS was performed for Mo, Bi, Se and Te in the sample M at different points. Fig. 7 shows the spectral distribution of the constituent elements for a typical MoBi2(Se0.5Te5)5 thin film. The atomic percentage ratios of Mo, Bi, Se and Te are listed in the inset table of the EDS image in Fig. 7. It clearly shows that the theoretical and practical atomic percentages of Mo, Bi, Se and Te in the M thin film are in good agreement, as well as confirming the composition of the film. Deviations from the atomic percentage of Mo4+, Bi3+, Se2− and Te2− could be attributed to the presence of oxygen. Oxygen may be incorporated into the film either from the atmosphere or from the alkaline medium of the bath solution. The variation in Bi3+ observed also might be due to the antisite defect.23,24 The greater Pauling electronegativity of selenium (2.55) than of tellurium (2.1) implies that the reactivity of selenium is greater than that of tellurium,25 due to which selenium is incorporated more easily in our films.

XPS analysis was carried out to confirm the binding energies of the respective elements and the elemental composition of the deposited thin films. Fig. 8(a) shows a typical XPS survey spectrum of the sample M. The XPS survey spectrum indicates the presence of binding energies of different states of the respective elements present in the as-deposited thin film (M). Fig. 8(b) shows the core level XPS spectrum of Mo 3d, and the doublet observed at 231.50 and 234.16 for the corresponding core levels Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2. The core level XPS spectrum of Bi 4f, Fig. 8(c) shows the doublet obtained at binding energies of 165.35 and 170.64 eV for the corresponding core levels Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, respectively. Fig. 8(d) shows the doublet at binding energy 45.07 and 53.67 eV for the corresponding core levels Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2. Fig. 8(e) shows the doublet observed at 574.12 and 585.07 eV binding energies for the corresponding core levels Te 3d5/2 and Te 3d3/2. The approximate composition of the surface can be determined by dividing the individual peak areas, after appropriate background subtraction, by their respective atomic sensitivity factors (ASF).26 For the M thin film, the Bi/Mo and SeTe/Mo ratios are 1.89 and 4.50, respectively, confirming nearly stoichiometric film formation.

3.6 Electrical studies
EC and TEP measurement studies were carried out to confirm the electron transfer mechanism and type of conductivity of the thin films. The EC measurements for the M, M-SDS and M-TOPO thin films were carried out in the temperature range 300–500 K using the standard DC two point probe method. The electrical conductivity was found to be a function of the temperature within the range 300–500 K. The plot of lnσ vs. 1000/T is shown in Fig. 9 for the M, M-SDS and M-TOPO thin films. The conductivity increases with increase in temperature for all the thin films. The increase in conductivity confirms that all samples are semiconducting in nature. From Fig. 9 it is observed that the surfactant-assisted (M-SDS and M-TOPO) thin films possess higher conductivities than that of the as-deposited sample (M). The size effect on the electrical conductivity of nanostructures is based on different mechanisms such as surface scattering, quantized conduction, coloumbic charging, tunnelling, widening, discrete band gap and change of microstructure. So the increase in conductivity of the M-SDS and M-TOPO samples may be due to the decrement in grain boundary scattering, structural defects, dislocations and improvement in nanoparticle size.27
 Fig. 9  Plot of lnσ vs. 1000/T of the M, M-SDS and M-TOPO thin films. 
The activation energy Ea can be estimated from the plot of ln σ against 1/T according to eqn (2),28 σ = σ0e(−Ea/kT)(2)where Ea is the activation energies for electrical conduction, k is the Boltzmann constant, σ is the temperature independent part of the conductivity and σ0 represents the pre-exponential factor. The activation energy for M, M-SDS and M-TOPO are 0.0208, 0.185 and 0.190 eV respectively.
The thermoelectric power (TEP) measurement properties of M, M-SDS and M-TOPO thin films were measured in the temperature range 300–500 K. The temperature difference between the hot and cold ends of the samples causes transport of carriers from the hot to the cold end, thus creating an electric field, which gives rise to a thermovoltage across the ends. The thermovoltage generated is directly proportional to the temperature gradient maintained across the semiconductor ends. From the sign of the multimeter terminal connected at the cold end, one can deduce the sign of the predominant charge carriers. Fig. 10 shows a plot of the Seebeck coefficient (S) vs. temperature for the M, M-SDS and M-TOPO thin films. The negative sign generated by the thermo emf confirms that all thin films are n-type semiconductors in nature. Also, the Seebeck coefficient indicates a negative sign, which confirms the n-type conduction mechanism.10

The Seebeck coefficient of the material is calculated using eqn (3),28 (3)where S is the Seebeck coefficient, ΔV is the voltage difference along the copper wire of the thermocouple and ΔT is the temperature difference along the thermocouple. The Seebeck coefficients for M, M-SDS and M-TOPO are −170, −192 and −220 μV K−1 at 300 K respectively.
3.7 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties
Thin-film-based PEC solar cells have wide applications due to their advantages, such as low fabrication cost, high throughput processing techniques and ease of junction formation with a semiconductor/electrolyte interface.29,30 Therefore, PEC solar cells with the semiconductors under investigation can be used as a simple and rapid technique to check the quality of solar cell materials. The PEC performance of the M, M-SDS and M-TOPO thin films were checked with the help of the standard two electrode configuration. The photoresponse tests of M, M-SDS and M-TOPO thin films were carried out by forming a typical cell configuration FTO/M or M-SDS or M-TOPO/0.1 M (Na2S)/S electrolyte/graphite as counter electrode.
The short circuit current voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured for all photoelectrodes in the dark and under an illumination of 30 mW cm−2 light intensity. The J–V characteristic curves in the dark display ideal diode-like rectifying characteristics for the fabricated PEC cells. Upon illumination, the magnitude of the open circuit voltage increases toward negative polarity for all electrodes, indicating the cathodic behavior of the photovoltage. These results confirm that all the thin films (M, M-SDS and M-TOPO) possess n-type behavior.31 The output parameters of the PEC solar cell, i.e. the light conversion efficiency (η%) and fill factor (FF), were calculated by using the following eqn (4) and (5) respectively,3 (4) (5)where Pin is the input light intensity, Jsc is the short circuit current density and Voc is the open circuit voltage. Jmax and Vmax are the values of maximum short circuit current density and maximum voltage, respectively, which can be extracted from the output characteristic of the PEC cell.

Fig. 11 shows the J–V curves in the dark and under illumination of the M, M-SDS and M-TOPO thin film samples, respectively. In the dark, all samples show J–V characteristics similar to diode characteristics (Schottky type in the case of MoBi2(Se0.5Te0.5)5/electrolyte) in which there is a negligible reverse saturation current. When these electrodes are illuminated by 30 mW cm−2 light intensity, sufficient incoming photons of light are absorbed, following which an electron hole pair is generated and becomes separated due to the built in potential at the interface, resulting in the generation of photocurrent.32 Under illumination, the J–V curves shift in the IVth quadrant, indicating the generation of electricity, which is typical of solar cell characterization. From the J–V measurements, the observed values of the power conversion efficiency (η%) for the M, M-SDS and M-TOPO thin film samples are 0.0337, 0.04958 and 0.107% respectively. A summary of the solar cell parameters is tabulated in Table 2.

The typical enhancement observed in the photoconversion efficiency for the surfactant-assisted thin films can be attributed to effective nanosized material deposition, lower particle size and larger surface area with more roughness. Also, the enhancement of the photoelectrochemical performance caused by using TOPO as a surfactant might be due to the morphological modifications that enhance the active surface area, and quenching of the defect levels responsible for recombination losses as compared to the SDS-assisted thin film.33
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized MoBi2(Se0.5Te0.5)5 nanostructures with different morphologies using SDS and TOPO as surfactants via the APT method. The experimental results demonstrated that the surfactant plays an important role in controlling the surface morphology of the thin films. These developed surface morphologies are useful for effective light absorption. The optical band gap energy increases with the decrease in crystallite size, from 1.46 eV to 1.51 eV to 1.62 eV. XRD patterns confirmed that all the thin films are nanocrystalline in nature, with rhombohedral crystal structures. The SEM study demonstrated pinhole-free and well-adherent thin film deposition with smaller particle size for the surfactant-assisted thin films over the entire substrate surface. The AFM study clearly indicated that the surface roughness increases for the surfactant-assisted thin films due to the specific growth mechanism of the surfactant and smaller particle deposition. The TEM and SAED patterns indicated good crystal structure with proper lattice parameters. The EDS spectra showed good agreement between observed and theoretical atomic percentages of the M thin film. The XPS plot showed nearly stoichiometric formation of the M thin film, with 1.89 (Bi/Mo) and 4.50 (SeTe/Mo) ratios. Finally, the photoelectrochemical performance testing demonstrated that the highest photoconversion efficiency was achieved for the TOPO-assisted thin film (0.10%).
