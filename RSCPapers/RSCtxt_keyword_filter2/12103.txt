    , Accepted 22nd October 2015First published on 23rd October 2015AbstractA series of ternary polymer solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated based on two narrow bandgap polymers PTB7 and PBDT-TS1 as the donors and PC71BM as the acceptor. The performances of the ternary PSCs monotonically increased along with the PBDT-TS1 doping ratio, up to 80 wt% in the donors. The optimum power conversion efficiency (PCE) achieved for the ternary PSCs was 7.91% with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.76 V, a short circuit current density (JSC) of 18.85 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 55.2% for the active layers with an 80 wt% PBDT-TS1 doping ratio in the donors. The optimized ternary PSCs show a 12.8% improvement compared to the optimum PCE of 7.01% for the binary PSCs with PBDT-TS1 as the donor and a 28.2% improvement compared with the optimum PCE of 6.17% for the binary PSCs with PTB7 as the donor. The FFs of all the ternary PSCs are larger than 54%, indicating efficient charge carrier transport channels in the ternary active layers. The energy or charge transfer between PTB7 and PBDT-TS1 should be neglected according to the investigation of the photoluminescence spectra of the blend films and the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of devices without the acceptor in the active layers. The ternary PSCs should be parallel-linkage structures with the donors independently working with the acceptor, which may be the most promising strategy for obtaining highly efficient ternary PSCs.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been envisioned as one of the promising candidates for energy converting devices with the advantages of being light weight, low-cost, flexible and environmentally friendly, and their ease of large-area processing.1–3 Many efficient methods have been carried out to improve the performance of PSCs, such as the synthesis of new materials with narrow bandgaps,4–6 optimization of morphology and phase separation,7,8 adoption of an interfacial buffer layer9,10 and development of new device architectures.11,12 The optimum power conversion efficiency (PCE) achieved is about 10% or 11% for bulk heterojunction or tandem solar cells, respectively.13,14 It is known that the performance of PSCs is mainly limited by insufficient photon harvesting of the active layers due to the relatively narrow absorption spectral range (∼100 nm) of organic/polymer materials.15 Tandem solar cells with a multi-layer structure were designed to improve photon harvesting by employing two or more materials with complementary absorption spectra to harvest high and low energy photons, separately.16 However, the complicated multi-layer structure has serious technical challenges for its potential application in tandem solar cells, such as the processing of a robust intermediate layer, and the optimization of the thickness of the sub-active layers. The intermediate layer between the top and bottom sub-cells is one of the most important features for obtaining high performance tandem solar cells, which should have rather low resistance and high transmittance. The thickness of the sub-active layers is also one of the key parameters to better balance the short circuit current density (JSC) of the top and bottom sub-cells. An elegant alternative strategy is incorporating the third component into binary blend films to prepare ternary PSCs with a performance improvement.17,18 Ternary PSCs maintain the simplicity of the processing conditions used for single-junction PSCs and strong photon harvesting ability by employing two materials with complementary absorption spectra.19,20 Recently, the PCE of ternary PSCs has approached or even exceeded 10%, which indicates that the ternary strategy may be an effective and simple method to improve the performance of PSCs.21,22
Ternary PSCs can be classified in three categories including “two donors/one acceptor”, “one donor/two acceptors” and “donor/nonvolatile additive/acceptor”.23–25 For the ternary PSCs with two acceptors, the PCE of the ternary PSCs can be optimized by adjusting the doping ratios of phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) or indene-C61 bisadduct (ICBA) in the acceptors.26 The ternary PSCs exhibit a relatively large open circuit voltage (VOC) for high ICBA doping ratios in the acceptors. A relatively large JSC can be obtained for the ternary PSCs with high PC71BM doping ratios in the acceptors. Zhan reported a high PCE of 8.24% for ternary PSCs based on ICBA as the electron-cascade acceptor in a thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7) and PC71BM blend system.27 The second acceptor ICBA plays a bridging role between PTB7 and PC71BM, providing more charge transfer or exciton dissociation routes. For the ternary PSCs with two donors, the complementary absorption spectra between the two donors is the first key selection criterion for improving the photon harvesting of the ternary active layers.28 Another key selection criterion is the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the two donors for better hole transport in the ternary active layers. From the early research on ternary PSCs with two donors, the main strategy is doping a narrow bandgap material into poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) with a PC71BM or ICBA blend system.29,30 The PCE of ternary PSCs can be improved by about 20–30% compared with the optimized PCE of the corresponding binary PSCs. In fact, the PCE values for this kind of ternary PSC are still less than 6% due to the relatively low PCE of the binary PSCs with P3HT as a donor.31 Recently, a series of highly efficient ternary PSCs has been reported based on having two narrow bandgap materials as the donors. Yan et al. reported an optimum PCE of 8.33% for the ternary PSCs obtained when the narrow bandgap materials alkyldiketopyrrolopyrrole and dithienylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DPP–DTT) were doped into a PTB7 and PC71BM blend system at 1 wt% in the donors.32 Yu et al. reported that when the wide bandgap material poly-3-oxothieno[3,4-d]isothiazole-1,1-dioxide/benzodithiophene (PID2) was doped into a poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th) and PC71BM blend system, an optimum PCE of 9.2% was obtained for a ternary PSC with a 20 wt% PID2 doping ratio in the donors. The enhanced PCE was attributed to the energy transfer from PID2 to PTB7-Th and the increased photon harvesting by the PID2 molecules.33 For most of the ternary PSCs, the optimum PCE has been obtained when the third component doping ratios are less than 20 wt% in the donors or acceptors. The PCE of ternary PSCs will be substantially decreased when the third component doping ratios are larger than 20 wt% in the donors, which is mainly due to a large phase separation resulting in a disrupted bicontinuous interpenetrated network in the ternary active layers.34 Therefore, the photon harvesting ability of the third component can't be efficiently utilized due to its limited doping weight in the ternary active layers. Recently, You et al. successfully reported parallel-linkage ternary PSCs; the optimum PCE of 7.02% was obtained for the ternary PSCs with two donors, poly(benzodithiophene-dithienylthiadiazolopyridine) (DTPyT) and poly(benzodithiophene-dithienyldifluorobenzothiadiazole) (DTffBT), with equal content (1:1, w/w) in the active layers.35 The fill factors (FFs) of all ternary PSCs are kept at more than 56% due to the efficient charge carrier transport in the ternary active layers. This means that two donors can independently work with the electron acceptor in parallel-linkage ternary PSCs, which is mainly attributed to the similar chemical structure of the two donors preventing an apparent phase separation or a disrupted bicontinuous interpenetrating network. It is believed that excitons generated in the two donors can migrate to their respective donor/acceptor interface and then dissociate into free charge carriers in the parallel-linkage ternary PSCs. Up to now, little research on parallel-linkage ternary PSCs has been reported.36 The underlying mechanism of parallel-linkage ternary PSCs needs to be further investigated to improve the performance of ternary PSCs.
Recently, a series of narrow bandgap materials based on the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit has been reported as being efficient electron donors in PSCs. Among them, 2,6-bis(trimethylstannyl)-4,8-bis(5-(octylthio)-thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene (PBDT-TS1) and PTB7 are popular materials with different bandgaps.37,38 Based on their complementary absorption spectra, PTB7 and PBDT-TS1 were selected to fabricate efficient ternary PSCs with PC71BM as the acceptor. The PCEs of the ternary PSCs are monotonically increased along with the PBDT-TS1 doping ratios up to 80 wt% in the donors. The optimum PCE of the ternary PSCs achieved is 7.91% along with a VOC of 0.76 V, a JSC of 18.85 mA cm−2 and a FF of 55.2% based on the ternary active layers with an 80 wt% PBDT-TS1 doping ratio in the donors. According to the investigation of the absorption spectra, photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the blend films and current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PTB7:PBDT-TS1 devices, the fabricated ternary PSCs should have a parallel-linkage structure. The efficient bicontinuous interpenetrating network and appropriate phase separation in the ternary active layers may be successfully kept while adjusting the PBDT-TS1 doping ratios in the donors for the optimization of photon harvesting.
Experimental section
Glass substrates coated with indium tin oxide (ITO) with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω square−1 were pre-cleaned consecutively in ultrasonic baths containing acetone, detergent, de-ionized water, and ethanol. The cleaned ITO-coated glass substrates were dried using high purity nitrogen gas and then treated by UV-ozone for 10 minutes to improve the work function of the ITO glass substrates. Subsequently, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, purchased from H.C. Starck Co. Ltd) solution was spin-coated on the ITO-coated glass substrates at 5000 rounds per minutes (rpm) for 40 s and they were baked at 120 °C for 15 minutes under air conditions. Then the glass substrate spin-coated PEDOT:PSS films were transferred to a high-purity nitrogen-filled glove box where all operations were carried out on them to fabricate the PSCs. The polymer PTB7 and fullerene derivative PC71BM (purchased from Luminescence Technology Corp.) and the polymer PBDT-TS1 (purchased from Organtec Materials Inc.) were used without any treatment. PTB7, PBDT-TS1 and PC71BM were co-dissolved in a blend of the solvents chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) with a volume ratio of 1:1. The overall concentration of solutions was kept constant at 25 mg mL−1 with the donors/acceptor weight ratio as 1:1.5; the only difference is the PBDT-TS1 doping ratios in the donors was altered between 0 wt% and 100 wt%. The prepared blend solutions were continuously heated and stirred at 75 °C for 12 hours before spin-coating. Then 3 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive was added into the blend solutions to form the final blend solutions. The active layers were fabricated by spin-coating the final blend solutions onto the PEDOT:PSS films at 1200 rpm for 40 s. The conjugated polyelectrolyte poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) was dissolved in methanol with the addition of 0.25 vol% acetic acid to prepare a 0.2 mg mL−1 solution. A two-step strategy was carried out for the better adjustment of the phase separation and control of the thickness of the PFN interfacial buffer layer.39 The 100 nm Al was deposited on the PFN films with a shadow mask by thermal evaporation under 10−4 Pa conditions, and the thickness was monitored using a quartz crystal microbalance. The effective area of the device was about 3.8 mm2, which was defined by the vertical overlap of the ITO anode and Al cathode.
The J–V curves of the PSCs were measured in the dark or under light illumination using a Keithley 4200 source meter under air conditions. The AM 1.5G irradiation used was provided using an ABET Sun 2000 solar simulator with light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PSCs were measured using a Zolix Solar Cell Scan 100. The absorption spectra of films were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-3101PC spectrometer. The thickness of the active layers was about 100 nm, which was measured using an Ambios Technology XP-2 stylus Profiler. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the films were measured by a HORIBA Fluorolog®-3 spectrofluorometer system. A schematic diagram of the device configuration, and the chemical structures of the used materials PBDT-TS1, PTB7 and PC71BM are shown in Fig. 1a and b.

Results and discussion
A series of ternary PSCs was fabricated with PBDT-TS1x:PTB7(1−x):PC71BM as the active layers; the subscript x indicates the PBDT-TS1 doping weight ratio in the donors. The J–V curves for the PSCs with different PBDT-TS1 doping ratios in the donors were measured under AM 1.5G illumination with light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, as shown in Fig. 2a. For the binary PSCs with PTB7:PC71BM as the active layers, an optimum PCE of 6.17% is obtained with a VOC of 0.72 V, a JSC of 15.29 mA cm−2 and a FF of 56.0%. For the binary PSCs with PBDT-TS1:PC71BM as the active layers, an optimized PCE of 7.01% is achieved with a VOC of 0.79 V, a JSC of 17.50 mA cm−2 and a FF of 50.7%. For the ternary PSCs, the VOC and JSC are monotonically increased along with the increase in the PBDT-TS1 doping ratio in the donors up to 80 wt%. This change in VOC is different from that of ternary PSCs with a charge transfer mechanism where the VOC of the blend films is decided by the difference between the highest HOMO energy level of the donors and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of the acceptor. The optimum PCE of the ternary PSCs achieved is 7.91% with a VOC of 0.76 V, a JSC of 18.85 mA cm−2 and a FF of 55.2% with PTB70.2:PBDT-TS10.8:PC71BM as the active layers. The PCE improvement should mainly be attributed to the increase in JSC due to the enhanced photon harvesting of the ternary active layers, which can be further demonstrated from the EQE spectra of the PSCs. The EQE spectra of all PSCs were measured and are shown in Fig. 2b. Markedly enhanced EQE values and wider response ranges are simultaneously obtained along with the increase in the PBDT-TS1 doping ratio in the donors, especially in the longer wavelength range. The optimized EQE spectra of the ternary PSCs are obtained based on the active layers with an 80 wt% PBDT-TS1 doping ratio in the donors. According to the EQE spectra of all the PSCs, the JSC values can be calculated based on the equation:  Here, N(λ) = I0/hν is the incident photon flux and q is the elementary charge in coulombs (C).40 The calculated JSC values of all the PSCs are slightly lower than the values obtained from the J–V curves with about 8% deviation due to the decay of the cells without encapsulation. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of all the PSCs are listed in Table 1.

To further confirm the contribution of PBDT-TS1 to the photon harvesting of the active layers, the absorption spectra of neat PTB7, PBDT-TS1, PC71BM and the ternary blend films with different PBDT-TS1 doping ratios in the donors were measured and are shown in Fig. 3a and b. According to Fig. 3a, the polymer PTB7 exhibits an apparent absorption peak at about 670 nm and a shoulder absorption peak at about 620 nm. The polymer PBDT-TS1 exhibits a strong absorption peak at about 720 nm and a shoulder absorption peak at about 650 nm. There is apparent absorption spectra complementation between PTB7 and PBDT-TS1, which is beneficial for enhancing the photon harvesting of the ternary active layers. The electron acceptor PC71BM has a strong photon harvesting ability in the UV and visible light range, which can replenish the photon harvesting of the ternary active layers in the shorter wavelength range. As seen from Fig. 3b, it is apparent that the absorption spectra of the ternary blend films are widened along with an increase in the PBDT-TS1 doping ratio in the donors. Meanwhile, the absorption intensity of the ternary blend films was enhanced in the shorter wavelength range along with the increase in the PBDT-TS1 doping ratio in the donors. The absorption spectra of the ternary active layers can explain well the EQE spectral change of the ternary PSCs along with the increase in the PBDT-TS1 doping ratio in the donors.

To further confirm the effect of the PBDT-TS1 doping ratio in the donors on the photon harvesting and charge carrier transport, the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves of the binary PSCs and the optimized ternary PSCs were investigated and are shown in Fig. 4a. Here, Jph is defined as Jph = Jl − Jd, where Jl and Jd are the current densities under 100 mW cm−2 illumination and in the dark, respectively. The Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage at the point Jph = 0 and Va is the applied bias voltage.41 The Jph values of all the PSCs rapidly arrive at the saturation state at about Veff = 0.2 V, indicating the efficient charge carrier transport channels formed in the binary and ternary active layers. Assuming the exciton dissociation efficiency and charge carrier collection efficiency are unity at Veff = 2 V, the saturation current density (Jsat) is mainly determined by the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax). As a result, Jsat = qLGmax, where q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the active layers.33 The Jsat of the optimized ternary PSCs is 21.79 mA cm−2, which is much larger than that of 18.01 mA cm−2 for the binary PSCs with PTB7 as a donor and 20.36 mA cm−2 for the binary PSCs with PBDT-TS1 as a donor. Therefore, the Gmax values are 1.36 × 10−26 m−3 s−1 for the ternary PSCs with PTB70.2:PBDT-TS10.8 as the donors, and 1.13 × 10−26 m−3 s−1 or 1.27 × 10−26 m−3 s−1 for the binary PSCs with PTB7 or PBDT-TS1 as the donor. It means that the ternary PTB70.2:PBDT-TS10.8 active layers can harvest more photons in the whole spectral range. It is known that the exciton dissociation, charge carrier transport and collection efficiency can also be assessed by the Jph/Jsat values under short circuit conditions.9 The Jph/Jsat value is 84.8% for the binary PSCs with PTB7 as the donor, 86.5% for the ternary PSCs with PTB70.2:PBDT-TS10.8 as the donors, and 85.1% for the binary PSCs with PBDT-TS1 as the donor under short circuit conditions. The efficient exciton dissociation can be confirmed from the PL spectra of the neat PTB7 and PBDT-TS1 films as well as the binary or ternary blend films, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4a. The PL emission of PTB7 or PBDT-TS1 was markedly quenched by PC71BM in the blend films. This means that efficient charge carrier transport and collection can be successfully undertaken in the ternary solar cells. To clarify the molecular interaction between PTB7 and PBDT-TS1, the PL spectra of the blend films without PC71BM were measured and are shown in Fig. 4b. The PL emission peaks of both PTB7 and PBDT-TS1 are located at about 780 nm due to their similar bandgap of 1.8 eV. It is highlighted that PL emission intensity of the PBDT-TS1 film is stronger than that of the PTB7 film under the same excitation conditions. The emission intensity of the blend films was almost linearly increased along with the increase in the PBDT-TS1 doping ratio. This means that the energy transfer between PTB7 and PBDT-TS1 can be neglected according to the PL emission intensity of the blend films.

The inset of (a) shows the PL spectra of the neat PTB7 and PBDT-TS1 films as well as the binary and ternary blend films. 
To further exclude the charge transfer between PTB7 and PBDT-TS1, three kinds of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layers/Al devices were fabricated with either neat PTB7 or PBDT-TS1, or a PTB7:PBDT-TS1 blend (1:1, w/w) as the active layers. The J–V curves of the devices were measured under AM 1.5G illumination with light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and are shown in Fig. 4c. As we can envisage, the JSC of all devices are rather low due to the absence of PC71BM in the active layers under light illumination. The JSC of devices with PTB7:PBDT-TS1 as the active layer is in between that of the devices with PTB7 or PBDT-TS1 as the active layers, suggesting inefficient exciton dissociation or charge transfer between the PTB7 and PBDT-TS1 interfaces. According to the above analysis, a schematic diagram of the working mechanism of the ternary PSCs is described in Fig. 4d. The two donors PTB7 and PBDT-TS1 can independently work with PC71BM as sub-cells; the ternary PSCs can be considered as a parallel-linkage structure.
It is known that charge carrier transport in the active layers also plays a key role in determining the performance of the PSCs, especially for the balance of hole and electron transport in the active layers. Hole-only devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer (100 nm)/MoO3/Ag and electron-only devices with the structure of Al/active layer (100 nm)/Al were prepared to characterize the effect of the PBDT-TS1 doping ratio in the donors on the charge carrier transport in the ternary active layers. The active layers of the single charge carrier devices are the same as those of solar cells. The J–V curves of the single charge carrier devices with different PBDT-TS1 doping ratios in the donors were measured in the dark and are shown in Fig. 5a and b.
 Fig. 5  (a) J1/2–V curves of hole-only devices; (b) J1/2–V curves of electron-only devices. 
The charge carrier mobility was calculated according to the space charge limited current (SCLC) method based on the J–V curves of hole-only or electron-only devices. The SCLC is described by the Mott–Gurney equation:  where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the dielectric constant of 3 for common organic materials, μ is the charge carrier mobility, V is the applied voltage, and L is thickness of the active layer.7,42 The calculated hole and electron mobilities of all the devices are listed in Table 2. It is apparent that the hole and electron mobilities of the ternary PSCs are slightly decreased along with the increase in the PBDT-TS1 doping ratio in the donors. It should be highlighted that the hole and electron mobilities become more balanced with μh/μe ≈ 1 when the PBDT-TS1 doping ratios are between about 60 wt% and 80 wt% in the donors. More balanced hole and electron mobilities are beneficial for obtaining a relatively high FF and JSC. The high FF can be further illustrated by the shunt resistance (Rsh) and series resistance (Rs) of the PSCs, as shown in Table 1. The Rsh is equal to the reciprocal of the J–V curve slope at the JSC point, and the reciprocal of the J–V curve slope at the VOC point represents the Rs of the cells. It is apparent that the values of Rsh are increased with the increase in the PBDT-TS1 doping ratio in the donors, and the values of Rs are simultaneously decreased. The maximum Rsh of 300 Ω cm2 and the minimum Rs of 4.9 Ω cm2 are obtained for the ternary PSCs with an 80 wt% PBDT-TS1 doping ratio in the donors, which is beneficial for charge carrier transport and collection in the ternary PSCs. The optimum PCE of the ternary PSCs with an 80 wt% PBDT-TS1 doping ratio in the donors can be well explained from the optimized photon harvesting, exciton dissociation, and charge carrier transport and collection in the ternary solar cells.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully fabricated highly efficient parallel-linkage ternary PSCs with PTB7 and PBDT-TS1 as the donors and PC71BM as the electron acceptor. The optimum PCE achieved is 7.91% for the ternary PSCs with an 80 wt% PBDT-TS1 doping ratio in the donors, which corresponds to a 12.8% or 28.2% PCE improvement compared with the optimized binary PSCs with PBDT-TS1 or PTB7 as the donor. The enhanced PCE should be attributed to the synergistic improvement of photon harvesting, exciton dissociation, and charge carrier transport and collection in the ternary blend films. The parallel-linkage structure may be a promising strategy to improve the performance of ternary PSCs, which not only enhances the photon harvesting of the active layers, but also may maintain the efficient bi-continuous interpenetrating network in the ternary active layers.
