1. Introduction
Solution-processed bulk-heterojunction organic photovoltaic cells (BHJ-OPVs) have attracted attention due to their advantages of low-cost, light-weight and flexibility.1–3 For a bulk-heterojunction organic photovoltaic cell, the most important component is the photoactive layer comprising a blend of a light absorbing electron donor (D) polymer and an electron acceptor (A) forming a three-dimensional network sandwiched between an anode and a cathode.4–6 Currently, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of BHJ-OPVs based on a conjugated polymer as a donor and a fullerene derivative PC71BM as an acceptor is 10.61% in single-junction organic solar cells5 and 11.83% in inverted triple-junction solar cells.7 With the rapid development of new small molecule non-fullerene acceptors matching with newly advanced small molecule and polymeric donors, especially, the development and utilization of the fused-ring non-fullerene acceptors have greatly promoted the development of organic photovoltaic cells, with the PCE of single-junction organic solar cells increasing speedily up to 15.7%,8 and the PCE of solution-processed tandem solar cells reaching 17.3%.9 The non-fullerene acceptor-based BHJ-OPVs have become a research focus in the organic photovoltaic field, and numerous related works have been increasingly reported in recent years.10–24 In order to make the organic small molecule non-fullerene acceptors viable for practical applications, they must be easily synthesizable and electronically and physically compatible with the commercially available donors.
Among the small molecule non-fullerene acceptors for OPVs, the 9,9′-bifluorenylidene (9,9′-BF) derivatives have the characteristics of simple synthesis and easy modification. Their optoelectronic properties can be easily adjusted by grafting different functional groups or different numbers of functional groups. 9,9′-Bifluorenylidene (9,9′-BF) contains two fluorenyl groups bridged by a CC bond. In the ground state, 9,9′-BF is forced to be coplanar due to the presence of the CC double bond between C9 and C9′, but the structure of the dimer is a twist because of the steric repulsion between the H1–H1′ and H8–H8′ protons; the two fluorene planes of 9,9′-BF are twisted by 31°.25 Wudl et al. first applied a 99′-BF derivative, 12-(3,6-dimethoxy-fluoren-9-ylidene)-12H-dibenzo[b,h]fluorine (D99′BF), as a new generation acceptor material to organic photovoltaic cells.26,27 When D99′BF was blended with P3HT, the acceptor increases the optical density and allows ultrafast charge transfer and charge separation. In the device configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT/D99′BF/Ba/Al, the polymer photovoltaic cells yielded a short-circuit current density (Jsc) close to 4 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.1 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.40, and a PCE of about 1.70%. Although the open-circuit voltage of the OPVs based on the D99′BF acceptor is high, its electron mobility is poor, leading to a lower PCE of the device. Recently, some new 9,9′-BF derivatives with upshifted LUMO energy levels and excellent electron transport have been developed by attaching functional groups with high electron mobility, good electron acceptability and low energy levels to the 9,9′-BF core. Zhao et al.28 designed and synthesized two non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (m-PIB and p-PIB) by linking four β-substituted perylene diimide groups to different positions of the 9,9′-BF core (2,2′,7,7′-positions for m-PIB, 3,3′,6,6′-positions for p-PIB), and blending m-PIB or p-PIB with PTB7-Th; the OPVs based on m-PIB and p-PIB obtained a maximum power conversion efficiency of 4.27% and 5.95% without any treatments, respectively. Gupta et al.29 attached four diketopyrrolopyrrole groups at the 2,2′,7,7′-positions of the central 9,9′-bifluorenylidene to synthesize a small molecule non-fullerene electron acceptor H1, and the solution-processable BHJ-OPVs based on the blend of P3HT/H1 afforded a promising efficiency of 5.42% with a high Voc of 1.17 V.
In our previous work,30 we synthesized three 9,9′-BF derivatives (STBF, TTBF and FTBF) containing thiophenyl, terthiophenyl and tetrathiophenyl groups at the 2- and 2′-position of the 9,9′-BF skeleton, respectively. Based on the LUMO energy level, STBF could be used as an electron acceptor in P3HT-based OPVs. However, the performance of the photovoltaic cells was very poor due to the low electron mobility of the compound STBF. In order to improve the electron mobility of the acceptors based on 9,9′-BF derivatives, we used 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone as the terminal functionality, which has high electron mobility and good electron acceptability, to synthesize a new small molecule non-fullerene acceptor (BF-TDCI4) (Fig. 1). Because of the strong ability to pull electrons, 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (DCI) groups can enhance the charge transport within the molecule, causing the absorption spectrum to widen, and thus this potentially allows an improvement in the PCE. In this paper, the performance of solution-processable BHJ-OPVs using poly{4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl]-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-2-carboxylate} (PTB7-Th) as the electron donor and BF-TDCI4 as the electron acceptor was investigated.

2.3. Fabrication and characterization of photovoltaic cells
The OPVs with the structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:BF-TDCI4/MoO3/Ag were fabricated. Organic solar cell devices were fabricated using ITO-coated glass substrates (15 Ω sq−1), which were cleaned with detergent water, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath sequentially for 20 min, and further treated with UV exposure for 30 min in a UV-ozone chamber. A ZnO electron transport layer was prepared on the ITO glass through spin coating at 4000 rpm from a ZnO precursor solution. Then, the ZnO substrate was immediately baked in air at 160 °C for 10 min. A chlorobenzene solution (in total 10 mg mL−1) of PTB7-Th:BF-TDCI4 blend was spin-coated on the ZnO layer to form a photosensitive layer. A thin layer (20 nm) of MoO3 as the anode interlayer and 100 nm of Ag as the top electrode were then evaporated onto the surface of the photosensitive layer under vacuum (ca. 4 × 10−6 Torr). Shadow masks were used to define the OPV active area (0.11 cm2) of the devices. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of unencapsulated photovoltaic devices were measured under N2 using a Keithley 2400 source meter. A 300 W xenon arc solar simulator (Oriel) with an AM 1.5 global filter operated at 100 mW cm−2 was used to simulate the AM 1.5G solar irradiation. The illumination intensity was corrected by using a silicon photodiode with a protective KG5 filter calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was recorded using certified IPCE equipment (Zolix Instruments, Inc, Solar Cell Scan 100).
3. Results and discussion
The compound BF-TDCI4 was synthesized through five step reactions (Scheme 1). Detailed synthetic procedures and characterization data for the two compounds are given in the Experimental Section. First, 2,7-dibromo-9H-fluoren-9-one was converted into the fluoren-diboronic ester I (83% yield), and then the intermediate II (74.4% yield) was obtained from the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction of the fluoren-diboronic ester I with 2-bromo-3-octylthiophene under a base condition with Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst. The 9,9 -bifluorenylidene derivative III (66.62% yield) was synthesized from a one-pot reaction by treating the intermediate II in the presence of Lawesson's reagent in toluene at reflux. The subsequent Vilsmeier-Haack formylation of compound III in 1,2-dichloroethane produced its four-formyl derivative IV in 90.8% yield. Finally, the Knoevenagel-condensation reaction of compound IV with an excess amount of 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone in the presence of pyridine and chloroform afforded the target compound BF-TDCI4 in 64.6% yield. The compound BF-TDCI4 was purified by column chromatography and characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and high-resolution mass spectroscopy. The compound BF-TDCI4 exhibited excellent solubility in common solvents, such as chloroform, dichloromethane, toluene and chlorobenzene due to the long alkyl chains attached to the thiophene rings.
The thermal property of BF-TDCI4 was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. 2). The TGA result showed that the compound BF-TDCI4 exhibited good thermal stability up to 290 °C (<3% weight loss). At 290, 328 and 381 °C, there are three obvious weight losses in the TGA curve, which shows that the compound undergoes three decomposition processes. The result indicates that BF-TDCI4 has good thermal stability and can be used in practical applications of OPVs.

The UV-vis spectrum (molar absorptivity (ε) versus wavelength) of BF-TDCI4 in dichloromethane solution (1.0 × 10−5 mol L−1) and the absorption spectra of BF-TDCI4 in solution and thin film are shown in Fig. 2. The absorption spectrum of BF-TDCI4 in dichloromethane solution shows two distinct bands located at 300 and 518 nm, respectively, which can be attributed to the π–π* transitions of the aromatic backbones. Grafting four strong electron-pulling groups (i.e. 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (DCI) groups) to the end of the 9,9′-BF core could result in intramolecular charge transfer of BF-TDCI4, giving the molecule strong transition dipoles and wide and strong visible absorption. Compared with the previously reported compound STBF,30 the absorption bands of BF-TDCI4 not only exhibit a significant red shift, but also increase the absorbance. The highest molar extinction coefficient of BF-TDCI4 is 1.14 × 105 M−1 cm−1; its molar extinction coefficient is greater than that of the reported 9,9′-BF derivatives,28,29 which means that the compound BF-TDCI4 may be able to absorb more photons and generate a higher photocurrent. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the absorption band at the long wavelength of BF-TDCI4 in thin film is red-shifted by 18 nm and broadened as compared to the spectrum measured in solution due to the intermolecular interactions and molecular aggregation between the molecules. From its absorption spectrum in thin film, the optical band edge was estimated to be at ca. 657 nm, thus the optical bandgap of BF-TDCI4 was about 1.89 eV. Furthermore, according to the absorption spectrum of the donor material PTB7-Th in thin film, the spectral characteristic of BF-TDCI4 exhibits good complementarity with the absorption of PTB7-Th.28 It is well-known that good spectral complementarity between the electron donor and the electron acceptor can effectively broaden spectral absorption, leading to achieving a higher Jsc in OPVs.

The electrochemical property of BF-TDCI4 was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in chloroform solution. The voltammogram of BF-TDCI4 is presented in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4, the HOMO energy level of BF-TDCI4 was found to be −5.71 eV, as calculated from the initial oxidation potential (1.32 V).32 From the optical bandgap and HOMO energy level of BF-TDCI4, its LUMO energy level was estimated to be −3.82 eV. The compound BF-TDCI4 is a low band gap material. In addition, the HOMO energy level difference (ΔEHOMO) between PTB7-Th and BF-TDCI4 is greater than 0.3 eV, which means that effective exciton dissociation can occur.33,34 The energy level diagram of the materials investigated in this work is depicted in Fig. 5.

The structure of BF-TDCI4 was optimized by density functional theory (DFT) using a B3LYP/6-311G(d) basis set to calculate its frontier molecular orbitals. The electronic distributions of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals for BF-TDCI4 obtained from time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculation are depicted in Fig. 6. The electron density in the HOMO orbital of BF-TDCI4 completely distributes on one side of the skeleton (including fluorene ring, thiophene rings and 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone rings) of BF-TDCI4, whereas in its LUMO orbital, one part of the electron density resides on 9,9′-bifluorenylidene (9,9′-BF) skeleton, and the other part of electron density locates on a 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone ring. The theoretical HOMO and LUMO energy levels were −5.78 and −3.39 eV. The theoretical UV-vis absorption spectrum of the acceptor BF-TDCI4 is shown in Fig. 7, and the two absorption bands are at about 432 and 543 nm.

In order to study the photovoltaic properties of the compound BF-TDCI4, the OPVs with an inverted configuration of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:BF-TDCI4/MoO3/Ag were fabricated, in which PTB7-Th was chosen as the donor because it is complementary to the absorption of BF-TDCI4, and the active layers were spin-coated from a chlorobenzene solution. Generally, different annealing temperatures (TAs),35 solvent vapor annealing (SVA)36 and solvent additives were used to modify the morphology of the active layer and improve the performance. Here, the optimization processes for fabricating the devices included changing the spin-coating speed, annealing temperatures and additives. However, the experimental results showed that the overall performances of the devices were not obviously improved when the additives were added. Therefore, the experiment of adding additives is not described in detail here. The fabrication conditions including the D/A weight ratio were carefully scanned to achieve the best device performance. The optimized weight ratio of D/A was 1ca1. The optimized photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE) of the devices under simulated AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination are summarized in Table 1. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OPVs based on PTB7-Th:BF-TDCI4 at the different processing method are given in Fig. 8a. The device data of the devices fabricated using the D/A weight ratio of 1h1.5 are given in Table 2.

As shown in Table 1, the device fabricated using the 1:1 active layer of PTB7-Th:BF-TDCI4 with 135 nm thickness and without any treatments showed values of Voc = 0.87 V, Jsc = 8.93 mA cm−2, FF = 34.42%, and PCE = 2.67%. After thermal annealing (TA) at 100 °C for 10 min followed by CS2 solvent vapor annealing (SVA) for 10 s, the performance of the device with the same thickness of the active layer was improved obviously, and the PCE of the device was increased to 3.21% due to having a higher Jsc (10.03 mA cm−2) and FF (36.83%). To further improve PCE, PTB7-Th:BF-TDCI4-based OPVs with different active layer thicknesses ranging from 95 to 135 nm were fabricated and investigated. From Table 1, it can be seen that as the film thickness decreased, the Voc did not change, the Jsc decreased slightly, and the FF was greatly improved. After TA and SVA (CS2) treatments, a notable PCE of 4.35% was obtained for the device with 95 nm thickness of the active layer due to having a higher FF (51.20%), although the open circuit voltage (Voc) and the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the device in this case changed little compared with that of the devices with 135 and 115 nm thicknesses of the active layer. Although a thicker active layer can tend to absorb more light, it also enables the possibility of charge recombination in the longer paths to the respective electrodes, leading to a reduction of FF and PCE. The existence of 3-octylthiophene bridges between the 9,9′-BF core and the 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone end-capped groups causes the compound BF-TDCI4 to not easily crystallize and influences the π–π stacking behavior between the molecules due to the steric hindrance effect, and thus, with the thinner active layer, the device based on PTB7-Th:BF-TDCI4 had a higher FF and PCE.37
The previously reported 2,2′,7,7′-substituted 9,9′-BF acceptors m-PIB28 and BF-PDI4,38 in which four perylene diimide (PDI) groups were grafted directly at the 2-, 2′-, 7- and 7′-positions of the 9,9′-BF skeleton, show 3D structures due to the twisted structure of the 9,9′-BF core and the twist between the perylene diimide (PDI) groups and the 9,9′-BF core, and the optimized PCEs of 4.27% and 3.64% were achieved for the devices based on PTB7-Th:m-PIB and PTB7-Th:BF-PDI4, respectively. The perylene diimide (PDI) group has a large size structure and large steric hindrance, resulting in poor planarity of m-PIB and BF-PDI4 molecules and poor π–π molecular packing, and further resulting in a low FF for their OPVs (46.72% for m-PIB, 45.55% for BF-PDI4). For the compound BF-TDCI4, 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone groups are small in size and connected to the 9,9′-BF core via the 3-octylthiophene bridges, which is beneficial to the π–π molecular packing. Therefore, the compound BF-TDCI4 has a better planarity compared with m-PIB and BF-PDI4, and the optimized PCE of 4.35% was obtained for the device based on PTB7-Th:BF-TDCI4 due to having a higher FF (51.20%). In addition, as the electron-pulling terminal groups, the electron-pulling ability of 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone group is stronger than that of PDI. This also has a certain effect on the high PCE of the photovoltaic device based on PTB7-Th:BF-TDCI4.
The corresponding EQE spectrum of the best-performing PTB7-Th:BF-TDCI4-based device is shown in Fig. 8b. This device displays a broad photoresponse in the range from 450 to 750 nm. A high maximum EQE value of 47% is obtained for the PTB7-Th and BF-TDCI4 blended film. From the EQE diagram, it can be seen that the spectral response is broad, indicating that PTB7-Th acts as a donor and BF-TDCI4 acts as a receptor, which can effectively broaden the spectral absorption of the active layer. For BF-TDCI4, the integrated photocurrent calculated from the EQE spectrum was 9.79, which is consistent with the Jsc value obtained from the J–V measurement.
In order to illustrate the exciton dissociation and charge transfer behavior in PTB7-Th:BF-TDCI4-based blends, the photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments of the polymer donor PTB7-Th and BF-TDCI4 in the PTB7-Th:BF-TDCI4 blend film were performed (Fig. 9), where excitation wavelengths of BF-TDCI4 and PTB7-Th were 536 nm and 700 nm, respectively. The PL emission band of pure BF-TDCI4 film emerges in the range of 610–650 nm centered at 630 nm, whereas a PL emission peak of the blend film was strongly quenched (by 89.6%) due to the effective photo-induced charge transfer between PTB7-Th and BF-TDCI4 in the photovoltaic device based on PTB7-Th:BF-TDCI4. The PL emission peak of pure PTB7-Th film emerges in the range of 720–900 nm, but the PL emission band of the blend film was highly quenched (by 83.4%) due to the efficient electron transfer from PTB7-Th to BF-TDCI4.
 Fig. 9  Photoluminescence spectra of (a and b) pure BF-TDCI4 and PTB7-Th as well as PTB7-Th:BF-TDCI4 blend films. 
To assess the charge transport properties and the recombination of opposite charges of BF-TDCI4, space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements were carried out to determine the hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe, respectively). The μh and μe values were obtained from the device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/Phen-NaDPO/active layer/Phen-NaDPO/Al, respectively. As shown in Fig. 10, after thermal annealing (TA) at 100 °C for 10 min then CS2 solvent vapor annealing (SVA) for 10 s, the optimal two blends of PTB7-Th and BF-TDCI4 have values of μh = 4.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 3.24 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The μh/μe ratio is 13.46 for PTB7-Th:BF-TDCI4, indicating that it could cause a space charge transfer imbalance, exciton recombination is serious, and the FF is lowered. The blend film exhibits a better hole mobility, which should facilitate the collection of holes by the anode.

The surface morphology of the PTB7-Th:BF-TDCI4 (1:1, w/w) blend film treated with TA and SVA was investigated by using atomic force microscopy (AFM). As observed from the height and phase images in Fig. 11a and b, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of the PTB7-Th:BF-TDCI4 film was measured to be 3.12. The appropriate RMS value of the PTB7-Th:BF-TDCI4 film indicates the excellent miscibility of donor and acceptor, which could lead to an efficient bicontinuous interpenetrating network.

4. Conclusions
In this paper, a new 9,9′-BF core-based non-fullerene receptor, BF-TDCI4, was designed and synthesized. This compound absorbs strongly in the 400–700 nm spectral region in thin film, and its spectral characteristic exhibits good complementarity with the absorption of PTB7-Th. The active layer of PTB7-Th:BF-TDCI4 can be readily fabricated for BHJ-OPVs by the solution spin-coating method. The optimized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.35% was obtained for the OPVs based on PTB7-Th:BF-TDCI4 (1:1, w/w) blend film after thermal annealing (TA) at 100 °C for 10 min then CS2 solvent vapor annealing (SVA) for 10 s. Compared with the reported 2,2′,7,7′-substituted 9,9′-BF acceptors, such as m-PIB and BF-PDI4, the organic photovoltaic device based on PTB7-Th:BF-TDCI4 has a higher PCE. The compound BF-TDCI4 has good potential as an acceptor material for high efficiency and low cost organic solar cells. The molecular design strategy used in this paper is of considerable feasibility and offers guiding significance in the field of 99′BF derivative non-fullerene receptor materials.
