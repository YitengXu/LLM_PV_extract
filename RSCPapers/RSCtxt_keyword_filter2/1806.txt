Single crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that the geometry around Co(III) in the Co-FcBz and Co-FcEtOH complex cations is distorted octahedral and satisfied by four sulfur atoms of two dithiocarbamate ligands and two phosphorus atoms of the dppe ligand. The weak interactions existing in Co-FcBz and Co-FcEtOH have been addressed with the help of Hirshfeld surface analysis. The electronic absorption spectra of all three compounds display bands in the regions of ∼400–500 nm and ∼500–750 nm which are due to the d–d transition of ferrocene and Co(III), respectively. These compounds have been used as photo-sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Experiments revealed that amongst all three sensitizer-based DSSC set-ups, the assembly fabricated using Co-FcEtOH exhibited the best photovoltaic performance with 3.89% efficiency (η), a short circuit current (Jsc) of 9.15 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of −0.680 V and an incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency of 49%. Also, the ageing experiment for the DSSC set-up fabricated using Co-FcEtOH revealed that after 100 h, the set-up retained 97% of its efficiency, which indicates that such a class of molecular systems can be used as apt sensitizers for DSSC fabrication.
Introduction
The last few decades have witnessed incremental utilization of fossil fuels, a non-renewable source of energy, which not only resulted in the depletion of these energy sources but also compelled researchers working in the area of energy to explore new non-conventional sources of energy.1 Amongst a plethora of non-conventional sources of energy which might be capable of meeting growing energy requirements, the use of solar energy can be a promising alternative,1 wherein the conversion of solar energy into electrical energy can be accomplished using photovoltaic (PV) devices.1
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), regarded as the third-generation PV devices, have been shown to be better than conventional PV devices in terms of their eco-friendly nature, economical fabrication and good performance under low-sun conditions and they have an efficiency of up to 14%.2 The main components of a typical DSSC are TiO2 or ZnO mesoporous semiconductor film-coated conducting glass, light sensitizers/dye, an electrolyte and a redox couple.3,4 All these entities of DSSCs are very important and play a pivotal role in enhancing the photovoltaic cell efficiency, but amongst these the most important component is the sensitizer.2–4
The most significant category of the many sensitizers used in DSSCs is that based on coordination complexes. Amongst those, ruthenium-based sensitizers such as state-of-the-art N719, N3, N749 and N621 dyes have gained significant attention due to their wide PCEs.5 However, their high cost and environmentally unfriendly nature limit their widespread real-world applicability. Hence, investigators started searching for newer categories of affordable sensitizers and synthesized main group metals and transition metal coordination complexes as sensitizers. Apart from coordination complexes, a range of organic sensitizers have also been reported, but their poor charge transfer properties limit their utility. Hence, suitably designed coordination complexes comprising variable anchoring groups find better applicability due to their tuned charge transfer properties and better robustness.6 Amid those, copper(I) complexes have gained attention due to their high abundance, low cost and analogous photo-physical properties to Ru(II) complexes.3
Apart from copper, recent reports indicate that ferrocenyl-based compounds can also act as photosensitizers in DSSCs. This may be ascribed to their efficient one-electron reversible redox as well as electron donating properties and absorption in the visible region which can be bathochromically and hyperchromically shifted by introducing appropriate functional groups at the five-membered cyclopentadienide unit.7 Such substitution not only affects the optical properties but also is responsible for altering the formal redox potential parameters.8 In view of these assorted features associated with ferrocene, various organic derivatives of ferrocene as well as their coordination complexes have been used as sensitizers and co-sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells.9–12 Also, in spite of a plethora of reports available where transition metal complexes have been employed as sensitizers in III-generation photovoltaics,2–12 only a few reports are available where cobalt complexes have been used as photosensitizers.9a,e,n However, cobalt complexes with an octahedral geometry can act as a better dye due to their broad electronic absorption spectra and if a ligand is judiciously selected it can exhibit good dye loading and better anchoring over the TiO2 semiconducting nanoparticulate.9a,e,n Hence, in view of the small number of existing reports and in the quest for new sensitizers, we are presenting herein syntheses and characterization of three new heteroleptic 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane cobalt(III) ferrocene appended dithiocarbamates used as sensitizers in DSSCs.
Results and discussion
Syntheses
New heteroleptic complexes of Co(III) having dithiocarbamate involving ferrocene and 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane were synthesized by condensation of ferrocene carboxaldehyde with three different primary amines viz. benzylamine, 2-picolyl amine and ethanol amine to engender respective imines, which on reduction with sodium borohydride yielded the corresponding secondary amines. The reaction of secondary amines with carbon disulfide and potassium hydroxide yielded the desired dithiocarbamates. The obtained dithiocarbamates on reaction with the precursor complex [CodppeCl2] and the counter anion KPF6 in a methanol and dichloromethane mixture yielded the desired sensitizers (Scheme 1). All heteroleptic complexes were air stable and soluble in halogenated solvents but insoluble in diethyl ether.

Spectroscopy
The FTIR spectra of all three complexes displayed a band between 1000 and 1100 cm−1 that corresponds to νC–S and revealed the symmetrical bidentate coordination of dithiocarbamate ligands. The bands near 1465–1495 cm−1 are attributed to the presence of thioureide vibration which signifies the presence of a partial double bond character as the band appeared at an intermediate frequency between νCN (1690–1640 cm−1) and νC–N (1360–1250 cm−1). Additionally, the FTIR spectrum of Co-FcEtOH displays a band at 3400 cm−1 corresponding to νO–H.13
In the 1H NMR spectra of all the three complexes, the presence of signals between δ 7.76 and 7.16 indicates the existence of aromatic protons of dppe, as well as benzyl and pyridyl protons in the case of compounds Co-FcBz and Co-FcPy, respectively. The resonances corresponding to the ferrocene fragment appear between 4.13 and 4.30 ppm. In the 13C NMR, the presence of signals at ∼200 ppm corresponds to the –CS2 moiety of the dithiocarbamate ligands. In the {1H}31P NMR spectra of the complexes, the signal at ∼59 ppm indicates that the phosphorus centers of the dppe ligand coordinate symmetrically to the Co(III) center. Additionally, signals corresponding to PF6− appeared as a septet at δ 144.18 (J = 712 Hz).14
Molecular structure description
Single crystals of Co-FcBz and Co-FcEtOH were obtained by slow evaporation of ethanol–dichloromethane solutions. The sensitizer Co-FcBz crystallizes in the monoclinic P21/c space group with four molecules in the unit cell while Co-FcEtOH crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Fddd with sixteen molecules in the unit cell. In both complexes, the coordination geometry around Co(III) is distorted octahedral and satisfied by the four sulfur centers S1, S2, S3 and S4 (in Co-FcBz) and S1, S2, S1′ and S2′ (in Co-FcEtOH) of two dithiocarbamate ligands and two phosphorus centers P1 and P2 (in Co-FcBz) and P and P′ (in Co-FcEtOH) of the chelating dppe ligand (Fig. 1).15,16 In Co-FcBz, the Co–S bond lengths are in the range of 2.2606(9)–2.2941(9) and the Co–P1 and Co–P2 bond lengths are 2.2375(9) and 2.2271(10), respectively. However, in Co-FcEtOH, the Co–S bond lengths range between 2.266(17) and 2.301(2) Å and the Co–P and Co–P′ bond lengths are 2.234(2) Å. The N1–C27 and N2–C47 bond lengths in Co-FcBz are 1.323(4) and 1.319(6) Å, respectively. In Co-FcEtOH, the N–C14 bond is 1.318(9) Å long. These bond lengths are intermediate to the C–N (1.47 Å) and CN (1.28 Å) bond lengths thereby indicating the partial double bond character between the N–C bonds of the dithiocarbamate ligands in both Co-FcBz and Co-FcEtOH.17 In Co-FcBz, the bite angles S1–Co–S2 and S3–Co–S4 are 75.99(3)° and 75.79(3)°, respectively while that of P2-Co–P1 is 86.99(4)°. In Co-FcEtOH, the S1–Co–S2 bite angle is 76.49(7) Å while the P–Co–P′ bite angle is 88.53(11) Å. The S–Co–S bite angles are relatively more acute than the P–Co–P bite angles because the dithiocarbamate ligand forms a four-membered chelate ring whilst dppe forms a five-membered chelate ring.

In Co-FcBz, the dihedral angle between the planes formed by four-membered chelate rings of two dithiocarbamate ligands is 81.94°, while the dihedral angles between the planes formed by two dithiocarbamate ligands and dppe are 88.35° and 85.05°. In Co-FcEtOH, the dihedral angle between the planes formed by four-membered chelate rings of two dithiocarbamate ligands is 86.67°, while the dihedral angles between the planes formed by two dithiocarbamate ligands and dppe are identical, 86.68°.
The solid-state framework of Co-FcBz is stabilized by various interactions amongst which the intermolecular S2⋯H51–C51 interaction is important with an interaction distance of 2.83 Å and an angle of 151.7°. Additionally, several intermolecular C–H⋯C (π) interactions, viz. C49–H49A⋯C65 (2.84 Å; 135.8°), C22–H22⋯C62 (2.87 Å; 153.1°), C40–H40⋯C3 (2.87 Å; 150.96°) and C40–H40⋯C4 (2.82 Å; 170.7°) also exist in the solid-state. Apart from intermolecular interactions, intramolecular C26–H26⋯C20 (2.87 Å; 153.1) and C8–H8⋯C10 (2.87 Å and 153.1) as well as C10–H10⋯S4 (2.87 Å; 153.1), C20–H20⋯S3 (2.87 Å; 153.1°) and bifurcated S4⋯H10–C10 (2.89 Å; 101.4°) and S3⋯H10–C10 (2.82 Å; 144.44°) interactions also exist in Co-FcBz (Fig. 2a and b).

In Co-FcEtOH, the solid-state framework is stabilized by intermolecular bifurcated C26–H26⋯C5 (2.88 Å; 137.30°) and C26–H26⋯C4 (2.57 Å; 154.14°) interactions that operate between ferrocene carbon and dppe hydrogens. Additionally, the intramolecular C22–H22⋯C16 interaction having an interaction distance of 2.76 Å with an angle of 129.5° and intramolecular bifurcated S1⋯H16–C16 (2.80 Å; 104.9°) and S2⋯H16–C16 (2.95 Å; 143.19°) interactions stabilize the supramolecular framework of Co-FcEtOH (Fig. 2c).
In addition to the aforementioned interactions, both complex cations also exhibit intermolecular interactions with their counteranion PF6−. In Co-FcBz, the intermolecular C55–H55⋯F5 interaction is 2.66 Å long with an angle of 168.86° while the C55–H55⋯F1 interaction length is 2.53 Å with an angle of 140.73° and stabilizes the solid-state framework (Fig. 2b). In Co-FcEtOH, the intermolecular bifurcated C24–H24⋯F1 and C24–H24⋯F6 interactions exist with interaction distances of 2.63 Å and 2.57 Å, respectively, with interaction angles of 128.2° and 157.01°, respectively, which stabilize the solid-state framework (Fig. 2c).
Hirshfeld surface analyses
The Hirshfeld surfaces18–20 for Co-FcBz and Co-FcEtOH are shown in Fig. 3 and 4, respectively. The dnorm surfaces for both the compounds have been mapped between −0.5 and 1.5 Å. The surfaces are presented as transparent for the visualization of the aromatic as well as the puckered ring moieties around which they were computed. The non-covalent interactions that have been discussed in X-ray crystallography (vide supra) are present as deep red circular depressions in the dnorm surfaces. The dominant C–H⋯π, S⋯H and F⋯H interactions in Co-FcBz and Co-FcEtOH can be seen as the red-shaded area. The shape index plot, which considers minute variations in the shape of the molecule brought on by irregular deformation from nearby crystal environments, also reveals the style of packing that is present in the crystal. The plot's surface consists of several grooves and bumps that range between −1 and 1 Å. The red-yellow hollow areas on the shape index plot govern the strong interactions that are strongly influenced by the surrounding environment that plays a key role in supramolecular interactions. Additionally, the bumpy patches in both compounds supported weak interactions that were least influenced by the nearby crystalline environment (Fig. 3 and 4). For both compounds, the RMS surface curvature-based curvedness was also generated. In Co-FcBz, a closer look at the surface revealed yellow spots within the smooth green surfaces while Co-FcEtOH has blue patches with significant surface curvature connected to the flat green surface. In Co-FcBz, isoenergetic supramolecular contacts are revealed by the yellow patches (Fig. 3), but in Co-FcEtOH, the blue patches show that these interactions are not isoenergetic in nature, thereby suggesting the variation in bond strengths (Fig. 4).

 Fig. 4  Results of the Hirshfeld surface analysis for Co-FcEtOH. 
In the fingerprint plots18–20 for both compounds, the complementary regions have been presented where one molecule behaves as a donor (de > di) whilst another acts as an acceptor (de < di). In Co-FcBz, the C–H⋯π and S⋯H intermolecular interactions display distinct paired spike features while C⋯S and F⋯H do not exhibit any. Amongst all the interactions, the C⋯H and F⋯H interactions contribute a maximum to the crystal structure of Co-FcBz (Fig. 3). In Co-FcEtOH also, the C–H⋯π and S⋯H intermolecular interactions display distinct paired spike features while C⋯S and F⋯H do not exhibit any. Amongst all the interactions, the C⋯H and F⋯H interactions contribute a maximum to the crystal structure of Co-FcEtOH (Fig. 4).
The electronic spectra of all three cobalt-based sensitizers display a band in the region of ∼400–500 nm which arises due to the d → d (assigned to the 1E1g ← 1A1g) transition of the ferrocene moiety (Fig. 5).21,22 Broad bands with a medium intensity observed between 550 and 750 nm arise due to the octahedral geometry around cobalt(III).23 The absorption in the visible region in the case of all the three complexes makes them appropriate candidates as sensitizers in DSSCs (Fig. 5a). The UV-vis spectra for all three sensitizers were recorded on TiO2 thin films (Fig. 5b) which indicated that in comparison with the solution phase, the bands of all three sensitizers were broadened with a slight bathochromic shift. The broadening associated with slight bathochromic shifts may be attributed to the aggregation and electronic coupling of all three sensitizers on the TiO2 surface.8b

To gain additional insight into the electronic transition characteristics of all three Co(III)-based sensitizers, TD-DFT calculations were performed. The calculations indicated that experimental λmax and calculated transitions matched satisfactorily (Table 1). Furthermore, the calculations suggested that in all three sensitizers, low energy transitions appearing in the visible region at ∼530 nm and 430 nm are accredited to d–d transitions of Co(III) center and the transitions corresponding to the ferrocene moiety of the ligand. In addition, changes in the oscillator strength (f) of low energy electronic transitions that are noticeable have an impact on the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), which has been computed using the equation LHE = 1–10−f (Table 1).24

Photovoltaic investigation
Electrochemical studies
The tuning of the energy level of sensitizers with respect to the conduction band of TiO2 is an important aspect of the thermodynamic viability of the DSSC device. For an enhanced power conversion efficiency, the dye must have a better regeneration efficiency and a high electron injection efficiency. Thus, cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were carried out to assess the ability of electron injection and dye regeneration properties of dyes in a three-electrode cell on an electrochemical workstation using Pt disc as the working electrode and Ag/Ag+ (in acetonitrile) as the reference electrode (Fig. 6). Table 2 summarizes the electrochemical parameters of these sensitizers, which suggest that the LUMO level of sensitizers are more negative (−2.32 to −2.25 V vs. Ag/Ag+ in ACN) than the conduction band edge of TiO2 (−0.85 V vs. Ag/Ag+ in ACN). This indicates that the excited dyes can efficiently inject electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 as well as the HOMO level of sensitizers are more positive (+0.557 to +0.628 V vs. Ag/Ag+ in acetonitrile) than the redox potential of the electrolyte (−0.15 V Ag/Ag+) providing a sufficient driving force for regeneration of dyes. The energy level diagram (Fig. 7) obtained from the combined results of electronic absorption spectra and electrochemical data suggests thermodynamically favourable electron injection from the excited state of sensitizers to the conduction band of TiO2 followed by successive regeneration of N719 by an electrolyte (I−/I3−).

Current–potential curve
To study the photovoltaic properties and performance of the assembled DSSCs, standard conditions for illumination (AM 1.5) were used and the corresponding JV curves were constructed (Fig. 8). The parameters derived from the J–V curves of dye sensitized TiO2-based solar cells are shown in Table 3. The efficiency of Co-FcEtOH as a photosensitizer in DSSCs based on TiO2 is 3.89%, which is the highest power conversion efficiency achieved for the Co-based dye series in this study which can be due to the existence of an extensive conjugate system and a suitable anchoring dye on the semiconductor surface.25,26 The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the sensitizers and the conduction band of the semiconductor determine the photovoltage value,27 while the amount of photovoltage in the Co-based DSSCs varies by a slight range (0.668–0.680 V) owing to the resemblance of the synthesized dyes from the chemical structure approach. Co-based dyes used in this study as photosensitizers have a common framework except for the substituents as anchoring groups in the photosensitizers, which is the only difference between the structures of Co-FcEtOH, Co-FcBz and Co-FcPy. Thus, there is a slight difference between the power conversion efficiencies of these Co-based dyes due to different anchoring groups and dye loading amounts. This result was obtained for all the synthesized dyes, with Co-FcEtOH showing superior performance in the presence of –OH as the anchoring group, which facilitates better anchorage on the semiconductor surface. In this study, the N719 dye was considered as a reference dye for comparing the photovoltaic performances of Co-based DSSCs. The DSSCs based on N719 showed better performance than the synthesized dyes. However, it is worth noting that a Co-based dye is more economical than N719 and also less toxic and more accessible than the N719 dye.

The amounts of dye loading on the TiO2 films were measured using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer. The sensitized electrodes were immersed in a 0.1 M NaOH solution in a mixed solvent of 1:1 DCM:ethanol, which resulted in the desorption of each dye. The dye loading amount was estimated using the formula: C = AV/εSo where C is the amount of dye loading, A is the optical absorbance of the dye, V is the volume of desorption solution, ε is the molar extinction coefficient, and So is the effective area of TiO2 films. Furthermore, FTIR spectral studies on all three sensitizers adsorbed over TiO2 films were performed (Fig. S1, ESI†). The adsorption of the sensitizers on the TiO2 thin film surface is very important for DSSC performance. Notably, three types of change in the FTIR spectra can be assigned to the adsorption of dyes on the surface of the TiO2 thin film surface: (1) a possible shift in the vibrational frequencies may occur, (2) the band intensities in the spectra may significantly change, and (3) the interaction between TiO2 and dyes may result in the generation of new bands.26c–f In the FTIR spectra of the three dye@TiO2 thin films, the (NCS2) band at 1141 cm−1 is shifted to 1126 cm−1. Moreover, the FTIR hump appearing below 800 cm−1 in the dye@TiO2 corresponds to the Ti–O bending and stretching which also demonstrates the characteristic bands of dithiocarbamate moieties of all three sensitizers.26c In Co-FcPy, the characteristic νCN band of the pyridine ring was observed at around 1528–1538 cm−1. On adsorption of the Co-FcPy@TiO2 surface, this band disappeared and a new strong band appeared at around 1590–1592 cm−1, which can be assigned to the pyridyl groups coordinated to the Lewis acid sites (Ti4+) on the TiO2 surface.26d Thus, the coordination of the dye with the surface of the titanium(IV) oxide could belong to both the interactions with the sulfur and with the nitrogen of the pyridyl ring in Co-FcPy. In the case of Co-FcEtOH@TiO2, the shifting of νO–H from 3370 cm−1 to 3332 cm−1 indicated the adsorption of this sensitizer from the –OH group. Apart from this, for all the three sensitizers adsorbed at TiO2, the absence of a band at ∼1624 cm−1 and the appearance of a new band at ∼1648–1650 cm−1 suggested the absence of Ti–OH in the FTIR spectra of dye@TiO2.
To confirm our findings of the FTIR spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for bare TiO2 and sensitizers adsorbed over TiO2 was performed (Fig. S2, ESI†). XPS is a highly surface-sensitive technique to distinguish between different chemical states of the same atom. In the deconvoluted XPS spectra for Ti2p (Fig. S3(e) (ESI†)), the splitting due to spin–orbit coupling was observed for dye-sensitized TiO2. In TiO2, the Ti2p peaks appearing at 457.97 eV and 463.52 eV are attributable to the Ti4+ 2p3/2 and Ti4+ 2p1/2 states, respectively. This suggests that the surface of TiO2 electrodes comprises titanium(IV) dioxide only but suboxides such as TiO, Ti2O3, etc. are not present.26b In the case of dye@TiO2, these Ti 2p peaks are shifted to slightly higher binding energies as compared to that of TiO2. The shift to higher binding energies could be due to a change in the surface dipole and/or a change in the Fermi level position in the band gap as a result of the bonding of the dye molecule with the TiO2 surface. In addition to the shift in binding energies, a decrease in the intensity of Ti 2p peaks was also observed, indicating the physio-chemical adsorption of dye ions on the TiO2 surface. Also, the O1s spectra can provide information about the bonding interaction and surface geometrical structure of the anchoring group. The O 1s XPS spectra of dye-sensitized TiO2 and bare TiO2 are presented in Fig. S3(f) (ESI†). For the O1s XPS spectra of dye-sensitized TiO2, there is a shift of 0.4 to 0.6 eV to a lower binding energy in comparison with the non-sensitised O1s TiO2 spectra. For bare TiO2, the bulk oxygen was found at 531.2 eV and surface Ti⋯OH groups were found at 533.7 eV. For dye-sensitised TiO2, the bulk oxygen was observed between 530.4 and 530.8 eV26g,h and the peak at 533.7 eV disappears corresponding to the Ti⋯OH. The shifting of peaks towards a lower binding energy and disappearance of the Ti⋯OH peaks in Co-FcBz and Co-FcPy sensitized TiO2 can be assigned to the involvement of the surface OH group along with interaction with the sulfur and nitrogen moiety of the dye with some van der Waals interactions whereas in the case of Co-FcEtOH, the –OH group of the dye interacts with –Ti and –O of TiO2.26i
Also, the trend of dye loading amount for the DSSC set-ups fabricated using these sensitizers (Table 3) follows the order Co-FcBz < Co-FcPy < Co-FcEtOH. Hence, better dye loading for Co-FcEtOH induces the best photovoltaic performance for this sensitizer and revealed that better anchorage and dye loading affect the photovoltaic performances of the sensitizers.
The current–potential density generated in the external circuit under monochromatic illumination of the cell, divided by the photon flux striking the cell, provides the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE). Fig. 9 shows the incident light intensity of the DSSCs fabricated using Co-based sensitizers at different wavelengths. For these sensitizers, the percentage IPCE values for Co-FcEtOH, Co-FcPy and Co-FcBz are 49%, 47% and 44%, respectively and the spectrum onset was up to about 750 nm. The IPCE action spectrum of the Co-based dye series-based DSSC showed a high plateau of up to 50% in the range of 400–450 nm. As mentioned above, Co-FcEtOH exhibited a better absorption spectrum on TiO2 than the other two dyes which may be contributing to the improved IPCE action spectra. The percentage IPCE graph shows that the response range of photocurrent is stable with the absorption spectrum of the respective dye signifying the sensitization of semiconductors by dyes.

Table 4 summarises the DSSC results of previously reported analogous cobalt-based sensitizers. The photovoltaic data presented herewith indicate that the performance of the sensitizers employed in the presented work is better than that of previously published analogous cobalt-based sensitizers. However, the cell performance of the sensitizers reported herein is lower than the state-of-the-art N719 dye, which may be attributed in part to the better spectrum responsiveness and photo-electron transfer. To achieve uplifted cell performance, sensitizers must exhibit an enhanced spectrum response, better anchoring over titanium dioxide semiconductors and an effective photo-electron transfer to the conduction band of the semiconductor.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
With the aid of kinetics studies, the electron transport properties and charge recombination procedures can be explained. For kinetic studies, the electrochemical impedance spectra were utilized to assess the charge transfer dynamics at different interfacial regions of the solid–liquid layers of the cell. The Nyquist plots were obtained for DSSCs sensitized by Co-based dyes measured under standard global AM 1.5 solar irradiation in the light and dark by applying their open circuit potential (OCP) over a frequency range of 10−2–105 Hz. In the Nyquist plot, the semicircle in the middle-frequency region is associated with the electron/charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.28–30 The Nyquist plots for DSSCs fabricated using Co-based dyes in the dark and light are shown in Fig. 10a and b. Under light conditions (Fig. 10b), the two semicircles located in the high and middle-frequency regions are accredited to the electrochemical response at the Pt/electrolyte interface and charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The large radius of the semicircle positioned in the middle-frequency region of the Nyquist plots decreases after sensitization with dyes and the decrease in the radius of the semicircle is in the order of Co-FcEtOH < Co-FcPy < Co-FcBz, which implies a decreasing trend of the charge transfer resistance (Rct) as well as an increase in the charge transfer rate at this interface after sensitization.31 Under dark conditions, as shown in Fig. 10a, the two semicircles of the Nyquist plots in the high and middle-frequency regions are attributed to the redox reaction at the Pt counter electrode and the electron transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. In the dark, the large semicircle of the middle-frequency region represents the resistance of the charge transfer from TiO2 to the electrolyte (back recombination resistance Rrec). The radius of the semicircle observed in the middle-frequency range lies in the order of Co-FcEtOH > Co-FcPy > Co-FcBz, indicating the sequence of Rrec at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, which implies the retardation of the charge recombination between injected electrons and the I3− ions in the electrolyte, with a consequent increase in Voc. The EIS study under light and dark conditions confirms that the charge transfer rate increases whereas the charge transfer resistance and the charge recombination rate decrease after sensitization by Co-based dyes under light, which is favorable for enhancing the performance of DSSCs.31

Long-term stability
Further to test the photovoltaic stability and robustness of the DSSC set-up fabricated using the best-performing sensitizer, Co-FcEtOH ageing experiments for 100 h were performed. For the durability study, the photovoltaic parameters (current–potential curve) were determined intermittently over 100 h under 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 11). The data obtained after 100 h of operation of the cell suggested that the cell retained about 97% of its initial conversion efficiency even after 100 h, which indicates its good stability.

Also, in order to assess the electron injection mechanism density of states (DOS) plots for (TiO2)30 all three sensitizers and sensitizers + (TiO2)30 were computed. The DOS of all three sensitizers when compared to the DOS of (TiO2)30 exhibited discrete localized states which are occupied (Fig. 12). Also, the DOS plot for the bare (TiO2)30 cluster displays a clearly separated valence band and conduction band. The fundamental TiO2 valence band is located between −10.0 eV and −8.2 eV, and the conduction band is located starting from −4.2 eV. Furthermore, the DOS plots for sensitizer + (TiO2)30 clearly indicate that the adsorption of cobalt-based sensitizers over the (TiO2)30 surface introduces occupied states at the lower part of the nanoparticle band gap and extends the valence states from around −8.0 eV to −5.5 eV. Hence, after the adsorption of sensitizers over the nanocluster, lower energy electrons are excited from the VB energy levels approximately between −8.0 and −5.5 eV which then can be transferred to the CB states of the nanocluster above −4.2 eV. The results revealed significant electronic coupling between the LUMO of sensitizers and the conduction band of TiO2. Also, as apparent from the DOS of (TiO2)30 + Co-FcEtOH, the sensitizer decreases the band gap slightly better than Co-FcBz and Co-FcPy which along with the better dye loading parameter is responsible for its better DSSC performance.

Conclusions
In the presented work, three heteroleptic dppe Co(III) ferrocene appended dithiocarbamate complexes with different R-groups have been synthesized and characterized. The weak interactions existing in the solid-state framework of the two complexes comprising –CH2C6H5 and –CH2CH2OH pendants have been addressed with the help of Hirshfeld surface analysis. These compounds when employed as photo-sensitizers in DSSCs exhibited reasonable photovoltaic performances and amongst all three sensitizer-based DSSC set-ups, the assembly fabricated using the sensitizer possessing –CH2CH2OH exhibited the best photovoltaic performance and also the ageing experiment for the DSSC set-up fabricated using this sensitizer showed 97% retention of photovoltaic performance after a time span of 100 h. The observed differences in the photovoltaic performances of these sensitizers were ascribed to the variation in the dye-loading parameter as well as better electron coupling in the best-performing sensitizer. The entire investigation suggests that such a class of molecular systems can be used as apt sensitizers for DSSC fabrication.
Materials and methods
General considerations
All the synthetic processes were performed under an oxygen-free dinitrogen atmosphere. All the solvents used for the syntheses were dried and distilled prior to use. Ferrocenecarboxaldehyde, ethanol amine, benzylamine and picolylamine were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification. The precursor [CodppeCl2] was synthesised by adapting a previously developed method. Microanalyses for the three compounds were performed on a PerkinElmer 240 C, H, N analyzer. A Shimadzu IRAffinity-1S spectrometer was used to perform the FTIR spectral studies of prepared complexes using the KBr pellet method. 1H, 13C and 31P NMR spectroscopy was performed using a Bruker Avance IIIHD spectrometer. Chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (ppm) using TMS as an internal standard for 1H and 13C NMR, while for 31P NMR, 85% phosphoric acid was used. The electronic absorption spectra in dichloromethane solutions were recorded using a SPECORD 210 PLUS BU spectrophotometer. XPS measurements were performed using a PHI 5000 Versaprobe-II ULVAC-PHI INC instrument with monochromatized Mg-Kα radiation (E = 1253.6 eV).
Syntheses

Synthesis of ligands [KS2CN(FcCH2)CH2R′ (R′ = CH2OH, C6H5, C5H4N)]. 
To the ethanolic solution of ferrocenecarboxaldehyde, ethanolamine/benzylamine/picolylamine was added and refluxed for 6 h under nitrogen at 95 °C. The resulting solution was rotatory evaporated and dissolved again in methanol, and NaBH4 was added for the reduction of imine. The reaction mixture was further stirred for 24 h on an ice bath. On the next day, after evaporation of the solvent, a secondary amine was extracted into dichloromethane and washed with water. Then, the organic layer was dried on anhydrous sodium sulphate and filtered. The solvent was again evaporated and the secondary amine was redissolved in a THF:acetonitrile (1:1) mixture. Then, the reaction mixture and carbon disulfide in THF solution were treated dropwise with KOH and dissolved in water, leading to a yellow solution. The reaction mixture was stirred for 3 h and then evaporated to obtain a solid yellow product. The product was washed twice with diethyl ether.

X-Ray crystallography
Crystals suitable for SCXRD have been obtained through re-crystallisation from methanol. The intensity data were collected at 150(2) K for Co-FcEtOH on a Rigaku Xcalibur, EosS2 single crystal diffractometer using graphite monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) and for Co-FcBz on a Rigaku SuperNova Dual EosS2 single crystal diffractometer using monochromated Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54184 Å). Unit cell determination, data collection, data reduction and empirical absorption correction were performed using the CrysAlisPro software.32 The structures were resolved with SHELXT33 and refined using a full-matrix least-squares procedure based on F2 (SHELXL-2018/3).33 All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms were placed onto calculated positions and refined using a riding model.

Fabrication of DSSCs
For the fabrication of DSSCs, FTO (F-doped SnO2: purchased from Pilkington. Co. Ltd, 8 Ω/γ) glass plates were cleaned in ethanol using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. FTO was used to prepare both the photo- and counter-electrodes. TiO2 thin films were prepared using commercialized TiO2 paste (Ti-Nanoxide T, Solaronix) using the doctor-blade technique onto the FTO substrate followed by calcination at 450 °C for 30 min. The sensitized and co-sensitized photoelectrodes were prepared by immersing the thin nanoporous TiO2 film (∼6 μm) into a 1:1 dichloromethane:ethanol solution of Co-FcEtOH, Co-FcBz, Co-FcPy for 6 h and then washing with dichloromethane followed by ethanol and drying at room temperature. The Pt-counter-electrodes were prepared by screen printing the Pt catalyst (Solaronix) on FTO and then sintered at 400 °C for 30 min. The dye-anchored TiO2 photoelectrodes and Pt counter-electrodes were assembled into a face-to-face sandwich type assembly which is sealed from three sides using a hot-melt sealant film (Solaronix) as a spacer between the electrodes by heating at 80 °C. A drop of electrolytic solution (0.05 M iodine, 0.05 M LiI and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile) was placed on the open side of the cell assembly which was driven inside the cell by capillary action and then the open side was closed using Araldite followed by copper connection on both the electrodes with the help of silver paste and Araldite.
Characterization of DSSCs
The photoelectrochemical performance characteristics (short circuit current Jsc (mA cm−2), open-circuit voltage Voc (V), fill factor ff and overall conversion efficiency η) were measured under illumination with a 1000 W xenon lamp (Oriel 91193) using a Keithley Model 2400. The light intensity was confirmed to be homogeneous over an 8 × 8 in2 area by calibration with a Si solar cell for 1 sunlight intensity (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). An accidental increase in the temperature inside the cell was prevented by using a cooler with a propeller. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the dyes was measured as a function of wavelength from 400–700 nm (PV Measurement Inc.) using a standard tungsten-halogen lamp as the monochromatic light and a broadband bias light for approximating 1 sunlight intensity.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on a CH 660C electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments, Shanghai, China) in a two-electrode configuration. The photoanode was used as the working electrode and the Pt electrode was used as the counter electrode. The electron transport properties were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with a 10 mV alternative signal in the frequency range of 10−2–105 Hz. The UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a Chenhua CHI760E model Electrochemical Workstation (Shanghai). The amounts of dye loading on the TiO2 films were measured using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer. The absorbed amount of dyes on the TiO2 surface was measured by desorbing the dye from the dye-sensitized TiO2 films in a 0.1 M NaOH solution of water and ethanol (1:1 for N719) and DCM:DMSO (1:1, co-sensitizers). The dye loading amount can be estimated using the following formula:C = AV/εSowhere C is the amount of dye loading, A is the optical absorbance of the dye, V is the volume of desorption solution, ε is the molar extinction coefficient, and So is the effective area of TiO2 films.
Computational details
To ascertain the structure and electronic nature of all three sensitizers, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. The molecular geometries of all three sensitizers were optimized using the B3LYP exchange–correlation functional.34 The MDF10 basis set for Fe and Co and the 6-31G** basis set for other atomic centers were employed to execute geometry optimization. These optimized structures were used for the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations for the first 30 vertical excitations and were executed using the CAM-B3LYP functional and polarised continuum model (PCM) having solvent parameters of dichloromethane. The TiO2 cluster, (TiO2)30 + Co-FcBz/Co-FcPy/Co-FcEtOH, was optimized using the 3-21G* basis set and the initial geometry was taken from the relaxed geometry of the (TiO2)30 cluster and dyes. All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 program.35
Hirshfeld surface analyses
