    , Accepted 24th April 2017First published on 25th April 2017AbstractWe synthesized two types of novel poly(3-alkylthiophene)-free (D)n-b-(A)m conjugated block copolymers: PTQI-block-PNDISs. PTQI-b-PNDIS is the fully conjugated block copolymer, in which the donor block is connected to the acceptor block via a π-conjugated unit. In addition, the donor block was connected to an acceptor block through a non-conjugated alkylene spacer, yielding PTQI-b-PNDISL, which is a partially conjugated block copolymer. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) was 1.54% with an open-circuit voltage of 0.79 V in the single-component polymer solar cell (PSC) based on PTQI-b-PNDISL, better performance than that of the PSC containing PTQI-b-PNDIS (PCE ∼ 0.36%). These results reveal the potential for improving the photovoltaic performance in PSCs by controlling the internal morphology with exploitation of the self-segregating behavior of p- and n-blocks in the film state.
1. Introduction
Recently, polymer/polymer blend systems have been intensely studied as the active layers in polymer solar cell (PSC) devices.1–3 In particular, there have been remarkable developments in all organic PSCs using donor–acceptor (D–A)-type conjugated polymers, which have advantages over fullerene-based devices, such as more efficient light absorption, easy tuning of electronic energy levels, and relatively high open circuit voltages (Voc).4–6 An important factor to achieve high efficiency in PSC devices is the nanophase separation between the p- and n-type conjugated materials, which facilitates exciton diffusion, dissociation, and charge carrier transport.7–9 Thus, a number of studies are underway to control phase separation to some extent, either by adding a solvent additive or by a specific annealing process.10–13 In addition to blend films with two electronically distinct materials, conjugated block copolymers (CBPs) bearing donor and acceptor blocks are candidates for limiting the size of the individual crystalline domains that typically appear in the blend matrix through intrinsic phase separation.14–16
Block copolymers preferentially form a nanoscale morphology because of the composition-dependent interaction between the identical blocks.17–19 Because the nanophase separation of the (D)n-b-(A)m CBP can be controlled by the block size and degree of compatibility of the two blocks, the morphology of the CBP can be varied significantly depending on the structures and characters of the two different blocks.20–22 The self-assembled domains of donor and acceptor blocks with an appropriate size in CBPs suggest that these materials are appropriate for exciton diffusion and charge separation, which are essential factors for PSC applications. Furthermore, the well-formed phase separated morphology observed in (D)n-b-(A)m CBPs was found to form a possible p–n junction at the interface between the donor- and acceptor-blocks, which is suitable for use as the photoactive layer of PSC.23,24 Basically, if the p-block and n-block domains are assembled individually in a single polymer film, two different charge transport pathways are formed, suggesting their application in single-component (SC)-PSCs.
Recently, some research groups have synthesized (D)n-b-(A)m CBPs and applied these to PSC devices.25–28 Nakabayashi et al. reported that the fully conjugated block copolymer composed of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and poly(naphthalene bisimide) segments (i.e., P3HT-PNBI-P3HT). All-polymer solar cells using the P3HT:P3HT-PNBI-P3HT blend films have achieved PCEs of 1.28% using a thermally annealed active film layer.29 Verduzco et al. synthesized poly(3-hexylthiophene)-block-poly((9,9-dioctylfluorene)-2,7-diyl-alt-[4,7-bis(thiophenee-5-yl)-2,1,3-benzothioadiazole]-2′,2′′-diyl) (P3HT-b-PFTBT), which was used as the active layer of a SC-PSC device. Intriguingly, a PCE of 3% was obtained from the PSC using P3HT-b-PFTBT without the need for fullerene derivatives or any additional acceptor molecules.30 The PSC performance progress with single active component using block copolymers are summarized in Table S1.†
Most (D)n-b-(A)m CBPs for PSC are dependent on P3HT units as electron donors. Therefore, CBPs have been limited to matching the appropriate absorption spectra and energy levels with various n-type conjugated blocks for high-efficiency SC-PSCs. Furthermore, (D)n-b-(A)m CBPs for PSCs have been used as additives in p-/n-type blend active layers to control the compatibility of p-type and n-type polymeric materials.31–33 The reason for the lack of research into CBPs is that their synthesis is not facile and their purification is challenging.34
We designed two new poly(3-alkylthiophene)-free (D)n-b-(A)m CBPs composed of quinoxaline-thiophene (PTQI) and naphthalene dicarboximide-selenophene (PNDIS) blocks. PTQI-b-PNDIS is the CBP containing donor blocks connected to acceptor blocks through π-conjugation. In contrast, the donor block was anchored to the acceptor block through a non-conjugated alkylene spacer in PTQI-b-PNDISL (Fig. 1). A well-defined fine morphology with nanosized-crystallite domains was observed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the PTQI-b-PNDISL films after thermal annealing (Tannealing = 200 °C). A SC-PSC based on PTQI-b-PNDISL exhibited a PCE of 1.54% with a Voc of 0.79 V, significantly better performance than that of the PSC based on PTQI-b-PNDIS (PCEmax ∼0.36%). These results unambiguously demonstrated that the (D)n-b-(A)m CBP with donor and acceptor blocks connected through non-conjugated alkylene spacers allow the two electronically distinct blocks to crystallize independently.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
As shown in Fig. 1, we successfully synthesized two (D)n-b-(A)m CBPs (i.e., PTQI-b-PNDIS and PTQI-b-PNDISL) without using 3-alkylthiophene. The main difference of the polymer structure is the connection mode between the p- and n-blocks along the polymer chain. PTQI-b-PNDIS was prepared with two conjugated polymeric blocks, PTQI and PNDIS (Scheme S1†). PTQI and PNDIS were used as the p-block and n-block, (P1 and P2), respectively, and condensed by reaction of the bromine and single trimethyl tin end groups using the Stille coupling reaction. Meanwhile, PTQI-b-PNDISL consists of two conjugated polymers, PTQI and PNDIS, connected through a non-conjugated alkylene spacer (Scheme S2†). First, PTQI and PNDIS were prepared using the Stille coupling polymerization reaction. Next, PNDIS with 1,6-diphenoxyhexane end groups was prepared by reacting an excess 1,6-bis(4-bromophenoxy)hexane with PNDIS, as prepared above. Finally, PTQI-b-PNDISL was obtained by polymerizing P3 and P5 via Stille cross-coupling reaction. The final products were purified through successive Soxhlet extractions with methanol, acetone, and hexane.
Before characterizing the various properties of the two CBPs, we carried out GPC and NMR measurements to define the structure and the composition of the p- and n-blocks. The molecular weights (MWs) and polydispersity indices (PDIs) of PTQI-b-PNDIS, P1, P2, and PTQI-b-PNDISL, as well as those of P3 and P5, were determined through a GPC with o-dichlorobenzene as the eluent and calibrated against polystyrene standards (Fig. 2a and b). The number average molecular weights (Mn) of PTQI-b-PNDIS and PTQI-b-PNDISL were 11.9 and 12.4 kg mol−1, with PDIs 2.22 and 2.12, respectively. From the GPC analysis results, we confirmed that both CBPs have increased molecular weights as compared to those of homopolymers and predicted that p-/n-blocks are combined in a 1:1 ratio. The 1:1 ratio of p- and n-blocks is ascribed to the fact that the major components of P2 and P3 are functionalized with trimethyl tin only at one chain end. The MW and PDI values of two CBPs and each homopolymer block are summarized in Table S2.† GPC analysis showed that the CBPs migrate with shorter retention times, indicating that the CBPs were well polymerized. But in the high retention region of the CBPs, there was some overlap with the homopolymer region. This overlap arises because the blocks have a broad PDI because they were prepared by condensation polymerization. The structures of two CBPs and homopolymer blocks were confirmed by 1H-NMR analysis. The presence of both p- and n-blocks in the PTQI-b-PNDISL was confirmed by integrating the peaks for P3 (i.e., 7.84–8.27, 6.96, and 6.84 ppm of the aromatic ring of the quinoxaline monomer; 3.70 ppm of the alkyl groups) and for P5 (i.e., 8.79–9.00 ppm of the aromatic ring of the naphthalene monomer; 4.16 and 2.03 ppm of the alkyl groups) (Fig. S4 and S6†). Furthermore, the presence of the reactive end groups at one side of P3 was determined through the peak corresponding to the methyl proton in the trimethyl tin moiety (i.e., 0.46 ppm, 9H). The results of 1H-NMR analysis of PTQI-b-PNDIS are also similar to those of PTQI-b-PNDISL, except for the peaks arising from the 1,6-diphenoxyhexane of PTQI-b-PNDISL (i.e., 6.93, and 6.37 ppm of the aromatic ring, 4.03 and 3.96 ppm of the alkyl groups of 1,6-diphenoxyhexane).

2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
As shown in Fig. 2c, the absorption spectra of the CBPs in chloroform and as films are almost identical and contain two characteristic bands. The absorption spectra of the PTQI-b-PNDIS and PTQI-b-PNDISL solutions correspond to the sum of the individual absorption spectra of the p-/n-blocks. The bands in the thin film spectra were significantly red-shifted compared to solution spectra, which is commonly observed in the spectra of D–A conjugated polymers, indicating the presence of typical intermolecular interactions in the film state. The related spectral data are summarized in Table S3.† Electrochemical analyses using cyclic voltammetry (CV) were carried out to estimate the orbital energy levels (Fig. S10†). The onset potentials of oxidation are determined to be 0.73 and 0.70 V for PTQI-b-PNDIS and PTQI-b-PNDISL, respectively, yielding highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of −5.53 eV and −5.50 eV, respectively. The corresponding lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) calculated from the optical bandgap were estimated to be very similar (i.e., −3.89 eV and −3.90 eV) for both PTQI-b-PNDIS and PTQI-b-PNDISL, respectively.
2.3. Morphological properties
AFM images of the CBP films and blend films of P1 and P2 were taken to study their surface morphologies. The AFM phase images of the films are presented in Fig. 3. The as-cast blend films of P1 and P2 show larger domain sizes on the film surface compared to the CBP film surfaces. In particular, we confirmed that the roughness increased and the domain size significantly increased in the blend film after annealing at 200 °C for 30 min. In contrast, the PTQI-b-PNDIS film displayed a uniform and smooth surface morphology, even after thermal annealing, because of nanophase separation between the p- and n-blocks in the polymer chain. This indicates that PTQI-b-PNDIS exhibits typical surface morphology characteristics of CBPs. It could be expected that the crystallization of the p-block is affected by the presence of the covalently bonded n-block, and vice versa.

In addition, the PTQI-b-PNDISL film morphology after annealing is similar to that of PTQI-b-PNDIS but exhibits a more prominent nanophase separation behavior. The inherent morphology characteristics of individual blocks in PTQI-b-PNDISL are clearer because the p- and n-blocks are connected by alkylene spacers, which increase the degrees of conformational freedom of the p- or n-blocks along the polymer chains compared to PTQI-b-PNDIS. The roughness of the PTQI-b-PNDISL film after annealing is slightly larger than that of PTQI-b-PNDIS, as shown Fig. S12.† This indicates that the crystallites are larger than those of PTQI-b-PNDIS; this difference arises because the two different blocks in PTQI-b-PNDISL are connected by a flexible spacer, and the different components exhibit independent crystallization behaviors.
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) experiments were conducted on the films made of P1, P2, a blend of P1 and P2, PTQI-b-PNDIS, and PTQI-b-PNDISL to investigate their molecular packing and polymer chain arrangement on the substrate. All films used in this study were annealed at 200 °C for 10 min. The GIWAXS patterns of the P1 film (i.e., PTQI film) showed clearly visible first order reflections assigned to the crystallographic (100) plane in the out-of-plane profile (Fig. 4). In contrast, the P2 film displayed fourth-order reflection peaks, which implies a higher degree of crystallization and order of the polymer chains in the P2 film than in the P1 film. Surprisingly, the (100) diffraction peak of the PTQI-b-PNDIS film was observed at very similar qz to that of the P2 film (i.e., d(100) spacing of PTQI-b-PNDIS = 22.18 Å). Possibly, the PNDIS block, which is very crystalline, hampered the crystallization of the PTQI block, suggesting that the crystallization of the PTQI block might be controlled by the PNDIS block; that is, the efficient co-crystallization of two different blocks was difficult in the PTQI-b-PNDIS. In addition, the diffraction peaks of the PTQI-b-PNDISL film were also observed to be similar to those of the PTQI-b-PNDIS film; however, the peak positions were shifted slightly to smaller qz values. In this case, the crystallization of PNDIS block displayed less influence on the crystallization of the PTQI block because of the long alkylene spacer between the two different blocks in PTQI-b-PNDISL. Therefore, the PTQI and PNDIS blocks in PTQI-b-PNDISL behave more independently, providing more degrees of freedom for their individual crystallization. The expected schematic packing diagrams of a blend of P1 and P2, PTQI-b-PNDIS, and PTQI-b-PNDISL are shown in Fig. 4c and S15.† These results suggest that hole and electron transport channels through different separated domains could be generated in the film state.

2.4. Photovoltaic properties
Consequently, we anticipated the photovoltaic properties in a diode device configuration for an SC-PSC. Thus, a series of PSCs with different photoactive layer were prepared in an inverted device configuration: ITO/ZnO/blend of P1 and P2, PTQI-b-PNDIS or PTQI-b-PNDISL/MoO3/Ag. As shown in Fig. 5a, the PSC made with the blend film of P1 and P2 and SC-PSCs using the PTQI-b-PNDISL exhibit drastically different device performances. The PSC with the blend film (e.g., P1:P2 (1:1 wt ratio)) had a maximum PCE (PCEmax) of 0.40% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 1.61 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.67 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 37.4%. This might be a shortcoming of PSCs containing low MW polymer blend films; that is, when blending the p- and n-type polymers, their independent crystallization behaviors are not restricted, giving rise to relatively large crystallites domains without proper nanophase separation. This is a significant factor that retards the exciton diffusion and causes poor charge separation/collection efficiency at the interface between the p- and n-type blocks. The poor nanophase separation is also supported by the roughness and large domain sizes observed in the AFM image of the blend film (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the devices containing PTQI-b-PNDIS or PTQI-b-PNDISL as the active layer displayed very different photovoltaic performances. In particular, the PTQI-b-PNDISL device showed a better performance, with a PCEmax of 1.54% (a Jsc of 4.04 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.79 V, and a FF of 48.1). The Voc was found to be identical to that of PTQI-b-PNDIS, as we expected. The other performance data were found to be very different from those of the PTQI-b-PNDIS (a PCEmax of 0.36% with a Jsc of 1.30 mA cm−2, and a FF of 35.0).

Compared to the device with PTQI-b-PNDIS, the enhancement of Jsc in the device with PTQI-b-PNDISL was confirmed by external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements (Fig. 5b). A high EQE of greater than 25% was measured in a wavelength range from 370 to 620 nm for the PSC. The wavelength range at which the high EQE values were observed is consistent with the absorption range of PTQI-b-PNDISL. Besides the high Jsc in the device containing PTQI-b-PNDISL, the high FF is the primary reason why the corresponding PSC exhibited the best PCE value. The improvement of FF in the PTQI-b-PNDISL-containing device is supported by the relationship between the light intensity and Jsc (Jsc ∝ Pα, where P is the light intensity and α is the exponential factor, Fig. S16†).35 The PSC based on PTQI-b-PNDISL displayed a high α value of 0.94, which is greater than those of the other devices with the P1/P2 blend film and PTQI-b-PNDIS having α values of 0.90 and 0.89, respectively.
This result suggests that bimolecular charge recombination was restricted in the PSCs containing PTQI-b-PNDISL compared to the other PSCs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and AFM images also supported the differences in Jsc and FF values among the P1 and P2 blend film, and PTQI-b-PNDIS and PTQI-b-PNDISL films (Fig. S17 and S18†). The internal morphology of the PTQI-b-PNDISL film was the most finely resolved with a uniform nanoscale dispersive structure. These results revealed that the charge carrier collection could be efficiently performed because PTQI-b-PNDISL has an appropriate domain size for facile exciton diffusion.
3. Conclusion
Our method of preparing (D)n-b-(A)m CBP through the condensation polymerization of the p- and n-type blocks has the advantage of easily introducing various well-defined conjugated blocks. Owing to the desired nanophase separated domains and formation of charge transporting channels, PTQI-b-PNDIS and PTQI-b-PNDISL displayed inherent photovoltaic performance in inverted solar cell devices. The results of this study propose the potential for steering the performance of PSCs by controlling connection mode of the p- and n-blocks embedded in the PTQI-b-PNDISL films. The new block copolymers prepared without using the poly(3-alkylthiophene) moiety described in this work are intriguing candidates for use in SC-PSCs.

4.3. Fabrication of inverted polymer solar cell
The devices were fabricated using a solution process and had an inverted structure: glass/ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The electron-collecting electrode was a 150 nm-thick indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass with a resistance of 15.0 Ω cm−2. The ITO glass was cleaned in acetone, deionized water, and isopropyl alcohol by sonification for 10 min in each solvent. Finally, the cleaned ITO coated glass was dried in a vacuum oven for 1 h at 120 °C. Next, the cleaned ITO coated glass was UV-ozone treated for 20 min. A 40 nm ZnO layer was coated on the ITO glass by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 40 s. After drying at 170 °C for 1 h, the substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The polymers were dissolved in the anhydrous chloroform with 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) 3 vol% over 12 h. The resulting solution was then spin-coated onto the ZnO layer and thermal annealed at 80 °C for 10 m. The resulting photoactive layer was ∼80 nm thick. Finally, a 10 nm layer of MoO3 and 100 nm layer of Ag were deposited onto the photoactive layer using a thermal evaporator to produce a 0.04 cm2 active area through shadow masks. The current–voltage characteristics were measured with a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit. A 300 W Xe lamp was used as a light source to obtain an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. To mimic sunlight, an AM 1.5 filter (Oriel) and a neutral density filter were used to reduce the intensity when necessary. The power of the incoming light was measured with a calibrated broadband optical power meter (Spectra-Physics model 404). The EQE spectra were determined by using a certified EQE instrument (McScience Inc., EQX 3100).
