    , Accepted 31st March 2020First published on 2nd April 2020AbstractCharge density modulation on a thieno[2′′,3′′:5′,6′]-s-indaceno[2′,1′:4,5]dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (IPT) core has been conducted for a systematic study of its impact on the electronic structure, molecular packing and photovoltaic performance of asymmetric fused-ring acceptors (FRAs). Herein, a series of IPT-based FRAs (i.e.IN-4F, INO-4F, IPT-4F and IPCl-4F) are designed by incorporating 2-ethylhexyl, 2-ethylhexyloxy, hydrogen and chloro side chains, respectively, onto the IPT core. Enhancing the electron-withdrawing ability of the side-chains decreases the optical bandgap but lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level, which yields a trade-off between JSC and VOC in organic solar cells (OSCs). Furthermore, the FRAs exhibit tunable miscibility and crystallinity, reflected in the FF and JSC values of the OSCs. By pairing with polymer donor PM6, IPT-4F based devices achieve the highest PCE of 14.62% with a balanced VOC of 0.88 V and JSC of 22.15 mA cm−2 and a high FF of 75.01%. Our research demonstrates that electronic density modulation on asymmetric FRAs is an effective way to systematically optimize the device parameters in pursuit of high performance OSCs.
1. Introduction
Since the beginning of the 21st century, the development of organic solar cells (OSCs) has stepped into a fast lane.1–5 Technology accumulation on OSCs, such as the development of new photovoltaic materials,2,3,6 device fabrication techniques5,7–12 and interface engineering,13–16 enables their power conversion efficiency (PCE) to be steadily improved. Non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have already drawn great attention owing to the advantages of easily-tailorable absorption and frontier energy levels.17–21 Among the NFAs, fused-ring acceptors (FRAs) with an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) backbone architecture bring OSCs into a new era.22–24 Encouragingly, the highest PCEs for FRA based OSCs have exceeded 16%.13,25–27
Side-chain engineering, as one of the most commonly used strategies, plays an important role in developing FRAs. The effects of side-chains on intermolecular interaction, crystallinity and photovoltaic performance were systematically explored in different A–D–A systems. Systematic investigations on side-chains from different aspects (including symmetry,28 length,29,30 substituted position31 and side-chain type32) have facilitated the understanding on the correlation between structure and OSC performance. On the other hand, A–(D1–D–D2)–A type asymmetric FRAs33–35 derived from A–D–A type FRAs show great potential for realizing high performance OSCs. For example, a series of 5,5,10,10-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4-octyl-5,10-dihydro-4H-thieno[2′′,3′′:5′,6′]-s-indaceno[2′,1′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]thieno[2,3-d]pyrrole (IPT) cored asymmetric FRAs with an A–(D1–D–D2)–A type structure was developed by our group.35 The frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energies and molecular packing can be precisely regulated by adjusting the conformation and the electron donating ability of the fused cores. As a result, when coupled with wide band gap donor PBDB-T, an IPT-2F based device shows a high PCE of over 14%. Moreover, the PCEs of IPT based devices were further promoted by controlling aggregation via halogenation on end-capped groups, and the corresponding PM6/IPT-4F based device achieves a high PCE of ∼15%.36 However, it should be mentioned that systematic research is mainly limited to the design of novel asymmetric cores by screening various combinations of donating units such as dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP), thiophene, selenophene, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene, and dithieno[3,2-b;2′,3′-d]thiophene.33–38 Studies on the effect of side-chains in asymmetric FRAs remain scant and thus deserve more further investigation.
In this study, we systematically investigated the impact of side-chains on the physicochemical properties, crystallinity, miscibility, and photovoltaic performance of a series of IPT-based FRAs. FRAs (IN-4F, INO-4F, and IPCl-4F) were synthesized based on the same molecular skeleton IPT-4F by introducing 2-ethylhexyl, 2-ethylhexyloxy, and chloro onto the IPT core, respectively, where the electron-withdrawing abilities of the side-chains were gradually enhanced (Fig. 1a). Redshifted absorption and down-shifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels could be seen to accompany with the enhancement of the electron-withdrawing ability. Hence, the trade-off between the short-circuit current (JSC) and open circuit voltage (VOC) was systematically modulated from the perspective of side-chain engineering. Furthermore, their crystallinity and miscibility could also be adjusted, due to the differences in terms of the spatial effects and amphipathic properties of the side-chains. Ultimately, when selecting PM6 with matched energy levels as a polymer donor to fabricate OSC devices, both INO-4F and IN-4F based OSCs showed high VOCs of 0.93 V and 0.92 V with a relatively low JSC of ca. 20 mA cm−2, whereas IPT-4F and IPCl-4F based devices achieved high JSCs over 21 mA cm−2 but low VOCs. As a result, the IPT-4F based devices exhibited the highest PCE of 14.56% with a balanced JSC of 22.39 mA cm−2 and VOC of 0.88 V, which is one of the record PCEs for asymmetric FRA based OSCs.

2. Results and discussion
Four FRAs were synthesized by referring to our previous work.35 The synthetic route is shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†). Aldehyde intermediates INO-CHO, IN-CHO, IPT-CHO, and IPCl-CHO were synthesized by using 3-substituted thiophene derivatives (i.e. 2-ethylhexyl, 2-ethylhexyloxy, and chloro). And the targeted products were obtained by Knoevenagel condensation between (2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene))malononitrile with the aldehyde intermediates in good yields over 75%. The NFAs were fully characterized with 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectroscopy (Fig. S1–S12, ESI†). The products exhibited good solubility in common solvents, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, chlorobenzene and tetrahydrofuran. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in a N2 atmosphere was employed to investigate the thermal stability of these FRAs (Fig. S13, ESI†). The decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) was observed to be 311 °C for INO-4F, 329 °C for IN-4F, 339 °C for IPT-4F, and 261 °C for IPCl-4F, indicating good thermal stability of these FRAs.
The electronic effects of substituents (e.g. induced effects, conjugation effects, and hyper-conjugation effects) can effectively affect the electron-donating and electron-withdrawing abilities of the substituents, and thus have an impact on the FMO energies and absorption of IPT-based acceptors. The Hammett substituent constants (σ) are applied in quantifying these electronic effects. The σ values of 2-ethylhexyloxy and 2-ethylhexyl can be approximated as the σ values of 2-methoxy (−0.27) and methyl (−0.17), respectively, by ignoring the weak effect of alkyl chain length. The σ values of hydrogen and chloro are 0 and 0.23. All the σ values are taken from a report by the Hansch group.39 As seen from the σ values of the substituents, the electron-withdrawing ability is gradually enhanced from 2-ethylhexyloxy to 2-ethylhexyl, hydrogen, then chloro. In addition, oxygen and chlorine can generate non-covalent inter-molecular interactions (e.g., Cl⋯H, Cl⋯S, O⋯H, O⋯S), which have an impact on molecular packing and thus film morphology.
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra in both chloroform solutions (Fig. S14, ESI†) and thin films (Fig. 1c) were recorded to investigate the optical absorption properties of these FRAs. In both dilute solutions and thin films, with the enhancement of the electron-withdrawing ability of the side-chain group, the acceptors exhibited gradually red-shifted absorption onsets due to the enhanced intramolecular electron push–pull effects. In solutions, the four FRAs exhibited strong absorption in the 650–800 nm region with a maximum peak (λmax) at 735 nm for INO-4F, 747 nm for IN-4F, 745 nm for IPT-4F, and 744 nm for IPCl-4F (Table 1). Furthermore, the maximum molar absorption coefficient is calculated as 3.00 × 105, 2.77 × 105, 2.48 × 105 and 3.24 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for INO-4F, IN-4F, IPT-4F and IPCl-4F, respectively. The enhanced maximum molar absorption coefficients of IN-4F, INO-4F and IPCl-4F compared with that of IPT-4F are mainly induced by enhanced conjugation (hyper-conjugation effect for IN-4F and p–π conjugation for INO-4F and IPCl-4F). The absorption onset (λonset) values of the FRA films are 848, 857, 884 and 893 nm for INO-4F, IN-4F, IPT-4F and IPCl-4F, respectively. Correspondingly, the Eoptg (= 1240/λonset eV) values are calculated to be 1.46, 1.45, 1.41 and 1.39 eV for INO-4F, IN-4F, IPT-4F and IPCl-4F (Table 1), respectively. The results indicate that the Eoptg and optical absorption spectra can be effectively tuned by attentively adjusting the electron-withdrawing abilities of the side-chains. It also provides a useful strategy for realizing adjustable absorption in most asymmetric FRA series for the fabrication of specific devices (e.g. ternary devices25,40–42 and tandem devices43,44). Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were employed to investigate the electrochemical properties of the FRAs. The HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO energy levels are calculated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, which are calibrated by ferrocene/ferrocenium. The measured EHOMO/ELUMO value is −5.64 eV/−3.93 eV for INO-4F, −5.59 eV/−3.94 eV for IN-4F, −5.56 eV/−4.05 eV for IPT-4F, and −5.60 eV/−4.08 eV for IPCl-4F (Fig. 1b and Table 1). The IPT-based FRAs’ LUMO energies monotonically decrease with the enhancement of the electron-withdrawing effect of the side-chains.

Quantum chemical calculations were employed to further understand the molecular structure and electron characteristics of the FRAs. The molecular structures with simplified alkyl side-chains were optimized by using density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) basis set, and the calculations were performed using Gaussian 09. As shown in Fig. 2, all FRAs show a flat π-conjugated skeleton. The dipole moment was estimated as 1.43, 1.71, 2.18 and 2.02 Debye for IN-4F, INO-4F, IPT-4F, and IPCl-4F, respectively. The dipole moments were all reduced when the H atom in IPT-4F was replaced. This may be explained by the weakened intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect with the substitution. The electron-donating abilities of methyl and methoxyl (which originated from hyper-conjugation effects and p–π conjugation effects) are able to balance the electric charge between the two ends of an asymmetric fused-ring core. The large electronegativity of oxygen, however, endows INO-4F with a larger dipole moment compared with IN-4F. For IPCl-4F, the p–π conjugation of the Cl atom is also in competition with the electronegativity of Cl. To quantify the extent of charge separation, the ICT process based on the charge density difference (CDD) between the ground state and the first excited state (S1) was analyzed. The electronic excitations for the FRAs at the optimized ground state geometries were calculated using the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) method with the cam-B3LYP/6-31G(d) basis set by iteratively solving 5 excitations. The ICT properties were analyzed by using Multiwfn software,45 and CDD maps were rendered with VMD.46 Apparently, all FRAs show charge separation upon excitation (Fig. 2). The electron density increment regions are localized on the terminal of the asymmetric core and end-capped groups, while the zones of density depletion are located at the asymmetric core. Furthermore, the side-chain on the terminal thiophene of the asymmetric core shows a negligible contribution to the electron excitation process, which could explain the reduced ICT effect through side-chain modification.

The photovoltaic performance of INO-4F, IN-4F, IPT-4F, and IPCl-4F as acceptors was evaluated. OSCs were fabricated with a conventional configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/PDIN/Al. PM6 was selected as a polymer donor due to its good photoelectric properties and its complementary absorption to those of the FRAs. The optimized active layers were spin-coated from a blend solution of 20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene (CB) with a D:A weight ratio of 1:1, and annealed at 150 °C for 5 min. The photovoltaic parameters of the OSCs based on PM6:IN-4F, PM6:INO-4F, PM6:IPT-4F, and PM6:IPCl-4F blends are summarized in Table 2, with the corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. It can be seen that the electron-donating group substituted IN-4F and INO-4F based devices exhibit high VOCs over 0.92 V, while the non-substituted IPT-4F and electron-withdrawing chloro-substituted IPCl-4F based devices show high JSCs over 21 mA cm−2. The VOC values for these IPT-based OSCs exhibit a monotonic decrease with the LUMO energies of the IPT-based acceptors (Fig. 3c). Moreover, the VOC value almost decreases linearly with the σ value of the substituent. These results indicate that the LUMO energies of the IPT-based acceptors should be the main determining factor for VOC. As shown in Fig. 3d, the change trend of JSC is consistent with that of the dipole moment. And the JSC value doesn’t increase with the inverse of the optical bandgap of the NFAs, suggesting the correlation of JSC with the ICT effect of the FRAs and the morphology of the blend films. As a result, the IPT-4F based devices achieve the highest PCE of 14.62% with a balanced VOC of 0.88 V and JSC of 22.15 mA cm−2, which is also one of the highest PCEs for asymmetric FRA based OSCs.

As shown in the EQE spectra, from the PM6:INO-4F to PM6:IN-4F to PM6:IPT-4F and then to PM6:IPCl-4F based devices, the OSCs show gradually extended photoresponse ranges in long-wavelength band absorption. These results are consistent with the absorption change trend of the corresponding blend films (Fig. S15a, ESI†). Moreover, the PM6:IPT-4F based devices exhibit stronger EQE responses (nearly 80%) in the region of 550 nm to 800 nm relative to the PM6:IN-4F, PM6:INO-4F, and PM6:IPCl-4F based ones, leading to higher JSCs. The JSC values integrated from the EQE plots are 18.85, 19.75, 21.42 and 20.50 mA cm−2, respectively, for the IN-4F, INO-4F, IPT-4F, and IPCl-4F based devices, which agrees well with the J–V characteristics (within 5% mismatch).
The light intensity (P) dependent JSC and VOC values were further measured to investigate the charge recombination behavior of the four FRA based OSCs (Fig. S15b and c, ESI†). The relationship between JSC and P can be described by the formula JSC ∝ Pα. In principle, if all free carriers are swept out and collected by electrodes prior to recombination, the fitted slope (α) should be equal to 1. The α value is found to be 0.96, 0.97, 0.98, and 0.99 for the optimized devices based on the PM6:IN-4F, PM6:INO-4F, PM6:IPT-4F, and PM6:IPCl-4F blend films, respectively. All devices show pretty similar values of α (close to 1), indicating very weak bimolecular recombination and effective carrier extraction in these devices. Furthermore, the trap-assisted recombination losses were studied. The variations of VOC as a function of P were modeled with the equation VOC ∝ lnP (Fig. S15c, ESI†). Theoretically, the slope (β) value close to 2kT/q (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and q is the elementary charge) indicates severe trap-assisted recombination caused by defects or impurities in the active layers. The β value close to 1 kT/q suggests negligible trap-assisted recombination in the active layers. The β value is 1.13 kT/q, 1.09 kT/q, 1.02 kT/q, and 1.62 kT/q for the optimized OSCs based on the PM6:IN-4F, PM6:INO-4F, PM6:IPT-4F, and PM6:IPCl-4F blend films, respectively. The optimized PM6:IPT-4F devices show a minimum β value, implying a weak trap-assisted recombination. However, the PM6:IPCl-4F based OSCs achieve the highest β value of 1.62 kT/q among the four FRAs. This suggests that trap-assisted recombination is non-negligible, resulting in a low JSC and FF compared with those of the IPT-4F based ones.
The photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) characteristics of the OSCs were measured to investigate the exciton dissociation and charge extraction processes. Jph was calculated from Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff was estimated by Veff = V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage when JL = JD and V is the applied voltage. Herein, the Jph values of the PM6:IN-4F, PM6:INO-4F, PM6:IPT-4F, and PM6:IPCl-4F based OSCs at 1 V reverse bias have been selected as the pseudosaturation photocurrents (Jsat). As shown in Fig. S15d (ESI†), the Jph/Jsat ratios under short-circuit conditions are 94.29%, 95.61%, 95.80% and 91.45% for the PM6:IN-4F, PM6:INO-4F, PM6:IP-4F and PM6:IPCl-4F based devices, respectively. This slight enhancement from the IN-4F to INO-4F, then to IPT-4F based devices indicated more efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection processes. However, the PM6:IPCl-4F based devices exhibit the lowest Jph/Jsat values, indicating that chloro substitution on the asymmetric core may lead to relatively poor exciton dissociation and charge collection processes.
The morphologies of these blend films were further investigated by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode. As shown in Fig. 4, all blend films exhibit quite smooth surfaces with small root mean square roughnesses (RMS ≈ 2 nm). Furthermore, all blend films display clear and homogeneous nano-fibril structures in the AFM phase images. Therefore, the impact of the side-chains on their morphologies is not well reflected by AFM. To probe more in-depth information on the morphologies and contact angles of water and glycerol (GL) on the neat films were measured to further investigate the influence of side-chains on their morphologies.

Fig. 5 shows the droplet contact angles (θ) of water and GL on the neat films of PM6 and the four asymmetric FRAs, with the contact angles and surface energies (γ) summarized in Table 3. The γ value can be calculated using the Wu model.47 (1) (2) γ = γd + γp(3)where γd and γp are the dispersion and polar components of γ. The θwater value can be increased from 92.1° to 95.2°, when the H atom on the thiophene unit was replaced by a long alkyl or alkoxy chain. However, the introduction of the Cl atom onto the asymmetric cores leads to a decreased contact angle (81.5°) of water on the neat films. These findings indicate that the side-chain type can modulate the hydrophilicity of the asymmetric FRAs, which is a significant physical characteristic that may affect the device fabrication process.

Polymer donor PM6 shows the smallest γ value of 21.7 mN m−1 among the five single component neat films, which can facilitate PM6 and the FRAs to form fine vertical phase separation. INO-4F and IPT-4F show relatively smaller γ values of 24.3 mN m−1 and 24.1 mN m−1, respectively, compared with those of IN-4F and IPCl-4F (25.5 mN m−1 and 29.9 mN m−1). Hence, the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter χdonor–acceptor was calculated to evaluate the miscibility of the two components, and can be derived using empirical eqn (4):48 χdonor–acceptor = m(γdonor1/2 − γacceptor1/2)2(4)where m is a positive constant, and γdonor and γacceptor are the surface energies of the corresponding donor and acceptor films, respectively. The χdonor–acceptor value is increased notably from 0.06m for IPT-4F to 0.07m for IPCl-4F, to 0.15m for IN-4F then to 0.66m for IPCl-4F, suggesting that the miscibility of the FRAs and PM6 was decreased in the order of PM6:IPT-4F to PM6:INO-4F to PM6:IN-4F then to PM6:IPCl-4F.
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed to probe the influence of side-chain engineering on the π–π stacking interaction and crystallinity of active layers. As shown in Fig. 6, all optimized blend films exhibited pronounced (010) diffraction peaks in the out-of-plane direction (qz = 1.74 Å−1). However, it should be mentioned that the intensities of the (010) diffraction peaks are quite different, suggesting that the π–π stacking interaction can be effectively tuned by side-chain engineering. Compared with PM6/IPT-4F blend film, the PM6/IN-4F blend film showed a weakened π–π stacking (010) diffraction peak, while the (010) signature peaks of the PM6/INO-4F and PM6/IPCl-4F blend films improved significantly. Therefore, alkyl modification can destroy the molecular order and decrease the crystallinity due to steric hindrance. However, the alkoxy or chloro substitution leads to enhanced π–π stacking interaction owing to non-covalent inter-molecular interactions. The diffraction ring located at ∼0.3 Å−1 is indexed as the (001) diffraction peaks of the flat-on lamellar crystal. The PM6/INO-4F and PM6/IPCl-4F blend films exhibited improved (001) diffraction peaks at q = 0.31 Å−1 compared with the PM6/IPT-4F blend film, which is well in accordance with the tendency of the π–π stacking (010) diffraction peak. These results indicated that the PM6/INO-4F and PM6/IPCl-4F blend films showed stronger crystallinity than the PM6/IPT-4F film. The weak miscibility and strong crystallinity of the PM6/INO-4F and PM6/IPCl-4F systems provide more opportunities to form enlarged aggregates, which may affect exciton dissociation and charge extraction processes, and even charge recombination. These results are well in accordance with those of the P–JSC, P–VOC, and Jph–Veff measurements. In contrast, the PM6/IN-4F blend film has weakened (001) diffraction peaks in both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions (qxy = 0.31 Å−1 and qz = 0.28 Å−1, respectively). Furthermore, the corresponding crystal coherence length (CCL) of the PM6/IPT-4F blend film is 24.3 nm in the in-plane direction, while the PM6/IN-4F blend film exhibits a significantly reduced CCL of 7.53 nm in the in-plane direction. The decreased crystallinity and restricted charge transport induced by the reduced CCL of the PM6/IN-4F blend film may lead to relatively poor JSCs and FFs.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, side-chain engineering on a fused-ring donating core was employed in successfully developing thieno[2′′,3′′:5′,6′]-s-indaceno[2′,1′:4,5]dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole based asymmetric FRAs. Four FRAs (INO-4F, IN-4F, IPT-4F, and IPCl-4F) were designed by introducing different electron-withdrawing substituents (i.e. 2-ethylhexyloxy, 2-ethylhexyl, hydrogen, and chloro, respectively) at the thiophene β-position. The absorption and energy levels were thus precisely modulated. Furthermore, such a design strategy not only has a great advantage of tuning the miscibility between FRAs and polymer donors, but also has a great impact on the π–π stacking interaction and crystallinity of the active layers. Consequently, enhancing the electron-withdrawing effect of the side-chain decreases the optical bandgap, but lowers the LUMO level to yield a trade-off between JSC and VOC. A floating FF originates from the impact of the side-chains on their morphologies. The IPT-4F based devices achieve the highest PCE of 14.62% with a balanced VOC of 0.88 V and JSC of 22.15 mA cm−2. Our strategy provides new insight into systematically modulating the optical and electron characteristics of asymmetric FRAs, and then optimizing the morphology to realize high performance OSCs.

4.2 OSC device fabrication and characterization
OSCs were fabricated with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layers/PDIN/Al structure. The patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass coated substrates (sheet resistance = 15 Ω per square) were pre-cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water and ethanol, respectively. The cleaned ITO substrates were blow-dried with high-purity nitrogen and then treated with oxygen plasma for 1 min to improve their work function and clearance. Subsequently, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios PVP Al 4083, purchased from H.C. Starck Co., Ltd) solution was spin-coated on the ITO substrates at 5000 rounds per minute (RPM) for 30 s and then annealed at 150 °C for 15 min in air. After annealing treatment, the ITO substrate coated PEDOT:PSS films were transferred to a high-purity nitrogen-filled glove box to fabricate active layers. PM6 and the FRAs (weight ratios of 1:1) were dissolved in chlorobenzene to prepare 20 mg mL−1 blend solutions. The PM6/IN-4F and PM6/INO-4F blend solutions were spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS films at 1800 RPM for 30 s, and the PM6/IPT-4F and PM6/IPCl-4F blend solutions at 2000 RPM for 30 s. The active layer thicknesses of all devices were controlled to be ≈100 nm. Next, the active layer on the substrate was annealed at 150 °C for 5 min. After that, PDIN solution (2 mg mL−1 in methanol with 0.25 vol% acetic acid) was spin-coated on the top of the active layers at 5000 RPM for 30 s to prepare a cathode interlayer. Finally, the Al cathode was deposited by thermal evaporation with a shadow mask under 10−4 Pa. The thickness of 100 nm was monitored using a quartz crystal microbalance. The active area is approximately 3.8 mm2, which is defined by the overlapping area of the ITO anode and the Al cathode.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of all OSCs were measured using a Keithley 2400 unit in a high-purity nitrogen filled glove box. AM 1.5G irradiation was provided using an XES-40S2 (San-EI Electric Co., Ltd) solar simulator (AAA grade, 70 × 70 mm2 photobeam size) with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, which was calibrated using standard silicon solar cells (purchased from Zolix Instruments Co. Ltd). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the OSCs were measured in air using a Zolix Solar Cell Scan 100. AM 1.5G radiation was provided using a Newport solar simulator with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, calibrated using a standard single crystal Si photovoltaic cell. The EQE spectra of the inverted devices were obtained using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using a standard single crystal Si photovoltaic cell. The film thicknesses were measured using a Bruker DektakXT stylus profiling system. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was measured at the 13A beam line of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Centre (NSRRC, Taiwan), with technical support provided by the “Ceshigo Research Service, www.ceshigo.com”. All samples for GIWAXS were irradiated with 12.13 keV X-rays with incident angles of 0.10–0.15°.
