    , Accepted 25th July 2016First published on 25th July 2016AbstractCharge recombination occurring at the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interface is a crucial factor that limits the power conversion efficiency (η) of quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). This paper presents a new approach by inserting a ZnS layer between the TiO2 and CdS/ZnS to prepare a TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS sensitized photoelectrode for QDSSC applications. The CdS QDs and ZnS passivation layers were deposited using a reproducible and controlled successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method. The TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS based QDSSCs exhibited a power conversion efficiency (η) value of 3.69%, which is significantly higher than the 3.02% and 2.09% observed for solar cells with a TiO2/CdS/ZnS device and without a passivation layer (TiO2/CdS), respectively. The elevated performance of the TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS-based QDSSCs was attributed to the pre-assembled ZnS layer enhancing the light harvesting and acting as a blocking layer to shield the TiO2 core from the outer QDs and the electrolyte, thereby retarding the interfacial recombination of electrons from the TiO2 with the electrolyte or with the QDs. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and open circuit voltage decay measurements showed that the TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS-based QDSSCs inhibit charge recombination remarkably at the photoanode/electrolyte interface and prolong the electron lifetime.
1. Introduction
Quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) are one of the most promising candidates for third-generation photovoltaic devices because of the unique properties of QDs compared to conventional organic dye sensitizers, such as a tunable band gap, multi-electron generation (MEG), high absorption coefficient, large intrinsic dipole moment, and ease of fabrication.1–5 The structure of QDSSCs includes mesoporous TiO2 sensitized with QDs, an electrolyte containing a redox couple, and a counter electrode (CE). Upon illumination, the electrons are transferred from the photo-excited states of the QDs to the conduction band of TiO2 films followed by a reduction of the oxidized QDs with a polysulfide electrolyte redox couple.6 Narrow band gap QDs, such as CdS, CdSe, PbS, CdTe, CuInS2, SnS, and Sb2S3, have been employed as efficient sensitizers for QDSSCs.7–13 Among these semiconductor QDs, CdS and CdSe are considered to be more promising materials because of their better performance. Although QD materials have excellent properties, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of QDSSCs (11.6%) is still lower than their theoretical efficiency of 44%.14,15 One reason for the low energy conversion efficiency is the high charge recombination at the QD/electrolyte interface,16 which makes it difficult to achieve full and conformal coverage of the QDs on the TiO2 surface, resulting in the leakage of electrons to the electrolyte.15,17
Currently, several fruitful methods have been developed to control the charge recombination processes: (1) introduction of a ZnS passivation layer to the QD surface to reduce electron recombination at the photoelectrode/QD/electrolyte interfaces;8,15 (2) introducing mid-gap states with the doping of QDs to facilitate charge extraction and retard interfacial recombination losses;18 and (3) wide-bandgap metal oxide thin layer (i.e. MgO, SiO2) treatment toward the TiO2 surface to reduce electron loss.19 ZnS has been the most frequently studied inorganic passivation agent to enhance the cell performance.20,21
Zhonglin et al. reported that the TiCl4 treatments are beneficial for the photocurrent and performance of the QDSSCs due to the strongly reduced charge recombination rate. As a result the cell based on FTO/TiO2/CdSe/ZnS without any TiCl4 treatment exhibits the lowest photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 5.11% than the cell based on FTO/TiO2/TiCl4/CdSe/ZnS treatment procedure that exhibited a PCE value of 5.36%.22 Ren et al. introduced an amorphous TiO2 (am-TiO2) layer between TiO2/QD and ZnS/SiO2 layers (TiO2/QD/am-TiO2/ZnS/SiO2) and achieved a new PCE record of 9.28% and a certified PCE of 9.01% under full one sun illumination.23 Wang et al. explored TiO2/Mn: QD/Mn:ZnS/SiO2 QDSSCs and achieved a PCE of 9.40%.24 Recently, significant progress has been achieved for copper indium sulfide (CIS) QDSSCs by the treatment of a wide band gap ZnS shell around CIS QDs (CIS/ZnS) to eliminate surface trapping defects, resulting in a certified PCE of 6.66%.11 Zhong et al. reported that a ZnS/SiO2 barrier coating on the CdSexTe1−x QD restricts the interfacial charge recombination and results in the highest power conversion efficiency of 8.55%.19 Lee et al. and Pawar et al. reported 4.22% and 2.56% PCEs based on TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDSSCs, respectively.25,26 Therefore, surface passivation has been implemented extensively in photoanode post-treatment by the deposition of a ZnS layer over the sensitized electrode to reduce QD/TiO2/electrolyte interface recombination and improve the PCE of the cell devices.
In this study, the surface passivation of QDs as well as the mesoporous oxide electrode forms a promising sensitizer (TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS) by employing a series of successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) processes. The deposition of ZnS on the TiO2 surface suppresses recombination, resulting in improved cell performance, such as a higher short-circuit photocurrent (JSC), open-circuit photovoltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF). The cascade structure of the TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS photoelectrode not only has a complementary effect in light harvesting, but also demonstrates efficient charge transport for both electrons and holes. The PCE of a solar cell with TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS increased from 2.09–3.69% (VOC = 0.635 V, JSC = 10.25 mA cm−2, FF = 0.566), which is almost 77% improvement compared to the solar cells without a ZnS passivating layer (TiO2/CdS). For comparison, TiO2/CdS/ZnS QDSSCs, which generated a power conversion efficiency of 3.02% that was much lower than the 3.69% obtained for TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS QDSSCs, were also fabricated. The present study highlights the potential of this novel sensitizer material, and provides a fresh perspective and valuable reference for researchers interested in improving the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Cadmium acetate dihydrate [Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O], zinc acetate dihydrate [Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O], sodium sulfide (Na2S), sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), sulfur (S), potassium chloride (KCl), copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate [CuSO4·5H2O], sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3), and urea (CH4N2O) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and TiO2 paste (Ti-Nanoxide HT/SP) was supplied by Solaronix. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and sourced commercially.
2.2 Fabrication of TiO2 photoelectrode
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, 13 Ω sq−2, Hartford Glass Co. Inc.) substrates were cleaned by sonication in acetone, ethanol, and water for 10 min each, and then dried. Subsequently, the FTO glass substrate was then coated with a 20 nm anatase (TiO2) particle paste via a doctor blading method to obtain a mesoporous film with an active area of 0.25 cm2. The as-prepared TiO2 films were subjected to a sintering process in air at 450 °C for 30 min to remove the impurities. A thickness of 7.5 μm was obtained after solvent evaporation.
2.3 Preparation of ZnS/CdS/ZnS co-sensitized photoelectrodes
The CdS QDs and ZnS layers were deposited onto the TiO2 electrodes by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) process. For the growth of the ZnS film, the TiO2 film was immersed in an aqueous 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O solution for 2 min. After washing with ethanol and distilled water (DI water), the film was dipped into a 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solution for a further 2 min to allow the S2− to react with the preadsorbed Zn2+, leading to the formation of ZnS, followed by another rinse with ethanol and DI water. This procedure was called one SILAR cycle. In total, 4 cycles were employed to obtain a suitable amount of ZnS on the TiO2 film. The TiO2/ZnS sensitized photoanodes were then dipped into aqueous solutions of 0.1 M Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O and 0.1 M Na2S for 5 min alternately. Eight cycles were repeated for the growth of CdS. Finally, another four cycles of the ZnS passivation layer were deposited on the TiO2/ZnS/CdS electrodes using the SILAR process. The as-prepared photoanode was called the TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS. For a CdS monolayer and CdS/ZnS multilayer coating, the same procedure described above was used for the TiO2 electrode.
2.4 counter electrode (CE), electrolyte and device assemble
CuS CEs were prepared by a chemical bath deposition (CBD) method according to a previous report.27 The polysulfide electrolyte was prepared by dissolving Na2S (1 M), S (2 M), and NaOH (0.2 M) in a solution with a methanol-to-water ratio of 7:3. The fabricated photoanodes and CuS CEs were sealed using a 60 μm hot melt sealing sheet (SX 1170-60, Solaronix).
2.5 Characterization
The crystalline nature of the electrodes was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/Max-2400, Rigaku) using a Cu Kα source operated at 40 kV and 30 mA in the 2θ range, 20–80°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG Scientific ESCALAB 250) was performed using monochromatic Al-Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) and an electron take off angle of 90°. The surface morphology and elemental composition of the electrodes were investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-2400, Hitachi) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDX) operated at 15 kV. The current–voltage characteristics of the QDSSCs were examined under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) using an ABET Technologies (USA) solar simulator with an irradiance uniformity of ±3%. The surface roughness of the substrates prepared using the SILAR method (CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnS and CdS–CdSe–Mn–ZnSe) was characterized using an atomic force microscope (JPK NanoWizard II AFM, JPK instruments, Berlin, Germany) with a scan rate of 0.8 Hz in the contact mode. The UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded using an OPTIZEN 3220UV spectrophotometer. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted on the QDSSCs using a BioLogic potentiostat/galvanostat/EIS analyzer (SP-150, France) under one sun illumination. The frequency ranged from 100 mHz to 500 kHz at room temperature. The applied bias voltage and AC amplitude were set to the VOC of the QDSSCs and 10 mV, respectively. The electrical impedance was characterized using Nyquist plots.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 presents plan-view SEM images of the photoelectrodes. Fig. 1(a1) and (a2) show the surface morphology of the TiO2/CdS photoelectrode without a ZnS passivation layer, and Fig. 1(b1, b2) and (c1, c2) show the surface morphology of the TiO2/CdS/ZnS and TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS photoanodes. The surface morphology was similar, except for a slight increase in particle size with the ZnS passivation layer deposition; however, the exact increase in size was difficult to investigate and was inconclusive. Therefore, XRD, EDX and XPS were conducted to verify that the CdS QDs and ZnS passivation layers were deposited successfully.

XRD was conducted to characterize the phase and crystallinity of CdS and ZnS on the surface of the TiO2 electrodes. Fig. 2 shows XRD patterns of the TiO2/CdS, TiO2/CdS/ZnS, and TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS electrodes deposited on the FTO-coated glass substrates. The XRD patterns of TiO2 showed peaks at 2θ = 25.2°, 37.6°, 47.8°, 53.9°, and 62.5°, which were assigned to a TiO2 tetragonal anatase structure (JCPDS: 21-1272). The peaks at 2θ = 26.5, 44.0, 54.6, and 70.5° for the TiO2/CdS, TiO2/CdS/ZnS, and TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS electrodes were indexed to the (111), (220), (222) and (331) crystal planes of the cubic CdS (JCPDS: 01-080-0019). Similarly the peaks at 2θ = 28.5°, and 56.5° in the TiO2/CdS/ZnS and TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS electrodes were indexed to the (008) and (118) crystal planes of the hexagonal ZnS, respectively (JCPDS: 39-1363). Elementary composition analyses of the as-prepared films were carried out using an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer; the results are shown in Fig. 3. The peaks corresponding to Ti, O, Cd, and S appeared in the spectra of the TiO2/CdS electrode (Fig. 3(a)). Fig. 3(b) shows that upon deposition of ZnS on the surface of the CdS QDs, the Zn content in the film was 2.04%, whereas the Cd content decreased from 6.33% to 6.09% and the S content increased from 8.68% to 9.69%, indicating the occurrence of a ZnS passivation layer on the CdS QDs. Interestingly, the at% of Zn and S increased (3.06 at% and 11.36 at%) with the introduction of a ZnS layer between TiO2 and CdS/ZnS (TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS). Therefore, the successful deposition of ZnS on both the TiO2 surface and CdS QDs suppress charge recombination and improves the performance of the QDSSCs.

XPS was used to investigate the composition and surface chemical bond configuration of TiO2/CdS and TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS photoanodes. Fig. 4 shows the XPS survey spectra of the nanostructured TiO2/CdS and TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS. The XPS survey in Fig. 4a show peaks for S 2p, Cd 3d, Ti 2p, C 1s, and O 1s, along with an additional Zn 2p peak for the TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS sample (Fig. 4b). The binding energies of Cd 3d3/2 and Cd 3d5/2 were observed at 411.6 and 405.8 eV in the TiO2/CdS and TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS electrodes, respectively. Fig. 4b shows the binding energies for Zn 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 of the prepared sample of TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS at 1045.0 and 1021.8 eV respectively. The spectrum for S 2p was fitted to a single peak at a binding energy of 161.2 that was attributed to the Zn–S and Cd–S bonds. Overall, these results confirm that the synthesized photoanode consists of TiO2, CdS, and ZnS.

To determine the changes in the surface morphology and roughness by the introduction of a ZnS layer, AFM was carried out on the TiO2/CdS, TiO2/CdS/ZnS, and TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS electrodes. Fig. 5 shows three-dimensional (3D) AFM images of TiO2/CdS, TiO2/CdS/ZnS, and TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS electrodes. The TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS electrode showed the lowest root mean square (RMS) surface roughness (10.8 nm) and the TiO2/CdS/ZnS film showed a moderate RMS value (18.5 nm). On the other hand, TiO2/CdS exhibited a larger RMS roughness (22.5 nm) than the other two samples. The low RMS value of the TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS film was attributed to the increased particle size with the increased deposition of ZnS.28 The power conversion efficiency of the QDSSCs depends mainly on the low roughness of the photoelectrodes. The decrease in the surface roughness of TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS tends to increase the performance of the QDSSCs, which affects the optical properties.28

The amount of CdS and ZnS incorporated in the TiO2 film was evaluated by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. Fig. 6 shows the variation of the spectra with the ZnS passivation layers in the range 300 to 800 nm. The absorbance of the TiO2 film appears in the UV spectral region with wavelengths less than 380 nm. The optical spectra of TiO2/CdS and TiO2/CdS/ZnS exhibited a band edge at 523 nm, which shows that ZnS as the top-layer on the TiO2/CdS film has no apparent change in the absorption spectrum. In the presence of a ZnS seed layer between TiO2 and CdS/ZnS (TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS), the amount of CdS incorporated was enhanced greatly, as demonstrated by the higher absorbance, and the absorption edge appeared at 538 nm. These results indicate the growth enhancement effect of the ZnS seed layer on the deposition of TiO2, which favors the nucleation and growth of CdS, leading to a high absorption rate of CdS.

The QDSSCs based on multiple photoanode cells were fabricated and measured to ensure the reproducibility of our results (see multiple measurement results in Table S1 in the ESI†). The optimization of the SILAR cycles of the ZnS intermediate layer between TiO2 and CdS/ZnS is shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI† and the corresponding extracted photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S2.† In the current density–voltage (J–V) curves corresponding to Fig. S1,† an electrode prepared using 4 SILAR cycles exhibited the best performance and the photovoltaic performance was reduced with an excess amount of ZnS (6 SILAR cycles). Fig. 7a shows the J–V characteristics of the QDSSCs configured using the samples as the photoanodes, a CuS as the counter electrode, and a polysulfide solution as the electrolyte. Table 1 lists the detailed photovoltaic parameters (VOC, open-circuit voltage; JSC, short circuit current density; FF, fill factor; η, power conversion efficiency) of the various cells. When only a CdS layer was present on the bare TiO2 film, the device generated a JSC of 6.51 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.607 V, and an FF of 0.529, yielding a η of 2.09%. For the TiO2/CdS/ZnS electrode, JSC, VOC, and FF increased to 8.61 mA cm−2, 0.623 V, and 0.563, resulting in an η value of 3.02%. When the ZnS passivation layer was deposited between TiO2 and CdS/ZnS, the VOC, JSC, and FF were all enhanced greatly and reached 10.25 mA cm−2, 0.635 V, and 0.566, respectively, giving the highest η value of 3.69%, which is much larger than the η = 3.02% for the TiO2/CdS/ZnS electrode. The incident-photo-to-carrier conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured to further explore the enhancement of the JSC value by the inserted ZnS layer, and the result is summarized in Fig. 7b. The maximum IPCE of TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS QDSSCs reached 75% at 410 nm, which is approximately 17% improvement compared to the maximum IPCE of 64% at 405 nm for the TiO2/CdS sensitized solar cells without a ZnS passivation layer, indicating excellent energy conversion efficiency. The IPCE data was in the order of TiO2/CdS < TiO2/CdS/ZnS < TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS under the visible light wavelength range, which is consistent with the JSC order. The enhanced performance of TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS was attributed to the ZnS layer also acting as a blocking layer to protect the TiO2 core from the outer CdS/ZnS QDs and the electrolyte, and providing physical separation of the injected electrons in TiO2 from the positively charged QDs and the electrolyte, thereby retarding the interfacial recombination to achieve a higher performance.

To clarify the intrinsic mechanism of the enhanced performance in the TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS QDSSCs, EIS was performed under one sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) conditions with an applied voltage set to VOC of the QDSSCs. Fig. 8 shows the Nyquist plots of the QDSSCs in the frequency range, 100 mHz–500 kHz. The Nyquist plots were fitted by an equivalent circuit (inset in Fig. 8) using the fitted values listed in Table 1. The starting point of the first semicircle is the series resistance, RS, which is the resistance of the FTO substrate and the resistance between FTO and TiO2. RCE and CCE indicate the charge transfer resistance and capacitance at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface, corresponding to the first and small semicircle, respectively, whereas Rct and Cμ represent the charge transfer resistance and capacitance at the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interface, which is shown as the second and large semicircle in the Nyquist plot, respectively.29,30 The RS and RCE values of these QDSSCs were comparable because of the similar counter electrode and electrolyte used in this study.

The Rct value of TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS (54.57 Ω) is lower than that of TiO2/CdS/ZnS (41.07 Ω) and TiO2/CdS (25.30 Ω). The ZnS inserting layer has a remarkable effect on charge transfer resistance, Rct, reflecting the charge recombination process between the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interface. The higher Rct values in TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS devices indicate that the overgrowth of a ZnS shell around TiO2 suppresses the electron back transfer from TiO2 to the QD sensitizer and the ZnS passivation layer over CdS QDs controls the recombination reaction from the QD to electrolyte with increased electron accumulation in the photoanode resulting in the prevention of the decrease of VOC of the TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS based cell.31,32 The variation in Cμ values shows that the position of the conduction band edge of TiO2 varies with the position of the ZnS passivation layer. The Cμ values obtained for TiO2/CdS, TiO2/CdS/ZnS, and TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS were 1516, 2217, and 2586 μF, respectively. The large Cμ of TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS is related mainly to the collection of a larger number of photo-excited electrons into the conduction band of the photo-anode due to the low recombination.8 Furthermore, the electron lifetime τe was measured using the equation, τe = Rct × Cμ,33 and the τe value for TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS QDSSC devices was longer than that of the TiO2/CdS/ZnS and TiO2/CdS cells. The larger electron lifetime will improve the charge collection efficiency of the cell device.
Furthermore, open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements were performed to investigate the interfacial recombination rates of the QDSSCs, which is a useful technique for measuring the electron lifetime from the OCVD information. At the start of the analysis, the cells were illuminated under one sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) to a steady voltage, and the light was then switched off and the OCVD information was recorded. Fig. 9a shows the OCVD plots of the QDSSC based on the TiO2/CdS, TiO2/CdS/ZnS, and TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS electrodes. Apparently, the TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS device exhibited considerably longer decay times than the other two devices. Moreover, the VOC decay rate was inversely proportional to the electron lifetime and was proportional to electron recombination. The electron lifetime (τe) under open circuit conditions can be obtained using eqn (1):34 (1)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and e is the electronic charge. Fig. 9b shows a plot of the electron lifetime, τe (in a log representation), as a function of VOC.35 Among the cell samples investigated, the τe of the TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS was longer than the other TiO2/CdS/ZnS and TiO2/CdS devices, suggesting suppressed recombination and more efficient electron transfer, which is consistent with EIS analysis.36 Therefore, the improved electron lifetime in the TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS QDSSCs accounts for the higher η than that of the TiO2/CdS/ZnS and TiO2/CdS devices.

EIS measurements were performed to obtain the dynamic information on charge recombination and transport of various devices under dark conditions at a forward bias ranging from 0 V to a bias voltage higher than the VOC in the frequency range of 500 kHz to 0.1 Hz. The extracted recombination resistance (Rrec) and chemical capacitance (Cμ), from the obtained EIS measurement data are shown in Fig. 10a and b, respectively. The Cμ value is related to the variation of electron density dependent on the Fermi level and monitors the distribution of trap states in the band gap of the TiO2 matrix and the Rrec stands for the charge recombination rate occurring at the photoanode/electrolyte interfaces. As shown in Fig. 10a, for all the three devices, the Rrec reduces with applied forward bias increasing, which is due to the Fermi level of TiO2 increased at the forward bias and is beneficial to the electron transfer across the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interface. It is found that the Rrec values of TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS cells were higher than those of the TiO2/CdS and TiO2/CdS/ZnS cells under the identical forward bias since the Rrec value is inversely proportional to the recombination rate.37 The larger Rrec value indicates the reduced charge recombination rate in TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS cells, mainly due to the configuration of the alloying with the ZnS intermediate layer which worked as an obstruction against electron recombination in the interface of TiO2/QDs and TiO2/electrolyte. Similarly, the greater Cμ values of the TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS cells indicate an upward shift of the Fermi level, resulting in higher VOC.38 This result is in good agreement and confirms the EIS studies pointing to a reduction of recombination when a ZnS intermediate layer is used between the TiO2 and CdS/ZnS.

Fig. 11 shows the J–V curves of the TiO2/CdS, TiO2/CdS/ZnS and TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS QDSSCs measured under dark conditions. Compared with the TiO2/CdS device, the dark current of the TiO2/CdS/ZnS device decreased while it was much smaller for the TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS device, with the same trend in EIS results. Therefore, dark current analysis further indicates that the charge recombination process was strongly inhibited via introducing the ZnS intermediate layer between TiO2 and CdS/ZnS layers.

The TiO2/QDs/electrolyte triple junction formed at the photoanode in QDSSCs forms several paths for charge recombination, in which photoinjected electrons from the TiO2 can react with the electrolyte or with the QDs; photo excited electrons from the QDs react with the electrolyte, as shown in Fig. 12a. To control the charge recombination at the interface of the QDs/electrolyte, a ZnS passivation layer was deposited on the surface of the QDs (Fig. 12b). As a result, a ZnS coating forms a potential barrier between the QDs and the polysulfide redox couple, which blocks the electrons in the CB from the QDs to the electrolyte and reduces the defect states in the QDs. Despite the ZnS passivation layer on the QDs, some of the electrons from TiO2 recombine with the QDs. To solve the above problem, a ZnS layer was introduced between the TiO2 and CdS/ZnS (Fig. 12c). This intermediate ZnS acts as a blocking layer to cover the TiO2 core from the outer CdS QDs and electrolyte, and separates the injected electrons in TiO2 from the positively charged QDs and the redox couple, thereby retarding the interfacial recombination to obtain a high JSC and VOC. The ZnS intermediate layer is advantageous not only for electron injection, but also for hole recovery for all three layers. Therefore, this TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS photoanode helps in the interfacial structure with superior ability in collecting the excited electrons and attenuating the recombination of excited electrons at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface.

4. Conclusions
In this study, a model sensitizer of TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS was prepared successively by a series of SILAR processes in a reproducible and controllable manner, and used as a promising photoelectrode for QDSSCs. The presence of a ZnS layer at the interface between the surface of the mesoporous TiO2 substrate and a CdS/ZnS layer can reduce the device recombination substantially and increase the light harvesting efficiency to produce more excitons. Eventually, an overall η of 3.69% was achieved for the TiO2/ZnS/CdS/ZnS QDSSCs, which is approximately 22% improvement over the η = 3.02% for the TiO2/CdS/ZnS QDSSCs and more than 76% enhancement over the η = 2.09% for the device without a passivation layer (TiO2/CdS). Overall, the method of a ZnS buffer layer is an effective approach for the preparation of high efficiency QDSSCs.
