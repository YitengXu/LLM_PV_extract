E-mail: hkk777@korea.ac.kr;  Fax: +82-44-860-1331;   Tel: +82-44-860-1493Received 16th April 2013, Accepted 3rd June 2013First published on 28th June 2013AbstractTwo types of coadsorbents based on a carbazole unit containing a carboxylic acid acceptor linked by extended π-conjugated linkers, e.g., biphenyl (HC-A′) and tetramethylbiphenyl (HC-A′′), were synthesized. They were used as coadsorbents in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on the porphyrin dye (2Flu–ZnP–CN–COOH:FP). For comparison, the π-conjugated phenyl linker (HC-A1) previously developed by our group was used as a coadsorbent. As a result, the DSSCs based on HC-A′ and HC-A′′ displayed power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 6.47 and 5.85%, respectively, while the HC-A1-based DSSC achieved a PCE of 7.46%. The HC-A′′-based DSSC exhibited lower short-circuit current (Jsc) and Voc compared to the HC-A′-based DSSC, due to the fact that the dihedral angle of the π-conjugated linkers is too high for electron injection into the TiO2 CB, and has less preventing effect on the π–π stacking of dye molecules due to its lower adsorbed amount, resulting in lower Jsc and Voc values. Therefore, it is important for coadsorbents to have a smaller dihedral angle of the π-conjugated linkers for efficient electron injection and a compact blocking layer on the TiO2 surface for preventing the π–π stacking of dye molecules, simultaneously.IntroductionSince O'Regan and Grätzel reported dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on polypyridyl ruthenium(II) complex dye adsorbed on a nanocrystalline n-type semiconductor TiO2 electrode in 1991,1 DSSCs have received considerable attention as a new generation of sustainable photovoltaic devices because of their high incident solar light-to-electricity conversion efficiency, colorful and decorative nature, and low cost of production.2 To date, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) greater than 12% has been reported for DSSCs based on nanoporous TiO2 electrodes and co-sensitization with YD2-o-C8 and Y123 organic sensitizers in conjunction with a Co-complex redox electrolyte.3 A DSSC performance is strongly dependent on the minimization of charge recombination losses at the interface of TiO2/dye/electrolyte as well as on the dye regeneration efficiency.4 Moreover, such a charge recombination at the interface of TiO2/dye/electrolyte leads to losses in both the short-circuit current (Jsc) and the open-circuit voltage (Voc), resulting in a decrease in power conversion efficiency (PCE).As a result, to reduce the charge recombination occurring at the interface of TiO2/dye/electrolyte, several kinds of coadsorbents such as decylphosphonic acid (DPA), dineohexyl bis(3,3-dimethylbutyl)phosphinic acid (DINHOP), and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) have been co-adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface.5 Among them, for example, cholic acid (CA) derivatives as coadsorbents in DSSCs, based on a Ru–pyridyl complex,6 coumarin,7 porphyrin,8 phthalocyanine,9 and naphthalocyanine dye10 have been well-investigated. Deoxycholic acid (DCA) is often used as a coadsorbent to break up π–π stacking of organic dyes, thereby significantly improving Voc and Jsc.7,11 Recently, we have demonstrated that the newly discovered coadsorbent based on the π-conjugated phenyl linker (HC-A1)12,13 has multiple functions, such as light harvesting at shorter wavelengths to increase Jsc and preventing the π–π stacking of organic dyes to enhance Voc by reducing the charge recombination. Though the electrochemical interactions between NKX2677 and HC-A1 were energetically unfavorable, it was demonstrated that the hole-transfer mechanism between them strongly depends on the energetic overlap between the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of a dye and HC-A1.12,14 For the better energetic overlap between them to have an effective hole-transfer process, it was necessary to negatively lift up the HOMOs of HC-A1. Thus, the longer π-conjugated biphenyl as well as the tilted structure of a tetramethylbiphenyl unit was introduced into HC-A1. In the latter case, the tilted structure could conceptually reduce the electron-withdrawing power of the carboxylic acid group to the π-conjugated linker by the π-conjugation interruption between a carbazole group and a carboxylic acid group, leading to the negative shift-up of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) and HOMOs of HC-A1.In this study, in order to evaluate the π-conjugated linker effect of coadsorbents on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs, e.g., hole-transfer effect by tuning HOMO energy levels, light harvesting by increasing the UV-visible absorbance, the charge recombination prevention by the screen effect, we designed and synthesized a new type of Y-shaped coadsorbents: 4′-(3,6-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)phenyl)-9H-carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl-4-carboxy-lic acid (HC-A′) and 4′-(3,6-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)phenyl)-9H-carbazol-9-yl)-2,2′,6,6′-tetramethylbiphenyl-4-carboxylic acid (HC-A′′). We systematically examined and investigated their functions as coadsorbents in the DSSCs with the porphyrin sensitizer (2Flu–ZnP–CN–COOH, FP),13 including their electrochemical, photophysical properties, charge transport and recombination.Results and discussionAs shown in Scheme 1, the molecular structures of HC-A′ and HC-A′′ have a carboxylic acid acceptor linked by two different conjugated moieties, such as biphenyl and tetramethylbiphenyl units. HC-A1 was also used for the comparison. To qualitatively understand the molecular structures and electron distribution of their HOMOs and LUMOs, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed employing Becke's three parameterized Lee–Yang–Parr (B3LYP) exchange correlation functional and 6-31G* basis sets using a suite of Gaussian 09 programs.15 Scheme 1  Molecular structures of (a) HC-A1, (b) HC-A′, and (c) HC-A′′. As shown in Fig. 1, HC-A′ and HC-A′′ have low molecular weight Y-shaped structures and can also prevent the π–π stacking of dyes, like HC-A1. The theoretical calculations of HC-A′′ suggest that the dihedral angle of the π-conjugated linker is too large compared to that of HC-A1, which is unfavorable for intramolecular charge transfer from the HOMO to the LUMO.16 Thus, the electron distribution from the donor unit to the anchoring moiety will be expected to be less susceptible to excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO to allow electron injection into the conduction band (CB) of TiO2. The charge transfer distributions of HC-A′ and HC-A′′ compared to HC-A1 are also presented in Fig. 1, in which the LUMOs of HC-A′ and HC-A′′ have a lower charge transfer distribution compared with HC-A1, leading to less efficient electron injection into the CB of TiO2 photoanodes. Fig. 2a shows the UV-visible absorption and emission spectra in THF of the coadsorbents used, and their photophysical properties are summarized in Table 1. Among the three coadsorbents, HC-A′′ exhibited the strongest absorption spectrum at 263 and 299 nm (λmax/nm (ε/M−1 cm−1)), but the lowest emission spectrum. It could be attributed to its highest dihedral angle, suggesting that its electron injection into the CB of the TiO2 anode is expected to be less efficient compared with the others.

All three coadsobents exhibited reversible peaks for the first oxidation peaks, corresponding to the HOMO energy level, at higher potentials than that of the I−/I3− redox couple (ca. 0.35 V vs. NHE),17 indicating effective regeneration of the oxidized state. The zero–zero excitation energies (E0–0) from the position of the intersection of the emission with the corresponding absorption spectra were calculated to be 3.34 eV for HC-A1, 3.22 eV for HC-A′, and 3.42 eV for HC-A′′, and the LUMO levels of the dye and coadsorbents were determined using the formula: LUMO = HOMO − E0–0. As a consequence, the band gap of HC-A′ was decreased due to the increased conjugation length between the carbazole and carboxylic groups, whereas that of HC-A′′ was increased with respect to HC-A1, which could be ascribed to the high dihedral angle of tetramethylbiphenyl as a π-conjugated linker. However, it is surprising that all three HC-As have the same HOMO value, even with various extended π-conjugated linkers. It indicates that the HOMOs of all present HC-As are not sensitive to the π-conjugated linker structure.We also measured the amount of dye adsorption by assessing dye desorption into a basic solution followed by spectroscopic analysis (Table 2). Fig. 3a shows the UV-visible spectra of the FP dye only or the FP dye containing coadsorbents adsorbed onto a TiO2 surface. The UV-visible spectrum of the TiO2 film absorbed with dye only showed a much broader absorption than the TiO2 films absorbed with dye and coadsorbents because of the strong intermolecular interactions between the dye molecules aggregated on the TiO2 surface. When the dye with coadsorbents was adsorbed onto the TiO2 film, the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid group in the dye induced less adsorption of the FP dye onto the TiO2 surface, due to the electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged carboxylic groups.11,12 The amounts of adsorption of the coadsorbents onto the TiO2 film were 3.1 × 10−7, 2.5 × 10−7, and 1.4 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for HC-A1, HC-A′ and HC-A′′, respectively. On the other hand, the amount of dye on the TiO2 film decreased from 2.3 × 10−7 to 0.96 × 10−7, 1.12 × 10−7, and 1.29 × 10−7 mol cm−2, leading to a 58%, 51%, and 43% drop in HCA1, HC-A′, and HC-A′′, respectively. These results indicate that all coadsorbents used in this study are effective for to reduce π–π stacking of dye molecules. Prevention of π–π stacking with an additive in the dye solution is a typical approach to improving the efficiency of organic DSSCs. Although π–π stacking is advantageous to light harvesting because of its broad feature in the UV-vis absorption spectrum, π-stacked aggregates usually lead to inefficient electron injection and low PCE.18

Fig. 4 shows the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) action spectra as a function of the light wavelength and the corresponding J–V characteristics for the DSSCs using different coadsorbents under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 irradiation at 25 °C). The photovoltaic performance is summarized in Table 2. The IPCE of the FP-sensitized solar cell was lower than that of the others, which means a faster charge recombination caused by dye aggregation or closer π–π stacking. Such aggregate formation has been suggested to cause unwanted intermolecular energy transfer or non-radiative decay pathways, thus reducing the electron injection efficiency.19 Following the addition of HCA1, HC-A′, or HC-A′′, the IPCE was improved, even with lower dye adsorption, indicating an increase in the photocurrent of the DSSCs. Thus, coadsorbents can act as more effective spacers, suppressing π–π stacking and thereby retarding the charge recombination and improving the device performance significantly.12,13,20 In other words, they should have dual functions that include the prevention of the π–π stacking of dye molecules and light harvesting effect.

The insets are the IPCE and J–V curves of HC-A1, HC-A′, and HC-A′′ only, and the TiO2 film thickness and active area are 16 (12 + 4) μm and 0.16 cm2 with a black metal mask, respectively. As summarized in Table 2, the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs with HC-A1, HC-A′, or HC-A′′ only was as follows: a short circuit current (Jsc) of 2.70, 1.82, and 0.44 mA cm−2; an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 716, 616, and 514 mV; a fill factor (FF) of 77.3, 74.2, and 77.1%; and a PCE (η) of 1.50, 0.83, and 0.20%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1, UV-visible spectra and molar extinction coefficients were broadened and increased with the increased π-conjugated length of coadsorbents. However, HC-A′ and HC-A′′ exhibited lower cell performance compared with HC-A1, probably due to lower electron injection efficiency into the TiO2 CB due to their higher dihedral angle.The DSSC with FP only displayed a Jsc of 10.68 mA cm−2, a Voc of 596 mV, a FF of 70.40%, and a PCE of 4.48%. The Jsc of the DSSCs fabricated with the dye and different coadsorbents gradually increased in the following order: FP/HC-A′′ (13.30 mA cm−2) < dye/HC-A′ (13.63 mA cm−2) < dye/HC-A1 (14.84 mA cm−2). The Jsc was strongly influenced by the light harvesting efficiency, charge separation (such as injection, dye regeneration and recombination), and charge collection. Previously, our group12,13,20 and others7,21 independently demonstrated that the co-sensitization of dyes with coadsorbents leads to the breakup of dye aggregates, yielding a higher PCE (in particular Jsc and Voc).To further clarify the effect of coadsorbents on Voc, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed under dark conditions. Improvement in Voc is usually associated with the negative shift of the conduction band edge or suppression charge recombination. Voc is defined as the voltage difference between the electrolyte redox potential (Eredox/q) and the quasi-Fermi potential of electrons (EF,n/q) in the semiconductor, TiO2. Voc is defined in eqn (1),22 where ECB is the conduction band (CB) edge energy level, NCB is the total number of CB states in the semiconductor, n is the number of electrons in TiO2 and q is the elementary charge of the electrons. For the ideal case (i.e., a defect-free semiconductor material), β = 1. Porous TiO2 used in DSSCs often shows a non-ideal relationship, β≠ used in DSSCs often shows non-ideal real electronic states referred to as trap states.23 Assuming that Eredox is constant, Voc will be determined by the position of the CB edge and the concentration of electrons in TiO2. These two parameters can vary when different dyes are used in the DSSCs. The position of the CB edge is determined by the surface charge introduced by interface species such as ions, additives, coadsorbents, and dye molecules. Any change in the surface charge will shift the CB edge position and, hence, Voc. The number of electrons in TiO2, n, is determined by the balance between electron injection and electron recombination. (1)EIS provides information on electron transfer and recombination in the photoanode of DSSCs.24–26Fig. 5a and b show Nyquist and Bode plots of the DSSCs with different coadsorbents, measured at a forward bias of −0.65 V in the dark. The large semicircle in the middle frequency range, attributed to electron transport and recombination competition at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, represents the greater recombination resistance and longer electron lifetime (τn = CμRrec) in the DSSC with HC-A1 (159.9 Ω, 184.9 ms) than in the DSSCs with HC-A′′ (31.5 Ω, 33.7 ms) and HC-A′ (104.7 Ω, 125.2 ms). The photovoltaic performance was reflected by the charge collection efficiency derived from ηcc = (1 + Rt/Rrec)−1. The charge collection efficiencies estimated from the EIS parameters calculated with the transmission line model27 are summarized in Table 3, and their fitted Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. S2.† The ηcc of the DSSCs with HC-A1 and HC-A′ was almost the same, but recombination resistance of the DSSC with HC-A1 was greater than that of HC-A′, resulting in an increased Voc of the DSSC (Fig. 5c). Coadsorbents may induce changes in the adsorption state of the dye and the electronic state of the dye-sensitized TiO2, thereby influencing the electron injection rate and efficiency.21,27 Wenger and co-workers28 reported that the charge injection rate of non-aggregated dyes, from the dye to the conduction band of the TiO2 electrode, was three orders of magnitude faster than that of aggregated dyes. Therefore, the improved Jsc for the DSSCs with coadsorbents (HC-A1, HC-A′ or HC-A′′) compared to the DSSC with FP only may be ascribed to the breakup of dye aggregates because of the competitive co-adsorption between FP and HC-A1, HC-A′, or HC-A′′.

Dark current, measured from EIS, decreased in the following order: FP, FP/HC-A′′, FP/HC-A′, and FP/HC-A1. Higher dark current could reduce Voc because it is governed by electron flow from the TiO2 surface into the redox couple. In particular, among the coadsorbents used in this study, it was obvious that HC-A1 had the highest Voc value with the lowest dark current. Fewer recombination reactions at the interface between the FP-sensitized TiO2 and the electrolytes occurred because of the Y-shaped bulky and robust insulating layer. Therefore, HC-A1 might be more effective than HC-A′′ and HC-A′ in screening I2 or I3−, which resulted in the simultaneous improvements in Jsc and Voc in the DSSC with HC-A1.Furthermore, to further clarify the effect of coadsorbents on Voc in DSSCs, electrolyte–dye interaction as a function of I2 concentration and charge recombination were investigated by EIS measurements. Fig. 6 shows the electron lifetime and dark current as a function of I2 concentration (50, 100 and 200 mM) at a forward bias of −0.65 V plotted for HC-A1-, HC-A′- and HC-A′′-based DSSCs; the Nyquist and Bode plots are presented in Fig. S3.† The comparison of the electron lifetimes among different coadsorbents was made at the same I2 concentration (i.e., the redox potential at the CE was equal for the DSSCs with different coadsorbents). The difference in the electron lifetime was dependent on how the coadsorbents affected the electron lifetimes. Fig. 6  (a) Electron lifetime and (b) the corresponding dark current for the DSSCs with different coadsorbents as a function of the I2 concentration at a forward bias of −0.65 V under dark conditions from 106 to 0.1 Hz. The dark current from EIS data was assumed to be positive. As expected, the electron lifetimes clearly decreased with increasing I2 concentration (and hence I3−). This was due to the increased probability of electron recombination caused by increasing the concentration of acceptor species (I2 or I3−) in the electrolyte. Changes in the electron lifetime dependence on I2 concentrations were less pronounced for HC-A1- than for HC-A′- and HC-A′′-based DSSCs (Fig. 6a). At 50 mM I2, the electron lifetime differed by about 1.4-fold between HC-A1- and HC-A′-based DSSCs, whereas at 200 mM I2, the difference was about 2.1-fold. At higher I2 concentrations, the 2.1-fold difference in electron lifetimes became more affected by the different degrees of surface blocking. Moreover, the dark current properties of the DSSCs with coadsorbents exhibited the opposite trend to that observed with the electron lifetime (Fig. 6b). This suggests that HC-A1 on the TiO2 surface may effectively protect against approaching I3− ions, thus improving Voc. Thus, we can conclude that coadsorbents should have a smaller dihedral angle for efficient electron injection into TiO2, a Y-shaped molecular structure for preventing the π–π stacking of dye molecules, and a compact blocking layer on the TiO2 surface for reducing the charge recombination, simultaneously.ConclusionsTwo carbazole-based coadsorbents with π-conjugated linker units (biphenyl and tetramethylbiphenyl) were synthesized to investigate their structural effect on the photovoltaic performance of organic DSSCs. Two coadsorbents with FP could break up dye aggregates, leading to an increase in the photocurrent density and suppressing charge recombination, leading to increased electron lifetimes. According to the EIS analysis, HC-A′′- and HC-A′-based DSSCs were less effective in both electron injection and charge recombination prevention compared to the HC-A1-based DSSC. As a consequence, coadsorbents should have a smaller dihedral angle for efficient electron injection into the CB of TiO2, a Y-shaped molecular structure for preventing the π–π stacking of dye molecules, and a compact blocking layer on the TiO2 surface for reducing the charge recombination, simultaneously. However, it is surprising that all three HC-As have the same HOMO value, even with various extended π-conjugated linkers. It indicates that the HOMOs of all present HC-As are not sensitive to the π-conjugated linker structures.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Human Resources Development Program (No. 20124010203190) of the Korean Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) Grant funded by the Korean Government of Trade, Industry and Energy.Notes and referencesB.
