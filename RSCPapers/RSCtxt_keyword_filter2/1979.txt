    , Accepted 30th June 2021First published on 1st July 2021AbstractAlkali-metal-ion doping is an efficient strategy to improve the device performance of thin film solar cells. Though doping with Li+ or Cs+ doping has been reported in Ag–Bi–I solar cells, the influence of doping with other alkali metal ions on Ag–Bi–I solar cells has not been systematically studied. In this work, we investigate the effects of five alkali metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) on the structure, morphology, and optical and electrical properties of Ag2BiI5 absorber layers, and also their influence on the device performance. All alkali-metal-doped Ag2BiI5 thin films show high crystallinity and have similar suitable band gaps. Hall effect measurements demonstrate that the alkali-metal-doped Ag2BiI5 films show an improved electrical performance compared with the pristine Ag2BiI5 thin film, which is beneficial to achieving high-efficiency solar cells. Unexpectedly, Cs+ doping can significantly increase the grain size of Ag2BiI5 thin films, leading to a porous absorber that reduces the device efficiency. The device performance of Li+-, Na+-, K+- and Rb+-doped Ag2BiI5 is significantly improved compared with that of pristine Ag2BiI5. It is found that the order of the power conversion efficiency promotion ability is K+ > Rb+ > Na+ > Li+ > Cs+ under the same experimental conditions. The present approach can be extended to other Bi-based solar cells to improve their device performance, which is critical for applications in absorbers with poor electrical performance or low crystallinity.
1. Introduction
Alkali-metal doping is an effective strategy to improve the device performance of thin film solar cells, such as Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGSSe),1–4 Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe),2,5–8 Sb2(S,Se)39 and organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs).10–14 For instance, Li+, Na+, K+ and Rb+ doping can passivate surface or grain-boundary defects, promote crystal growth, and improve the electrical properties of CIGSSe3,4 and CZTSSe6–8 solar cells. Interestingly, Li+ can alloy with the kesterite phase leading to a solid solution (LixCu1−x)2ZnSn(S,Se)4 that offers a way of tuning the band gaps of the absorber layers and improving the device performance. In addition, LiOH, NaOH, KOH, RbOH and CsOH have been introduced into Sb-based precursor solutions to fabricate Sb2S3 solar cells.9 It is worth noting that only heavy alkali metal ions (K+, Rb+, and Cs+) are beneficial for absorbers to grow into large grains and form a better morphology, which facilitate the improvement of the device performance of Sb2S3 solar cells. Moreover, the role of alkali metal ions in halide perovskite solar cells has also been widely investigated.15–21 Low concentrations of Cs+ and Rb+ promote halide homogenization and enhance the charge-carrier lifetime, which plays a critical role in improving the photovoltaic device performance.10 Alkali metal ions with a gradient size occupy different positions in the crystal lattice of the perovskite, and they play various roles, e.g. crystallinity adjustment, defect passivation and ion migration.11 Based on the above discussion, we can infer that the modes of alkali-metal doping include substitutional22 and interstitial doping.23 In substitutional doping, the alkali metal can replace ions with a similar radius and coordination mode, which has a significant impact on the band gap and defects of the absorber layer.24,25 The interstitial doping is mainly to promote the growth of crystal grains, passivate the crystal surface and grain boundaries, and improve the device performance.26 In the past few years, Bi-based materials, a new type of absorber, have aroused widespread interest among researchers,27–33 but the performance of Bi-based solar cells is far lower than those of CIGSSe, CZTSSe, Sb2(S,Se)3 and PSCs. Therefore, alkali-metal doping has great potential in improving the efficiency of Bi-based solar cells.
The Bi-based solar cell is a general term for a series of solar cells containing the Bi element in the absorber layer, including Bi2S3,34,35 BiSI,36 AgBiS2,37 CuBiS238,39 and Bi-based halides (binary,40 ternary41–43 and quaternary44). AgaBibIa+3b is an important Bi-based absorber material, and a large number of encouraging results have been achieved.45–51 In the crystal structure of AgaBibIa+3b, [AgI6] and [BiI6] octahedra are connected through shared edges and further increase the structural dimension.48 AgBiI4,49 AgBi2I7,52 Ag2BiI5,45 Ag3BiI648 and AgBi3I1053 demonstrate an appropriate direct band gap of 1.6–1.86 eV. AgBi2I7 was first reported by Sargent et al. in 2016.52 The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the Ag–Bi–I-based device was achieved by Pai et al. in 2018,54 by introducing sulfide to partially substitute iodine. The band gap is decreased and the valence band edge is upshifted by sulfide doping, which contributes to improving the device performance. Recently, Li-TFSI55 and CsI56 were introduced into the precursor solutions to improve the quality of AgBiI4 thin films and to enhance the PCEs of AgBiI4 solar cells. However, the effects of other alkali metals being incorporated into Ag–Bi–I absorbers have not been investigated.
In this work, we investigate the effects of different alkali-metal doping on the performance of Ag2BiI5 solar cells by introducing LiI, NaI, KI, RbI and CsI into the Ag–Bi–S–I-based precursor solutions. Compared with the traditional one-step deposition approach, our method can adjust the thickness of the as-prepared films by repeating the spin-coating and annealing processes. The as-prepared film is AgBiS2 and unknown Ag compounds. Interestingly, the XRD patterns demonstrate that alkali-metal doping does not change the crystal structure of Ag2BiI5, so the alkali-metal doping model is one of interstitial doping. The Li+-, Na+-, K+- and Rb+-doped Ag2BiI5 films show dense and continuous surface morphologies. Unexpectedly, there are a lot of pinholes in the Cs+-doped Ag2BiI5 film due to its larger grain-size composition. All the absorption edges of Ag2BiI5 thin films are at the wavelength of ∼700 nm, which proves that the doping mode of the alkali metal is interstitial. Hall effect measurements indicate that alkali-metal doping can increase the carrier concentration, thus leading to a high conductivity. Finally, we fabricate Ag2BiI5 solar cells with the structure of glass/ITO/SnO2/Ag2BiI5/PTAA/Ag. The device performance of Li+-, Na+-, K+- and Rb+-doped Ag2BiI5 is significantly improved compared with that of pristine Ag2BiI5. As a result, we achieve a PCE of 0.75% for the K+-doped Ag2BiI5 solar cell, with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.68 V, a short circuit current density (JSC) of 1.95 mA/cm2, and a fill factor (FF) of 56.20%, which is significantly higher than that of other devices. Moreover, it is found that the order of the power conversion efficiency promotion ability is K+ > Rb+ > Na+ > Li+ > Cs+ under the same experimental conditions.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Silver oxide (Ag2O, 99.7%), bismuth hydroxide (Bi(OH)3, 90%), iodine (I2, 99.8%), lithium iodide (LiI, 99%), sodium iodide (NaI, 99.5%), potassium iodide (KI, 99%), rubidium iodide (RbI, 99.9%), cesium iodide (CsI, 99.9%), tin chloride dihydrate (SnCl2·2H2O, 98%), n-butylamine (CH3(CH2)3NH2, 99%) and carbon disulfide (CS2, 99.9%) were purchased from Aladdin. Poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) was purchased from Luminescence Technology Corp. N,N-Dimethylformamide (HCON(CH3)2, 99.8%) and chlorobenzene (C6H5Cl, 99.5%) were obtained from Alfa Aesar. Dimethyl sulfoxide ((CH3)2SO, AR) and ethanol (CH3CH2OH, AR) were bought from Beijing Chemical Works. All chemicals were used directly without any further treatment.
2.2. Deposition of Ag2BiI5 thin films
First, 2 mL of n-butylamine and 1.2 mL of carbon disulfide were slowly mixed in a DMF/DMSO (2.5:1.5 volume ratio) solution with magnetic stirring at room temperature. Butylamine reacted with carbon disulfide and formed butyldithiocarbamic acid. Then, 289.675 mg (1.25 mmol) of Ag2O, 325.025 mg (1.25 mmol) of Bi(OH)3 and 158.63 mg (0.625 mmol) of I2 were dissolved in the solution by heating at 80 °C. For the respective alkali-metal-doping precursor solution, 0.1125 mmol of LiI, NaI, KI, RbI or CsI was added to the precursor solution. The molar ratio of alkali/(Ag + Bi) was set as 3%. After cooling down, the precursor solution was centrifuged and spun at 5000 rpm for 30 s on the SnO2 electron-transport layers. The as-prepared thin films were obtained after annealing at 230 °C for 1 min and the spin-coating/annealing process was repeated 5 times to obtain the required thickness (∼300 nm) of the as-prepared films. To obtain Ag2BiI5 thin films, the as-prepared thin films and 507.62 mg (2 mmol) of iodine were added to a weighing bottle (Ø 60 × 40 mm). Then, the bottle was placed on a 155 °C heating plate for 40 min. After this iodization procedure, the Ag2BiI5 thin films were formed. Note that all procedures were performed in the air.
2.3. Fabrication of Ag2BiI5 solar cell devices
The Ag2BiI5 solar cell devices with an architecture of ITO/SnO2/Ag2BiI5/PTAA/Ag were constructed. First, the patterned ITO glass substrates (20 × 20 × 0.5 mm) were washed successively with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol by ultrasonic treatment for 20 min, dried under a fast nitrogen flow, and then treated with UV-ozone for 15 min. Next, 415.3 mg (2 mmol) of SnCl2·2H2O was dissolved in a mixture of 2 mL of butyric acid and 2 mL of n-butylamine. Subsequently, the dissolved solution was diluted to a total volume of 10 mL by using ethanol, and spun on the ITO glass substrates at a speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by thermal annealing at 180 °C for 30 min on the hot plate in ambient air. The PTAA was dissolved in chlorobenzene at a concentration of 10 mg mL-1 and was spun onto the obtained ITO/SnO2/Ag2BiI5 substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the top Ag electrodes were thermally deposited using steel shadow masks, and devices with an area of 9 mm2 were achieved.
2.4. Characterization
The powder XRD patterns were measured using a Bruker D8 FOCUS X-ray diffractometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded using a Hitachi S-4800 electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer (Bruker AXS XFlash detector 4010). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were collected using a Thermo ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with an Al Kα X-ray source. The binding energy was calibrated using the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was carried out using an Axis Ultra DLD, with an emission line of HeI (21.22eV). The thicknesses of the thin films were measured using a step profiler (AMBIOS, XP-100). Current density–voltage (J–V) measurements were conducted under standard AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination conditions using a Keithley 2400 source meter. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were acquired using a Zolix SCS100 QE system. Hall effect measurements were obtained using an ET9000 Hall effect system (Eastchanging Technologies Inc.) via the van der Pauw method.
3. Results and discussion
Herein, Ag2O, Bi(OH)3 and iodine were dissolved together in butyldithiocarbamic acid solution.57,58 It should be noted that the traditional silver bismuth iodide precursor solution can only be deposited once,45,47,49,50 and it is hard to fabricate high-quality Ag–Bi–I thin films with adjustable thicknesses. In this work, the thicknesses of the as-prepared films were easily adjusted by repeating the spin-coating and annealing processes. Subsequently, we use the iodization process to convert S2− in the as-prepared film to I−. By choosing 155 °C and 40 min as the iodization conditions, large-grain Ag2BiI5 thin films were obtained. The procedure for the deposition of Ag2BiI5 thin films is summarized in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the fabrication of Ag2BiI5 films. 
The XRD pattern (Fig. 2a) demonstrates that the as-prepared film is mainly AgBiS2 (PDF #21-1178). It should be noted that since the ratio of Ag to Bi in the precursor solution is 2:1, there should be some amorphous or low-crystallinity Ag compounds (marked with the * sign) in the as-prepared film. However, we cannot accurately determine the structure of the Ag compounds by the XRD pattern. Moreover, the as-prepared thin film consists of nanoparticles and has no penetrating holes from the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 2b and c). Compared with the traditional one-step approach, our deposition method can prepare high-quality thin films with adjustable thicknesses, which are beneficial to improve the morphology of absorber layers. Though the surface of the as-prepared thin film is discontinuous, the subsequent iodination process can convert small particles into large grains, thereby eliminating these small pores. The top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of the as-prepared Ag–Bi–S–I thin films with alkali-metal doping are shown in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†), and all films consist of small, cluster-like nanoparticles. There are some holes present on the surface, but no penetrating holes exist. In addition, some white components appear on the surface, which may be amorphous or low-crystallinity Ag compounds. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of the as-prepared undoped Ag2BiI5 film is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), and it shows that the composition in the prefabricated film is uniform. Furthermore, to confirm the presence of the alkali-metal elements in the Ag2BiI5 films, the compositions of the as-prepared Ag2BiI5 films doped with different alkali-metal ions were measured by surface EDS measurement. The values in Table S1 (ESI†) represent the median and standard deviation of each element's atomic percentage, which was calculated from five different points within each film. The EDS results confirm the lateral uniformity and homogeneous nature of the absorber layers.

After the iodization process, the diffraction peak intensities increase markedly (Fig. 3), which demonstrates the crystallinity enhancement. Hexagonal Ag2BiI5 (PDF #35-1025) with the space group Rm is formed after iodization. The strongest diffraction peak is located at 12.8°, corresponding to the (003) plane, and indicating that the Ag2BiI5 thin film is highly orientated along the c-axis of the unit cell. It should be noted that the two peaks with a similar intensity at 41.5° and 42.2° from the (110) and (108) planes confirm the existence of Ag2BiI5 without other Ag–Bi–I phases.59 By introducing 3 mol% LiI, NaI, KI, RbI, or CsI into the precursor solution, the almost constant XRD peak positions demonstrate that the doping alkali metal ions do not change the crystal structure of Ag2BiI5, and the alkali-metal doping model is one of interstitial doping (Fig. 3a). In previously reported studies, the Li+ and Cs+ ions undergo substitutional doping. Differently, the alkali metal ions in our work undergo interstitial doping, which may be attributed to the difference in the preparation method of the absorber layers. Furthermore, the enhanced XRD peak intensities of the alkali-metal-doped samples indicate that the doping can increase the crystallinity of the Ag2BiI5 thin films, especially for the main peak (003), following the sequence of Cs+ > K+ > Rb+ > Na+ > Li+ (Fig. 3b).
 Fig. 3  (a) XRD patterns of Ag2BiI5 films with and without alkali metal doping and (b) enlarged peaks at approximately 12.8°. 
Moreover, XPS spectra are also provided to check whether the as-prepared Ag–Bi–S–I film converts to Ag2BiI5 completely after the iodization process. As shown in Fig. S4a (ESI†), both the as-prepared film and the Ag2BiI5 thin film exhibit two peaks of Ag 3d3/2 and 3d5/2, and the corresponding binding energies are nearly consistent. The peaks located at approximately 374.1 eV and 368.1 eV indicate the existence of Ag+ cations. In addition, the two peaks at 164.1 eV and 158.8 eV, as shown in Fig. S4b (ESI†), can be attributed to Bi 4f5/2 and Bi 4f7/2, respectively, which confirm that Bi3+ remains unchanged during the iodization process. It is worth noting that the intensities of the I 3d peaks of Ag2BiI5 (Fig. S4c, ESI†) are obviously enhanced compared with the as-prepared film. The I 3d XPS peaks can be fitted into two individual peaks at 630.5 eV and 619.1 eV, corresponding to the binding energies of I 3d3/2 and I 3d5/2, which are the characteristic peaks of I−. In addition, the S 2s peak at 225.4 eV (Fig. S4d, ESI†) completely disappears after iodization, which illustrates that S2− is removed. As a result, Ag+, Bi3+, I− and S2− are confirmed to coexist in the as-prepared film before iodization. After the iodization process, S2− is completely converted to I−.
The absorber morphology is of vital importance to the device performance of Ag2BiI5 solar cells. In Fig. 4, the obtained films after iodization are composed of large grains with a size of nearly 1 μm, and the average thickness of the Ag2BiI5 thin films is nearly 300 nm. The pristine Ag2BiI5 and the Li+-, Na+-, K+-, Rb+-doped Ag2BiI5 thin films present dense morphologies. Nevertheless, the Cs+-doped Ag2BiI5 thin film shows pinholes, which may be attributed to a larger grain size than for the other Ag2BiI5 films, which is detrimental to the device performance.

To examine the optical properties of the Ag2BiI5 thin films, the UV–vis absorption spectra and Tauc plots of alkali-metal-doped and pristine Ag2BiI5 thin films are shown in Fig. 5. All thin films show absorption edges at the wavelength around 700 nm (Fig. 5a). Analysis of the Tauc plots (Fig. 5b) indicates the direct band gap characteristic of Ag2BiI5. From a linear fit to the Tauc plots, the band gap values are evaluated to be 1.78–1.81 eV, close to those in previously reported studies.47,48 In the previous studies reported in the literature, similar doping concentrations can significantly affect the band gap values, so the alkali metal should undergo interstitial doping in this work. To further examine the position of the energy level, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) spectra of the pristine Ag2BiI5 thin film were obtained, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). As can be observed from the cut-off region, the cutoff energy (Ecutoff) is 15.9 eV. Therefore, the Fermi energy (EF) is estimated to be 5.32 eV from the equation EF = 21.22 eV (He I) − Ecutoff. Combined with the onset linear extrapolation, the Eonset value is 0.85 eV, which is the value of (EVBM−EF), where the EVBM represents the valence band maximum energy. Therefore, the EVBM is regarded as being 6.17 eV. With the band gap of the pristine Ag2BiI5 film of 1.81 eV, the conduction band minimum energy (ECBM) is calculated to be 4.36 eV.

In addition, we examine the electrical properties of these Ag2BiI5 thin films to investigate the influence of alkali-metal doping. Hall effect measurements indicate that after doping with alkali metal ions, the concentration of free carriers is increased, and thus a higher conductivity is achieved. The higher carrier-density levels can be attributed to the better crystallinity. As can be observed in Table 1, K+-doping is the most effective strategy to enhance the carrier concentration. The carrier concentration value of K+-doped Ag2BiI5 is 6.51 × 1014 cm−3, which is 4.9 times that of pristine Ag2BiI5 thin films. At the same time, the electrical resistivity of the K+-doped Ag2BiI5 thin film shows the lowest value of 3.74 × 103 Ω·cm, indicating the best conductivity. However, the high carrier concentration increases the carrier scattering and decreases the carrier mobility. Therefore, the Hall mobility of the K+-doped Ag2BiI5 thin film is only 1.71 cm2 (V·s)−1, lower than that of the Li+-, Na+-, Rb+-, Cs+-doped and pristine Ag2BiI5 films. Therefore, we speculate that doping K+ in the precursor solution is the most conducive approach to improve the performance of the Ag2BiI5 solar cell. In addition, Xin et al. have demonstrated that lithium doping in CZTSSe can change the polarity of the electric field at the grain boundary (GB) such that minority carrier electrons are repelled from the GB.60 Therefore, we speculate that alkali-metal doping can play a similar role for Ag2BiI5 films.

Considering the locations of EVBM and ECBM of the Ag2BiI5 absorber layer, we construct Ag2BiI5 solar cells with an n–i–p planar structure using SnO2 and PTAA as the electron-transport and hole-transport layers, respectively (Fig. 6a). It should be noted that all procedures are conducted in air. The energy level alignment of the pristine Ag2BiI5 solar cell is illustrated in Fig. 6b. The Ag2BiI5 absorber is deposited on the 30-nm-thick SnO2 layer. Then, PTAA and silver are sequentially deposited by spin-coating and thermal evaporation, respectively. The devices are tested under standard AM 1.5G illumination. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the pristine and different alkali-metal-doped Ag2BiI5 solar cells are presented in Fig. 6c. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The PCEs of the devices are increased to different extents by doping with Li+, Na+, K+, and Rb+, respectively. Due to the enhancement of crystallinity, all alkali metal ions, including Cs+, increase the JSC value of the devices. The increased integrated JSC in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 6d) matches well with the enhanced JSC results in the J–V curves. However, doping with Cs+ cannot improve the device performance due to the poor morphology in the SEM images. Furthermore, since the band gaps are nearly unchanged by doping with alkali metal ions, the VOC remains practically unchanged for the Li+-, Na+-, K+- and Rb+-doped devices. The best performance is achieved by the introduction of K+, which is consistent with the previous evaluation of electrical properties. The obtained PCE is 0.75% with a VOC of 0.68 V, a JSC of 1.95 mA/cm2, and an FF of 56.20%. Moreover, Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows the statistical efficiency distribution of 30 devices with the Ag2BiI5 absorber doped with K+, which indicates a good reproducibility of efficiency. Besides, there are some pinholes on the surface of the Cs+-doped Ag2BiI5 film, and this may damage the device performance. Therefore, the doping concentrations of 1% and 2% for Cs+-doped Ag2BiI5 films are used to investigate the effect of doping concentration on the film properties (Fig. S7, S8 and Table S3, ESI†). As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the 1% Cs+-doped Ag2BiI5 film shows a dense and continuous morphology. In addition, some pinholes are still presented on the surface of the 2% Cs+-doped Ag2BiI5 film. Furthermore, the J–V curves and PV parameters of the 1% and 2% Cs+-doped Ag2BiI5 solar cells are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†) and Table S3 (ESI†), and the 1% Cs+-doped Ag2BiI5 solar cell achieves an improved device performance (PCE = 0.49%).

4. Conclusion
In summary, an effective alkali-metal (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, or Cs+) doping strategy is applied to improve the photovoltaic performance of Ag2BiI5 solar cells. The introduction of alkali metal ions improves the film crystallinity and carrier concentration, which leads to an increase of the JSC of the corresponding solar cells. The band gaps remain practically unchanged because the alkali-metal-doping model is one of interstitial doping. Large-grain and high-quality Ag2BiI5 thin films are obtained using our new deposition approach. It should be noted that different alkali metal ions can improve the crystallinity and increase the carrier concentration to various degrees. For instance, the Cs+-doped Ag2BiI5 thin film shows pinholes in the top-view SEM images, which may be attributed to the larger grain size compared with the other alkali-metal-doped films. In addition, the carrier concentration value of K+-doped Ag2BiI5 is higher than that of the other alkali-metal-doped films, which indicates the most conducive tendency of K+ to improve the device performance. Subsequently, devices with the structure of ITO/SnO2/Ag2BiI5/PTAA/Ag were fabricated. The highest PCE of 0.75% is achieved after introducing K+. The order of the power conversion efficiency promotion ability is K+ > Rb+ > Na+ > Li+ > Cs+ under the same experimental conditions. Based on a systematic understanding of the effects of doping with different alkali metals, our work provides a feasible avenue to improve the photovoltaic performance of Ag2BiI5 solar cells.
