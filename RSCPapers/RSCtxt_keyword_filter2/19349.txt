    , Accepted 4th June 2013First published on 4th June 2013AbstractAn innovative ionic liquid (IL)-based synthesis route was developed to obtain ZnO-based hybrid nanostructured films with a modified surface. In particular, ZnO–IL hybrid films, with thickness from 1.5 to 4.5 μm and an appealing sponge-like morphology, were obtained from the electrochemical reduction of NO3− in ionic liquid-based electrolytes containing Zn2+. The presence of the ionic liquid moieties and/or derivatives in the as-deposited films was demonstrated by Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. However, a relatively soft thermal annealing (i.e. 1 hour in air at 350 °C) was proved to be an effective way to remove the ionic liquid content from the samples, leading to porous ZnO films with high specific surface area. In comparison to ionic liquid-free samples, a blue shift of ∼40 meV in the absorption onset is detected for the ZnO-PYR14TFSI hybrid films, which suggests a modification of the bandgap. Both kind of films (i.e. ZnO–IL and ZnO) were sensitized with an indoline dye, coded D358, and evaluated as photoanodes in Dye-sensitized Solar Cells (DSCs). Although less D358 was adsorbed onto ZnO–IL samples (suggesting co-adsorption of the IL and D358), a clear enhancement (by a factor of ca. 2) of the power conversion efficiency was detected in DSC based on ZnO–IL hybrid films. This improvement was mainly due to a huge increase (∼180 mV) in the photovoltage, which reaches values of up to 780 mV. The DSC characterization, by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and open circuit voltage decay techniques, indicates that the photovoltage improvement is likely due to a negative displacement of the conduction band in hybrid films. Therefore, the use of metal oxide–IL hybrid anodes appears to be a promising strategy to increase the open circuit voltage of the DSCs.
Introduction
Since ZnO has a unique combination of physico-chemical properties1,2 and a rich family of nanostructures,3 this inorganic material has a multifunctional nature that has attracted great interest for several technological applications.1,2,4–6 However, better control of particular properties (e.g. surface states) is still needed to enhance and fruitfully exploit some ZnO functions. As an example, ZnO surface control has recently been suggested as one of the main bottlenecks of the current research on ZnO-based dye-sensitized solar cells.7 As surface states may play a major role in charge transfer mechanisms taking place at any ZnO-based heterojunction, similar conclusions may also be valid for applications in other emerging technologies such as hybrid light emitting diodes8 and organic photovoltaics.9 Among different strategies to enhance surface properties control, ZnO–organic hybrid materials appear to be a very promising approach because the complementary strengths from the ZnO and the organic moieties can judiciously be combined.
In recent years, room temperature ionic liquids have emerged as versatile and environmentally-friendly reaction media for the synthesis of inorganic nanomaterials.10–15 Additionally to their particular self-assembling properties and the consequent potential to be used as a template agent, they are versatile sources of ions which may interact electrostatically with inorganic solid surfaces providing wide opportunities for the synthesis of hybrid materials with innovative functionalities. The synthesis of ZnO with unusual morphologies16–18 and crystal orientations19–21 in ionic liquid-based reaction media has already been reported. Although the interactions between ionic liquid and ZnO surfaces was suggested as the main cause of those singularities, studies on the chemical characterization and influence of potential ionic liquid content on the functionalities of the obtained materials are still scarce. However, the clear variations in the light emission properties reported for ZnO nanocrystals dispersed in ionic liquids,22,23 as well as the improvement in the charge injection in light emitting devices based on ionic liquid-modified ZnO thin films,24,25 suggest that ZnO–ionic liquid interactions may significantly affect the optoelectronic properties of ZnO. Therefore, the reports cited above seem to provide some clues about the great potential of ionic liquids as all-in-one materials to be used as reaction media, templates and a versatile source of organic moieties for the synthesis of ZnO-based hybrid materials with tailored surface and optoelectronic properties. Hence, the use of ionic liquids might provide an interesting strategy to improve the performance of ZnO-based devices in technological applications. However, further and complementary efforts in the synthesis, physico-chemical characterization and device integration are needed to demonstrate the feasibility of this all-in-one material concept.
In this article, 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoro-methanesulfonyl)imide (PYR14TFSI) ionic liquid electrolytes are reported as reaction media for the electrodeposition of ZnO-based hybrid films with a particular sponge-like morphology. The physico-chemical properties of the obtained films are studied by different characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopies, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The correlative analysis emphasizes the hybrid character (i.e. ZnO/PYR14TFSI) of the as-deposited films. Meanwhile, ZnO films are obtained after a relatively soft thermal annealing (i.e. 1 hour in air at 350 °C) to remove the ionic liquid. ZnO/PYR14TFSI and ZnO films were used as anodes in Dye-sensitized Solar Cells (DSCs). A clear enhancement of photovoltaic performance, mainly due to the increase of photovoltage, for devices based on hybrid films is shown. The DSC are characterized, by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and open circuit voltage decay techniques, in order to gain further insight into the main origin of the performance enhancement in ZnO/PYR14TFSI hybrid anode-based DSCs.
Experimental section
Deposition experiments
PYR14TFSI ionic liquid (purity 99.9%, H2O < 0.005%) and zinc(II) bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Zn(TFSI)2) were used as electrodeposition media and Zn2+ source, respectively. Both compounds were kindly provided by SOLVIONIC SA. N-Butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium nitrate (PYR14NO3), which was synthesized according to the procedure explained elsewhere,26 was used as a NO3− source. A 50 mM Zn(TFSI)2 and 30 mM PYR14NO3 PYR14TFSI-based electrolyte was studied. The experiments were performed in a three-electrode electrochemical cell with the substrate as the working electrode, a zinc sheet as the counter electrode and a Pt wire as the pseudo-reference electrode. Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glasses (TEC15, Hartford Glass) were used as substrates. Electrochemical depositions were performed on a geometric surface of ∼1 cm2. The stability of the pseudo-reference electrode was checked periodically by using a solution of ferrocene in PYR14TFSI. Therefore, hereafter all potentials will be referred to as Fc/Fc+.
All electrochemical experiments were carried out using Autolab PGSTAT302N and GPES software (Eco Chemie B.V.). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans were performed at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The electrodeposition experiments were performed under a constant current density of 0.5 mA cm−2. Charge densities in the range of 1–3 C cm−2 were applied to obtain different film thicknesses. Nitrate species in the electrolyte were regenerated by adding 0.1 mL of a 0.44 M PYR14NO3 PYR14TFSI-based solution per 1-coulomb unit of charge density being applied. This concentration was chosen because 0.1 mL of solution contains the amount of NO3− that may be consumed after 1 C considering eqn (3). Zinc cations were spontaneously regenerated by the anodic dissolution of zinc counter electrode. The electrochemical cell was immersed in a hot oil bath whose temperature was kept at 150 °C. The electrolyte was bubbled with high purity argon (purity 99.999%) for 2 h before and during deposition experiments.
Every sample was rinsed with acetone immediately after deposition to remove the excess ionic liquid. As a final cleaning treatment, the samples were immersed in dichloromethane for 12 h, whereas PYR14TFSI is easily dissolved.
Physicochemical characterization
The morphology of the films was analyzed using an ULTRA plus ZEISS field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) equipped with an Ammeter EDAX (Apollo model) accessory for the elemental analysis of the samples by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The structural properties were analyzed with a Bruker AXS-D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) using Cu Kα radiation. Near-grazing incident angle Fourier transform infrared (NGIA-FTIR) spectra were obtained at room temperature using a Thermo Nicolet Avatar 360 FTIR spectrometer equipped with an NGIA reflectance accessory. The reflectance measurements were performed by using infrared radiation at 60° in the range of 3500–800 cm−1. A bare substrate was used for background measurements. The optical transmittance of the samples was measured at room temperature with a Jascow V-570 spectrophotometer fitted with an integrating sphere, from 350 to 700 nm.
Adsorption isotherms of krypton at 77 K were recorded using an ASAP 2020 (Micromeritics) static volumetric apparatus. In order to attain sufficient accuracy in the accumulation of the adsorption data, the ASAP 2020 instrument was equipped with pressure transducers covering the 133 Pa and 1.33 kPa ranges. Before the adsorption measurements the films were outgassed in vacuum using a heating program that afforded slow removal of humidity at a relatively low temperature. Starting at room temperature, the samples were outgassed at 383 K until the residual pressure of 0.5 Pa was attained. After further heating at 383 K for 1 h, the temperature was increased up to 623 K, and maintained for 2 h.
Dye sensitized solar cells
ZnO films in the range of 1.5–4.5 μm thickness were deposited on TEC15 FTO substrates, previously coated with a thin ZnO sprayed layer,27 and then sensitized with D358 indoline dye (Mitsubishi Paper Mills Limited) by immersing the samples in a 5 × 10−4 M dye and 7 × 10−4 M chenodeoxycholic acidacetonitrile/tert-butanol (1:1) solution. The samples remained immersed for 55 minutes and were subsequently rinsed with the same solvent. The amount of dye adsorbed on the semiconductor anodes was evaluated from the absorbance of the solution after dye desorption in alkaline solution (1 mM KOH in ethanol/Mili-Q water (50:50) solution). The counter electrode was prepared by spreading 20 μl of Platisol (Solaronix) on the conductive side of TEC8 FTO electrodes and subsequent annealing at 400 °C for 5 min. The two electrodes were sealed together with a Surlyn thermoplastic film frame (25 μm, Solaronix). The electrolyte solution, made of 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M TBAI in acetonitrile/ethylencarbonate (1:4), was introduced through two small holes previously drilled in the platinum-coated FTO. The holes were then sealed using Surlyn and a microscope slide. The active area of the cells was 0.25 cm2.
The current–voltage characteristics were determined by applying an external potential bias to the cell and measuring the photocurrent using an Autolab/PGSTAT302N potentiostat. Open-circuit voltage decay measurements (OCVD) were made by keeping the solar cell at open-circuit and registering the voltage transient after interrupting the illumination.
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was utilized to obtain electron transport and recombination parameters in the DSC test devices. EIS experiments were performed under illumination over a wide range of DC light intensities using a 540 nm light emitting diode (LUXEON). This allows for probing the devices at different positions of the Fermi level in the semiconductor. A response analyzer module (PGSTAT302N/FRA2, AutoLab) was utilized to analyze the frequency response of the devices. To avoid voltage drop due to series resistance, EIS measurements were performed at open circuit, the Fermi level (related to the open-circuit voltage) being fixed by the DC illumination intensity. A 10 mV perturbation in the 105 to 10−2 Hz range was utilized to obtain the spectra. In all cases the samples were illuminated from the dye-coated TiO2 electrode side. Zview equivalent circuit modeling software (Scribner) was used to fit the EIS spectra, including the distributed element DX11 (transmission line model).
Results and discussion
Deposition experiments
Cyclic voltammograms of the single-component and full electrolytes were recorded. Fig. 1 shows a representative set of the obtained data.
 Fig. 1  Cyclic voltammograms of argon bubbled single–component (Pyr14NO3 (, 30 mM), Zn(TFSI)2 (, 50 mM)) and full electrolyte (, i.e. 50 mM Zn(TFSI)2 and 30 mM PYR14NO3) PYR14TFSI-based electrolytes. The inset shows a partial magnified view of the cathodic sweep. 
Briefly, the response of the zinc salt (Zn(TFSI)2) electrolyte (Fig. 1, red circles) exhibited a cathodic/anodic wave at ∼−1.3 V and ∼−1 V respectively, attributed to the reduction and oxidation of the Zn2+/Zn redox couple (eqn (1) and (2)). On the other side, the nitrate salt (PYR14NO3) electrolyte showed a cathodic wave starting at ∼−0.8 V (Fig. 1 inset, blue squares). According to previous reports,28,29 the reduction of nitrates proceeds by generating oxide ions (O2−) and nitrites (eqn (3)). By comparing the CVs of both single-component electrolytes, no potential window was found where the reduction of nitrates could be performed with a negligible signal for zinc reduction. Therefore, at first approximation, a co-deposition of metallic zinc and zinc oxide seems to be the most probable scenario to take place in the full electrolyte. However, no anodic features were detected in its cyclic voltammogram (Fig. 1, green triangles). This fact suggests the absence of Zn2+ reduction to metallic zinc during the cathodic sweep. The cathodic wave with the onset and center at ∼−0.7 and ∼−1.2 V, respectively is thus attributed to NO3− reduction. The latter was enhanced with respect to the single Pyr14NO3 electrolyte (Blue square curve versus green triangle curve) due to the presence of Zn2+. The NO3− reduction enhancement seems to be mainly originated by the relatively fast consumption of the generated O2− species by the reaction with Zn2+ to form the metal oxide (eqn (4)). This reaction avoids the O2− accumulation around the electrode and the consequent displacement of the eqn (3) to the right side (i.e. enhanced NO3− reduction). Although this effect does not take place in the aqueous electrodeposition of ZnO from the O2 reduction,30,31 similar behavior was reported for the latter in ionic liquid media19,32 and also for NO3− aqueous based electrodeposition approach.33,34
After preliminary experiments to check that ZnO films were obtained from potentiostatic experiments at V ∼ −1.25 V, electrochemical deposition experiments were generally carried out in galvanostatic mode (J ∼ −0.5 mA cm−2) by passing a charge density in the 1–3 C cm−2 range. The current density of −0.5 mA cm−2 was proved optimal for reaching a good compromise between film homogeneity and deposition rate. A periodic addition of a nitrate solution served to maintain the electrolyte within the adequate range of concentrations of NO3−. For the electrochemical experiments in which the electrolyte was not regenerated with the NO3− solution, the deposit turned blackish at a certain moment due to the co-deposition of metallic zinc. Zn2+ + 2e− → Zn(1) Zn → Zn2+ + 2e−(2) NO3− + 2e− → NO2− + O2−(3) Zn2+ + O2− → ZnO(4) Zn2+ + 2O2− → ZnO4 → ZnO + O2 (ref. 32)(5)
Thin film characterization
The electrochemical deposition resulted in a film that to the naked eye appeared whitish and homogeneous, which showed good adhesion to the substrate. Fig. 2a depicts the top view FE-SEM micrographs of a sample deposited after passing a charge density of 2 C cm−2. Although some micro-cracks were detected, good homogeneity was found at the microscale. However, a nanoscale sponge-like morphology with very narrow pores was revealed in high magnification micrographs (Fig. 2b). Although a slight increase of the pores might be inferred, not very significant differences were detected in annealed samples (ESI, Fig. S1†). The cross section FE-SEM micrographs showed a thickness variation as a function of the charge density passed during the electrodeposition. Samples of 1.5, 3 and 4.5 μm were obtained for charge densities of 1, 2 and 3 C cm−2, respectively (Fig. 2c–e).
 Fig. 2  Top view FE-SEM micrographs of 2 C cm−2 sample (a). Cross section FE-SEM micrographs of samples obtained after passing different charge densities: 1 C cm−2 (c), 2 C cm−2 (d) and 3 C cm−2 (e). 
Krypton gas adsorption isotherm measurements (ESI, Fig. S2†) were carried out in order to evaluate the specific area of the obtained films. The roughness factor, defined as the total physical surface area of the film with respect to the projected area, was then estimated in the range from 96 to 181, increasing as a function of the sample thickness. This result confirms the high porosity inferred from the high magnification FE-SEM micrographs. It is worth noting that the roughness factor of 4.5 μm thick films is of the same order of that reported for 8 μm thick nanoparticle-based films prepared from commercial ZnO pastes.35 Therefore, the present electrodeposition approach appears to be a competitive way to prepare high specific surface anodes for dye-sensitized solar cells without sintering or annealing.
XRD characterization of the samples was carried out. Fig. 3 depicts the XRD patterns of films obtained after passing 3 C cm−2, both for as-deposited and thermally-annealed films.

All diffraction peaks can be indexed by considering only the tetragonal SnO2 phase36 from the TCO substrate and the ZnO wurzite phase.37 The crystallographic orientation of the films was quantitatively studied by means of Harris texture analysis.38 The texture coefficients (Ci) of (100), (0002) and (101) planes and the degree of preferential orientation (σ) are summarized in Table 1. Firstly, it is worth noting that the annealing did not induce significant changes either in the crystallite size or in the film orientation. Interestingly, in contrast to the ZnO electrodeposited from O2 reduction in the same19,32 and other ionic liquids,20 the present films exhibit a clear preferential growth orientation along [0001] direction. Thus, additionally to the dielectric constant of the media,20 the ZnO formation mechanism (i.e.eqn (4) and (5)) appears to be also crucial in the film growth orientation. The crystallite size along different directions was estimated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (100), (0002), and (101) peaks by using the Scherrer formula. As can be seen in Table 1, a mean crystallite size of approximately 20 nm was obtained. The slightly larger values obtained for (0002), in comparison to (100), suggested a minor anisotropy along [0001] direction. As clear preferential orientation along this direction was detected from the Harris texture analysis (Table 1), some order in the arrangement of the primary nanocrystals is pointed out.
Table 1 Texture coefficients (Ci), degree of preferential orientation and crystallite size for as-deposited and annealed films of different thickness. The Ci coefficient provides a measure of the orientation of plane i relative to a completely randomly oriented sample, and σ is used to compare the degree of orientation between different samples (σ = 0 indicates a completely randomly oriented sample)

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) experiments were performed in order to gain further insight into the microstructural properties of the films. Fig. 4a shows a dark-field TEM micrograph, in which several multi-branched features can be detected, indicating that they are under diffraction conditions. Therefore, some common diffracting planes from different multi-branched nanostructures were suggested. Although crystalline domains with different orientation were detected in High Resolution TEM micrographs from areas between different multi-branched nanostructures (e.g.Fig. 4b, areas delimited by red lines), the latter are constituted of large (i.e. 50–100 nm in length) coherent domains as can be inferred from Fig. 4c. These dimensions are significantly larger than those estimated from XRD, suggesting that other parameters such as the presence of pores and/or strain are also contributing to the FWHM of the XRD peaks. The correlation of SEM, XRD and TEM results seems to point towards an adsorption of the ionic liquid moieties onto ZnO perturbing, although only locally, the grain crystal growth (i.e. inducing a pore). This effect does not hinder, however, the growth of the whole nanocrystal. Thus, the present route appears to be an interesting alternative to previously reported methods based on the use of molecular dyes39 or gas40 to electrodeposit ZnO nanoporous films.

Fig. 5 displays the optical transmittance spectra of samples obtained after passing a charge density of 2 C cm−2, before and after thermal annealing. A decrease (i.e. ∼10%) of transmittance in the visible wavelength range was detected after annealing. Very interestingly, a clear red shift was detected in the absorption onset. The latter was estimated from the maximum derivative of the optical absorptance, which was determined from total transmittance and reflectance measurements. Values of 3.23 and 3.19 eV were obtained for as-deposited and annealed samples. Since no significant variations of the crystallite size were detected after annealing, removal of ionic liquid moieties from the hybrid, as-deposited films, could be the main reason for the red shift in the optical gap.
 Fig. 5  Transmittance spectra of as-deposited and air annealed (350 °C, 1 h) samples. 
In order to study the presence of ionic liquid moieties in the samples, FTIR (Fig. 6a) and EDS (Fig. 6b) spectra were recorded. It is important to bear in mind that the obtained films were cleaned with organic solvents as explained in the experimental section. The measurements were carried out before and after the annealing treatment at 350 °C for 1 h. On the one hand, moderate FTIR features matching the characteristic peaks of PYR14TFSI ionic liquid were detected in as-deposited samples. It must be noted that such features are not strong peaks, most probably because of the small amount of ionic liquid in the ZnO layer.
 Fig. 6  FTIR (a) and EDS (b) spectra of the as-deposited (i.e. ZnO/PYR14TFSI, blue) and air annealed (350 °C, 1 h) (i.e. ZnO, red) samples. 
Briefly, the peaks with wavenumbers within 3000–2800 cm−1 (stretching vibrations) and the bands at 1460 cm−1 and 1375 cm−1 (bending vibrations) correspond to CH2 and CH3 groups related to the presence of the PYR14 cation. Besides this, the peaks at 1055, 1130, 1188 cm−1 and a double peak at 1330–1360 cm−1 that are characteristic of TFSI− anions and/or their derivatives41 were also detected. Such signals disappeared after the thermal treatment (no bands related to PYR14TFSI ionic liquid). On the other hand, EDS measurements reinforce the conclusions from FTIR because elements from ionic liquid such as fluorine, sulfur and carbon were detected in addition to chlorine. The source of the latter element is likely to come from the PYR14Cl used as a precursor for the PYR14NO3 salt synthesis. However, fluorine and sulfur features disappeared in annealed samples, remaining only minor carbon and chlorine contributions.
Therefore, FTIR and EDS analyses pointed out the presence of ionic liquid and/or derivatives in electrodeposited samples – even after a long immersion (i.e. 12 h) in dichloromethane – suggesting significantly stronger interactions with the ZnO surfaces. However, ionic liquid moieties can be almost completely removed by post deposition thermal treatments, in the as-deposited samples. It can be thus concluded that the present ionic liquid based electrochemical route stands as an effective method to obtain ZnO films with a hybrid organic–inorganic nature. The organic moieties are removable by thermal annealing under relatively soft conditions (i.e. 350 °C under air).
Photoanode characterization
Dye-sensitized Solar Cell (DSC) photoanodes based on ZnO/PYR14TFSI and ZnO electrodeposited films with 1.5, 3 and 4.5 μm thicknesses were prepared. The required ZnO was electrodeposited on FTO substrates, which were previously coated with a thin ZnO sprayed layer.27 The samples were then immersed in D358 indoline dye solution to induce the adsorption of the dye and the sensitization of the films. In comparison to ZnO samples before sensitization, new low intensity features, which fit well with the frequencies of the main vibrations of D358 molecule, were detected in the FTIR spectra of both the ZnO and the ZnO/PYR14TFSI photoanodes (ESI, Fig. S3†). However, the appearance of both photoanodes was significantly different. ZnO/PYR14TFSI samples showed paler pink-purple color whereas those based on ZnO films showed a much more intense color (ESI, Fig. S3† inset). Furthermore, a clear increase of the absorbance as a function of the thickness was detected for ZnO/PYR14TFSI photoanodes (Fig. 7). However, 3 and 4.5 μm thick photoanodes based on annealed ZnO exhibited very similar absorbance, suggesting a saturation of the light harvesting properties of the films for thickness longer than 3–4 μm.

The differences in the absorption were quantitatively analyzed by calculating the effective absorption (AE, eqn (6)) in the 370–700 nm range of the AM1.5 solar spectrum. The obtained values are summarized in Table 2, which also includes dye loading data. As explained in the experimental section, these were found by inducing D358 desorption and measuring the absorbance spectra of the solutions. (6)

Eqn (6) is the formula for effective absorbance calculation where A is the absorbance, I0 is the standard (AM1.5) solar flux andλ1 = 370, λ2 = 700 nm.
Significantly larger dye amounts were estimated in ZnO samples with respect to ZnO/PYR14TFSI ones. As the annealing removed the ionic liquid or derivatives adsorbed on the ZnO surface, further free sites for the anchoring of dye molecules are created. In contrast, a co-adsorption phenomenon between ionic liquid and dye seems to occur in the ZnO/PYR14TFSI photoanodes with the consequent decrease in the D358 loading. It is interesting to note that effective absorption of the ZnO/PYR14TFSI anodes increases almost linearly with dye loading (ESI, Fig. S4†). However, a saturation-like trend is observed for ZnO photoanodes at larger dye loadings. It is worth mentioning that 3.5 μm thick ZnO anodes reach the same AE (i.e. 69%) than 8 μm thick ZnO/D149 based on ZnO commercial nanoparticles.35 This comparison demonstrates the great potential of the present approach to prepare relatively thin photoanodes with high light harvesting. A schematic view of the chemical scenario in the as-deposited and annealed films before and after sensitization is tentatively proposed in Fig. 8. For a better comprehension, the chemical structures of D358 dye, PYR14TFSI ionic liquid and wurtzite phase of ZnO are depicted in the inset.

The ZnO wurtzite structure, in which each O2− (Zn2+) ion is fourfold coordinated, can be regarded as a series of hexagonal O2− and Zn2+ atomic planes that alternate along its [0001] direction. The lack of inversion symmetry results in two different atomic configurations perpendicular to [0001]; these two different 0001-type planes are constituted exclusively by oxygen ions, ZnO(000), or by zinc ions, ZnO(0001). However, lateral terminations result in non-polar surfaces (i.e. no net electrical charge).
Due to the charge distribution on the ZnO surface, different interactions with PYR14TFSI moieties may occur, affecting their adsorption. Simultaneously to the ZnO crystal growth, the adsorption of the PYR14+ cation on the lateral faces of the grain may take place by non-coulombic interactions (e.g. Van der Walls) whereas the charged faces of the ZnO nanocrystals may induce the cation and anion adsorption through coulombic interactions (Fig. 8a). The adsorption of the ionic liquid moieties on the ZnO nanocrystals may hinder their growth. As a result, grains of few tenths of nanometers were obtained. Assuming that carboxylic groups serve as anchoring units,42–44Fig. 8b depicts the D358 adsorbed on the annealed ZnO nanocrystals (i.e. ionic liquid free), but also on hybrid as-deposited ZnO/PYR14TFSI nanocrystals (i.e. with adsorbed ionic liquid moieties). In conclusion, it can be assumed that co-adsorption of D358 molecules and PYR14TFSI moieties has taken place in the as-deposited samples.
Dye sensitized solar cell (DSC) characterization
DSCs based on ZnO and ZnO/PYR14TFSI photoanodes of different thickness (i.e. 1.5, 3 and 4.5 μm) were prepared. Their photovoltaic performance was analyzed. Fig. 9 displays the current density–voltage characteristics measured under 1 sun light illumination (AM1.5). Table 2 summarizes the main photovoltaic parameters (i.e. open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit photocurrent (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and conversion energy efficiency (η)). The efficiency for devices based on as-deposited (i.e. hybrid ZnO-PYR14TFSI) films was substantially better than that of annealed ones (e.g. ZnO), reaching values of 2% for the thickest photoanodes. Therefore, the co-adsorption of ionic liquid and dye leads to a beneficial effect on the DSC performance. The efficiency difference was mainly due to a strong enhancement in Voc although FF increased too.
 Fig. 9  Photocurrent–voltage curves, under simulated solar light (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), for DSCs based on the ZnO/PYR14TFSI (dashed line) and ZnO (solid line) anodes. 
In order to clarify the phenomena taking place in the DSC devices further characterization was carried out. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed with open circuits over a wide range of light intensities. The obtained spectra were fitted to the transmission line equivalent circuit proposed by Bisquert.45 In this equivalent circuit (see ESI, Fig. S5†) Rs is the series resistance of the solar cell, Rt is electron transport resistance in the oxide, Rct and Cμ are the recombination charge transfer resistance and the chemical capacitance at the oxide–electrolyte interface, and Rpt and Cpt are the charge transfer resistance and the double layer capacitance at the electrolyte–counter electrode interface.

Fig. 10a displays the chemical capacitance Cμ of the mounted devices as a function of the voltage drop across the cell. As expected for larger surface areas, higher values of the capacitance are obtained for thicker samples. In all cases, the capacitance exhibits exponential behavior with respect to the applied bias, with a relatively small slope. This is the typical behavior of a chemical capacitance in ZnO-based cells as discussed elsewhere.53 The fact that the slope is similar for all samples, together with the shift between the two types of photoanodes, confirms the chemical nature of the capacitance data extracted from the EIS experiments.
 Fig. 10  Capacitance values extracted from the EIS measurements: as obtained (a) and (b) corrected to plot the magnitude at a constant value of electron density. 
Importantly, a significant shift in the capacitances can be observed between both types of photoanodes, with lower values found for the ZnO/PYR14TFSI at the same values of the voltage. As voltage can be ascribed to the difference in Fermi level (chemical potential) between the oxide and the redox couple, this observation strongly suggests that an upward displacement of the conduction band in the ZnO-PYR14TFSI anodes with respect to the annealed ones is taking place. Following Gonzalez-Pedro et al.,46 the band displacement can be corrected for, so that one can plot magnitudes relevant for transport and recombination at a constant value of the electron density. Having performed this correction, the chemical capacitance is plotted as a function of nEF(shifted) − EF,redox in Fig. 10b. To account for the variable shift ranging between 0.24 and 0.48 V, a fixed upward displacement of ∼0.35 V in the conduction band of the as-deposited anodes was considered in the correction. Upward displacement of the metal oxide conduction band were previously reported for dicyanamide ionic liquid based DSCs47,48 and were attributed to the anion correlated dipole effects upon dicyanamide adsorption on the metal oxide surface. In common with the TFSI− anion, the dicyanamide anion has the capability of donating electron pairs to the oxide, hence producing a displacement of the conduction band edge towards more negative potentials. As a matter of fact, this is the same effect as that is produced by additives commonly used in DSC like tert-butylpiridine, known for its beneficial effect on the open-circuit photovoltage.49,50

Fig. 11a displays the recombination charge transfer resistance (Rct) as a function of the nEF(corr) − EF,redox. As explained above, by using a corrected Fermi level (shifted according to the displacement observed in the capacitances) we make sure that the charge transfer resistances are compared at the same amount of accumulated charge in the oxide. Slightly smaller Rct values were obtained for the DSC based on the ZnO/PYR14TFSI anodes. This observation can be explained by a combination of factors. On the one hand, the presence of ionic liquid moieties adsorbed on the ZnO may provide an additional recombination pathway for the electrons injected to the ZnO conduction band with the oxidized redox mediator in the electrolyte. On the other hand, the lower dye loading of the as-deposited films (due to the co-adsorption of the ionic liquid), removes the blocking effect of the dye molecules on the recombination reaction.
 Fig. 11  (a) Charge recombination resistance values and (b) electron lifetimes calculated from OCVD (line) and EIS (squares and circles). Dashed and solid lines are a guide for the eye. 
Electron lifetimes (τn) were estimated from impedance measurements according to τn = Rct·Cμ, and from open circuit voltage decays (OCVD).

Fig. 11b displays the obtained values, from both techniques, as a function of the nEF(shifted) − EF,redox. It is worth noting that very good agreement between the values obtained by EIS and OCVD is observed, which is an indication of the accuracy of the EIS fitting and the suitability of the equivalent circuit employed. As a consequence of the smaller Rct, DSCs based on the ZnO-PYR14TFSI hybrid anodes exhibited shorter electron lifetimes, reflecting faster recombination dynamics. In spite of the lower lifetimes and recombination resistances, the conduction band displacement in ZnO-PYR14TFSI hybrid anodes lead to an impressive Voc improvement of ∼170 mV with respect to the pure ZnO-based DSCs. As a result, a maximum photovoltage of 780 mV was reached in solar cells based on 4.5 μm thick ZnO-PYR14TFSI anodes. This result represents a significant improvement over previously reported Voc values in ZnO-based DSCs.7 The present photovoltage is even slightly larger than that obtained by using TiO2 coatings (i.e. ZnO/TiO2 core–shell nanostructures51) that gave record values up to now.
Additionally, to improve Voc, DSCs based on PYR14TFSI based-hybrid films also showed a larger FF. The FF enhancement could be related to a better electron injection when the solar cell approaches open circuit conditions.50,52,53
In this context, although PYR14TFSI based-hybrid films showed lower solar light harvesting, DSC based on them exhibit a ratio between the short circuit current density and effective absorption higher than devices based on annealed (i.e. ZnO) anodes (Table S1†). This observation appears to be clear evidence for better electron injection, at least under short circuit conditions, in devices based on ZnO-PYR14TFSI-D358 photoanodes than those on ZnO-D358. Nevertheless, the upward conduction band displacement should result in a lower driving force for the electron injection in the former. However, as recently discussed by Gonzalez-Moreno et al.,54 the orientation of the carboxyl group dye molecules onto ZnO surfaces may be strongly sensitive to the atomic structure of the surface. The presence of PYR14TFSI moieties adsorbed onto ZnO nanocrystals might result in a better orientation of the D358 molecules, enhancing the electron injection.
Conclusions
ZnO/PYR14TFSI hybrid thin films were successfully obtained by a novel electrochemically assisted synthetic route. The results obtained constitute proof of concept of using ionic liquids as all-in-one (i.e. reaction media, morphology template and functional surface modifier) materials. The application of ZnO/PYR14TFSI films as anodes in dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs) was investigated. A clear beneficial effect, with respect to ionic liquid-free anodes, in the DSC performance was demonstrated. A photovoltage improvement of ∼180 mV, reaching values of 780 mV, was accomplished. In contrast to other approaches (e.g. core–shell anodes), the photovoltage was enhanced by negative displacement of the anode conduction band, and not by a decrease of the recombination dynamics. A judicious combination of the present route with the latter approaches is suggested to improve the ZnO-based DSCs. It is also worth highlighting that there is still significant room for improvement in terms of light harvesting by increasing dye loading and/or the nature of the ZnO-PYR14TFSI anodes. Thus, the present results may enlarge the versatility and options to progress beyond the state-of-the-art of ZnO-based DSC. As conceptually similar ionic liquid-based surface modification strategies may also be applied to other metal oxides (e.g. TiO2 and SnO2), the present results may open wide avenues to design anodes with tailored conduction band positions with the consequent advantages for increasing the open circuit voltage of the DSCs in general.
