    , Accepted 31st December 2022First published on 2nd January 2023AbstractOrganic solar cells (OSCs) prepared from ternary bulk heterojunction active layers offer a simplistic and proficient tactic for enhancing power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Herein, we report the construction of all-small-molecule ternary OSCs using a medium bandgap IDT-IC and a narrow bandgap F13 as fullerene-free molecular acceptors along with a wide bandgap C1-CN as a molecular donor. The crystalline nature of IDT-IC induces the appropriate nanoscale in the range of the exciton diffusion length in the C1-CN:F13 binary film, resulting in a higher PCE of 15.54% than that for C1-CN:F13 (14.23%) and C1-CN:IDT-IC (6.17%). Although the open circuit voltage (VOC) for the C1-CN:IDT-IC:F13 ternary organic solar cell is lower than that for C1-CN:F13, the improved PCE is mainly due to the increased values of short circuit current and fill factor. The improvement in the fill factor may be attributed to the enhanced charge transport and minimal recombination loss due to the enhanced phase separation in the ternary films. The increase in the short circuit current is attributed to the increased interfacial area for exciton dissociation and the effective utilization of excitons via the energy transfer for IDT-IC to F13.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted increasing interest as one of the most promising candidates for the transformation of solar energy into electrical energy owing to distinctive advantages such as mechanical flexibility, light weight, semitransparency, and low-cost solution processibility.1–6 Most efficient OSCs are created using a bulk-heterojunction active layer consisting of the blend of an electron donor and an electron acceptor to provide a nanoscale morphology for effectual exciton dissociation and charge transport.7 After the invention of small molecule fullerene-free acceptors (FFAs) with A–D–A type ITIC in 20158 and A–DA'D–A type Y6 in 2019,9 the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increased rapidly and exceeded 18% for single bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) binary OSCs10–16 but was still low compared to silicon-based solar cells and perovskite solar cells. Therefore, the current research is aimed at further boosting the performance of OSCs so that these devices can be commercialized more effectively at a low cost. Apart from designing new photoactive materials by the chemical approach, the new concept of the ternary film, i.e., adding another component (donor or acceptor) to the binary BHJ active layer has been established as an efficient approach to enhancing the PCE of the OSCs.17–21 A ternary BHJ active layer can be prepared by either two donors (2D)/one acceptor (1A) or one donor (1D)/two acceptors (2A). Compared to binary BHJ-OSCs, the ternary active layer-based OSCs have been demonstrated to have many advantages such as increased light-harvesting via broadening the optical absorption profile, efficient exciton dissociation, as well as charge separation via the optimization of the phase-separated nanoscale morphology of the active layer. Additionally, various mechanisms, which include charge transfer, energy transfer, and the formation of the alloy, have been observed and additional research has been dedicated to developing the OSCs based on a ternary system. Recently, the PCE of the ternary BHJ-based OSCs has reached more than 19%.22–25
Most of the efficient binary and ternary OSCs have employed conjugated polymers as the donors but some inherent drawbacks, such as batch-to-batch variations, restrict their applications for commercialization. Mono-dispersed small molecules can effectively solve the issues that arise in the batch-to-batch variations during the production process.26–31 A lot of research has been devoted to developing all-small-molecule OSCs, and PCEs in the range of 15–17% have been attained for binary and ternary devices.32–38
Herein, we have used two FFAs, i.e., one narrow bandgap and the other medium bandgap, denoted as F1339 and IDT-IC,40 respectively, and a wide bandgap small molecule C1-CN donor41 for the construction of ternary ASM-OSCs. The chemical structures of these molecules are shown in Fig. 1a. To compare the performance of ternary OSCs, we have also prepared binary OSCs using C1-CN:IDT-IC and C1-CN:F13 binary BHJ active layers. We found that the ternary OSCs (C1-CN:IDT-IC:F13) showed an optimized PCE of 15.54%, which is higher than the binary BHJ OSCs prepared with C1-CN:IDT-IC (6.17%) and C1-CN:F13 (14.23%). The increase in the PCE for ternary OSCs has been related to the effective use of excitons via the energy transfer from IDT-IC to F13, increased D/A interfacial area for exciton dissociation, charge transport, and suppressed charge recombination.

Results and discussion
As displayed in Fig. 1b, in thin films, C1-CN showed absorptions from 300–600 nm (peak at 536 nm), F13 from 600–900 nm with a maximum at 790 nm, and IDT-IC from 550–790 nm with a maximum at 712 nm. The absorption spectra of these materials are complementary to each other, which is beneficial for effective light harvesting for the ternary OSCs with a wide absorption range from 300 nm to 900 nm and is favorable for achieving a high photocurrent.
The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of these materials were determined in thin films by means of cyclic voltammetry as reported in our previous publications and displayed in Fig. 1c. In the OSCs, after the absorption of photons, excitons are generated in the photoactive layer and diffuse towards the D/A interfaces followed by subsequent exciton dissociation and charge transport. The charge transfer, i.e., electron transfer (ET) and hole transfer (HT) depend upon the LUMO and HOMO offsets between donor and acceptor, respectively. The high LUMO offset between the C1-CN and F13 or IDT-IC provides a sufficient driving force for the ET from the donor (C1-CN) to the acceptor (F13 or IDT-IC). However, the HOMO offsets for C1-CN/F13 and C1-CN/IDT-IC are 0.10 eV and 0.05 eV, respectively. To get information about the HT from the acceptors (F13 or IDT-IC) to the donor C1-CN, the thin-film photoluminescence (PL) studies were performed for the pristine acceptors (F13 and IDT-IC) and blend (F13:C1-CN and IDT-IC-Cl:C1-CN) films (Fig. S1 (ESI†). The PL intensity of F13 is almost quenched in the F13:C1-CN blended film as compared to that for IDT-IC in IDT-IC:C1-CN, indicating that the small HOMO offset between F13/IDT-IC and C1-CN is sufficient for the HT in the OSCs as reported for most of the fullerene-free OSCs.42–44 The PL intensity in the case of C1-CN/IDT-IC is not fully quenched, which demonstrates that the HT from the IDT-IC to C1-CN is hampered and results in a low value of JSC in OSCs. When F13 is mixed with the host C1-CN:IDT-IC blend, the PL intensity is appreciably quenched, signifying effective exciton dissociation and hole transfer from the acceptors to the donor in the ternary blend. Moreover, as can be seen from Fig. S2 (ESI†), the PL intensity is more efficiently dissociated into free charge carriers and the subsequent electron transfer from C1-CN to acceptors.
We have constructed binary and ternary BHJ OSCs with F13 or IDT-IC as the acceptor and C1-CN as the donor using the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN/Al device structure. Device preparation and characterization details are given in the ESI.† The weight ratios between the donor and acceptor were varied using chloroform as the processing solvent. We have found that for C1-CN:F13 and C1-CN:IDT-IC binary devices, the 1:1.2 ratio gave the optimal PCE (Tables S1 and S2, ESI†). After that, we exposed the optimized active layer to THF for 40 s for solvent vapor annealing. The current–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized active layer under illumination (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) are demonstrated in Fig. 2a and their photovoltaic factors are presented in Table 1.

The optimized C1-CN:F13 and C1-CN:IDT-IC binary OSCs gave an overall PCE of 14.23% (JSC = 23.24 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.98 V and FF = 0.68) and 6.17% (JSC =11.42 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.86 V and FF = 0.63), respectively. The higher VOC value for F13 is associated with the up-shifted LUMO energy level of F13 compared to IDT-IC. The EQE spectra of the OSCs are displayed in Fig. 2b. The EQE spectrum of the IDT-IC-based OSC is restricted only to 800 nm, whereas it is extended to 890 nm for the F13 counterpart. Moreover, the EQE value for IDT-IC is significantly lower than that for the F13 counterpart, showing the generation of more excitons in the F13-based OSC than in IDT-IC. The HOMO energy offset between IDT-IC and C1-CN is very small (0.05 eV), which may hamper the HT from IDT-IC to C1-CN, and may be the cause of the poor JSC value for IDT-IC-based OSC. The JSC values estimated from EQE spectra are 11.23 mA cm−2 and 21.12 mA cm−2, respectively, for IDT-IC and F13, and are consistent with the values achieved from illuminated J–V characteristics.
The absorption spectrum of the C1-CN:F13 film (Fig. S3, in ESI†) shows a band dip at around 610 nm; therefore we incorporated a medium bandgap electron acceptor IDT-IC into this binary blend to form the ternary OSCs. The OSC performance was optimized by varying the weight ratios between two acceptors (IDT-IC and F13) and the weight concentration of C1-CN was kept constant. The ternary active layer C1-CN:IDT-IC:F13 (1:0.3:0.9) attained the best PCE as compared to the binary counterparts (Table S3 ESI†). To further fine-tune the morphology of the ternary active layer, we exposed the optimized blend film to THF vapor for 40 s. The J–V plots under the illumination of the optimized binary and ternary OSC are displayed in Fig. 2a and the photovoltaic data are collected in Table 1. The ternary OSCs attained a PCE of 15.54% with JSC = 23.24 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.93 V and FF = 0.72. The VOC value in the case of the ternary OSCs is lower as compared to the C1-CN:F13 and higher than the C1-CN:IDT-IC binary BHJ counterparts. As can be seen in Table S3 (ESI†), the value of VOC decreased by increasing the weight ratio of IDT-IC, demonstrating the formation of an alloy between two acceptors.45–47 We measured the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the optimized mixed IDT-IC:F13 (0.3:0.9) acceptors from the cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S4, ESI†), which are located at −5.62 and −3.87 eV, respectively, and lie between the F13 and IDT-IC; this also supports the validity of the alloy formation. The increased JSC may be associated with increased light absorption efficiency and greater charge dissociation and charge transport by creating additional channels for electron and hole extraction.48,49 The EQE photo-responses for the binary and ternary OSCs are also shown in Fig. 2b. The EQE spectra of the C1-CN:F13 showed a broad photoresponse from 300 to 900 nm, but quite low values between 550 nm and 700 nm. When a small quantity of IDT-IC was incorporated, the EQE increased significantly in this wavelength region and attained a higher integrated JSC of 23.06 mA cm−2. This value is in decent agreement with the JSC value extracted from J-V plots. It is established that the EQE response to the OSCs is governed by the light-harvesting efficiency, exciton dissociation, charge transport and collection.50,51 As can be seen from Fig. 2b, the EQE value for the ternary OSCs is higher than that for binary C1-CN:F13, which may have resulted from the enhanced light harvesting and increased utilization ability of the ternary active layer.50 The value of series resistance (Rs) estimated from the J–V characteristics (Fig. 2a) is lower (Rs = 2.93 Ω cm2) than that for binary C1-CN:F13 (3.23 Ω cm2), which is also beneficial for achieving a high value of FF (0.72) for ternary OSCs.
In the ternary OSCs using one donor and two acceptors, energy transfer20,52 and charge transfer53 from the guest acceptor to the host acceptor are the dominant mechanisms. In order to get information about these mechanisms, we have measured the PL spectra of neat IDT-IC, F13, and the optimized IDT-IC:F13 blend (excited at 720 nm, corresponding to the absorption peak of IDT-IC (Fig. 3a)). We have observed that the PL intensity corresponding to F13 is increased in the IDT-IC:F13 blend, whereas the PL intensity of IDT-IC is almost completely quenched. This demonstrates the occurrence of Förster energy transfer from IDT-IC to F13 in the ternary OSC resulting from the overlapping of the PL spectrum of IDT-IC with the absorption spectrum of F13 (Fig. 3b) and the energy transfer from IDT-IC from F13 is shown in Fig. 4. To validate the possibility of charge transfer between two acceptors in the ternary OSC, we constructed the devices using pristine acceptors (F13 and IDT-IC) and a mixed optimized weight ratio of acceptors and found that the device based on the mixed acceptor attained JSC of 0.45 mA cm−2, which lies in between the devices based on IDT-IC (0.28 mA cm−2) and F13 (0.56 mA cm−2). These results again confirm the lack of charge transfer between the acceptors in the ternary OSCs. The mechanism of energy transfer and charge transfer is shown in Fig. 4. In the ternary active layer, D/A interfaces are formed at C1-CN/F13 and C1-CN/IDT-IC and excitons generated in the C1-CN phase are dissociated into free charge carriers at both these interfaces and electrons are transferred from the LUMO of C1-CN to the LUMO of both acceptors (F13 or IDT-IC). The excitons generated in the acceptor IDT-IC and F13 phases are dissociated at C1-CN/IDT-IC and C1-CN/F13 interfaces, respectively and holes from either IDT-IC or F13 are transferred to C1-CN.

To understand the effect of mixing IDT-IC on the charge transference mechanism in the ternary OSCs, the values of hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) in the binary and ternary devices were investigated by the SCLC method in dark conditions and are depicted in Fig. S5a and S5b (ESI†), respectively.54 The details about the calculation of μh and μe are described in the ESI.† The calculated values of the charge carrier mobilities in the binary and ternary blends are presented in Table 2. The μe and μh values of the ternary active layer were increased and attained a μh/μe ratio closer to unity as compared to the binary counterparts, indicating that the charge transport is more balanced in the ternary device compared to binary counterparts, which must be responsible for the greater values of FF and JSC values in ternary OSCs.

The illumination intensity (Pin) dependence of JSC and VOC was investigated to explore the charge carrier recombination kinetics in binary as well as in ternary OSCs (Fig. 5).55 The α values determined from JSC ∝(Pin)α were 0.988 for the ternary device and 0.903 (C1-CN:IDT-IC) and 0.965 (C1-CN:F13) for binary devices, indicating that the bimolecular recombination is suppressed with the incorporation of IDT-IC into the C1-CN:F13 active layer.56 The association of VOC with Pin is stated as VOC ∝ (nkT/q) ln(Pin). The value of n for ternary OSC is about 1.09, which is relatively lower than the binary counterparts (1.24 and 1.36 for C1-CN:F13 and C1-CN:IDT-IC, respectively), demonstrating that the trap-assisted recombination also diminished in the ternary devices.57 The reduction of both bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination in the ternary OSCs also validates the higher JSC and FF values.58

In most of the BHJ-OSCs, the photocurrent generation involves sequential steps such as exciton generation by the absorption of photons and their diffusion towards the D/A interfaces and subsequent dissociation, charge separation, and finally their transportation and collection at the electrodes. Therefore, to gain knowledge about the exciton generation rate (Gmax), exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss = JSC/Jsat under short circuit current), and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll = Jph/Jsat, under maximum power point), the relationship between the photocurrent (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) was investigated (Fig. 6) and the data are presented in Table 2. The description to estimate the values of Jph and Veff is given in the ESI.† Initially, Jph of both binary and ternary devices increased with the increase in Veff and arrived at a saturation value (Jsat) at high Veff, where photogenerated excitons were dissociated into free charge carriers and collected by the electrodes. The ηdiss and ηcoll of ternary devices were higher as compared to the binary devices, resulting in more efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction without recombination and higher JSC and FF.59,60 The Gmax can be assessed as Gmax = Jsat/qL, where q and L are the electronic charge and thickness of the active layer and the values are compiled in Table 2. The higher Gmax values for the ternary blend than the binary blends are in agreement with the absorption profile of the blended films since the exciton generation rate is directly related to the light-harvesting ability of the OSCs. These data demonstrate that when IDT-IC is added as the third element in the C1-CN binary blend, it improves the exciton generation, exciton dissociation, and charge collection. As presented in Fig. 6, compared to binary OSCs, the Jph rapidly arrives at saturation for the ternary counterpart under a relatively low value of Veff, indicating more efficient charge transport in the ternary active layer, leading to the highest value of FF of 0.72.61–63

The phase separation morphology of the blend films was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 7 shows that the incorporation of IDT-IC into the C1-CN:F13 BHJ active layer forms a more appropriate nano-scale phase separation interpenetrating network morphology as compared to the binary BHJ active layer, which is conducive to proficient exciton dissociation as well as charge transport.

The molecular packing and crystallinity of the blend films were investigated using in-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and are shown in Fig. 8. After the addition of IDT-IC to the C1-CN:F13 blend, the intensity of the (010) diffraction peak corresponding to π–π stacking increased and shifted to a longer diffraction angle. The crystal coherence length (CCL) values assessed from the Scherrer equation are 2.51 nm and 3.19 nm for C1-CN:F13 and C1:IDT-IC:F13, respectively. The increase in the CCL values of the ternary BHJ film signifies that the incorporation of IDT-IC contributes to relatively larger (010) ordered crystallites in the ternary film. The π–π stacking distance for the ternary active layer (0.352 nm) is smaller than that for the binary system (0.36 nm), which is beneficial for efficient charge transport.64,65

We have measured the efficiency of these OSCs after 10 days and the efficiency of C1-CN:IDT-IC, C1-CN:F13 and C1-CN:IDT-IC:F13 dropped to 5.11%, 13.38% and 14.88%, respectively, indicating that the ternary OSC is more stable than its binary counterparts.
Conclusions
In summary, we have fabricated all-small-molecule ternary OSCs employing the wide bandgap C1-CN as the donor and two complementary absorbing fullerene-free acceptors (IDT-IC and F13) and attained a higher PCE of 15.54% than that for the binary C1-CN:F13 (14.23%) and C1-CN:IDT-IC (6.17%) devices. The enhanced PCE for the C1-CN:IDT-IC:F13 ternary BHJ as compared to C1-CN:F13 binary BHJ is largely due to the improved values of JSC and FF. The increased JSC is linked with the higher light harvesting efficacy of the ternary active layer, leading to more exciton generation, increased interfacial area for efficient exciton dissociation, and the successful utilization of excitons via energy transfer from IDT-IC to F13. The enhanced FF is associated with more appropriate phase separation, leading to efficient charge transport and reduced recombination.
