    , Accepted 10th October 2011First published on 3rd November 2011AbstractThe processing parameters for photoanodes that are printable in a room-temperature (RT) continuous process for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) were optimized by the use of Genetic Algorithm (GA). The photoanodes were prepared at RT from mixtures of partially dyed-TiO2 (PDT) with various sizes and dye-loadings and were subsequently compressed for the fabrication of PDT films with different compositions, nanoporous structures, and thicknesses. According to our decision parameter design, there were 220 different cases, from which only 30 chromosomes for each generation were selected for the testing of photovoltaic performance to determine the global optimal point in power conversion efficiency (η). After 7 generations (i.e., only 210 chromosomes tested out of 220), η reached 6.02%, which was 22% higher than the value reported previously without the aid of a GA. The photoanode composed of a mixture of 14, 21, and 40 nm TiO2 with different dye-loadings and compressed to a thickness of 8.0 μm under 94 MPa showed the highest η (short circuit current = 12.03 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage = 685 mV, fill factor = 72.8%). A comparison of the photovoltaic parameters and characteristic charge transport properties revealed that sparsely dyed small TiO2 provided an efficient electron transport route to increase the short circuit current. The role of large TiO2 dyed up to monolayer coverage, on the other hand, was also disclosed to partially increase the short circuit current by light scattering. We hope that the GA-assisted photoanode optimization, presented here, will encourage new directions in research while providing an efficient RT printing process for the continuous fabrication of DSCs.
1. Introduction
Since the first report on an efficient solar energy conversion based on TiO2/Ru complexes/redox couple,1Dye-sensitized Solar Cells (DSCs) have attracted much attention due to their unique advantages over Si-based solar cells along with an appreciable power conversion efficiency (η). As a result of extensive research during the past 20 years, an η of more than 10% for a single cell can now be easily attained and the commercialization of DSCs is expected in the near future.2 However, for a successful launching of DSCs into the commercial market, other aspects such as the economical production of large-scale photoanodes must be taken into account. In this regard, TiO2 film preparation by printing on a flexible plastic substrate at room temperature (RT) is being actively investigated for the low-cost production of DSCs. This includes chemical sintering,3 compression,4–6electrophoretic deposition,7etc.8,9 Some of these resulted in an η higher than 7.0%,4 but they are far removed from the printing of a photoanode in a continuous manner for the following reason.
In addition to the preparation of a stable TiO2 paste that can maintain a colloidal stability during printing without organic stabilizers,10 the key aspect that must be considered is the minimization of the dye adsorption time. The appreciable time necessary for dye adsorption complicates the adaptation of the fabrication of DSCs to a continuous printing process. For example, this is critical for DSCs fabricated by a roll-to-roll printing process. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work on the RT fabrication of a photoanode has addressed this point. The RT process mentioned above3–9 cannot be directly applied to a continuous printing process due to the necessary long-term dye adsorption. Although the simultaneous injection of dye and electrolyte has previously been reported,11 a TiO2 photoanode is generally dipped in a dye solution for more than 10 hours to ensure a complete monolayer coverage of dye molecules on the TiO2 surface. An increase in the dye concentration can reduce the dipping time,12 but the process still requires several hours.
In order to simultaneously solve these two problems (stability and dye adsorption time), we have proposed a new RT fabrication method of photoanodes for DSCs.13 In that work, we utilized the partially dyed-TiO2 (PDT) dispersion that was subjected to the subsequent compression. This strategy was contrasted with the conventional pressurization method,4–7 in that the time for dye-adsorption was not required during the continuous fabrication of photoanodes. In addition, compared with bare TiO2, PDT was more compatible with common organic solvents. By controlling the amount of dyes adsorbed onto TiO2 (21 nm) in the previous work, we attained an η of 4.9%, addressing that the strategy using PDT was adequate for a continuous RT printing process.
The PDT in association with the compression was a new approach with no precedent to which we could refer. The optimal conditions for efficient electron transport of conventional DSCs might not be directly applicable to the PDT system, as pre-dyed TiO2 was used in the present study. This means that the η of PDT-based DSCs has plenty of room for improvement by optimizing the processing conditions consisting of a number of parameters. In this regard, we introduced Genetic Algorithm (GA) that is well known as an efficient global optimization tool based on a stochastic optimization skill and is often utilized to obtain a solution for multi-dimensional problems14–16 in the development of new functional materials.17–20 The introduction of the GA enabled us to significantly improve photovoltaic performance to the global maximal point (i.e., highest η), which was certainly higher than the previously reported value.13
In the present study, we optimized the η by maximizing the forward electron transport and minimizing the backward electron transfer, which was accomplished by the judicious combination of several processing parameters such as TiO2 size, amount of pre-adsorbed dyes, film nanostructure, and film thickness. It is our opinion that optimization would be impossible without the aid of a stochastic optimization skill because the full screening of at least 220 different cells, according to our experimental design, was impossible using one-by-one experimental confirmation of the η. As GA execution proceeded, the highest η at each generation steeply increased to 6.0% up to the 5th generation and stayed invariant for the 6th and 7th generations, which is indicative of the effectiveness of GA. The best performance was obtained from the photoanode (compressed at 94 MPa to 8 μm) composed of PDT of small (14 nm) and large (40 nm) particle sizes dyed at 2.84 × 10−11 and 11.2 × 10−11 mol cm−2 respectively, together with 80% of regular-size TiO2 (21 nm) dyed at 7.66 × 10−11 mol cm−2.
2. Experimental section
2.1. 
          PDT preparation and cell fabrication

          PDT
          nanoparticles were prepared by dipping various sizes of TiO2 (7, 14, 21, and 40 nm) in different concentrations of N3 (3, 7, 12, and 17 mM). After shaking overnight, PDT was collected, washed, and dried at RT. In this way, we prepared 16 kinds of PDT with different sizes and dye-loadings. Hereafter, the various sizes of TiO2, 7, 14, 21, and 40 nm, will be referred to as T1, T2, T3, and T4, respectively. Also, the abbreviations D1, D2, D3, and D4 will be used in reference to TiO2 dyed in 3, 7, 12, and 17 mM N3 solutions (for example, T1D1 means 7 nm TiO2 dyed in 3 mM N3). Dye desorption studies were carried out to spectroscopically determine the amount of dye molecules on each PDT. The detailed procedure for dye adsorption and desorption is explained in the ESI†. As expected, the dye-loadings increased with an increase in the N3 concentration (Fig. 1). Both the dye-loading per unit weight and the dye coverage per unit surface area of TiO2 increased with an increase in the N3 concentration. However, as the amount of N3 approached saturation (monolayer coverage) at high concentrations of N3, the slope gradually decreased in all cases examined. Fig. 1A indicates that the amount of dye per g TiO2 varied with TiO2 particle size due to different surface areas. T1 exhibited the largest value due to the highest surface area. On the other hand, the behavior of the dye coverage per unit surface area with particle size was reversed, as shown in Fig. 1B. While the surface of T2, T3, and T4 seemed to be saturated with N3 in 17 mM solutions, the dye coverage for T1 (7.54 × 10−11 mol cm−2) even in 17 mM of N3 was far below the monolayer coverage.21 The preparation of photoanodes and the fabrication of complete DSCs are described in more detail in the ESI†.

2.2. Genetic Algorithm and decision parameter design
In order to improve the cell performance of a DSC equipped with a RT-processed photoanode, we utilized the GA strategy enabling the optimization of η in a multidimensional decision parameter space. GA is one of the most widely used tactics of heuristics optimization, which is a stochastic global search method that mimics natural biological evolution. GA operates on a population of potential solutions, adopting Darwin's principle of survival of the fittest. Techniques such as encoding (and decoding) of decision parameters, selection, insertion (elitism), crossover, and mutation are used in GA. GA makes populations evolve, that is, it makes individuals that are better suited to an artificially determined environment survive. GA usually starts from a population of randomly generated individuals (randomly generated processing conditions out of the decision parameter space that we designed in the present study). In the first generation, the fitness (objective function value) of every individual in the population is evaluated and multiple individuals are stochastically selected from the current population based on their fineness (e.g., roulette-wheel or tournament selection). In the present study, the fitness evaluation process was achieved by the actual experiment. We did not employ any equation type fitness function. Instead, the fitness evaluation was solely based on experimental values in the present study. The selected individuals are then modified by crossover and mutation to form a new population. One or a few brilliant individuals in the former generation are generally copied and inherited to the next generation without any GA operations so as to maintain the excellence. The elitism can also be obtained by selecting multiple individuals in the combined population of two or more ensuing generations. The new population created by the GA operations is then used for the next iteration of the algorithm. The main idea of GA is that the string of decision parameters is regarded as a chromosome and each parameter can be thought of as a gene.17–20 In the present study, the processing parameters are decision parameters, which can be encoded into a binary code to constitute a chromosome.
The decision parameters were types of PDT (i.e., TiO2 (T1, T2, T3, T4) having different amounts of N3 adsorbed (D1, D2, D3, D4)) and their relative compositions. The initial film thickness (L) prior to compression was also parameterized at 8 degrees of freedom. The extent of compression was also included as a decision parameter with 4 degrees of freedom. The parameter space was constituted as follows. First, by combining all different sizes of TiO2 (T1, T2, T3, and T4) and all different dye amounts (D1, D2, D3, and D4), we constituted 16 combinations such as T1D1, T2D3, T3D1, T4D3, etc. Out of the total of 16 combinations, 4 were selected for each photoelectrode excluding duplicated adoption of the same size of TiO2, such that the selection from the total number of 28 cases could be available. Secondly, we determined the relative weight fractions of the PDT. While the weight percentages of T2 and T3 varied from 0–100% with a 10% interval, the T1- and T4-based PDT was limited to a 0 to 30% range. This produced a total number of cases that reached 27. We controlled the initial film thickness (before compression) by the solid content of the PDT dispersion and the tape thickness during doctor blading (23 cases). Finally, we changed the pressure forced onto PDT films at 4 different loads (22 cases). It should be mentioned that the final film thickness also depends on the PDT composition. Therefore, each film had an independent thickness although the doctor blading conditions (i.e., solid content and tape thickness) and pressure were the same. For instance, a film thickness of 15.5 μm for 100% T3D1 can be compared with a thickness of 20.3 μm for 30% T1D3 and 70% T3D1 with other parameters being fixed. The decision parameter space constituted in this way included discrete 28 × 27 × 23 × 22 = 220 cases (for the decision parameters in detail, please refer to the ESI†). After that, we created the first set (=the first generation) consisting of 30 individuals via a random selection from the decision parameter space, and their processing conditions were encoded into binary codes to constitute each chromosome.
2.3. Characterization
The J–V characteristics of the DSCs were measured under simulated AM 1.5 solar illumination with 100 mW cm−2 (300W Xenon lamp, Oriel Instruments). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the DSCs was carried out in the dark using a potentiostat/galvanostat (PARSTAT 2273). The EIS spectra were recorded for frequencies ranging from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. An AC amplitude of ±10 mV was applied at various bias potentials. Characteristic parameters for charge transport in DSCs were analyzed using ZView software (DX type11-Bisquert #2). Visible spectra were recorded by a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (V670, JASCO). Film thickness was measured using a FESEM (Hitachi S4800) and a profilometer (Tencor Alpha-step 500). Incident photon-to-current efficiency (M-74100, Newport) was also recorded to confirm the effect of minor components on the photovoltaic performance.
3. Results and discussion
In a previous report,13 we found that PDT composed of a single size TiO2 (21 nm) can be used for the RT fabrication of photoanodes reaching a conversion efficiency of 4.9–5.0% with a dye-loading of 9.0 × 10−11 mol cm−2. In that study, we found that the electron transport resistance through compressed PDT was too high to ignore even at high forward bias voltage. When comparing the charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, it had a similar order of magnitude, suggesting that further improvement in the η could be attained by decreasing the electron transport resistance and/or increasing the charge transfer resistance. In order to tackle this point, we used a mixture of PDT with different TiO2 sizes and dye-loadings, simultaneously controlling the film thickness and the nanoporous structure. Since 220 samples should be fabricated and evaluated for a complete screening of our decision parameter space, we made use of GA to determine the global optimal point from a reasonable number of samples. In each generation, 30 chromosomes were tested. 6 samples with an identical composition and processing conditions were prepared for each chromosome. Among the 6 experimental values obtained, the highest and the lowest η were omitted for the calculation of the average η. An average η of 4 samples for every chromosome in each generation are shown in Fig. 2 (color bars). In the 1st generation, the average η was spread widely across a 1.5 to 5.0% range. It is interesting that the highest η of 4.9%, which was the same as the maximum reported previously, was obtained even from the randomly selected 1st generation. For the 2nd generation consisting of another set of chromosomes, which were created by the GA operations of the results from the 1st generation, the width of the η variation was reduced and more importantly, the highest η was increased to 5.3%. A concomitant up-shift of the lowest η was also distinct, implying that the GA was working properly. In this way, the generations were repeated up to the 7th generation and finally reached an average of 5.94% (the highest cell showed 6.02%). Note that the average η for 30 chromosomes in each generation (filled circles in Fig. 2) continued to increase, but the highest η reached the steady state from the 5th generation (open circles in Fig. 2). For the photovoltaic performances of all individual samples (840 cells) for every generation, please refer to the ESI†.

There is no definitive way to determine whether we reached the exact global optimum, because GA is a heuristics optimization strategy. It is customary to reiterate GA executions until a satisfactory outcome is obtained. In the case of calculation-based GA executions, more than several hundreds of iterations are possible to reach the global optimum point. It should be noted, however, that we adopted an experimental evaluation of the objective function. The experimental evaluation of the objective function means that we had to actually produce 180 DSC samples for a generation, which is a considerable experimental burden. Therefore, we stopped the GA at the 7th generation, based on our stopping criterion; if the highest η is not improved for 3 consecutive generations then GA is stopped. A significant improvement in fitness is generally known to take place earlier than the tenth generation and only a slight improvement is available thereafter. Even though the exact objective function shape of our problem is unknown, it is not likely that the terrain of the present objective function would vary dramatically. This means that the highest η we obtained would be very close to the global optimum η value.
The highest η was obtained from the photoanode with an initial thickness of 13 μm, which was composed of 10% T2D1, 80% T3D2, and 10% T4D4 and pressurized at 94 MPa to give an 8.0 μm thickness (5G-9, 6G-30, and 7G-30 in the ESI†). FESEM images of 7G-30 indicated that PDT particles of different sizes were well dispersed, showing no high density region of T2D1 or T4D4 (Fig. 3). Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy also revealed that the Ru/Ti ratio for T2D1 was as low as one-sixth that of T4D4. Although EDX results can be sometimes complicated by the information from a bulk, we consider this noticeable difference in the dye content as the evidence of no dye-molecule exchange between sparsely dyed-TiO2 and densely dyed-TiO2 (i.e., no desorption and re-adsorption of dye molecules occurred in a PDT mixture). The photoanode including T1 resulted in inferior performance, regardless of the dye-loading and weight fraction. Compare the η values for the pairs with the same weight fraction of T1 plus T2 [3G-12 (30% T1D1, 20% T2D4, η = 3.68%) vs.5G-12 (10% T1D1, 40% T2D4, η = 5.84%), 4G-4 (30% T1D3, 20% T2D4, η = 4.40%) vs. 6G-7(10% T1D3, 40% T2D4, η = 4.97%), and 6G-12 (no T1, 20% T2D1, η = 5.53%) vs.7G-8 (10% T1D4, 10% T2D1, η = 5.35%)] in the ESI†. In all cases, the sample including more T1 and less T2 showed the lower η. A plausible reason is that 7 nm TiO2 (T1) is so small as to prevent the diffusion of electrolytes. It is also interesting that T3D2 with a surface coverage of 7.66 × 10−11 mol cm−2 is a major component rather than T3D3 (surface coverage = 9.75 × 10−11 mol cm−2). As mentioned above, we previously reported that T3 with a surface coverage of 9.00 × 10−11 mol cm−2 resulted in the best photovoltaic performance.13 This appears to imply that T2D1 and T4D4 are counter-balancing the shortage of dye molecules in T3 by enhancing the light-harvesting process in a certain way.

The highest η was obtained from the photoanode with an initial thickness of 13 μm, which was composed of 10% T2D1, 80% T3D2, and 10% T4D4 and pressurized at 94 MPa to give an 8.0 μm thickness (5G-9, 6G-30, and 7G-30 in the ESI†). FESEM images of 7G-30 indicated that PDT particles of different sizes were well dispersed, showing no high density region of T2D1 or T4D4 (Fig. 3). Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy also revealed that the Ru/Ti ratio for T2D1 was as low as one-sixth that of T4D4. Although EDX results can be sometimes complicated by the information from a bulk, we consider this noticeable difference in the dye content as the evidence of no dye-molecule exchange between sparsely dyed-TiO2 and densely dyed-TiO2 (i.e., no desorption and re-adsorption of dye molecules occurred in a PDT mixture.) The photoanode including T1 resulted in inferior performance, regardless of the dye-loading and weight fraction. Compare the η values for the pairs with the same weight fraction of T1 plus T2 (3G-12 and 5G-12, 4G-4 and 6G-7, 6G-12 and 7G-8, and 4G-9 and 5G-12) in the ESI†. In all cases, the sample including more T1 and less T2 showed the lower η. A plausible reason is that 7 nm TiO2 (T1) is so small as to prevent the diffusion of electrolytes. It is also interesting that T3D2 with a surface coverage of 7.66 × 10−11 mol cm−2 is a major component rather than T3D3 (surface coverage = 9.75 × 10−11 mol cm−2). As mentioned above, we previously reported that T3 with a surface coverage of 9.00 × 10−11 mol cm−2 resulted in the best photovoltaic performance.13 This appears to imply that T2D1 and T4D4 are counter-balancing the shortage of dye molecules in T3 by enhancing the light-harvesting process in a certain way.

Fig. 4 (top) compares current–voltage (J–V) curves of G7-30 and a cell consisting of 100% T3D2 (prepared by the same conditions as G7-30, with the exception of the omission of T2D1 and T4D4). The short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (ff), and η were 12.07 mA cm−2, 687 mV, 72.6%, and 6.02% for G7-30 and 8.97 mA cm−2, 730 mV, 75.4%, and 4.94% for 100% T3D2, respectively. The most distinctive feature came from the difference in Jsc. Considering that the amount of dyes in G7-30 (5.23 × 10−5 mol g−1TiO2) was less than that in 100% T3D2 (5.61 × 10−5 mol g−1TiO2), ca. 35% increase in Jsc on incorporating 10% T2D1 and 10% T4D4 was quite surprising. This increase in Jsc was partly offset by the 5.9% decrease in Voc, resulting in a 21.9% enhancement in the η. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was also compared in Fig. 4 (bottom). As expected, the IPCE of G7-30 reached 61% at 530 nm, which is 32.6% higher than that of 100% T3D2. This fact again indicates that the higher η of G7-30 is mainly due to the increase in Jsc, despite the lower dye-loading.

In order to elucidate the reason for a higher Jsc and a lower Voc for G7-30, we investigated the charge transport characteristics in the dark. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed by applying small perturbations over a steady state. Fig. 5 compares the EIS spectra of G7-30 and 100% T3D2, measured in a frequency range of 0.1–105 Hz with a magnitude of the alternating signal of 10 mV at a forward bias of 650 mV. While large semicircles appeared in the low frequency region due to the interfacial charge transfer look similar to each other, the distinguishable difference in the high frequency region was evident. A DSC composed of 100% T3D2 exhibits a Warburg-like diffusion behavior in the high frequency region, indicating that the electron transport through TiO2 film cannot be ignored at this potential (see the inset).22 On the other hand, the DSC fabricated with G7-30 shows a distinct small arc, associated with the charge transfer process at the counter electrode. This usually happens when the electron transport resistance (Rt) is negligibly small so that the current flow through the entire cell is substantial.22–26 In this case, the response due to the electron transport is undistinguishable from the small arc located in the high frequency region.22 We extracted characteristic charge transport parameters from the EIS spectra, using the diffusion-recombination transmission line model.22–26 The Rt of 2.47 Ω for G7-30 was contrasted with that of 76.65 Ω for 100% T3D2, implying a significantly higher conductivity of the photoanode for G7-30. However, the difference in the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the chemical capacitance (Cμ) between the two was relatively small. Values for Rct of 294 Ω and 316 Ω and for Cμ of 3.17 × 10−4 F and 3.89 × 10−4 F were obtained for G7-30 and 100% T3D2, respectively. From these values, we calculated the electron diffusion coefficient (Dn = L2Rt−1Cμ−1) and the electron life time (τn = RctCμ). While Dn and τn were 0.82 × 10−3 cm2 s−1 and 0.093 s for G7-30 (L = 8.0 μm), those were 1.9 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 and 0.123 s for 100% T3D2 (L = 7.6 μm). A 2 orders of magnitude difference in Dn with only a slight difference in τn explains the 34% rise in Jsc and 6.2% lowering in Voc for G7-30 relative to 100% T3D2.

We believe that this difference mainly results from the T2D1 incorporated in G3-70. Since the T2D1 has a significant fraction of uncovered TiO2 surface (dye coverage = 2.84 × 10−11 mol cm−2, see Fig. 1), it can provide efficient electron transport pathways through TiO2 when compressed, but it also brings about a fast back electron transfer (recombination to I3−). While the former enhances the photocurrent, the latter increases the dark current leading to the reduction of Voc. In G7-30, however, the increase in Jsc on adding T2D1 seems to dominate the decrease of Voc, resulting in an increase in η. The 10% T4D4 incorporated in G7-30 also likely contributed to the increase in Jsc. The comparison of 6G-14 (100% T3D2) and 7G-12 (80% T3D2, 20% T4D4) in the ESI† clearly shows that the incorporation of T4D4 (20% in this case) led to the increase in Jsc probably due to light scattering (the dye-loading was decreased by replacing T3D2 with T4D4, refer to Fig. 1A).
Conclusions
The continuous fabrication of DSCsvia various printing techniques is mandatory for the low cost manufacture of large area solar panels. The biggest hurdle in the continuous process is the dye-adsorption step, which takes from several to tens of hours to complete. One of the solutions is to use PDT, with careful control of the charge transport properties. In this work, we applied GA (a stochastic optimization strategy) for the improvement of η by optimizing RT printable photoanodes. We hope that this work will provide an efficient RT printing process for the continuous fabrication of DSCs.
We constructed 220 decision parameter sets including the weight fraction of PDT with various sizes of TiO2 and dye-loadings, various initial film thicknesses, and various magnitudes of pressure. From these parameter sets, we selected only 30 chromosomes for each generation. For each chromosome, 6 DSC samples (180 samples for one generation) were fabricated and their photovoltaic performances were tested. Based on the photovoltaic results obtained, the other 30 chromosomes for the next generation were selected via GA mimicking the natural gene replication process. In this manner, we finally confirmed the optimal point after the 7th generation. The photoanode exhibiting the best η (6.02%) was composed of 10% T2D1, 80% T3D2, and 10% T4D4 and compressed to a thickness of 8.0 μm from 13 μm. A comparison of charge transport characteristics extracted from EIS and photovoltaic performances revealed that T2D1 provided efficient electron transport routes and T4D4 contributed to the partial increase in Jsc due to light scattering. The concept of this work is schematized in Fig. 6.
