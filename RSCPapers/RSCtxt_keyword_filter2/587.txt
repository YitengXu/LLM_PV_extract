    , Accepted 12th December 2021First published on 13th December 2021AbstractA chiral aromatic amino acid, (S)-3-amino-4-phenylbutyric acid hydrochloride (s-APACl), was employed as an additive to the active layer in a p-i-n organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cell. This additive led to a better ordered crystal grain with vertical alignment and strongly n-dominated semiconducting properties of the perovskite layer. The s-APACl additive passivated the perovskite predominantly at grain boundaries rather than in the bulk. Both –CO and –NH3+ functional groups interacted strongly with the perovskite, forming coordination with the PbI2 cage, and passivated the defects at grain boundaries; they also reduced the trap or defect densities to suppress non-radiative recombination and to give enhanced photoluminescence with longer lifetimes, suppressed decomposition in the perovskite layer, stabilized the interface structure and reduced ion migration, which enhanced the stability of the device. A device with 1 mole% s-APACl showed an increase in power conversion efficiency to 21.02% (from 18.90% for the control device) with substantially enhanced operational stability. This work offers a comprehensive understanding of a multi-functional additive in a perovskite device.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a conventional n-i-p structure have been developed in recent years, and have achieved a high efficiency exceeding 25% using a low-cost solution process.1,2 Perovskite materials have been found to have a tuneable bandgap,3 high optical density,4 long carrier diffusion lengths and lifetimes,5 low exciton binding energies,6,7 and bipolar carrier mobility.8 In an inverted (p-i-n) perovskite device structure, the maximal power conversion efficiency (PCE) reached 22.7%.9
Despite these striking optoelectronic and semiconducting properties, inherent problems such as the toxicity,10 ion migration,8,11,12 and poor reliability of perovskite materials due to defects at grain boundaries or interfaces13 resulted in the instability of these devices and have hindered the commercialization of PSCs.14 The majority of perovskite films fabricated using a solution process are polycrystalline with grains ranging from hundreds of nanometres to tens of microns which are surrounded by defects, such as under-coordinated bonds (i.e., Pb2+, I−, Br−), lead clusters (Pb0), vacancies (i.e.,  and ), and anti-site defects (i.e.,  and ) in the Kröger–Vink notation.15,16 These become non-radiative recombination centres and deteriorate the performance and stability of the device. In addition, the volatile methylamine cation may decompose and be converted to CH3NH2 and HI at elevated temperatures.17 It has been proved that grain boundaries are the dominant channels for ion migration.18 Ion migration in PSCs is related to the hysteresis of the devices and is assumed to be the main issue leading to the instability of PSCs.19 Light-induced reactions may also lower the activation energy of ion migration.20 These factors all accelerate the degradation of the device, and these problems cannot be simply overcome by encapsulation.21
Substantial efforts have been made to improve the performance and stability of PSCs, such as tuning of their composition,22 additive engineering,23,24 interface engineering25,26 and the application of a barrier layer.27,28 Of these, additive engineering is the simplest approach in terms of the fabrication of a high-performance device, and is the focus of this work. Early investigations demonstrated that solvent additives were able to tune the crystalline morphology by varying the nucleus formation and crystallization processes, which enhanced the crystal size and effectively minimized defect formation.29,30 Due to their ionic characteristics, molecules with electron acceptor or donor groups (Lewis acid or base) and ionic species were found to be more effective for the passivation of defects via the use of coordinate31,32 or ionic33,34 bonds to reduce the density of deep level traps. Extended conjugation has also been found to be useful in removing free I2 species via charge transfer formation with a conjugated ring.35 Defect passivation is able to reduce non-radiative recombination and enhance radiative light emission with longer lifetimes36 and can also lead to an increase in the open circuit voltage (Voc)37 and suppress ion migration.34
In recent years, zwitterions or multifunctional molecules containing different functional groups have been developed to passivate perovskite. High-performance PSCs have been achieved. Yang et al. demonstrated that phenylalanine (containing carboxyl, amine, and, phenyl groups) is much more effective in passivating perovskite surface defects than phenylpropionic acid (or phenethylamine) with a carboxyl (or amine) group alone or a mixture of the two.35 By designing a multifunctional molecule, D-4-tert-butyl-phenylalanine, they were able to achieve perovskite cells with an extremely small Voc deficit. Mei et al. used 5-ammoniumvaleric acid iodide (5-AVA), an amino acid salt, as an additive, which substantially enhanced the performance of the device. However, the 5AVA group acting as a cation entered the perovskite lattice.38–40 It appears that the interaction between a multifunctional molecule and perovskite is complex. The current understanding of the physics and chemistry of the passivation of a perovskite layer by multifunctional organics is limited, and requires further investigation. Different fabrication processes may lead to variation in the types of defects or their distribution, and can increase the complexity.
In this work, a multifunctional amino acid salt (S)-3-amino-4-phenylbutyric acid hydrochloride (s-APACl) is introduced as an additive for the doping of perovskite layers. Due to the homochirality of s-APACl, we expected that better order could be created in the perovskite structure. PSCs containing a small amount of s-APACl demonstrated improved performance with enhanced stability. This paper represents an attempt to understand the chemical interaction between the additive and perovskite as well as its effect on the morphology of the perovskite layer. More importantly, we carry out an in-depth exploration of the effect of the additive–perovskite interaction in terms of changes in the excitation/recombination process, the semiconducting properties, the traps and interface charges of the device, and their relationship with the photovoltaics performance and stability of the devices.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 
          s-APACl modified perovskite layers: the morphology, photophysical and optoelectronic properties
This investigation focuses on a perovskite additive approach. The target additive is a chiral amino acid compound called s-APACl, which is thermally stable and can withstand the annealing process of the perovskite layer (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The selection of s-APACl as a perovskite additive was based on its chirality, its rigid molecular structure consisting of a benzene ring, its flexible chain having an electron-deficient amino cation, and its electron-rich carboxyl groups in addition to an associated Cl− anion. The homochirality of s-APACl was expected to create minimum disturbance to the perovskite crystal order. This has been confirmed in device fabrication. Devices with the APACl additive of different chiralities were fabricated. The device with the homochiral APACl additive performed better than that with mixed (S) and (R) chirality as seen in Fig. S2.† It was anticipated that the molecule might interact with the perovskite, and it was therefore interesting to see how the functional groups altered the perovskite layer properties.
In this work, perovskite layers with a feed-in composition of Cs0.05(FA0.92MA0.08)0.95Pb(I0.92 Br0.08)3 were prepared on top of an ITO/poly-[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-tri-methyl-phenyl)amine] (PTAA) surface via a conventional one-step method, followed by anti-solvent rinsing (see Fig. 1a and experimental details in the ESI†). The perovskite layers were manipulated by the addition of the s-APACl additive at varying concentrations, such as 0.33 mole%, 1 mole% and 1.67 mole% in the perovskite layers, and these specimens are denoted as APACl-1, APACl-3 and APACl-5, respectively. Perovskite crystalline layers with or without s-APACl were developed as shown in the scheme in Fig. 1a. The morphologies of these s-APACl-doped perovskite layers were first investigated. The devices were then completed by the follow-up deposition of the electron transporting layer PCBM:C60/Zr(acac)4 and a top electrode, Cu.

The surface morphologies were observed from the top-view scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images of perovskite specimens containing different fractions of the s-APACl additive shown in Fig. S3a,† but no distinct changes in the crystalline size could be found. Atomic force microscopic (AFM) images in Fig. S4† showed that the APACl-3 perovskite film was less rough than the control specimen (without s-APACl), with a relatively low root mean square roughness (RRMS) of 20.4 nm compared with that of the pristine film of 23.7 nm. From the cross-sectional SEM images of the perovskite specimens with the s-APACl additive, it could be observed that the crystal grains in the perovskite layer grew along the direction of the thickness (vertically) as seen Fig. S3b,†i.e., the grain boundaries are mostly aligned vertically (normal to the layer surface) when the s-APACl additive is used.
The bulk morphologies of perovskite films doped with various concentrations (0.33, 1 and 1.67 mole%) of the s-APACl additive were investigated using X-ray diffractions (XRD). A crystal of s-APACl-doped perovskite had a tetragonal form which is similar to that of the pristine one as seen in Fig. 1b. However, the increase of (100) diffraction at 2θ = 14.0° from the α phase was accompanied by the decrease of diffraction at 2θ = 11.5° from the δ phase of the perovskite,41 when the amount of s-APACl was increased gradually. This can be seen more clearly from the enlarged diagram in Fig. 1c. The results indicate that an increase in the concentration of s-APACl was able to improve the crystalline order in perovskite films. In addition, a lack of detectable features at relatively low diffraction angles responsible for the two-dimensional structure indicates that the s-APACl-doped perovskite layers crystallized mainly in three dimensions.42 This result suggests that the s-APACl additive may act mainly at the grain boundaries, rather than entering into the perovskite lattice and participating directly in the crystallization process.
The predominance of (100) diffraction implies that the s-APACl-doped perovskite preferred to crystallize in the 〈100〉 orientation; presumably the (100) plane has a relatively low surface energy. The degree of order or quality of the crystalline structure can be evaluated from the (100) linewidth, which is quantified using the correlation length (ΔL); It is defined as ΔL = 2π/Δq (where the vector q = 4πsinθ/λ) and is associated with the dimension of a periodically repeated structure or the size of a crystalline structure.26,43–45 A larger correlation length ΔL therefore represents a greater crystal size. These results are listed in Table 1. It can be clearly seen that the crystal sizes in perovskite films become larger as the fraction of the s-APACl additive is increased. The density of the crystal boundaries in the s-APACl-doped perovskite layer can therefore be reduced, which can minimize the number of interface defects.

The crystal grains were mostly vertically aligned in the s-APACl-doped perovskite layer in the SEM images; this indicates that the defect centres in the s-APACl-doped perovskite layer may also be vertically aligned. Overall, the s-APACl additive not only enhances the order of crystallization in the perovskite, but also aligns the grains in the vertical direction. This is a very interesting result.
The optical absorption spectra of perovskite layers deposited on a glass surface were measured as presented Fig. 2a, and the energy band gaps (Eg) were determined by extrapolating the linear region to the E-axis via a Tauc plot as shown in Fig. 2a (inset).26,46,47 The Eg value for the perovskite films was found to be ∼1.58 eV no matter with or without the s-APACl additive (Table 1).

The electronic energy levels of the control and APACl-3 perovskite specimens were investigated using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) as shown in Fig. S5a.† The work function (φ) was determined based on the difference between the photon energy and the binding energy of the secondary cut-off edge, using the formula φ = hν − Ecutoff. A distinct difference in the work function φ for the perovskite layer with and without the s-APACl additive was found, with values of 4.59 eV for the control and 4.44 eV for the APACl-3 specimens, respectively (see Fig. S5b† and Table 1). The differences of the valence band maximum and the Fermi level (EF) (ΔEVBM) of the control and APACl-3 layers were found to be 1.12 eV and 1.28 eV, respectively, (Fig. S5c and Table S1†). The valence band level (EVB) for the control (−5.71 eV) and APACl-3 specimens (−5.72 eV) could therefore be obtained (Table 1). The conduction band (ECB) could be obtained from the values of Eg and EVB, which were −4.13 eV for the control and −4.14 eV for the APACl-3 specimen, respectively (Fig. S5d† and Table 1). It was interesting to discover that the s-APACl additive had little effect on the electronic structure of the perovskite layers and that the band structure was almost unchanged. All of perovskite specimens thus prepared were n-type semiconductors. However, the up-shifted work function DO indicates the density of states moving upwards towards the conduction band, meaning that the s-APACl-doped perovskite was even more strongly n-dominated.
The steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence of perovskite films deposited on a glass surface were measured in order to understand the dynamics of the excitation process. Photoluminescence (PL) excited at 479 nm markedly increased as the concentrations of the s-APACl additive in the perovskite layers were progressively increased (Fig. 2b). This indicated that the s-APACl additive was able to suppress non-radiative recombination in the perovskite layer and coincided with the increase in the crystal size of the perovskite evaluated in the previous section when the s-APACl concentration was increased, i.e. a reduction in the grain boundaries (see Fig. 1c and Table 1). The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) monitored at 780 nm from the perovskite layers showed a double exponential decay process, which could be fitted with a fast process (τ1) and a slow lifetime (τ2) as shown in Fig. 2c and Table S2.† A progressive increase in the TRPL average lifetime (τavg = 0.59–3.11 μs) with s-APACl concentrations could be observed. An enhancement of the PL emission with extended lifetimes is an indication of a reduction in non-radiative recombination. This was confirmed by the reduction in the open-circuit voltage (Voc) deficit, as described in the next section, as Voc is related to the PL efficiency via the relation of Voc = Voc,rad + (kT/q)ln(ηext), where Voc,rad is the radiative limit of the Voc and ηext is the external PL quantum efficiency.36,48
The APACl-5 film specimen has the longest lifetime, with a τavg value of 3.11 μs, which is in agreement with the morphology results (Table 1). This further proves that the s-APACl additive has benefits in term of improving crystallization quality, with a larger crystal size and reduced interface defects.
2.2 Solar cells prepared from s-APACl modified perovskites and the device physics
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated with an inverted (p-i-n) configuration: ITO/PTAA/Cs0.05(FA0.92MA0.08)0.95Pb(I0.92Br0.08)3 (with and without s-APACl)/PCBM:C60/Zr(acac)4/Cu, where PTAA functioned as a hole transporting layer, a blend of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and fullerene (C60) as an electron transporting layer and zirconium acetylacetonate (Zr(acac)4) as a modified layer. The fractions of the s-APACl additive were varied in the perovskite layer to manipulate the devices. The current–voltage characteristics were measured under standard AM1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (shown in Fig. 3a). The photovoltaic parameters of the devices are shown in Table 2. The output current of the devices was tested (see Fig. S6†). Except APACl-5, most devices remained steady within 30 s. The box chart data for all devices exhibited excellent reproducibility (see Fig. S7†).

From Fig. 3a and Table 2, it was found that the short-circuit current (Jsc) was almost unchanged for a low level (≤1 mole%) of s-APACl additive in the perovskite layer. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the devices were estimated and found to be at a similar level, with a consistent integral current density (see Fig. S8a†). However, when the s-APACl concentration was further increased, Jsc was drastically reduced. In contrast, the s-APACl additive had a strong effect on Voc (see Table 2). An increase of 10% in Voc (ΔV = 0.10–0.12 eV) was found when s-APACl was added.
It is interesting to look at what happened in the device when the additive was introduced to the perovskite layer. In general, the devices investigated here were semiconducting devices. The J–V characteristics of the device can be expressed using a one diode model, with an equivalent circuit containing a single heterojunction, as described in eqn (1).49,50 The first term in eqn (1), Jph, is the light-generated current contribution. The last term accounts for the leakage current of the device, where Rs and Rsh are the series and shunt resistances, and can be neglected if Rsh is large enough. The second term relates to the junction current of a semiconductor diode, where J0 is the saturation of dark current density and n is the ideality factor. The parameters q, kB and T are the electronic charge, Boltzmann constant and absolute temperature, respectively. (1)
In our experiments, the values of Rsh for the devices were estimated from the reciprocal of the slope of the J–V curve at V = 0 and J = JSC, and these are shown in Table 2. It was found that the Rsh for the device was improved from 104 Ω (control) to 105 Ω (doped with s-APACl), and there was a reduction in the leakage current, which was also confirmed by the dark J–V characteristics as seen in Fig. S8b.† This result is in agreement with the SEM observations, which showed densely packed crystal grains in the s-APACl-doped perovskite layer. With a relatively high Rsh, the last term in eqn (1) can be neglected. Eqn (2) and (3) were derived for photovoltaic analysis.50–52Rs can be obtained from the intercept of the versus (JSC − J)−1 graph as seen in Fig. 3b. This showed that the APACl-1 and APACl-3 devices had better contacts. (2) (3)

Eqn (4) can be derived for V = VOC (J = 0), and implies that both n and J0 are critical for Voc. (4)
These terms (J0 and n) can be extracted from the intercept and the slopes of the ln(JSC − J) versus (V + RSJ) curves (Fig. 3c), according to eqn (3).50,53 These results are tabulated in Table 2. It was discovered that the value of n decreased from 3.39 for the control to 2.79 for both the APACl-1 and APACl-3 devices. The J0 of the APACl-3 device is 2.77 × 10−6 mA cm−2, which is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the control device (2.21 × 10−4 mA cm−2).
The ideality factor n for a semiconducting device is a parameter associated with the recombination process at the junction. A typical value for n is between one and two. Commonly, n = 1 represents a bimolecular radiative recombination, whereas n = 2 represents the space charge region recombination process or defect-assisted recombination through trap states.54 Higher values have also been reported, especially for perovskite devices,55 and are often associated with multiple trap states inside the device56 or multi-junction devices.57 In this work, n values were also larger than two. However, the addition of s-APACl to the perovskite layers was able to reduce the n value, which played a positive role in terms of the functioning of the device. The n values were also evaluated using the J–V characteristics measured in the dark as plotted in Fig. S8c.† It revealed that the n values were strongly voltage dependant. However, within a relatively steady voltage range (0.1–0.3 V), the n value for the control device was in the range of 2 to 3, but a substantial improvement in the n value for the APACl-3 device could be observed, which was around 1.5–2.0 depending on the voltage.
In order to identify whether the change in n was associated with traps or defects, hole-only devices were prepared using pristine (control) and APACl-3 perovskite layers. The trap density was evaluated using a space charge limit current (SCLC) method. The dark J–V curves for the devices were measured and plotted on a double logarithmic scale as seen in Fig. 3d. In low-voltage bias regions, J versus V was linear, indicating an ohmic contact. As the bias voltage increased, the current went into a trap-filling region with a slope ≫2, followed by a quadratic SCLC region. The trap density (nt) could be estimated from the critical turning voltage, and the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), based on relation (5),58,59 (5)where L is the thickness of the perovskite layer (∼600 nm in this work), ε (=32.1) is the relative permittivity of perovskite, and ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant.60 It was found that the value of nt for holes was about 1.04 × 1016 cm−3 for the control (VTFL = 1.05 V) and 7.69 × 1015 cm−3 for APACl-3 (VTFL = 0.78 V)(see Fig. 3d). The trap density reduction for the s-APACl-doped device effectively explained the reduction in n, and also confirmed the suppression of the non-radiative recombination mechanism for PL enhancement and the increase in lifetime (Fig. 2b and c).
The saturation current density J0 is a parameter related to both the thermal emission rate of electrons from the valence to the conductions bands and the recombination rate. Smaller J0 values for the APACl-1 and APACl-3 devices indicated a retardation of the charge recombination at passivated gain boundaries.61–63 This could lead to a lower energy loss and a higher VOC based on eqn (4), that is, a smaller J0 gives a greater VOC. For comparison, VOC was calculated using the values obtained for n and J0, which were 1.01, 1.12, 1.14, and 1.14 V for the control, APACl-1, APACl-3 and APACl-5 devices, respectively. These matched perfectly with the measured VOC values in Table 2.
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites are semiconductors having very different characteristics from traditional ones. In addition to electronic conduction, ion migration may play a special role, and this has been proposed as a crucial factor affecting the device stability.64,65 In this work, the ionic charges were quantified by integrating the transient current pulses (reversed current spikes) from both the control and APACl-3 devices under dark conditions; these can be detected when a bias voltage (1.2 V for 5 s) is suddenly withdrawn and the currents are monitored simultaneously (see Fig. 3e). It can be clearly seen that the charges are gradually released through the current flow over time, and the integration returns the total charge accumulated in the devices. The interface charge obtained in this manner was 0.18 μC cm−2 for the APACl-3 device, more than an order of magnitude lower than the value for the control device (3.32 μC cm−2). This also reflected in the hysteresis of the device shown in Fig. 3f. The H-index = (PCERS − PCEFS)/PCERS was calculated to quantify the hysteresis for a reverse scan (RS) (from 1.2 to 0 V) and forward scan (FS) (from 0 to 1.2 V).66,67 It was found that the APACl-3 device displayed a relatively low hysteresis index (HI = 3.57) compared to the control device (HI = 4.76), which is in accordance with the interface charge obtained (Table S3†). The s-APACl additive appears to be able to minimize ion migration in the perovskite layer and enhanced the performance of the device.
This experiment demonstrated an overall enhancement in device performance. The champion APACl-3 device achieved values of Voc = 1.14 V, Jsc = 23.32 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 79.1% with a PCE of 21.02%, a result that was substantially higher than PCE = 18.90% for the control device. In addition, the statistical distributions of the photovoltaic parameters of the APACl-3 device were much narrower than those of the control device (see Fig. S6†).
The s-APACl additive is very effective in enhancing the device performance, and the defect passivation explained well from the point of view of a semiconducting device. However, the concentration of s-APACl appears to restrict to a low level (1 mole%, such as APACl-3). If the s-APACl concentration was increased to 1.67 mole% (APACl-5), the performance of the device deteriorated drastically; both JSC and the FF for the APACl-5 device were substantially reduced, though the morphology and photophysical properties were improved. There must therefore be other unknown factor(s) at play in addition to the defect reduction.
2.3 Simulate the interaction between the amino acid functional groups of s-APACl and the perovskite
In order to better understand the function of the s-APACl additive and its interaction with the perovskite surface, a molecular simulation was carried out using a quantum mechanical method based on density functional theory (DFT), using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). The atomic structure of the perovskite layer was built based on a periodical structure with a 3 × 3 × 1 cubic supercell (19.1 × 19.1 × 6.4 Å3) and a 30 Å vacuum layer along the c-axis. In order to accelerate the calculation, the MA+ and FA+ groups in the perovskite were replaced by Cs+ for approximation.68 The s-APACl molecule was placed on the Pb–I plane (see Fig. 4a). The entire structure was optimized for energy minimization.

(d) FTIR and (e) 1H NMR spectra, and (f) XPS at Pb 4f orbitals measured from the specimens as indicated. (g) Nyquist plots represented for the devices as indicated. 
The interaction between the organic molecule and the perovskite surface was investigated by laying the s-APACl molecule on the perovskite surface. In the supercell, the Pb–I plane was found to be vertical to the [001] direction, and was selected as the focused surface (Fig. 4a, top graph). A differential charge density analysis demonstrated that the hydrogen atom on the amino group appears to be coordinated with the iodine atom by a reduction in charge density (Fig. 4b). It appears to be able to passivate the under-coordinated I− defect. The oxygen atom of the carboxyl group appears to interact strongly with the Pb atom to passivate the under-coordinated Pb2+ defect by transferring an electron to the Pb atom. At the same time, the electron density of the hydrogens on the aromatic ring was reduced overall, while a slightly increased electron density around the Pb atom was found, leading to an increase in charge delocalization (Fig. 4b bottom graph). In addition, the free Cl− anion may also passivate defects such as under-coordinated Pb2+ or iodine vacancies  Due to chemical activity, the I− anion and organic cation on the perovskite surface can easily escape, leaving an anion charge or a cation vacancy. The s-APACl molecule demonstrated multiple functions in defect passivation within the PbI2 cage (see Fig. 4b), which are similar to those reported in the literature.69 The activities of the –CO group, –NH3+ groups, aromatic ring and the free Cl− anion of s-APACl are all able to passivate the perovskite and form a stabilized structure as illustrated in Fig. 4c.
The molecular interactions between the organic groups and the PbI2 could be simulated experimentally. Interactions between organic groups could easily be detected using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopic studies. Specimens were specifically prepared by mixing s-APACl with PbI2 at a ratio of 1:1. Pristine s-APACl and PbI2 specimens were used for comparison. The interactions with PbI2 were evaluated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), a powerful tool for sensing the bonding states of the elements.

FTIR. 
Several key absorption features were found in the IR spectra shown in Fig. 4d (details in Fig. S9†): a very broad stretching absorption was centred at 3000 cm−1 with a secondary absorption close to 2600 cm−1, belonging to νO–H for the hydrogen-bonded hydroxy group; a strong absorption was seen at about 1720 cm−1 from νCO of the carboxyl group; and the doublet stretching absorptions around ∼3300 cm−1 were from the νN–H for the amino groups. The interaction between PbI2 and the amine of s-APACl were revealed by the frequency shift in the stretching vibration for νN–H, i.e., Δν ∼ 210 cm−1, shifting from 3340 and 3244 cm−1 for the pristine s-APACl specimen to 3131 and 3030 cm−1 for the PbI2 + s-APACl mix (Fig. 4d). The strong νCO absorption also shifted slightly, from 1720 cm−1 for the pristine s-APACl to 1717 cm−1 for the PbI2 + s-APACl mix. The IR spectra confirm that both the –COOH and –NH3+ groups of s-APACl undergo strong interactions with Pb–I species or coordinate with Pb2+ in the perovskite layer.



1H NMR. 
The chemical shift at 8.19 ppm for the –NH3+ group on s-APACl also shifted to 7.89 ppm in the mixture (Fig. 4e). This indicates that strong –NH⋯I bonding interactions exist between s-APACl and PbI2. A slight reduction in the integration value at 12.75 ppm for the –OH group was also observed from the s-APACl + PbI2 mixed specimen (Fig. S10†), which could contribute to the coordination between –OH and Pb2+.70 These also provide evidence for strong chemical interactions between s-APACl and PbI2.


XPS. 
The chemical bonding states of Pb and I between pristine and APACl-3 perovskite layers (prepared on top of a glass/ITO/PTAA surface) were evaluated using XPS. All signals were corrected referring to the C–C signal at 284.61 eV (Fig. S11†). The binding energy for Pb2+ in the control film was located at 142.66 and 137.76 eV, but a shift of 0.2 eV to a higher energy could be observed in the APACl-3 layer (Fig. 4f). In combination with the IR and NMR spectra, this indicates that the –COOH group coordinated with the cations Pb2+ and filled the  The –NH3+ group of s-APACl could also replace the cation vacancy. In addition, the Pb0 peak at 136.86 eV (Pb0) disappeared completely in the s-APACl-modified perovskite layer (Fig. 4f), thus removing one of the factors causing instability in the perovskite. The existence of metallic Pb in the crystal lattice corresponds to an iodide vacancy, a non-radiative centre, giving rise to the instability of perovskite-based devices according to reports in the literature.71,72
Since there is no sign of s-APACl entering the perovskite crystal structure, such coordination appears to be restricted at the interfaces or grain boundaries only, indicating a surface passivation role for the s-APACl additive. The mechanism by which surface passivation affects the electronic process in a device can be examined using AC impedance spectrometry, a powerful tool for measuring electronic processes either inside the bulk or at the interfaces of the perovskite.26
Nyquist plots were obtained for the control, APACl-1 and APACl-3 devices and are represented in Fig. 4g. Two semicircles in different frequency ranges represent the different electronic processes. The nature of these processes can then be identified based on capacitance (C0), which can be obtained either from the maxima of the semicircles (where ωRC = 1) or via a simulation using an equivalent circuit (see Fig. 4g inset). The results are listed in Table 3.

It was found that the C01 values from the larger semicircle at a relatively high frequency were in the order of 10−12 F cm−1, which is associated with the bulk properties of the perovskite layer.26,73,74 The C02 values from the small semicircle at a low frequency fell in the range 10−7 to 10−9 F cm−1, representing a process occurring at the interface (at a grain boundary or perovskite/transport contact). The bulk capacitances of all four devices were rather similar (∼10−12 F cm−1), with only a slight reduction when the additive concentration was increased. This implies only a limited change in the charge density of the bulk. However, it was interesting to see that the interface capacitance first decreased as the s-APACl concentration increased. The capacitance of the APACl-3 device (7.3 × 10−9 F cm−1) was the minimum and was two orders of magnitudes lower than that of the control device (1.5 × 10−7 F cm−1), signifying a substantial reduction in the interface charges in the APACl-3 device. This agrees with the simulation result obtained above, in which the s-APACl additive mainly functions at an interface (such as a grain boundary) rather than in the bulk. The recombination resistance (Rrec) at a high frequency and the interface charge transfer resistance (Rct) at a low frequency were also extracted as seen in Table 3. There was a progressive increase in Rrec as the amount of s-APACl additive was increased, indicating a suppression of non-radiative recombination due to defect passivation in the perovskite layer by the additive. This agrees with the photophysics measurements showing that PL emission was enhanced (Fig. 2b). Rct was reduced only when a very small amount of additive was used, such as in the APACl-1 device. The reduction in Rct is beneficial in terms of carrier transport at the interface. However, if the concentration of the additive was increased further, the value of Rct increased again. It appears that there is a competition between the defect passivation and the interface charge transfer. As long as Rct is within an acceptable range of values, the performance of the device can be improved by passivation. However, we found that Rct was substantially increased in the APACl-5 device. The accumulation of low-conductive organic groups at the interface may contribute to this. It hindered the charge extraction at electrodes, resulted in a lower JSC and FF (Table 2) and caused a marked decline in the performance of device. The variation in Rct closely matched the change in JSC for the s-APACl-doped devices. An increase in Rct caused an increase in the resistance to the current flow and hence a reduction in JSC as seen in Table 2.
Both our theoretical simulations and experimental analyses demonstrated that the s-APACl additive had multiple, strong molecular interactions with the perovskite, and passivated not only positive defects, but also negative charges in the perovskite structure. In addition, the interaction between s-APACl and the perovskite mainly occurred at the interface, possibly at the grain boundary.

2.4 Physical mechanism of device stabilities
Unlike the instability induced by humidity and oxygen, this may be resolved by encapsulation. Instabilities induced by light or thermal stresses are unavoidable, and the operational stability of PSCs still remains a challenge. Although many researchers have focused on this field, there is still little understanding of the underlying chemical or physical causes of instability in these devices. In this section, the stability of the control and APACl-3 devices was examined further, in order to gain a better understanding. A nitrogen-filled glovebox was used to control the test conditions. The humidity and oxygen levels inside the glovebox were kept at 0.1 ppm. The devices were tested during storage in the dark, or during aging under constant illumination or under constant thermal stress without exposure to the atmosphere.
The storage stability of the devices with or without the s-APACl additive was evaluated inside a N2-filled glovebox in the dark and the device performance versus time was recorded manually as shown in Fig. 5a. During a 60 day test period, the photovoltaic parameters of both the control and APACl-3 devices remained almost unchanged. The results of the test indicated that the perovskite devices in this work were stable enough for relatively long-term storage at room temperature without atmospheric exposure.
 Fig. 5  Stabilities of the devices were tested inside a N2 filled glovebox (a) after storing in the dark at room temperature (∼25 °C); or (b) after heating at an elevated temperature of 60 °C; or (c) under continuous illumination at room temperature with a constant voltage stress (0.94 V) at MPP. 
The thermal stability of the control and APACl-3 devices was also measured by placing them on a hot plate at 60 °C with N2 protection. The values of JSC and FF for the control device decreased significantly after 50 hours, as shown in Fig. 5b though VOC remained relatively stable. This reduced the PCE of the device. In contrast, the APACl-3 device remained almost unchanged up to ∼150 hours. After that, the value of JSC began to decrease, but both VOC and the FF were relatively stable. After a 250 hour test period, the PCEs for the APACl-3 and control devices decreased to 84% and 45% of their initial levels, respectively, thus demonstrating that the s-APACl additive was able to create a more thermally stable device.
The operational stability of the devices was tested under continuous white light illumination at 100 mW cm−2 at room temperature, with a bias voltage stress (0.94 V) at the maximum power point (MPP). The device parameters were automatically recorded at one hour intervals (see Fig. 5c). It can be seen that the Voc for both devices remained almost unchanged. After continuous illumination for 250 hours, however, the values of Jsc and the FF for the control device decreased substantially, and the PCE decreased to 42% of its initial value, whereas the parameters for the APACl-3 device appeared much more stable and the PCE retained 91% of its initial value. A loss of Jsc is an indication of a reduction in carrier extraction efficiency and the perovskite phase transition.75 The s-APACl additive was therefore able to stabilize the interface structure and enhanced the operational stability.
“Aged” devices after continuous illumination (see experimental details) were further examined in order to explore the mechanism of damage to the device. The cross-sectional SEM images of the “aged” and “fresh” versions of both the control and APACl-3 devices were compared along with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDS) analysis results (Fig. S12†). In the “aged” control device, a substantial amount of the I− anion was found to enter the electron transporting layer via diffusion, while a lower degree of I− diffusion was observed in the “aged” APACl-3 device. This illustrates that s-APACl passivation can minimize ion migration by stabilizing the interface structure.
The composition and morphology of the “aged films” (see experimental details) were also evaluated. From the top-view SEM images, no distinct difference between the “fresh” and the “aged” films could be observed apart from traces of black dots (residuals of PCBM/C60, shown by red circles) in Fig. 6a. From the X-ray diffraction pattern, it was found that a δ phase (2θ = 11.50) developed in the “aged film” as shown in Fig. 6b. From the reduction in the (100) intensity, it can be concluded that the partially decomposed black α phase contributed to the growth of the yellow δ phase. It was interesting to discover, however, that decomposition was greatly reduced in the “aged” APACl-3 device. The “aged” perovskite film with the s-APACl additive was much more stable. Optical absorption spectroscopy also confirmed that the s-APACl-doped perovskite layer was more stable than the control one (see Fig. 6c). Optical absorption below 600 nm was substantially reduced in the “aged” control films, but a much lower degree of reduction was observed for the “aged” APACl-3 film.
 Fig. 6  Top-view SEM images (the residuals of PCBM/C60, red circle) (a), XRD patterns (b) and optical absorption spectra (c) from “fresh” or “aged” films obtained by lift-off top PCBM:C60/Zr(acac)4/Cu layers from control or APACl-3 devices. 
These experiments reveal that it is the decomposition of the perovskite structure that causes a reduction in device stability and is responsible for the progressive reduction in Jsc during the stability test, a result that is in good agreement with reports in the literature.76–78
The s-APACl additive plays an important role in enhancing the device performance and the stability of PSCs by passivating the defects, stabilizing the interface structure and blocking ion migration. The junction characteristics of the devices are comprehensively enhanced, leading to a much better photovoltaic performance.
3. Conclusions
A p-i-n type PSC was prepared using a conventional one-step process. A chiral amino acid compound (s-APACl) was selected as an additive for use in the perovskite active layer. Both the bulk and interface properties of the perovskite and devices were improved. The following features were found in the perovskite layer and the devices when the s-APACl additive was used:
(1) An enhancement was observed in the order of crystallization; a vertical alignment and a higher correlation length (larger crystal size) were induced, which minimize the grain boundaries.
(2) The s-APACl additive led to even stronger n-domination in the n-type perovskite and improved the junction characteristics of the devices.
(3) For the device with the additive, a reduction was seen in the trap or defect densities, which suppressed non-radiative recombination, leading to enhancement of PL with longer lifetimes and reductions in the ideality factor n and saturation current J0 and an enhanced VOC. At the same time, the leakage current and ion migration were also minimized, providing a very significant improvement in device performance and stability.
(4) Simulations revealed that both the –CO and –NH3+ groups and the phenyl ring in the s-APACl molecule undergo strong interactions with iodine and Pb atoms suggesting passivation of the under-coordinated I− and Pb2+ defects in the perovskite surface. More interestingly, the additive appears to play a more important role at the interface area rather than in the bulk, a result that was confirmed by impedance spectrometry. This explained the photophysical properties of the s-APACl doped perovskite layer.
(5) The s-APACl additive was able to stabilize the interface structure and minimized ion migration, which enhanced operational stability.
The champion device demonstrated a PCE of 21.02% with a VOC of 1.14 V. The efficiency retained 91% of its initial value after 250 hours of continuous illumination at the MPP. Our investigation offers a better understanding of the functionalities of the s-APACl additive in perovskite materials and its effect on device performance.

 	Fig. 2  (a) Optical absorption spectra with Tauc plots in the inset, (b) steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra, and (c) time-resolved PL with curves fitted using a biexponential equation from the perovskite films having different fractions of the s-APACl additive.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) J–V characteristics, the (b) (Jsc − J)−1versus −dV/dJ plot and the (c) (V + Rs × J) versus ln(JSC − J) plot are measured for perovskite devices having different fractions of the s-APACl additive. (d) Hole-only SCLC curves, (e) transient current decays (enlarged spike area and integrated shadow area are shown in the inset). For a better illustration, two current curves are plotted on one graph, but with their polarities reversed to avoid overlapping; and (f) forward and reverse J–V scans. The testing devices are indicated inside the graphs.
