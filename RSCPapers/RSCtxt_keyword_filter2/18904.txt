    , Accepted 8th May 2013First published on 10th May 2013AbstractIn the present investigation we have successfully synthesized 1D vertically aligned rutile TiO2 nanorods (TNR) and 3D TiO2 nanostars (TNS) as a scattering layer by a single step hydrothermal route. The synthesized nanostructures were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning-and transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The 1D TiO2 nanorod and 3D TiO2 nanostar samples were further used for N-719 dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC) application. Compared to a nanorod based cell, the photovoltaic performance of the nanostars/nanorods TiO2 cell exhibits excellent DSSC performance, including superior light scattering, rapid electron transport and lower electron recombination rate. The 3D/1D TNS/TNR based DSSC cell exhibits 5.39% power conversion efficiency, which is remarkably higher than that of the bare 1D nanorod based (3.74%) photoelectrode. The detailed interface and transient properties of these nanorod and nanostar based photoanodes in DSSCs were analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements and open circuit voltage decay measurements in order to understand the critical factors contributing to such high power conversion efficiency. The enhancement of the efficiency for the 3D/1D TNS/TNR photoanode based cell compared to the 1D TNR is mainly attributed to better light scattering capability, faster electron transport and lower electron recombination.
1. Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC), a molecular approach to photovoltaic solar energy conversion, is one of the emerging photovoltaic technologies that offer the potential to reduce the cost of photovoltaic electricity production. During the last two decades, nanoporous polycrystalline titania has been extensively used in DSSCs. It has been demonstrated to be a promising alternative to silicon based solar cells due to their relatively high solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency at low cost.1,2 The transportation of electrons through TiO2 film and effective dye loading are the most important parameters in DSSC. These two parameters depend upon the surface topography of the photoanode, surface area, grain boundaries between two nanostructures and porosity of the photoanodes. Hence, tailoring nanomorphology of photoanode is a key factor in the DSSC.2
Until now, DSSC photoanodes with nanoparticles, colloidal mesoporous particles, nanorods, and nanowires have been tested. However, the nanoparticle based photoelectrodes suffer from a large number of grain boundaries that cause slower electron transportation, which subsequently limits photon conversion efficiency of the DSSC. Thus for an efficient DSSC a relatively thick (∼10 μm) titania layer is required. Recent efforts to synthesise exotic nano-morphologies of TiO2 such as 1D nanorods,3 nanowires,4 nanocorals,5 hierarchical microspheres6,7 nanotubes,8 mesocrystalline rutile TiO2 nanorod arrays,9 {001} faceted anatase TiO210,11 and single walled TiO2 nanotubes9 by various chemical routes,12–19 are promising approaches towards improved electron transport and effective light harvesting capability.
A number of approaches have been employed for the synthesis of rutile TiO2 and a variety of nanostructures such as rutile TiO2 microspheres, nanoflowers, nanotrees and nanobelts have been fabricated.20 Ordered single-crystalline rutile TiO2 nanorod arrays on different substrates were synthesized by using titanium tetraisopropoxide [CH3CH3CHO]4Ti, TTIP] via a hydrothermal process.21 Porous rutile TiO2 nanorod arrays and nanoparticles were fabricated on a FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide) substrate via a secondary hydrothermal treatment22 and rapid hydrothermal method, respectively.23
Recently Sun et al. demonstrated photon conversion efficiency enhancement up to 7.2% using a combination of 1D-nanowire and 3D-dendritic nanostructures by hydrothermal process.24 Such bilayer photoanodes enable fast electron transport, high surface area and pronounced light scattering effect, which otherwise would not be possible with either 1D or 3D nanostructures alone. Thus, this approach is pretty impressive and cost-effective and has opened a new route for fabrication of efficient DSSC photoanodes. However, fabricating such bilayer photoanodes is a challenging task and involves many delicate synthetic steps.
In the present investigation, we have synthesized 1D nanorods and 3D nanostars of TiO2 by a single step surfactant free hydrothermal route. The preparative parameters like deposition time and temperature have been optimized for synthesis of such novel 1D TiO2 nanorod/3D TiO2 nanostar (1D TNR/3D TNS) architecture. Further, the synthesized 1D TNR/3D TNS photoelectrodes were successfully used to fabricate an efficient DSSC. The interface and transient properties of 1D TNR and 3D/1D TNS/TNR DSSC devices were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements. The transient properties of 3D/1D TNS/TNR based devices show fast electron transport, low recombination rate and lifetime.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) (99.98%), and titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 35.46%) and nitric acid (HNO3, 38%,) were obtained from Thomas Baker. Absolute ethanol (99.9%) AR-grade was obtained from Changshu Yangyuan Chemicals China. Conducting FTO coated glass substrates (fluorine-doped SnO2, resistance 15 Ω cm−2, transmittance 90%, Solaronix) were received from Solaronix, Switzerland. Iodolyte AN-50 (Solaronix) redox electrolyte was used in the DSSCs. The sensitizer used in this work is an organic N719 dye (di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II), 95% (NMR) purchased from Sigma Aldrich.
2.2. Hydrothermal syntheses of 1D TNR and 3D/1D TNR/TNS photoelectrodes
The procedure for obtaining 1D TiO2 nanorods on FTO coated conducting glass substrates by hydrothermal method is given in our previous report.18 Briefly, titanium(IV) isopropoxide (0.5 mL) was added to equal volumes of distilled water and concentrated HCl. The clear transparent solution was then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (25 mL), and a piece of F-doped SnO2 (FTO) glass (Solaronix, 15 Ω cm−2) was immersed in the solution parallel to the wall. The autoclave was sealed and placed in an oven at 180 °C for 3 h. After cooling the autoclave to room temperature, the TiO2 films were washed several times with distilled water and dried in an oven at 70 °C for 1 h and designated as 1D TNR. For the synthesis of 3D/1D TNS/TNR, the precursor concentration was varied to 1:0.7 v:v% (H2O:HCl) and reaction vessel maintained at 180 °C. The deposited samples were designated as 3D/1D TNS/TNR. Please note that fresh hydrothermal solutions were prepared before each experiment.
2.3. Characterizations
The surface morphology of the samples was recorded by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; S-4700, Hitachi). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained by TECNAI F20 Philips operated at 200 kV. The TEM sample was prepared by drop casting ethanolic dispersion of 3D/1D TNS/TNR onto a carbon coated Cu grid. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using a D/MAX Ultima III XRD spectrometer (Rigaku, Japan) with Cu Kα line of 1.5410 Å. The optical reflection spectra were recorded using a StellerNet Inc. USA Reflectometer over 300–850 nm, with 0.01 nm resolutions. The elemental information of 3D/1D TNS/TNR was obtained using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (VG Multilab 2000-Thermo Scientific, USA, K-Alpha) with a multichannel detector, which can endure high photonic energies from 0.1 to 3 keV.
2.4. DSSC device fabrication and its performance
Both TiO2 samples (1D TNR and 3D/1D TNS/TNR) were treated with aqueous TiCl4 before the dye adsorption. In a typical experiment TiCl4 solution was prepared by adding 2 mL of TiCl4 into water under ice bath conditions. The TiO2 films were immersed in a TiCl4 aqueous solution in a beaker and then kept at ∼60 °C for 30 min, followed by rinsing with ethanol and annealing at 500 °C in air for 30 min. The TiCl4 treated photoelectrodes were subsequently soaked in ethanolic 0.5 mM N719 dye (Dyesol) solution at room temperature for 24 h in the dark and then washed carefully in ethanol. A compact DSSC was fabricated using a standard two electrode configuration, comprising dye loaded glass/FTO/3D/1D TNS/TNR (with an active surface area of 0.25 cm2) as the photoanode and platinum coated FTO as the counter electrode, which is sealed with the working electrode using a thermoplastic (∼1 μm). The Pt/FTO counter electrode was prepared by drop casting a H2PtCl6 solution (0.7 mM) on a pre-cleaned FTO coated glass substrate followed by heating at 400 °C for 30 min in air. The iodide-based electrolyte (Dyesol) was used as the redox electrolyte and was injected into the inter-electrode space from the counter electrode side through a pre-drilled hole.
The open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements were obtained with CHI Electrochemical work station (model-CHI-400A), CH Instruments, USA. The DSSC properties were measured by Sol2A Oriel New Port Corporation USA, with Keithley-2420 source meter under 1.5 AM illumination. To measure the adsorbed dye concentration on the 3D/1D TNS/TNR electrode surface, the dye loaded 3D/1D TNS/TNR samples were desorbed by a 0.1 M NaOH solution in water and ethanol (50:50, v:v) for 10 min. The area of the 3D/1D TNS/TNR electrode was 1 cm2. The adsorbed dye was quantitatively determined from the absorbance at 530 nm measured by UV-1800, Shimadzu UV-vis spectrophotometer (resolution 0.01 nm).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted using electrochemical work station (PARSTAT Model 273 system) at an open-circuit potential at frequencies ranging from 10−1 to 105 Hz with AC amplitude of 10 mV. Z-view2.8d (Scribner Associates) was used to fit the EIS spectra to the equivalent circuit based on the transmission line model.
3. Results and discussion
The crystallinity of the hydrothermally deposited 1D TNR and 3D/1D TNS/TNR was examined by XRD measurement. Fig. 1(a) and (b) shows the XRD patterns of TiO2 1D TNR and 3D/1D TNS/TNR samples respectively. The diffraction peaks of the 1D TNR and 3D/1D TNS/TNR have been indexed to the pure rutile phase (021-1276). Six distinct reflections such as (110), (101), (111), (210), (211) and (220) at 27.48°, 36.14°, 41.31°, 44.12°, 54.40° and 56.72° respectively, are clearly discernible.14,19 The samples are well-crystallized in rutile TiO2 single crystals, where the growth direction is along [001] orientation and the side surfaces exhibit {110} facets. No additional phases were observed. The crystallite size of the 3D/1D TNS/TNR is ∼25 nm. Both XRD patterns show the presence of a broad XRD peak at 27.48° with FWHM of 0.204, which is an indication of smaller crystallite size.

The microstructure of 3D/1D TNS/TNR was examined by HRTEM. Fig. 2 shows the HRTEM image of 3D/1D TNS/TNR sample. The clear lattice fringes of 1D TNR sample is observed to be single crystalline along its entire length. The interplanar spacings obtained from the HRTEM lattice fringes along d110 = 0.32 nm between the adjacent lattice fringes perpendicular to the rod axis can be assigned to the rutile TiO2 (110) phase. The single crystalline interface (marked by the yellow dotted circle) between 1D TNR and 3D TNS is clearly observed. This facilitates an efficient transport of photo-generated electrons harvested by nanostars to nanorods.

The lattice spacing of d001 = 0.29 nm along the longitudinal axis direction pertains to the d-spacing of rutile TiO2 (001) crystal planes.20,25 The inset of Fig. 2 shows the SAED pattern of the 3D/1D TNS/TNR sample. The SAED pattern of the rutile crystal shows a spot pattern, which indicates the single-crystalline nature of the rutile TiO2 samples.
Quantitative analyses of the electronic structures and chemical properties of the 3D/1D TNS/TNR sample was performed by XPS. Fig. 3(a) shows the Ti2p high resolution XPS spectrum with two bands in this region. The bands centred at 464.61 and 458.82 eV are attributed to Ti2p1/2 and Ti2p3/2 spin–orbital splitting photoelectrons in Ti4+, respectively. The O1s main peak at 531.82 eV is assigned to the metallic oxides (Ti–O), which is consistent with the binding energy of O2− in the TiO2 lattices (Fig. 3(b)).26

The morphology of hydrothermally synthesized photoanodes was characterized by FESEM. Fig. 4 shows FESEM images of 1d TNR and 3D/1D TNS/TNR samples. Fig. 4(a) shows a magnified FESEM image that reveals ∼250 nm diameter of nanorods. Fig. 4(b) shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the nanorods. The vertically aligned 1D TNR with 2 μm length are seen. The detailed synthesis and growth mechanism of such vertically aligned TiO2 nanorods were discussed elsewhere.10,3Fig. 4(c) shows SEM image of hydrothermally synthesized at 1:0.7 v:v% (H2O:HCl) concentration of solvent. The equal volume of HCl:H2O is beneficial for the synthesis of vertically aligned TiO2 nanorods. The concentrated HCl constraint on the hydrolysis of the TiO2 precursor results in 1D TiO2 nanorods. The growth of oriented TiO2 nanorods requires slow hydrolysis of TTIP in a fairly strong acidic aqueous medium.3 However reduction in acidity of the precursor solution might have prompted hydrolysis of TTIP. Hence the nanostars (2.5 μm in diameter) are grown onto the top of the vertically aligned TiO2 1D nanorods in-situ. The nanostars are composed of relatively shorter nanorods ∼110 nm length. Fig. 4(d) shows cross section image of the vertically aligned 1D TiO2 and 3D nanostars on top of them.

As per the above discussion, we have represented a schematic of the 3D/1D TNS/TNR architecture for DSSC application as shown in Fig. 5. Interestingly, the synthesized TiO2 3D nanostars contain ∼110 nm single crystalline nanorods. Such photoelectrode morphology helps boost both the electron transportation and photon harvesting by way of light scattering. Moreover, the nanostar morphology offers a higher surface area for dye loading and hence larger absorption cross-section.

The high quality of the nanostar–nanorod interface formed in-situ, as revealed by HR-TEM, is expected to transfer electrons from stars to rods without losses. The DSSC devices are assembled using the 1D TNR and 3D/1D TNS/TNR samples as photoelectrodes and their performance is studied. Fig. 6(a) shows the J–V plots of both samples. The average photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 1. The hydrothermally synthesized TiO2 nanorod based DSSC produced power conversion efficiency (η%) of 3.75% with short circuit current density (Jsc) 8.83 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (Voc) 0.690 V and fill factor (FF) 61%. The 3D/1D TNS/TNR sample shows η of 5.39% (Jsc = 11.70 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.712 V, FF = 62%). It is also noted that the Voc of the nanostars sample is slightly increased; which may be due to the change in Fermi level of the 3D/1D TNS/TNR sample.

The amounts of adsorbed dye molecules were determined by measuring the eluted dye concentration from both the photoelectrodes using UV-vis (UV-1800, Shimadzu) absorption spectroscopy. The 1D TNR sample shows 98 μmol cm−2, which is less as compared to the 1DTNR/3D TNS sample, which is 110 μmol cm−2. It is clear that the increment in dye adsorption is simply proportional to the surface area of the 3D/1D TNS/TNR. Transient photoconductivity was studied by exposing the dye loaded samples with AM 1.5 solar light illumination for 10 s, and the response voltage decay is measured. An OCVD experiment is conducted to investigate the recombination kinetics of the TiO2/Dye samples (as shown in the inset of Fig. 6(b)). Adopting the technique reported by Zaban et al.,27,28 we performed OCVD measurements by monitoring the Voc transient during relaxation from an illuminated quasi equilibrium state to the dark equilibrium. When photoelectrodes are illuminated, the photovoltage decay rate is related to the electron lifetime by eqn (1) (1)The thermal energy is given by kBT, e is the positive elementary charge and dVoc/dt is the derivative of the open circuit voltage transient. Fig. 6(b) is the plot of the response time obtained by applying the above equation to the data in inset of Fig. 6(b). The 3D/1D TNS/TNR sample exhibits superior characteristics, with longer life time indicating fewer recombination centers in the sample than 1D TNR sample. The longer lifetime of electrons in the such photoelectrode highlights the usefulness of the nanostar architecture in suppressing the recombination pathways at the electrode–electrode and electrode–electrolyte interface.
The light scattering–trapping–harvesting of the nanomaterials play a key role for improvement in light harvesting by increasing optical path length. In order to further demonstrate the effect of light scattering, 1D TNR and 1D TNR/3D TNS samples were studied using UV-vis reflection spectroscopic technique. Fig. 7 displays the reflectance spectra of 1D TiO2 nanorods and 3D/1D TNS/TNR samples. The average reflectance of the 1D TiO2 nanorods and 1D TNR/3D TNS sample was ∼25 and 38%, respectively, over 300–850 nm. The higher reflectance revealed that 3D/1D TNS/TNR photoanode has better light trapping than 1D TNR.29,30

Fig. 8(a) shows the EIS spectra of the TiO2 based DSSC at forward 0.7 V bias of the open-circuit voltage with an ac potential amplitude of 10 mV and a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 105 Hz. The inset shows its well fitted equivalent circuit diagram. The semicircles in the high-frequency region are related to charge-transfer resistance at the interface of Pt/redox (I−/I3−) (R2), and the semicircles in the low-frequency region are attributed to the charge-transfer process occurring at the TiO2–N-719-Dye–electrolyte interface (R3). These semicircles are classically assigned to the charge-transfer resistance at the interface of the counter electrode–electrolyte (R1), the charge-transfer resistance occurring at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface (R3) and the Nernst diffusion in the electrolyte.31 The semicircle associated with the Nernstian diffusion process is usually seen at frequencies below 0.1 Hz and requires a long acquisition time. Two semicircles associated with charge-transfer kinetics at the Pt–electrolyte interface and electron transfer and recombination kinetics at the TiO2–electrolyte interfaces are observed. The constant phase element (CPE1 and CPE2) and resistances (R1) were analyzed by using equivalent circuit as shown in inset of Fig. 8(a).
 Fig. 8  (a) Impedance spectra of the TiO2 DSSCs cells. Inset shows its equivalent circuit. (b) Bode plots of TiO2 photoelectrodes. 
As shown in Fig. 8(a) compared to the TNR sample, the 3D/1D TNS/TNR device has larger R2 and smaller R3. The increase in resistance at the TiO2–electrolyte interface is beneficial for suppressing charge recombination. This effect results in a more smooth and efficient electron transfer in the 1D TNR/3D TNS samples.
The Bode phase plots are shown in Fig. 8(b), a characteristic frequency peak in the middle frequency range of 1D/3D TiO2 (TNR/TNS) based electrodes shift greatly to a lower frequency compared to the TNR from 30.98 Hz to 22.8 Hz respectively. It is well know that any shift of the peak from high frequency to low frequency reveals a more rapid electron transport process, because the mean electron lifetime (τe) can be calculated from the relation,32 (2)where as the fmax is the frequency at the top of the intermediate-frequency arc. The longest electron lifetime in the TNR/TNS based photoanode is 6.98 ms. However, the bare TNR photoelectrode shows 5.14 ms. Hence from the above discussion it is clear that the 1D TNR/3D TNS sample 3D/1D TNS/TNR shows lower recombination rate and longer electron life time. These results are also consistent with the OCVD measurements. This results in a lower recombination rate which is very important for improving the charge-collection efficiency and the energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized novel 1D TNR and 3D/1D TNS/TNR photoelectrodes for effective light harvesting using a surfactant free single step hydrothermal route. The 3D/1D TNS/TNR synthesized at 1:0.7 v:v (H2O:HCl) shows highest 5.39% photon conversion efficiency. These 3D/1D TNS/TNR photoelectrodes are beneficial for improved electron transport and have effective light harvesting capability. The EIS results revealed that 3D/1D TNS/TNR based photoanode has τe ∼ 6.98 ms, which is much higher than the 1D TNR sample. These parameters are helpful for lower recombination rate of electron–holes which is very important for improving the charge-collection efficiency and the energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs. This new in-situ synthesis strategy to combine 1D with 3D nanostructures facilitates a one step potential approach to fabricating efficient photoelectrodes for DSSCs.
