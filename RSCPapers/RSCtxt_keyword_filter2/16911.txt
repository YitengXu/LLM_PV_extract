    , Accepted 13th December 2022First published on 19th December 2022AbstractIn perovskite solar cells (PSCs) the defect density at the charge selective layer (CSL)/perovskite absorber interface is always a few orders higher than that of the perovskite bulk due to the existence of inevitable dangling bonds and not so ideal perovskite absorber film formation on the CSL. In this work, defects at the interface of the tin oxide (SnOx) electron selective layer (ESL) and cesium-formamidinium lead iodide (CsFAPbI3) perovskite absorber were passivated simultaneously by a holistically designed and synthesised small molecule (AA6), which possesses vinyl spacer units that are conjugated to electron-rich thiophene on either side and tethered with electron-withdrawing dicyanomethylene rhodanine units. By passivating the oxygen-vacancy defects of SnOx and concurrently passivating the undercoordinated ionic defects of the perovskite absorber, the interfacial nonradiative recombination was suppressed significantly. AA6 interface passivation also improves the energy level alignment by causing an upshift of the Fermi level of SnOx from 5.05 eV to 4.85 eV which led to the reduction of the energetic barrier (250 meV to 50 meV) assisting in improved charge extraction from the perovskite absorber to SnOx. This correlates well with improved photoluminescence quenching efficiency (PLQE), reduced photoluminescence lifetime and improved thin film conductivity. Further, the increase in contact angle during AA6 passivation results in the improvement of perovskite grain size which led to the reduction of defect density per unit area, which matches well with the lower defect density obtained from space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements. One order lower leakage current (dark J–V analysis) was seen after interface modification, implying a better junction formation at the SnOx/CsFAPbI3 interface. With all these sought-after features, the optimised unencapsulated device achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.14% with an open circuit voltage of 1.05 V when measured under high relative humidity (RH ∼65–70%) conditions whereas the PCE and open circuit voltage of the pristine device were 13.96% and 1.0 V respectively. This work demonstrates that the prudently designed organic small molecule (AA6) reduces the recombination and defect induced charge carrier trapping at the CSL/perovskite interface which results in more efficient charge carrier extraction, lower energy loss and an improved device performance.
1. Introduction
In recent years, metal halide based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted a lot of interest due to their excellent intrinsic properties leading to a remarkable improvement in device efficiency (25.7%, device level) which is now akin to that of silicon solar cells (26.1%).1 Earlier studies of the PSC research community focused on lowering the defect density of solution-processable perovskite absorbers via tuning the perovskite stoichiometry, changing the processing methods, and developing in situ perovskite defect passivation strategies, thereby improving the device efficiency.2 However, the perovskite/CSL interface defect density is often two orders of magnitude greater than the perovskite bulk intrinsic defect density and has not been well optimized to date. The major cause for higher order perovskite/CSL interface defects is the uncontrolled nucleation process occurring during perovskite film formation, as well as surface dangling bonds of the bottom CSLs.3 The most common interface defects found in perovskite absorbers are undercoordinated Pb2+ and I− vacancies which have lower formation energy than deep level defects and these may be passivated using surface passivation techniques.4 Similarly, low temperature (180 °C) processed SnOx exhibits uncontrolled defect formation due to inappropriate oxygen vapour pressure and annealing temperature, preventing the attainment of maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) in PSCs.5 Hence, the optimization of both SnOx and perovskite interface defects is crucial for achieving higher efficiency PSC devices.
As compared to TiO2 & ZnO, low temperature processed SnOx (<180 °C) is widely used as an electron selective layer (ESL) due to its innate advantages like lower parasitic absorption significantly above 1200 nm (crucial for tandem solar cells), lower refractive index (<2, improves transmittance), negligible catalytic activity (strong for TiO2), better UV light and chemical stability, feasibility of integration on flexible substrates (polyethylene terephthalate, PET and polyethylene naphthalate, PEN), and easy integration for pilot line processes.5,6 Although the low temperature processed SnOx ESL offers many benefits, it also has limitations such as uncontrolled defect formation that is observed during the film fabrication process. The dominant defects are oxygen vacancies (Vo) and tin interstitials (Sni) in the bulk SnOx. The SnOx/perovskite interface limits charge extraction via defect induced recombination processes and also the SnOx defects alter the SnOx band states (conduction band edge and Fermi level) resulting in Voc loss.7–9 At the SnOx/perovskite interface, defects of both layers (SnOx and perovskite) are dominant namely (1) the uncontrolled SnOx surface defects (Vo & Sni) and (2) the perovskite undercoordinated ionic (Pb2+) defects. Both defects lead to higher order defect density at the SnOx/perovskite interface.10 Elemental doping is a typical approach often utilized for controlling the defect states in low temperature processed SnOx films, but it does not passivate the undercoordinated perovskite defects at the SnOx/perovskite interface. As a result, an interlayer or passivation layer is often introduced at the SnOx/perovskite interface to passivate the SnOx and perovskite interface defects.5
Fullerene (C60) derivatives were used as surface passivators for the SnOx ESL due to their electron accepting nature. For understanding the interaction of fullerene derivatives/SnOx, Wang et al. studied the effect of C60 side chains and they observed that the hydroxy group containing [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid bonds to the SnOx surface with excellent surface coverage and acts as an ESL, leading to increased passivation and enhanced PCE, whereas [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) acts only as an ESL due to the physisorption process (not bonded to the surface) giving comparatively lower PCE.11 Similarly, Huang et al. used C60 pyrrolidine tris-acid as a passivation layer for SnOx thin films, wherein the carboxylic acid group was covalently bound to the SnOx layer causing a shift in the Sn 3d binding energy which led to an enhanced dipole moment resulting in PCE > 19%.12 When C60-substituted phenol was used as the SnOx interlayer, PCE was found to increase to 21.39% from 19.04% via lowering of the trap state density.13 Instead of using a fullerene derivative, Liu et al. used an inorganic potassium halide passivation at the SnOx interface, which passivated the perovskite ionic defects and increased the PCE and Voc of the PSC.14 Tu et al. used triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) molecules as the surface passivation layer which shifts the Sn 3d peaks to lower binding energy and from the density functional theory (DFT) studies it was noted that more delocalized electrons were present at Sn sites which resulted in enhanced conductivity and a reduced energy barrier between the perovskite and SnOx further leading to improved device performance.15 Hill et al. observed a drop in PCE following SnOx passivation with various phosphonic acids, but increased device stability was seen.16 Jiang et al. found that introducing phosphoric acid into SnOx solution decreases the Sn2+ content from 36% to 19% through Sn–O–P bonding, resulting in an enhanced PCE of 21%.17 Zhang et al. used amino trimethylene phosphonic acid (ATMP), which contains three PO groups that passivate the oxygen vacancies and replace surface Sn–OH with Sn–OP, leading to reduced surface hydroxyl groups on the SnOx layer causing an increase in PCE from 20.99% to 23.52%.18 Liu et al. found that incorporating phytic acid in SnO2 solution reduces the SnO2 cluster size distribution to ∼15.8 nm from ∼98.3 nm and the phytic acid–SnO2 complexation shifts the core Sn 3d peak by ∼0.26 eV resulting in better energy alignment with the perovskite layer and reduced surface defects, which leads to an improved PCE of 21.4%.19 Sun et al. introduced p-amino benzenesulfonic acid to modify the SnOx and perovskite interface wherein the sulfonic acid groups passivate the undercoordinated Sn ions in the SnOx layer and alkaline amino groups passivate the deep level perovskite defects. This dual side passivation strategy not only reduces the interface defects but also reduces the energetic barrier between SnOx and the perovskite, which results in better charge carrier transport with improved device performance.20 Chen et al. utilised thioctic acid that was chemically anchored at the TiO2 interface, and the introduction of thioctic acid into the perovskite bulk favoured in situ polymer cross-linking during thermal annealing for effective passivation of defects, and the enhancement of hydrophobicity on the perovskite film improved the device performance.21 Sun et al. used several triazine-based small molecules for perovskite surface passivation by dissolution in an antisolvent. The electron donating groups in the triazine molecule (–NH2, –CN, and CO) passivate Pb2+ defects and the electron withdrawing groups in the triazine molecule (F, Cl, N–H, and O–H) passivate I− defects in the perovskite absorber, resulting in improved device performance.22
Chen et al. used a commercial imidazoleacetic acid hydrochloride based ionic liquid as a bifunctional passivating agent, which acted as a chemical bridge between SnO2 and the perovskite resulting in an increase in PCE from 18.6% to 20.2%.23 Recently, Ming et al. used a commercial β-alanine molecule to passivate defects in both SnO2 and the perovskite layer wherein the carbonyl group in β-alanine formed hydrogen bonds with oxygen vacancies in SnOx and the Lewis base amino group bonded to undercoordinated Pb2+ sites in the perovskite absorber resulting in an improved device performance.24 Zhang et al. used a commercial thiophene-based carboxylic acid molecule as a dual passivating layer with different chain lengths which were used to treat the SnOx layer wherein the carboxyl groups passivated the surface terminal groups in SnOx and the sulfur atom on the thiophene ring passivated the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects.25 Recently, Zhong et al. also used a commercially available 3-thiophenboric acid (TBA) molecule for SnOx surface passivation. In this case, TBA binds to the SnOx surface and forms an Sn–O–B bond whereas the sulfur atoms in the thiophene ring bind with the perovskite undercoordinated Pb2+ sites resulting in dual passivation which reduces trap density with improved Voc and fill factor for PSCs.26
As can be seen from the above reports, simple molecules with charged functional groups such as carboxylic/phosphoric/boric acid, primary/tertiary amine or sulphur centre existing in the polarized state were used for defect passivation at the SnO2/perovskite interface. Migration of charged ions in these simple molecules and not so ideal energy level alignment in a few cases along with surface energy mismatch and inferior perovskite absorber grain growth on top of the CSL can result in poor efficiency and device instability. Taking note of these expedient functional characteristics, it would be of great interest to explore and design molecules having a donor–acceptor (D–A) configuration with multiple heteroatoms having lone pair electrons. The advantage of interface modifiers based on D–A units is that they can simultaneously passivate the defects on the surface of metal oxide(s) and the perovskite absorber due to the presence of multiple heteroatoms with lone pair electrons. Also, these molecules facilitate the tuning of the surface energy of the underlying CSL that can facilitate the growth of a high-quality perovskite film. The D–A configuration also results in the formation of a dipole moment which can result in better interfacial energy level alignment which is crucial for better charge carrier separation, collection and transport. Keeping in mind the above-mentioned salient features of D–A type molecules, here we have designed and synthesized a unique organic small molecule (AA6) comprising a vinyl spacer unit in the middle that is linked to electron-rich thiophene (donor moiety) on both sides and tethered with electron-withdrawing dicyanomethylene rhodanine units (acceptor moiety) and used it for dual-side passivation.
The rationale behind the design of the AA6 molecule is as follows: (a) the extended π-conjugation that can arise due to the vinyl spacer being at the centre of the molecule helps in achieving better charge transport;27 (b) the existence of a vinyl group between adjacent thiophene rings can favour the ordered conformation along with planarity of the structure which can facilitate π–π interaction between the stacked molecular entities and results in improved thermal stability which is a crucial parameter in device fabrication;28 (c) electron withdrawing dicyanomethylene rhodanine units conjugated to thiophene with π electron density can cause the push–pull effect29 and this donor–acceptor (D–A) interaction, often termed intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT), is responsible for polarisation and generation of a molecular dipole; (d) the multiple heteroatoms present with lone pair electrons – for example, the sulfur atoms on the thiophene moiety – can form bonds with the undercoordinated lead atoms which can result in defect passivation; and finally (e) tuning of the surface energy of the CSL/perovskite interface by the incorporation of this molecule.
When we employed this molecule possessing the above-mentioned salient features as a two-side passivating layer at the SnOx/perovskite absorber interface, we observed the following: (a) a binding energy shift of the Sn 3d peaks of SnOx and Pb 4f peaks of the perovskite absorber after modification with AA6 which indicates the following – (i) good interaction between the AA6 molecule and SnOx which results in the variation of electron cloud density around the tin atom and (ii) involvement of the AA6 molecule in the undercoordinated Pb2+ defect passivation as the electron density around the Pb2+ sites is also altered; (b) Fermi level realignment – the scanning Kelvin probe based contact potential difference measurement shows that the AA6 modification causes an upshift of the Fermi level of SnOx from 5.05 eV to 4.85 eV which led to the reduction of the energetic barrier (250 meV to 50 meV); (c) proper energetic alignment of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the perovskite, LUMO of AA6 and SnOx conduction band justifies effective charge carrier extraction which was confirmed through steady state and time resolved PL measurements; and (d) the increased contact angle of AA6 passivated films (contact angle ∼38°) compared to bare SnOx (contact angle ∼17°) favours the formation of larger perovskite grains (∼225 nm to ∼375 nm) leading to reduced grain boundaries causing less defect density per unit area on AA6/perovskite films. The defect passivation of both SnOx and perovskite layers, optimized Fermi level, better energy level alignment and improved perovskite film quality lead to enhanced device performance from 13.96% to 16.14% with better fill factor (57% to 62%) and improved Voc (from 1.0 V to 1.05 V) when measured at high relative humidity (RH ∼65–70%) conditions without encapsulation.

2.3 Device fabrication
ITO coated glass substrates (XY15S, Xin Yan Technology Ltd, with sheet resistance (Rsh) ∼15 Ω sq−1 and transmittance at 550 nm: 85%) were ultrasonically cleaned for 10 minutes each, with soap solution, deionised water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol and immediately dried for 30 minutes in a hot air oven. After drying the ITO substrate, it was exposed to UV/ozone for 30 minutes to get rid of any organic contaminants and other impurities. The 4 wt% SnOx aqueous solution was spun on ozonated ITO at 4000 rpm for 30 seconds and annealed at 180 °C for 30 minutes to obtain a ∼30 nm thick film. The synthesised AA6 molecule was diluted in dry chloroform at various concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 1 mg mL−1 for interlayer passivation and spin coated onto the underlying SnOx layer at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds and dried at 100 °C for five minutes to remove the solvent residuals. The AA6 passivated SnOx films were then quickly transferred to an inert atmosphere glovebox filled with nitrogen (O2 < 1 ppm and H2O < 1 ppm) for further perovskite absorber and hole selective layer (HSL) processing. The double cation-based perovskite absorber (Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3) solution was prepared using a suitable ratio of precursors such as 0.1 M CsI, 0.9 M FAI, and 1 M PbI2 in a 4:1 ratio anhydrous DMF:DMSO solvent with stirring at 70 °C overnight. Before spin coating, the perovskite solution was filtered using a 0.45 μm PTFE syringe filter. The perovskite absorber solution was then sequentially deposited by a spin-coating process on the SnOx layer at 1500 rpm for 10 seconds and 4500 rpm for 30 seconds and 300 μL of dry chlorobenzene antisolvent was drop cast onto the film surface about ten seconds before the completion of spin coating to attain a film thickness of ∼400 nm. These films were then annealed at 120 °C for 20 minutes. On top of the perovskite absorber, spiro-OMeTAD HSL solution was coated at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds. To prepare the spiro-OMeTAD solution, ∼73 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI (120 mg in 250 μL of acetonitrile) and 28.8 μL of 4-tBP were added in 1 mL of dry chlorobenzene. Finally, a silver metal contact with a thickness of ∼150 nm was thermally deposited using a shadow mask under high vacuum conditions of <2 × 10−4 Pa. The device active area is 9 mm2.
2.4 Perovskite solar cell device testing
The fabricated PSC devices were tested in an Oriel Sol3A (class 3A) solar simulator from Newport Corporation, USA. A standard reference silicon cell was used for light intensity calibration (91150V, Newport Corporation). The electrical parameters (J–V data) were measured in a Keithley 2400 source meter with a sweep rate of 120 mV s−1 under reverse scan conditions without any preconditioning such as light soaking.
2.5 Characterization techniques

1H and 13C-NMR data were obtained using Bruker 500 MHz BBFO equipment and HPLC mass spectroscopy data were obtained using an LC-MS-2020 Shimadzu spectrometer. UV-vis spectra were acquired using a SHIMADZU UV 3600 PLUS in DRS mode for both absorbance and transmittance measurements. X-ray diffractograms were collected using a Bruker (D8 Advance) diffractometer with a Cu Kα source and data were taken with a step size of 0.02°. A scanning electron microscope equipped with an EDS detector (Thermo Scientific Apreo system) was used to obtain SEM images and to carry out EDX analysis. A low accelerating voltage (10 kV) was utilised to minimise the beam damage on the perovskite absorber. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under a nitrogen environment from room temperature to 800 °C employing an SDT Q600 (TA Instruments, USA; the ramp rate used is 20 °C per min). A PHI VersaProbe III system was utilised to conduct X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) under ultra-high vacuum conditions (∼8 × 10−10 Torr) with a spot size of 100 μm using a 25.5 W power-based X-ray source with an Al Kα monochromator. This XPS system has built-in charge adjustments utilising the dual beam charge compensation technique and all samples were calibrated using C 1s spectra at 284.8 eV with a 0.01 eV accuracy. For baseline correction, the ‘XPSPEAK41’ software was utilised, and deconvoluted plots were crosschecked using the ‘CasaXPS software, version 2.3.24’. Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy with a resolution of <5 meV (model: SKP5050) was used to measure the contact potential difference (CPD) and the surface photovoltage was measured using a QTH lamp source of light intensity 70 mW cm−2. Steady state and time resolved PL was measured in an FLS1000 Edinburgh setup using a ∼450 nm (±8 nm) ps pulsed diode laser as the excitation source and the repetition rate was synchronized with the time window (2 μs). Space Charge Limited Current (SCLC) and conductivity (I–V) measurements were performed under ambient dark conditions using a Keithley 2400 source meter with a scan range of −3.0 V to 3.0 V and at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out using an Origaflex multichannel system (Origaflex OGF500) instrument with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. FT-IR measurements were carried out using a Bruker Alpha instrument. The static sessile drop technique was used for contact angle measurements using a DMs-401 model from Kyowa Interface Science.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the AA6 organic small molecule
In the newly synthesized AA6 molecule, the vinyl fragment at the centre bridging the donor thiophene moiety is end-capped with ethyl substituted rhodanine-(CN)2 as the acceptor and exhibits π-conjugation which facilitates molecular packing and charge transfer. The electrostatic potential (ESP) plot obtained from DFT (density functional theory) and TD-DFT (time-dependent density functional theory) calculations reveals the charge distribution in the molecule with relatively high electron density around the rhodanine units due to the existence of strong electron withdrawing cyano and carbonyl groups as shown in Fig. 1a. To obtain the optimized structure of the molecule, the B3LYP exchange–correlation functional with the 6-31G** basis set was used. The observed variation of electron distribution in the structure of AA6 is due to the intervening vinyl group in the thiophene–rhodanine conjugate.34

In Fig. 1b, the normalised absorption and emission spectra of the AA6 molecule in dry chloroform solvent are provided. The absorption maximum was observed at 535 nm with a shoulder peak at 567 nm and the corresponding emission maximum was observed at 629 nm. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) profile of AA6 is shown in Fig. 1c, which reveals excellent thermal stability with a high Td value (∼320 °C, noted at 5% weight loss). Such a high Td value is essential to satisfy the temperature cycle test (ISOS-T) protocols as well as to deploy it in high temperature top layer processing for device fabrication.35,36
3.2 Thin film characterization
UV-vis transmittance spectroscopy was performed for SnOx and AA6 passivated SnOx as shown in Fig. 1d. Weighted average transmittance (%WAT) was calculated using eqn (1) to quantify the effect of change in transmittance upon AA6 modification. (1)where %T is the transmittance spectra of the measured samples, IAM1.5 is the AM 1.5 solar spectrum and λ is the measured wavelength of range 300 nm (λ1) to 800 nm (λ2).37 For glass/ITO/SnOx, the %WAT was ∼85.9% and for 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg mL−1 AA6 passivated SnOx layers, %WAT of ∼84.9%, ∼85.4% and ∼84.5% was observed respectively, which is a less than 2% drop compared to SnOx samples and this indicates that there is no adverse variation in %WAT with respect to AA6 passivation of SnOx. To further evaluate the effect of AA6 on %WAT, 1 mg mL−1 AA6 solution (in CHCl3) was coated directly onto the glass/ITO substrate (without the SnOx layer) as shown in Fig. S10† and %WAT of ∼81.2% was observed which is a less than 1% drop when compared to the glass/ITO substrate (∼81.8%). The above observations reveal that the AA6 passivation does not affect the light absorption process of the CsFAPbI3 perovskite absorber. To ensure proper film formation and uniform coverage of the AA6 molecule, SEM analysis was performed for both SnOx and AA6 passivated SnOx (Fig. S11a and b†) thin films. They form uniform films without cracks and pinholes, which is crucial for effective charge transport from the perovskite absorber to the ITO layer. For bare SnOx, no detrimental sulfur content was seen in EDX mapping (Fig. 1e) and the presence of trace amounts of sulfur (0.02 wt%) in bare SnOx (Table S1†) is attributed to the bottom glass substrate (glass/ITO/SnOx). To improve the glass quality during glass manufacturing, sulphate or sulfide-based compounds are commonly used in the fining process as they help in preventing air bubbles. For this purpose, around 0.05 wt% sulfur compounds are typically used, which matches well with our SnOx thin film EDX sulfur mapping data.38 XPS analysis of the bare SnOx thin film reveals no S 2p peaks (Fig. S12b†) within the detection range and it confirms that the observed sulfur (0.02 wt%) content in SnOx (in EDX mapping) indeed originates only from the glass substrate. Upon AA6 modification, the presence of uniform sulfur throughout the film (Fig. 1f) was observed, and this confirms the uniform spreading of AA6 on the SnOx layer. As expected, the EDX plot and Table S1† clearly show that when the concentration of AA6 increases during passivation, the sulfur wt% also increases to 0.09% (0.05 mg mL−1 AA6), 0.3% (0.1 mg mL−1 AA6) and 0.41% (0.2 mg mL−1 AA6) respectively.26 Similarly, XPS analysis of SnOx/0.1 mg mL−1 AA6 passivation exhibits ∼0.4 wt% sulfur content which is slightly higher than that observed via EDX mapping (0.3 wt%) and this slight variation is attributed to the substantial variation in the beam penetration depth (XPS ∼10 nm, EDX ∼100 nm to micrometres). Dumitrache et al. have noticed a significant variation between EDX (fluorine atomic% ∼12.87%) and XPS (fluorine atomic% ∼27%) measurements of fluorine percentage on Zn/F-doped tin oxide nanoparticles.39
The XPS measurements were performed to confirm both SnOx/AA6 interaction and perovskite/AA6 interaction. For SnOx/AA6 interaction, XPS was measured for SnOx, AA6 and SnOx/AA6 samples coated on the silicon substrate in order to eliminate the interaction of the ITO substrate (containing Sn and O) with AA6 and the corresponding survey scan is shown in Fig. S12a.† The Sn 3d core level spectrum of pristine SnOx is deconvoluted, considering the spin-orbit coupling, into Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2 peaks at binding energies of 495 eV and 486.6 eV respectively. After AA6 passivation the corresponding binding energies are shifted to ∼0.1 eV lower binding energies for 0.1 mg mL−1 AA6 passivation (Sn 3d3/2 ∼494.9 eV and Sn 3d5/2 ∼486.5 eV) and ∼0.2 eV lower binding energies for 0.3 mg mL−1 AA6 passivation (Sn 3d3/2 ∼494.8 eV & Sn 3d5/2 ∼486.4 eV). The shift in Sn 3d binding energy is due to the interaction of the AA6 molecule and SnOx layer (Fig. 2a and b).24 Similarly, Zhang et al. observed a 0.19 eV Sn 3d peak shift during thiophene-based interlayer passivation on SnOx and such shifts are commonly observed and acceptable in surface passivation strategies and herein we also observe a similar trend in Sn 3d peak shifts.25 The AA6 molecule's ESP plot (Fig. 1a) shows a strong electronegativity distribution at –CN and CO positions which may partially replace Sn–O with Sn–N bonds at the SnOx layer upon AA6 passivation which causes the Sn 3d peaks to be shifted to lower binding energy for AA6 passivated SnOx. Yu et al. also observed a similar Sn 3d shift during the interaction of the Hf(ACBN)4 molecule with SnOx and its ESP distribution with binding energy calculation reveals the possibilities of Sn–N formation leading to a shifted Sn 3d peak (∼0.3 eV) which is similar to our observation on AA6 passivation of SnOx.40

To further understand the oxidation states of Sn, the Sn 3d5/2 peaks are deconvoluted into Sn4+, Sn2+ and Sn0 (atomic Sn) oxidation states as shown in Fig. 2d. For bare SnOx, the Sn4+ states are observed at 486.58 eV and account for only 72% of the total composition. The presence of oxygen vacancy at the surface of SnOx due to disproportionation reaction during SnOx annealing may be responsible for the formation of the Sn2+ valence state (487.14 eV) which accounts for another 20% and atomic Sn (Sn0) accounts for the remaining 8%.17,41,42 The AA6 passivation on SnOx (Fig. 2e) suppresses the formation of the Sn2+ valence state from 20% to 16% and Sn0 from 8% to 4% which implies the reduction of oxygen vacancies and Sn interstitials (Table S2†).3
To further verify the oxygen vacancies, the deconvoluted O 1s spectra were plotted for SnOx (Fig. 2f) and SnOx/AA6 (Fig. 2g) samples. The O 1s dominant lattice oxygen peak (530.7 eV) for both SnOx and AA6 passivated SnOx accounts for ∼66% of the total composition (Table S3†) while the amorphous oxygen (532.1 eV) was comparatively lower on AA6 passivated SnOx (26%) than SnOx (33%) due to the reduction of defects in the SnOx layer. The remaining 7% of O 1s deconvoluted spectra (532 eV) in AA6 passivated SnOx was due to chemical interaction of SnOx and AA6, with possibilities of Sn–S–Sn, Sn–O–S, Sn–N–O and Sn–O–N bond formation. Liu et al. also observed a similar O 1s deconvoluted bond formation upon phytic acid passivation (Sn–O–P) on the SnOx layer.17,19,25 Similarly, Pan et al. observed oxynitride formation in SnO2 by Sn–O–N (401.2 eV) or Sn–N–O (399.7 eV) and Wang et al. noticed Ti–O–N and Ti–N–O peak formation upon nitrogen doping of TiO2.43,44 Similarly, the presence of the S 2p (Fig. S12b†) peak at ∼164 eV and N 1s (Fig. S12c†) peak at ∼400 eV validates the adherence of AA6 in the SnOx layer. The presence of lone pairs on sulfur and nitrogen atoms in AA6 passivates the SnOx defects which results in the reduction of Sn2+, atomic Sn (Sn0) and amorphous oxygen in the SnOx surface as discussed earlier. To support the AA6 passivation on SnOx, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) data were collected for AA6, SnOx, and AA6:SnOx (1:2) powder mixture as depicted in Fig. S14a.† A marginal shift (11 cm−1) was observed in the Sn–O vibration peak from the sample of AA6:SnOx (650 cm−1) as compared to SnOx (661 cm−1) (Fig. S14b†). This suggests that the existence of lone pair electrons on the heteroatoms of the AA6 molecule could passivate the SnOx defects, which agrees well with the Sn 3d XPS peak shift (Fig. 2b) and oxygen vacancy reduction in O 1s spectral deconvolution (Fig. 2f and g). Liu et al. observed a similar phenomenon using phytic acid-complexed SnO2 and a ∼9 cm−1 shift was observed in the Sn–O vibration peak compared to bare SnOx due to phytic acid coordination with Sn dangling bonds (Sn–O–P), leading to enhanced PSC device performance.19
To confirm the perovskite absorber/AA6 interaction, the XPS survey scan of CsFAPbI3 and CsFAPbI3/AA6 (0.1 mg mL−1) samples was taken as shown in Fig. S15.† The Pb 4f characteristic peaks of CsFAPbI3 are positioned at Pb 4f7/2 ∼137.75 eV and Pb 4f5/2 ∼142.65 eV (Fig. 2c). After AA6 passivation, a ∼0.25 eV higher binding energy shift (Pb 4f7/2 ∼138 eV, Pb 4f5/2 ∼142.9 eV) was observed, suggesting that the AA6 molecule is involved in the perovskite Pb2+ defect passivation at the SnOx/perovskite interface and alters the electron density around the Pb2+ sites.45 To justify the AA6 passivation on CsFAPbI3 and to validate the Pb 4f peak shift, FT-IR measurements for AA6, PbI2, and AA6:PbI2 (1:2 ratio) were performed as shown in Fig. S14c.† The symmetric stretching frequency of the –CO peak in the AA6:PbI2 mixed powder (1712 cm−1) was found to shift by 4 cm−1 as compared to pristine AA6 (1708 cm−1) and this is attributed to the interaction between –CO of the AA6 molecule and undercoordinated Pb2+ in the perovskite absorber (Fig. S14d†). This observation further reveals that the AA6 molecule indeed passivates the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects which are known to be the dominant non-radiative recombination centres in the perovskite absorber layer.46 Thus, XPS and FT-IR analyses confirm that the AA6 passivates both SnOx and CsFAPbI3 defects, acting as a dual passivating agent.
To better understand the energetic barriers between SnOx, AA6 and CsFAPbI3, scanning Kelvin probe measurements for SnOx, SnOx/AA6, SnOx/CsFAPbI3 and SnOx/AA6/CsFAPbI3 thin films were carried out. The Fermi level (Ef) is upshifted to 4.85 eV for 0.1 mg mL−1 concentration of AA6 passivated SnOx when compared to bare SnOx (∼5.05 eV) as shown in Fig. 3a and ∼4.9 eV (Fermi level) was observed for higher concentrations of AA6 passivation (0.2 mg mL−1, 1 mg mL−1 and 2 mg mL−1) as shown in Table 1. The observed upshift in the Fermi level in AA6 passivated SnOx is mainly due to its structural feature, wherein thiophene units are connected via a vinyl unit to facilitate conjugation among the electron withdrawing rhodanine units containing the dicyanomethylene group. In fact, exo-carbonyl groups on the rhodanine backbone and exo-cyano groups comprehensively withdraw electron density from the thiophene ring, inducing a dipole moment uniformly on both sides of AA6, leading to an upshift in the Fermi level from 5.05 eV (SnOx) to 4.85 eV (SnOx/AA6) and thereby reducing the energetic barrier between AA6 passivated SnOx and CsFAPbI3. However, there is no significant influence on the Fermi level of CsFAPbI3 (∼4.8 eV) coated on AA6 passivated SnOx (Fig. 3b) and bare SnOx.47

This Fermi level shift (0.2 eV) during AA6 passivation closely matches with earlier reports such as phytic acid complexed SnO2 which shows a Fermi level shift of ∼0.13 eV. A Fermi level shift of ∼0.14 eV to 0.29 eV was observed in the case of thiophene with interlayer passivation on SnOx based on various methylene spacers, similar to this work.19,25 The Fermi level difference (ΔEf) between SnOx and CsFAPbI3 is ∼250 meV, while AA6 passivated SnOx films show only ∼50 meV as shown in the band diagram (Fig. 3c), indicating the lower energetic barrier between the AA6 passivated SnOx and perovskite layers which is crucial for a better charge extraction process.25 The conduction band minimum (CBM) of SnOx is about −4.4 to −4.5 eV whereas the absorber CsFAPbI3 CBM is −3.85 eV and this large energy gap results in a large energy barrier for electrons (ΔEe: the energy difference between the Fermi level of the SnOx and the CBM of the absorber) to transport across the ESL/absorber interface, which causes energy loss (Eloss) in perovskite solar cells. As can be seen from the results, ΔEe is minimized due to the upward band-bending and the allied electric field facilitates both the separation and transport efficiency of charge carriers and this will result in better charge transport efficiency at the interface which is favourable for reducing Voc losses and Eloss.
UV-vis absorption data were collected for CsFAPbI3 coated on AA6 passivated SnOx layers to analyse the effect of AA6 during light absorbance. No change was noticed in the onset (∼795 nm) of absorbance for the perovskite absorber. Also, no observable influence on the light absorption over the entire perovskite absorption range (400 to 800 nm) was observed as shown in Fig. 4a. This reveals that AA6 passivation between SnOx and the perovskite absorber has no adverse effect during the light absorption process.

The XRD spectra (Fig. 4b) were measured for CsFAPbI3 and AA6 passivated CsFAPbI3 films, both of which formed a highly pure crystalline perovskite structure without precursor peaks (PbI2, CsI and FAI) and hydrated perovskite peaks. The similar peak profile in the diffractograms indicates that there is no change in the perovskite growth direction and it is largely independent of the AA6 layer underneath it, which is crucial for maintaining a uniform charge transport direction between the perovskite layer and the SnOx layer.11 The observed higher intensity of the CsFAPbI3 (101) plane while coated on the AA6 layer reveals enhancement of perovskite crystallinity (Fig. S16†) and a highly crystalline perovskite absorber is crucial for enhanced carrier mobility.
The effect of perovskite surface morphology prior to and after AA6 treatment was analysed using SEM images as depicted in Fig. 4c–f. In all the cases, perovskite films were formed uniformly, free from undesirable cracks and pinholes. The grain size of pristine CsFAPbI3 was ∼225 nm when coated on the SnOx layer which increased to ∼375 nm when coated on the 0.1 mg mL−1 AA6 passivated SnOx layer as shown in the histogram plots in Fig. S17a–d† and this correlates well with the increased crystallinity as seen in XRD analysis (Fig. 4b). As expected, improved grain size compared to bare SnOx was seen in all the cases.48 Hence, the larger grain size of AA6 interlayered perovskite thin films resulted in fewer grain boundaries per unit area than for the bare SnOx coated samples. The grain boundaries are the dominant recombination sites compared to the grain interior, indicating that the fewer grain boundaries or larger grain sized perovskite thin films increase the local carrier lifetime and mobility, which is essential for effective carrier transport across the perovskite layer with lower defect induced carrier recombination.49 The thickness of CsFAPbI3 on the AA6 passivated SnOx layer was measured using cross-section SEM analysis as shown in Fig. 4g (architecture: glass/ITO/SnOx/0.1 mg mL−1 AA6/CsFAPbI3) and those without AA6 passivation are given in Fig. S18.† For both the samples, the thickness of CsFAPbI3 was ∼400 nm without much deviation and the SnOx thickness is also in the expected range (∼30 nm). Notably, there is no observable formation of a separate AA6 layer upon AA6 (0.1 mg mL−1) passivation which may be due to the lower concentration of AA6 employed.
To better understand the perovskite grain size enhancement on the AA6 passivated SnOx layer, the perovskite ink-based contact angle was measured on SnOx and AA6 passivated SnOx layers. The wetting of perovskite ink on SnOx resulted in a contact angle of ∼17°, but for AA6 passivated films the contact angle was found to be 38° for 0.1 mg mL−1 AA6 and 45° for 1 mg mL−1 AA6 as shown in Fig. 4h and i and S19† respectively. The enhancement of contact angle in AA6 modified substrates is due to the existence of a saturated heterocyclic rhodanine ring tethered with N-ethyl and dicyanomethylene groups on both ends of AA6. Solmaz et al. have coated rhodanine on a copper metal surface and found an improvement in contact angle of 35°, similar to our rhodanine based AA6 molecule.50 The increased contact angle seen in AA6 passivated SnOx minimizes the possibilities of a heterogeneous nucleation process due to reduced nuclei density during perovskite growth formation. This leads to larger perovskite grain size through a grain boundary migration process as shown in Fig. 4c–f.13,51 This increased grain size is essential for smooth film formation with reduced grain boundaries leading to effective charge extraction at the SnOx/perovskite interface via AA6 passivation.
After the charge generation process, the generated charge carriers should be effectively extracted to the CSL, otherwise charge recombination will occur. For this, an ideal SnOx/perovskite interface and proper energetic alignment of the perovskite LUMO, AA6 LUMO and SnOx conduction band is essential for effective charge extraction. Subsequently, to better understand the band edge transport from the perovskite to SnOxvia the AA6 molecule, cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies were carried out to obtain the HOMO and LUMO level of the AA6 molecule as this information is critical for constructing the SnOx/AA6/perovskite energy level diagram. For CV measurements, a three-electrode system with working electrode: glassy carbon, counter electrode: Pt wire, and reference electrode: Ag/AgCl was used in an inert atmosphere (argon gas) with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in dry dichloromethane (DCM) as the supporting electrolyte and the ferrocene/ferrocenium ion redox couple as the internal reference. The halfway oxidation potential (Eox1/2) of AA6 is 1.29 V based on the CV data (Fig. S20a†) and using this the HOMO level was calculated to be −5.88 eV and the corresponding LUMO level was calculated by adding the optical band gap (Eg ∼2.0 eV) of the AA6 molecule with the HOMO (Fig. S20b†) and found to be −3.88 eV. SnOx and perovskite energy levels were taken from reported literature.52,53 The energy levels of the AA6 molecule were obtained by adopting the measurement procedure earlier reported by Abate et al.54 and Nazeeruddin et al.55 These values were then used for constructing PSC energy levels as shown in Fig. 5a. The proper energetic alignment of the perovskite LUMO, AA6 LUMO and SnOx conduction band is seen and this should result in a better charge extraction process.

(b) Time resolved PL analysis of CsFAPbI3 coated on SnOx, and 0.1 mg mL−1 and 0.2 mg mL−1 AA6 passivated SnOx films (inset: corresponding steady state PL spectra). (c) Surface photovoltage analysis of SnOx/CsFAPbI3 and SnOx/AA6/CsFAPbI3 films. (d) I–V conductivity measurements of SnOx and SnOx/AA6 coated films. 
To confirm this hypothesis and better understand the charge carrier dynamics, we then carried out steady state photoluminescence (PL) and time resolved PL studies for perovskite absorber films deposited on SnOx and AA6 modified SnOx films. Fig. 5b (inset) shows the steady-state PL emission spectra of perovskite coated on SnOx and AA6 passivated SnOx layers. As can be observed from the steady state PL spectra, higher PL quenching was seen in the case of the perovskite absorber deposited on the SnOx/AA6 substrate.
The reason behind the observed increased PL quenching can be attributed to the following two factors: (a) sub-standard quality perovskite film resulting in the formation of more trap-states and (b) the augmentation of electron extraction and transportation at the interface. From the SEM image it is obvious that the perovskite absorber films are crack free and no pin holes are observed and also the higher intensity of the CsFAPbI3 (101) plane while coated on the AA6 layer as deciphered from the X-ray diffractogram unequivocally confirms the PL quenching seen is indeed associated with the interface change rather than the quality of the perovskite absorber film. The photoluminescence quenching efficiency was calculated using the equation ‘PLQE (%) = ((ISnOx − IAA6)/ISnOx) × 100’, where ISnOx is the PL emission intensity of SnOx/CsFAPbI3 and IAA6 is the intensity of different concentrations of AA6 between SnOx and CsFAPbI3 based samples respectively. In comparison with bare SnOx, the 0.05 mg mL−1 and 0.1 mg mL−1 AA6 samples showed ∼48% and ∼75% more PLQE, suggesting that the AA6 (0.1 mg mL−1) passivated SnOx layer provides better charge extraction from perovskite than bare SnOx, indicating that AA6 passivation effectively suppresses the SnOx/perovskite interface recombination, which results in lower energetic (Voc) loss as discussed later.56 As expected, the higher concentration of AA6 (0.2 mg mL−1) has ∼28% lower PLQE (increased PL emission) than bare SnOx (Fig. S21a†) which may occur due to the possibility of forming a separate layer of AA6. However, studying the behaviour of the gradient bilayer is not in the scope of this work.
The excited state kinetics of SnOx/CsFAPbI3 and AA6 passivated SnOx/CsFAPbI3 thin films were further investigated using time resolved PL studies and the data were plotted using a bi-exponential fit (eqn (2)) as shown in Fig. 5b with fitting parameters listed in Table S4.† (2) (3)where τ1 and τ2 indicate the fast decay and slow decay lifetime components of the perovskite absorber, I1 and I2 refer to the corresponding amplitude and τavg represents the average PL lifetime.57,58 The fast lifetime component (τ1) indicates interfacial charge carrier recombination at the SnOx/CsFAPbI3 interface, while the slow lifetime component (τ2) relates to the bulk recombination.59 CsFAPbI3 on 0.1 mg mL−1 AA6 passivated SnOx films has a lower τ1 (25 ns) than bare SnOx (65 ns), indicating the lower interface recombination at the interface which helps in effective charge transport. Similarly, the SnOx/CsFAPbI3 has an average lifetime (eqn (3)) of ∼301 ns but 0.05 mg mL−1 and 0.1 mg mL−1 passivated SnOx/CsFAPbI3 have faster photoluminescence decay of ∼256 ns and ∼179 ns respectively, implying that 0.1 mg mL−1 AA6 passivated SnOx films offer better charge extraction and interfacial charge transport than bare SnOx.60 As a result, significant photoluminescence quenching (Fig. 5b (inset)) and faster photoluminescence decay (Fig. 5b) were observed for AA6 (0.1 mg mL−1) which indeed confirms that the AA6 treated SnOx film reduces the energetic barrier between SnOx and the CsFAPbI3 absorber. A well optimized energy level alignment was seen which results in better electron extraction ability and this will have a positive impact on the short circuit current density of the PSC.24,61
To further understand the interface band bending and associated change in device Voc, the surface photovoltage (SPV) measurements were performed for SnOx/CsFAPbI3 and SnOx/AA6/CsFAPbI3 thin films using an SPV module integrated scanning Kelvin probe setup and data were acquired under dark and light illumination (QTH lamp, 70 mW cm−2) conditions (Fig. 5c). During dark SPV measurements, the Fermi levels of SnOx and perovskite layers are aligned with respect to the vacuum level, resulting in band bending at the SnOx and perovskite interface. Once light is illuminated, electron–hole pairs are generated in the perovskite absorber, from where electrons move towards the SnOx layer (ESL) as observed during the charge separation process in the PSC, thereby altering the sample's CPD.62 The difference in CPD between dark and light conditions is referred to as SPV, and if any defects are present at the surface or interface (ESL and perovskite interface), the generated charge carriers are trapped, affecting surface band bending due to the charging–discharging effect in trap states resulting to a drop in SPV.63 When defects are appropriately passivated, the device SPV is higher than that of non-passivated devices, resulting in a higher Voc. In this study, the 0.1 mg mL−1 AA6 passivated sample has the highest SPV of 260 mV, which is 50 mV higher than that of the bare SnOx layers (210 mV), indicating that the AA6 passivates the SnOx and perovskite interface defects. Also, the ideally aligned AA6 LUMO level helps in the hopping mechanism which is essential for a better charge extraction process. For higher concentration (1 mg mL−1 AA6), the SPV drops to ∼160 mV which is ∼90 mV lower than for 0.1 mg mL−1 passivated SnOx as shown in Table 1. For higher concentration of AA6 samples, the SPV range was well correlated with the changes observed in device Voc, steady state PL (Fig. S21a†) and lifetime analysis (Fig. S21b†) behaviour and this is attributed to the thicker AA6 layer.64,65 SnOx defect passivation has the potential to improve the conductivity and for this we then carried out I–V measurements with the following architectures: ‘glass/ITO/SnOx/Ag’ and ‘glass/ITO/SnOx/0.1 mg mL−1 AA6/Ag’ (Fig. 5d). The conductivity of SnOx/0.1 mg mL−1 AA6 was increased to 2.9 × 10−6 S cm−1 from 2.0 × 10−6 S cm−1 (bare SnOx) and this results in improved carrier density and mobility of the SnOx ESL. This observation again reiterates that the AA6 molecule successfully passivates the SnOx surface defects and acts as a bridge between CsFAPbI3 and SnOx, resulting in effective charge carrier transfer.18,37
3.3 Device performance of the AA6 passivated SnOx based PSC
The device performance of AA6 passivated SnOx was studied using a low-temperature, solution-processed, planar n–i–p based PSC architecture. Detailed device fabrication processes are already provided in the experimental section. To understand the effect of defect passivation, a current density–voltage (J–V) study of AA6 passivated PSC was done in a class 3A solar simulator under standard test conditions. As indicated in Fig. 6a, the champion device efficiency of the 0.1 mg mL−1 AA6 passivated SnOx based PSC was 16.14%, whereas for the bare SnOx based PSC it was only 13.96%. During passivation with 0.1 mg mL−1 AA6, a considerable improvement in Voc of ∼50 mV and FF (57% to 62%) was observed, resulting in PCE improvement of the PSC. Fig. 6b–e show the histogram plots (box plots) of device metrics such as current density (Jsc), power conversion efficiency (%), open circuit voltage (V), and fill factor (%) for twelve devices for each AA6 concentration and the associated representative J–V curves are plotted in Fig. S22a–e.†

According to the J–V parameters, when AA6 concentration is greater than 0.1 mg mL−1, all device parameters (Jsc, Voc and FF) drop dramatically, resulting in a PCE of ∼9.5% for 0.2 mg mL−1 AA6 passivation and ∼7.5% for 1 mg mL−1 AA6 passivation (Table 1), which is matched with higher steady state PL emission intensity and longer lifetime in time resolved PL studies (Fig. 5b).16 The measured PSC device efficiency of this architecture is lower than that of the state of the art devices and the reason for this is that the PSC devices reported in this work were tested under high relative humidity conditions (RH ∼65–70%). To prevent the quick degradation of spiro-OMeTAD under high relative humidity conditions, a relatively thicker (∼200 nm) spiro-OMeTAD layer was used which results in an increased device series resistance leading to a drop in fill factor (FF) by at least 10% from the expected range (FF > 70–75%). This implies that our champion device will have an FF of about 60–65%, resulting in a PCE drop of ∼3% relative to the expected value. This is indeed the case as the champion device showed a PCE of ∼16.14% instead of an expected PCE of ∼19%. Similar PCE drops were observed in our previous reports that correlated very well with improved FF in low light intensities (0.2 sun), which justifies the thicker spiro-OMeTAD layer that is causing the FF drop under one sun test conditions.29,37,66
To further understand the Voc improvement upon AA6 passivation, the open circuit voltage loss (ΔV) for PSC devices was calculated using eqn (4),67 where Eg is the perovskite absorber bandgap (Eg = 1.55 eV), q is the elementary charge and Voc is the PSC device open circuit voltage. For 0.1 mg mL−1 AA6 passivated SnOx, 50 mV lower voltage loss (∼0.5 V) was observed when compared to bare SnOx (∼0.55 V) indicating that AA6 passivation suppresses the interface defects with the possibility of reduced band tail states at the SnOx/perovskite junction (Fig. 3c) arising due to AA6 being energetically well-aligned with the SnOx conduction band edge (Fig. 5a). qΔV = Eg − qVoc(4)
To get a better understanding of the recombination processes of the PSC, the quality of the junction interfaces was investigated using dark J–V measurements as illustrated in Fig. 7a. In ideal solar cells, the recombination rate (R) is proportional to the electron and hole concentration, whereas under dark conditions, the recombination rate (R) is proportional to the dark current (J0) obtained from dark J–V measurements. This dark current (leakage current) is transported via shunting paths because of improper interfaces, resulting in increased leakage current. According to this study, AA6 passivation at the SnOx interface reduces interface defects, resulting in lower dark current (∼10−8 mA cm−2), which is one order of magnitude lower than that of bare SnOx (∼10−7 mA cm−2). However, at higher concentrations of AA6 passivation (1 mg mL−1), it creates improper junctions between SnOx and CsFAPbI3 and as a result, dark current becomes one order of magnitude higher than that of bare SnOx (∼10−6 mA cm−2) as listed in Table 1, demonstrating the importance of a proper junction interface to achieve improved device performance despite the PSC's ideal energetic alignment and defect passivation.16,68,69 Lower leakage current and better PL quenching are seen as a result of AA6 defect passivation at both the SnOx and perovskite interfaces.
 Fig. 7  (a) Dark J–V analysis of SnOx and SnOx/AA6 coated PSCs. (b) SCLC analysis of electron only devices (glass/ITO/SnOx with and without AA6/CsFAPbI3/PCBM/Ag). 
Space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements were then carried out to confirm the effective electron extraction capability and defect density at the SnOx/CsFAPbI3 interface treated with AA6 (Fig. 7b). The SCLC profile shows three separate regions: (i) the ohmic area (n = 1) at low bias, where current and voltage have a linear relationship; (ii) the trap filled region (n > 3) at intermediate bias; and (iii) Child's region (n = 2) at higher bias, where current saturates and rises quickly. In the trap filled region, trap states are filled continuously with increasing bias until they reach saturation point which is called trap filled limit voltage (VTFL). The AA6 passivated SnOx based device has a lower VTFL (0.50 V), but bare SnOx exhibits higher VTFL (0.73 V), indicating that AA6 effectively passivates the interface traps, resulting in a lower electric field needed for the trap filling process. The trap density (nt) was calculated using eqn (5) as shown below.70–72 (5)where ε0 represents vacuum permittivity, εr represents the absorber dielectric constant (32), e represents elementary charge and L represents absorber thickness (∼400 nm). The trap density (nt) of AA6 passivated SnOx is 1.1 × 1014 cm−3, which is ∼35% lower than that of bare SnOx (1.6 × 1014 cm−3). This indicates that AA6 passivation on the SnOx layer effectively passivates the surface defects of the SnOx and perovskite interface, resulting in less trap assisted recombination than in the case of bare SnOx.
In summary, the optimised AA6 interlayer at the SnOx and CsFAPbI3 perovskite interface passivates both SnOx and undercoordinated Pb2+ defects leading to reduced VTFL, trap density, and leakage current with increased conductivity, hydrophobicity and perovskite grain size. Improved energetic alignment at the SnOx and perovskite interface results in effective charge extraction with reduced interface recombination. The improved interface properties of the ESL/perovskite in the PSC lead to enhanced device performance evidenced by the improved open circuit voltage (from 1.0 V to 1.05 V) and fill factor leading to better PCE of 16.14% from 13.96% measured at high humidity conditions (RH ∼65–70%) without encapsulation. The synthesized molecule with a donor–acceptor type configuration can facilitate the exploration of other available analogous organic small molecules for defect passivation in other metal oxide-based ESLs.
4. Conclusions
A novel multifunctional organic small molecule (AA6) was synthesized and used as a dual interface defect passivating moiety for both SnOx and CsFAPbI3 interfaces for the first time. The AA6 molecule contains vinyl spacer units linked to electron rich thiophene on both sides, with both ends being connected to dicyanomethylene rhodanine units. During AA6 passivation, the shift in Sn 3d and Pb 4f binding energies confirms that the AA6 molecule simultaneously passivates both SnOx and Pb2+ undercoordinated defects. Further, the reduced energetic barrier between SnOx and CsFAPbI3 layers, increased contact angle leading to bigger perovskite grains (∼375 nm), ∼75% more PLQE compared with bare SnOx and the reduced average lifetime of charge carriers result in effective charge extraction from CsFAPbI3 to SnOx through the AA6 interlayer. The defect passivation of SnOx and perovskite layers leads to improved device performance from 13.96% to 16.14% with enhanced fill factor and improved open circuit voltage (from 1.0 V to 1.05 V).
