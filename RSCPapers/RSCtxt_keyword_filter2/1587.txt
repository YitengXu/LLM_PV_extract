    , Accepted 14th October 2013First published on 21st October 2013AbstractA bilayer film composed of an upper-layer of aluminum-doped ZnO (AZO) film and a lower-layer of tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) film (designated as AZO/ITO) has been successfully fabricated using an atmospheric pressure-based electrospraying method and studied as an excellent transparent electrode, efficient field-emitter and the dye-sensitized solar-cell (DSSC) electrodes in order to develop a cost-effective alternative fabrication method. The morphological, optical and electrical properties were examined for the single layer of an ITO, an AZO and the bilayer AZO/ITO film. The composition of the films was confirmed with the help of energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photospectroscopy (XPS). The bilayer AZO/ITO film presented an enhanced optical transparency of 95% with improved electrical performance, exhibited a resistivity of 9.3 × 10−5 Ω cm and a mobility of 49.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared to single layer TCO films that might be useful for optoelectronic devices. Moreover, the lowest turn-on field of ∼3.8 V μm−1, and highest emission current density of 3.9 mA cm−2 was obtained for bilayer AZO/ITO film under the field of 7.6 V μm−1, and the highest field enhancement factor (β) was estimated to be 3315 ± 2, compared with AZO and ITO single layer films. Furthermore, films exhibit good long period emission current stability with a variation of less than 4% during 30 h under a field of 7.6 V μm−1. For DSSCs, the photoanode composed of AZO film only showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as low as 0.57% with a short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 2.5 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 425 mV. The photoanode with ITO film only exhibited higher PCE (0.84%) because of higher JSC (4.0 mA cm−2), whereas VOC (375 mV) was lower than that of AZO film. Compared to AZO and ITO single layer films, the bilayer structured AZO/ITO film demonstrated much higher PCE (2.4%) because of both higher JSC (7.4 mA cm−2) and VOC (600 mV). Addition of an AZO layer over the ITO layer significantly improved the electron transport and lifetime compared to the ITO only film. One order of magnitude slower charge recombination rate for the bilayer film than for the ITO film was found to be a major factor for the improved efficiency. The fabricated cells show highly durable cell performances, even after 40 days under atmospheric conditions. The proposed atmospheric pressure-based electrospraying film fabrication method was well suitable for the deposition of bilayer AZO/ITO films which found multi-applications as an excellent transparent electrode, efficient field-emitter and improved DSSC when compared with other vacuum-based methods.
1 Introduction
Transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) have been employed as transparent electrodes in displays, solar cells and photovoltaic devices owing to their high conductivity and transparency.1–3 Mostly TCOs are n-type conductors composed of pure or doped cadmium oxide (CdO), zinc oxide (ZnO), tin oxide (SnO2), indium oxide (In2O3) or ternary oxides. Among these materials, indium tin oxide (ITO) has been extensively used in commercial applications due to its high optical transparency and excellent electrical conductivity. However, the rising cost of indium and less than optimum ITO conductivity raises concern regarding its usefulness in future optoelectronic devices? Recently, Al-doped ZnO (AZO) has received considerable attention from many researchers as a promising candidate to replace ITO owing to low cost. Furthermore, AZO has advantages of higher thermal stability, chemical sensitivity and mechanical properties,4,5 compared to ITO. Since ITO has excellent electrical conductivity and AZO has a good optical transparency, the multilayer TCO structures have a higher potential than single layer TCO films. In addition, these multilayer TCO films also possess useful features such as greater optical transparency, lower resistance, smooth surface morphology, lower materials cost and being environmental friendly. A simple film growth process can be applicable to the multilayer stacks of TCO films.6
In order to achieve higher transmittance with higher conductivity and multifunctionality at vacuum conditions, TCOs have been assembled in multilayer stacks. For example, Martin et al.;7 reported pulsed laser-deposition derived TCO double layers consisting of Sn-doped CdO, CdIn2O4, and Cd2SnO4, which demonstrate higher conductivity than ITO with a comparable optical transparency. Kawashima et al.;8 reported that fluorine-doped tin-oxide (FTO) shows improved thermal stability as compared to the ITO with conductivity restrained during solar cell processing at 400–600 °C. Therefore, multilayer TCOs structures have the ability to attain greater functionality than single layer TCOs by choosing a suitable layer structure and arranging the suitable material properties.9 Previously different techniques such as co-sputtering,10 dc magnetron sputtering11,12 and the combination of metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) with ion-assisted deposition (IAD) were used for the fabrication of multilayer stacks of TCO films.6 However, the fabrication of TCO film on a large scale by previously-reported vacuum-based methods has a number of drawbacks like long processing time and complex fabrication. An alternative atmospheric pressure-based film fabrication technique is needed to overcome these drawbacks. Electrospraying is a promising way for the synthesis and deposition of dense TCO films at relatively low substrate temperature and has a low materials processing and fabrication costs.13 Moreover, it has several advantages of facilitating the growth of TCO films due to its simple setup, low cost, easy to control system parameters, high growth rate of the film and large area uniformity. In a previous report, we successfully fabricated the tantalum and nitrogen codoped ZnO (Ta, N–ZnO) thin films using electrospraying and found it as an excellent transparent electrode.14 On the basis of the report, it is confirmed that the atmospheric pressure-based electrospraying method is highly suitable for the preparation of single layer TCO films with excellent electrical and optical properties. Hence, the electrospraying method has a great capability of depositing the highly transparent and conductive TCO films with ease of handling, low cost and larger area uniformity.
Besides the successful realization of bilayer TCO films as an excellent transparent electrode, zinc oxide (ZnO) or AZO also has a potential usage in low-voltage electron field-emission (FE) devices,15 due to its high thermal stability,16 low electron affinity and high oxidation resistance in harsh environments. On the other hand, ITO has good transparence characteristics in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum while maintaining high electrical conductivity, thermal stability, and oxidation resistance.17,18 Moreover, ITO layer is needed in order to realize a durable field emitter and to provide low turn-on voltage.19,20 In order to produce the efficient FE devices based on ZnO nanostructures at a lowest energy expense, striking techniques are also preferred for improving the electron FE. Recently, various nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs),21 silicon (Si) NWs,22 and ZnO NWs23 have been investigated as possible field emitter materials. In addition, numerous attempts such as plasma bombardment,24 ion implantation,25 and doping with selective elements,26,27 have been made to improve the FE properties of various nanostructures. However, no reports are available about the fabrication of bilayer film with a unique AZO/ITO structure using a simple and inexpensive method and studied as a field-emitter, which is especially advantageous for FE applications because the screening effect which was normally observed in densely packed nanostructures can be minimized using a bilayer structure.28 For practical applications in FE and the related areas, investigations about the intrinsic FE properties of doped nanomaterials are important.
Along with the successful recognition of bilayer TCO films as an excellent transparent electrode and an efficient field-emitter, the ZnO-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) technology is an alternative to titanium dioxide (TiO2) which has been investigated as one of the most suitable material for solar cells. Although, the TiO2-based DSSCs are most commonly used and their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have reached as high as 12%,29 the TiO2 nanocrystals caused a pronounced recombination problem due to the lack of a depletion layer on the TiO2 nanocrystallite surface and a serious problem occurred when the film thickness of photo electrode increases.30 Semiconducting metal oxides other than TiO2, including ZnO,31–36 and SnO2,37–40 have also been investigated as potential alternatives to TiO2. However, PCEs based on ZnO were reported to be much lower than TiO2 although the conduction band edge position of ZnO is similar to that of TiO2. One of reasons for such a low performance is the chemical instability of ZnO in acidic media. For the case of SnO2, the device performance was low because of the inherent low conduction band edge, leading to theoretically low photovoltage, and the fast recombination process.41 In order to overcome these drawbacks in ZnO and SnO2, composite structures, core–shell techniques were proposed. It was found that photovoltaic performance of SnO2 was significantly improved by surface modification with the help of insulating oxides.42–45 A composite structure was investigated by adding the ZnO nanoparticles to SnO2 nanoparticles, which improved the photovoltage of SnO2 owing to the upward shift of conduction band edge.23 Even though the composite films which contained the SnO2 and ZnO nanoparticles demonstrated the enhanced performance compared to the isolated SnO2 or ZnO, it was difficult to control the charge recombination and electron transport for such kind of randomly distributed nanoparticles fused structure. A bilayer structure comprising AZO and ITO film is thus expected to regulate better electron transport and charge recombination compared to the random admixture film. In addition, the visible response of nanomaterials can be realized by doping metal elements such as Al and Sn, because the dopant elements not only narrow the band gap so as to be responsible for visible light, but also inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.
In the first part of this paper, we have investigated a highly transparent and conductive bilayer AZO/ITO film as an excellent transparent electrode fabricated by the electrospraying technique, in order to develop a cost-effective alternative fabrication method to achieve higher transmittance with higher conductivity and multifunctionality at atmospheric conditions. The morphological, optical and electrical properties were examined for the single layer of an ITO, an AZO and the bilayer AZO/ITO films. It was observed that the bilayer AZO/ITO film significantly improved the transparency with better electrical conductivity as compared to single layer TCO films. In addition, such combination of bilayer TCO films have not been yet properly investigated, especially using atmospheric pressure-based deposition methods such as electrospraying. After demonstrating the bilayer AZO/ITO film as an excellent transparent electrode because of the increasing demands of efficient FE devices, an attempt was made to further enhance the FE properties. We also approached to employ the same bilayer AZO/ITO film as an efficient field-emitter which will be discussed in the second part. It was found that the bilayer AZO/ITO film could significantly improve the FE properties owing to its better structure which could easily induce much more electron emission than the AZO and ITO single layer films. In the last part, we applied the same bilayer AZO/ITO film for the fabrication of photoanode to enhance the efficiency of the DSSCs. We report on preparation and photovoltaic performance of a photoanode comprising bilayer structure of ITO film lower-layer and AZO film upper-layer. Electron transport and charge recombination characteristics of the bilayer structured photoanode are also compared to those of photoanodes comprising of ITO single-layer film only and AZO single-layer film only. To the best of our knowledge, this sort of multi-applications (i.e.; excellent transparent electrode, efficient field-emitter and DSSC with improved conversion efficiency) based on bilayer AZO/ITO film has not been studied especially by using a less-expensive, simple and efficient method.
2 Experimental details
2.1 Thin films deposition
The films were deposited onto the heated fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates by electrospraying method.14 Zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn (O2CCH3)2(H2O)2) and aluminum chloride (AlCl3) were used as precursors in ethanol–water (30:70 v/v) solution. The spraying solution was 0.05 M zinc acetate dihydrate. Aluminum doping was achieved by adding AlCl3 at concentration of 0.5 wt% in the precursor solution. Tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) film was deposited by spraying a 0.05 M, ethanol–water (30:70 v/v) solution containing indium chloride (InCl3) and tin chloride pentahydrate (SnCl4·5H2O) used as dopant with concentration of 0.5 wt%. A syringe pump (KD200, KD Scientific Inc., U.S.A.) was used to feed the precursor solution through plastic tubing to a small needle. The voltage, flow rate and nozzle to substrate distance were 6 kV, 0.003 mL min−1 and 4 cm, respectively. Precursor solution was sprayed for 90 minutes in the case of single layer TCO films and for bilayer TCO films spraying time was 45 minutes for each film. Moreover, the source temperature was maintained at 250 °C.
2.2 Fabrication of DSSCs
The FTO substrates contained the AZO, AZO/ITO bilayer and ITO films were rinsed with DI water and baked at 80 °C for 30 minutes to remove any residual organics. Then, they were immersed into 0.3 mM N 719 dye solution for 12 hours at room temperature. A thermally-platinized FTO glass (Platisol, Solaronix) was used as a counter electrode. For the cell assembly, a 60 μm-thick Surlyn (Meltonix 1170-60, Solaronix) was used to separate the photoanode and the counter electrode. Edge of each electrode was treated with a solder to obtain a good electrical contact and hot-pressing method was performed at 70 °C for 2–3 minutes. The electrolyte solution, consisted of 0.3 M anhydrous lithium iodide (LiI), 0.06 M iodide (I2), 0.5 M tert-butyl pyridine (t-BPy) and 1.0 M DMPII in acetonitrile was injected into the cell through the small hole drilled in the Pt counter electrode. For preventing the electrolyte leakage, the hole was covered with a small square glass sheet.
2.3 Characterization and property measurements
A field emission scanning electron micro-scope (Magellan 400) was used to analyze the cross-sectional view of films, coupled with an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (DX-4), for elementary composition of the films. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of each sample were identified by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Thermo VG Scientific, Sigma Probe). The film resistivity, carrier concentrations and mobility were measured with a Hall measurement system (HMS-3000). The optical transmittance of films was obtained by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV-3101PC). Field-emission measurements were performed in a homemade vacuum chamber with a pressure lower than 6 × 10−7 Pa at room temperature under a two-parallel-plate configuration. The samples were connected to the cathode, whereas another parallel stainless-steel plate worked as the anode. The distance between anode and cathode was kept about 200 μm. For the degassing of samples and the removal of contaminates, a high voltage of ∼4 kV was applied. After that, a voltage with a sweep step of 50 V was applied between the cathode and anode to supply an electric field E. The emission current was monitored by a Keithley 485 picoammeter.
Photocurrent and voltage were measured from a solar simulator equipped with 450 W xenon lamp (Newport 6279NS) and a Keithley 2400 source meter. Light intensity was adjusted with a NREL calibrated Si solar cell having KG-2 filter for approximating AM 1.5G one sun light intensity (100 mW cm−2). While measuring current and voltage, the cell was covered with a black mask having an aperture. The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) values at a chopping frequency of 4 Hz were recorded as a function of the wavelength from 400 nm to 800 nm (PV Measurements, Inc). A 75 W xenon lamp was used as a light source with a monochromator. Time constants for electron transport and recombination were obtained using a photocurrent and photovoltage transient spectroscopy.46 The cells were probed with a weak laser pulse at 532 nm superimposed on a relatively large, back ground (bias) illumination at 680 nm. The bias light was illuminated by a 0.5 W diode laser (B&W TEK Inc., model BWF1-670-300E/55370). The intensity of the bias light was adjusted using ND filters (neutral density filters). A 30 mW frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser (Laser-Export Co. Ltd. Model: LCS-DTL-314QT) (λ = 532 nm, pulse duration 10 ns) was used as probe light. The photocurrent transients were obtained by using a Stanford Research Systems model SR570 low-noise current preamplifier, amplified by a Stanford Research Systems model SR560 low-noise preamplifier, and recorded on Tektronics TDS 3054B digital phosphore oscilloscope 500 MHz 5GS/s DPO. The photovoltage transients were obtained by using SR560 preamplifier, which was recorded on oscilloscope combined with Keithley 2400 measure unit. The photocurrent- and the photovoltage–time curves were fitted with an exponential relationship, y(t) = exp(−t/τ), where y represents photocurrent density or photovoltage, t is time and τ (τC for electron transport and τR for recombination) is constant.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Morphological and compositional analysis of single and bilayer films
TCO films of three different types were deposited on FTO substrates using the electrospraying technique. In order to confirm the layer structure and film thickness, cross-sectional SEM images were examined for the as-deposited single and bilayer TCO films as shown in Fig. 1 of (a) an AZO film, (b) an ITO film, and (c) the bilayer AZO/ITO film. TCO films with the same thickness of about 350 nm were observed in the images. Fig. 1c shows that there was a sharp boundary between the AZO and ITO layers. This suggests that the two layers were not diffused into each other, which was especially advantageous for FE applications because the screening effect normally observed in close packed nanostructures can be minimized.28 In addition, for DSSCs, a bilayer structure comprising AZO and ITO films is expected to regulate better electron transport and charge recombination compared to the random admixture film. In addition, the chemical composition of the three corresponding TCO films was examined through energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The EDS spectrum (Fig. 1d), taken only from AZO film, consisted of Zn, O, and Al peaks and the spectrum revealed the co-existence of Zn, O and Al which also ensured the presence of Al contents of about 0.5 wt% in the AZO film. Similarly, Fig. 1e shows the EDS spectrum taken only from ITO film composed of Sn, O and In peaks which guaranteed the co-existence of Sn, O and In and ensured the presence of Sn contents of about 0.5 wt% into the ITO film. The EDS spectrum for AZO/ITO bilayer is shown in Fig. 1f, consisted of Zn, O, Sn, Al and In peaks which ensured the co-existence of Zn, O, Sn, Al and In into the AZO/ITO bilayer film.
 Fig. 1  Typical cross-sectional SEM images of (a) an AZO film, (b) an ITO film, and (c) bilayer (AZO/ITO) TCO film, EDS spectrum corresponds to (d) an AZO film, (e) an ITO film, and (f) bilayer (AZO/ITO) TCO film, respectively. 
The X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) reveals valuable information in the film stoichiometry and the chemical state of each constituent element in the AZO/ITO bilayer film. Al 2p peak is located at 73.80 eV as shown in Fig. 2a. The appearance of the Al element peaks in the AZO film indicates that Al has been successfully doped into the ZnO lattice and an Al–O bond has been formed at the interface region of ZnO, that is, Al atoms mainly reside substitutionally on Zn lattice sites. The successful substitution of Al contributes to the low resistivity of AZO films grown at room temperature. In addition, Fig. 2b shows the two peaks at 1021.1 and 1041.3 eV corresponding to Zn2p3/2 and Zn2p1/2. The spectrum shown in Fig. 2d exhibits the two significant binding energy peaks at 445.4 and 452.7 eV corresponding to the electronic states of In3d3/2 and In3d5/2, respectively. The energy difference between two Zn2p peaks was 20.2 eV, and for the two In3d peaks was 7.3 eV which agrees well with the standard values of 22.97 and 7.5 eV, respectively.47 Furthermore, Fig. 2c shows the scan of O1s spectrum demonstrating a peak at 530.4 eV which was assigned to oxidized metal ions in the film, specifically O–Zn and O–In in the ZnO lattice, which indicate that the structure of valance band states can be greatly influenced by the In doping.47 It also attributed to O2− ions surrounded by Zn (or substitutional Al) atoms in the wurtzite ZnO lattice.48 Moreover, Fig. 2e shows the XPS spectra of Sn5/2,3/2 peaks. The position of Sn3d5/2,3/2 (487.2, 495.7 eV) corresponds to the oxidation state of Sn4+ in ITO.49 Hence, XPS analysis also proves the successful addition of Al and Sn into the AZO/ITO bilayer film. Furthermore, the average Sn and Al contents were consistent with the EDS results.

3.2 Electrical and optical characteristics of single and bilayer films

Fig. 3a shows the electrical resistivity, mobility and carrier concentration of as-deposited an AZO film, an ITO film, and a bilayer AZO/ITO TCO film, respectively. The single layer ITO film showed the highest mobility of 50 cm2 V−1 s−1 with highest carrier concentration of 1.36 × 1021 cm−3 and lowest resistivity of 9.2 × 10−5 Ω cm. On the other hand, the single layer AZO film had the lowest mobility of 32 cm2 V−1 s−1 with lowest carrier concentration of 6.5 × 1020 cm−3 and higher resistivity of 3.1 × 10−4 Ω cm. The bilayer AZO/ITO film exhibited an enhanced mobility (49.5 cm2 V−1 s−1) with enhanced carrier concentration (1.35 × 1021 cm−3) and improved resistivity of 9.3 × 10−5 Ω cm (Table 1), which revealed that the electrical characteristics were improved after changing the film structure from single to bilayer architecture. It was also observed that the decrease in resistivity and the increase in mobility and the carrier concentration for bilayer AZO/ITO film were more significant than those of single layer films. The enhancement of mobility in a TCO material will cause the conductivity to increase without spoiling the optical transparency thus, improving the overall performance of the TCO material. The increase in mobility was caused by the decrease in quantum size effect as the quantum confinement effect degraded the carrier transport and decreased below a certain level.50 In general, the electrical resistivity of a film is mainly dependent on the carrier concentration and mobility. It also revealed that the modification of the single layer TCO films to the bilayer TCO films might be helpful to control the electrical properties. Fig. 3b shows the optical transmittance spectra of the as-deposited TCO films in the range of 300 to 800 nm. Highest transparency above 96% was shown by single layer AZO film, while the lowest transparency more than 90% was observed for a single layer ITO film in the visible region. The bilayer AZO/ITO film exhibited an improved transparency above 95%, which was close to the value of the single layer of AZO film (Table 1). The closeness in transmittance of the AZO and AZO/ITO films can be attributed to the reduction of the ITO film thickness, indicating that a certain thickness of ITO film does not deteriorate the optical transparency. The fluctuations in the transmittance of film were probably caused by the interference between different layers. ITO has a lower optical transmittance in wavelengths below about 550 nm, admitting a brownish or yellowish color. That's why the growth temperature of the ITO is set to several tens of °C for minimizing the thermal degradation of the film, among others. When the ITO has grown on a film in an environment of several tens of °C, the ITO does not totally crystallize, leaving it in a non-crystalline state. So, the crystallization temperature of ITO is high, about 200 °C. The non-crystalline ITO has poor optical transmittance to blues and some other wavelengths, making it view yellowish. On the other hand, AZO provides much higher optical transmittance in the short wavelength than ITO. Though, ITO contributed to excellent electrical conductivity and AZO has a good optical transparency, therefore bilayer AZO/ITO TCO structure has a higher potential than does a single layer TCO films. Hence, these bilayer TCO films possess useful features such as greater optical transparency, lower resistance, smooth surface morphology, lower materials cost and environmentally friendly.

Furthermore, the comparison of electrical and optical properties between the literatures and the proposed structures was summarized in Table 2. It can be seen that the electrical and optical characteristics for the fabricated bilayer AZO/ITO film using the electrospraying method at atmospheric pressure were much better than the bilayer AZO/ITO structure deposited by co-sputtering method10 and also better than other multilayer film structures fabricated by vacuum-based methods,51–53 as shown in Table 2. In addition, the obtained optical and electrical characteristics were comparable to the other film structures such as AZO/Cu/AZO and AZO/Mo/AZO fabricated by vacuum-based rf sputtering technique.54,54 It can also be concluded, that the bilayer TCO film with excellent electrical and optical properties can be prepared by the electrospraying method at atmospheric pressure. The fabrication of multilayer TCO films was performed using vacuum-based methods such as rf and dc sputtering, which makes it difficult to control the process parameters. Hence, the preparation of TCO films with excellent electrical and optical properties by the electrospraying method at atmospheric conditions might be more suitable than vacuum-based methods in terms of process handling and operation. The properties like electrical resistivity and transmittance are directly influenced by the film characteristics like film thickness and surface roughness of a film surface. An optimum film thickness is always needed in order to achieve the maximum transmittance and lower resistance for TCO films. The control of film thickness and surface roughness is very easy using the electrospraying method compared with other vacuum deposition methods. Since the electrospraying method is simple and easy to operate and produces the very small droplets of uniform size which generate the very dense and smooth surface film with equal thickness all over the substrate surface which will eventually provide the higher transmittance and lower resistances compared with other vacuum based methods.

3.3 Field-emission behavior of single and bilayer films
The comparison curves of the current density J verses applied electric field E measured for the AZO only, AZO/ITO bilayer and ITO only films are shown in Fig. 4a. The turn-on fields values (defined as the E where J arrives at 0.01 mA cm−2) for corresponding films were 6.1, 3.8 and 5.6 V μm−1, respectively. In addition, the corresponding threshold fields (defined as the E where J arrives at 0.1 mA cm−2) were 6.4, 4.2 and 5.4 V μm−1, respectively. Moreover, the corresponding current densities were 2.3, 3.9 and 2.9 mA cm−2, respectively under the field of 7.6 V μm−1. It was evident that the FE properties of AZO/ITO bilayer film were improved after changing the film structure with much lower turn-on and threshold fields and higher current density compared with the AZO only and ITO only films. All the films exhibit the steady emission current and also the J–E curves have been measured more than 8 times and found to be excellent reproducible. In addition, the emission current–voltage behavior of films was analyzed by Fowler–Nordheim (F–N) equation56 (1)where A = 1.54 × 10−10 (A V−2 eV), B = 6.83 × 109 (V m−1 eV −3/2), Φ is the work function, and β is the field enhancement factor which expresses the ability of the emitters to enhance the local electric field and can be calculated from the FN plot.

Fig. 4b shows the linear dependence of the corresponding ln(J/E2) vs E−1(F–N) plots for AZO only, AZO/ITO bilayer and ITO only films respectively, where the slope of the FN plot is equal to −BΦ3/2β−1,used to estimate the β value. The highest value of β was found to be ∼3315 ± 2 for AZO/TO bilayer film because the bilayer film was densely packed which could easily induce much more electron emission than the other two films (AZO and ITO only). The screening effect normally observed in close packed nanostructures can be minimized.49 In addition, the lowest turn-on and threshold fields will lead to the highest average values of β. On the other hand, for AZO only and ITO only films the values of β were found to be ∼2065 ± 2 and ∼2470 ± 2, respectively. The higher value of field enhancement factor suggested that the enhancement in the field due to the nanometric features of the AZO/ITO bilayer film. Fig. 4d exhibits the plots of threshold fields and the β for AZO only, AZO/ITO bilayer and ITO only films, respectively. The AZO/ITO bilayer film exhibited the relatively low threshold field of 4.2 V μm−1 and the calculated β value of 3315 ± 2 was higher compared with other films. In addition, the experimental FE characteristics can be connected and consistent with the addressed observations of physical analysis. In general, a fine nanostructure is critical for the development of field emission devices, since it enhances the β, which reflects the ability of emitters to enhance the local electric field. In addition, the highest average value of β and the lower turn-on and threshold fields can result from nanometric features and the densely packed bilayer films which could easily induce much more electron emission than the other films.
The long period emission current stability of the corresponding films was tested by measuring the current density under the field of 7.6 V μm−1, as shown in Fig. 4c. It can be seen that no obvious degradation of FE current density was observed even after 30 h. The emission current fluctuations were about 2 and 3% during 30 h with keeping the constant current density about 2.3, 3.9 and 2.9 mA cm−2 for AZO only, AZO/ITO bilayer and ITO only films, respectively. These results demonstrated the excellent long period emission current stability of the AZO/ITO bilayer films, which make them highly valuable for practical applications as a field emitter. Hence, the overall FE performance of AZO/ITO bilayer film, such as turn-on and threshold fields, and β factor are all excellent compared with AZO only and ITO only films due to the better film structure.
3.4 DSSC performance of single and bilayer films
Prior to the investigation of photovoltaic performance of the bilayer electrode, photoanode comprising only ITO layer was prepared and its photovoltaic performance was investigated. Fig. 5 shows the effect of ITO film thickness on short-circuit current density (JSC) and power conversion efficiency (PCE). Both JSC and PCE increase as the ITO film thickness increases up to 350 nm, whereas a decline in performance was observed for the films thicker than 350 nm. This was well consistent with the previous result,45 studied for SnO2 film only. The main drawback for the SnO2 based DSSC was low open-circuit voltage (VOC) due to lower conduction band edge than TiO2 (about 0.4 eV lower than TiO2). To solve the problem of low VOC, surface modification of SnO2 (core–shell structure) has been proposed;42,43,45 however, the shell thickness was critical in the photovoltaic performance and hard to control.

Photovoltaic performance of the AZO/ITO bilayer was compared with those of the AZO film only and the ITO film only (Fig. 6a). Table 3 summarizes the calculated and measured values obtained from the typical J–V curves (Fig. 6a). The DSSC based on AZO/ITO bilayer film demonstrates the best photovoltaic performances in terms of JSC, VOC, fill factor (FF), and PCE. The bilayer AZO/ITO structure shows the JSC of 7.4 mA cm−2, VOC of 600 mV and fill factor of 0.55, resulting in a conversion efficiency of 2.4%, which was higher than the efficiency of AZO film only (0.57%) and ITO film only (0.84%). Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency measurement (IPCE, Fig. 6b) was also performed to further investigate the efficient electron transportation within the AZO/ITO bilayer film, which showed the highest PCE. Absolute IPCE was higher in the measured entire wavelength for the bilayer structure than the AZO and ITO single layer films (Fig. 6b). Note that VOC of the present bilayer structure was different from the mixed SnO2 and ZnO particles,57 we assume that the VOC enhancement maybe related to the charge recombination. Electron lifetime was thus measured to elucidate the origin of the VOC enhancement in AZO/ITO bilayer structure.

In order to investigate electron transport and charge recombination in the bilayer structure, we measured electron diffusion coefficient and charge recombination time constant. As shown in Fig. 7a, electron diffusion coefficient is highest in AZO and lowest in ITO film, which revealed that AZO was beneficial for fast electron transport. Electrons in the bilayer structure were not faster than AZO film but slightly faster than ITO film. On the other hand, electron lifetime was significantly improved in the bilayer structure as can be seen in Fig. 7b, which was 1 order of magnitude higher than that in the ITO film. Suppression of charge recombination for the bilayer structure was even better than AZO film. Compared to the ITO only film, the much longer electron lifetime in the AZO/ITO bilayer structure was due to mainly the presence of AZO film and in part the surface modification of the ITO under-layer during the deposition of AZO layer. This significant improvement for electron lifetime was responsible for the high VOC for the bilayer structure. Long electron lifetime was expected to contribute to long electron diffusion length, which will lead to the improved charge collection efficiency, associated with high JSC.58

The fabricated DSSCs demonstrated the high performance stability compared with other liquid junction solar cells. Specifically, the liquid junction solar cells encounter the low stability originated from side reactions at the electrolyte/counter electrode interface, corrosion of quantum dots and as well as the leakage currents. In terms of device durability of cells performance, ZnO-based DSSCs are advantageous owing to its air stability, non volatility, robustness to corrosion and capability to operate at lower internal temperature. Dependence of the short circuit current density, open circuit voltage, fill factor and the overall conversion efficiency on time durations (for 40 days) are shown in Fig. 8, to investigate the performance stability of the devices. The cell performance was measured every 5 days in the ambient atmosphere, and it was decreased by only ∼4–5% not degraded even after 40 days. Hence, high durability for cell performances of our fabricated AZO/ITO bilayer film based DSSCs has a great potential as a next generation solar cell.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully fabricated a bilayer film with a AZO/ITO structure using a simple electrospraying process, for multi-applications as an excellent transparent electrode, efficient field-emitter and improved dye-sensitized solar cells. We developed a high quality transparent conducting AZO/ITO bilayer film comparable to that of state of the art of ITO and other commercially available TCOs. The bilayer TCO film (AZO/ITO) showed the enhanced electrical performance and higher optical transparency compared to AZO and ITO single layer films. The films produced are well suitable for optical and electrical applications owing to their low resistivity and high optical transmittance in the visible range. The bilayer AZO/ITO film exhibited an enhanced mobility (49.5 cm2 V−1 s−1) with enhanced carrier concentration (1.35 × 1021 cm−3) and improved resistivity of 9.3 × 10−5 Ω cm, that the electrical characteristics were improved after changing the film structure from single to bilayer architecture. The material costs for the bilayer structure also offer an economical advantage over the use of ITO as a TCO material. The bilayer AZO/ITO film shows the enhanced FE behavior (i.e., the higher current density of 3.9 mA cm−2, larger field-enhancement factor (β) of ∼3315 ± 2, lower turn-on field of 3.8 V μm−1, lower threshold field of 4.2 V μm−1 and long term emission current stability a variation of less than 4% during 30 h) compared with AZO and ITO single layer films due to the better structure and reduced screening effect. For DSSCs, compared to ITO film and AZO film, the bilayer structured film exhibited higher JSC and VOC, leading to higher PCE. Fast recombination and slow electron transport are the drawbacks in ITO film, which are reduced after the introduction of AZO film over the top of ITO layer. Electron diffusion coefficient became faster and charge recombination rate is 1 order of magnitude slower for the bilayer structure than that of the ITO film. From this study, modification of nanostructured film in dye-sensitized solar cell is found to have a significant effect on charge recombination and electron transport. The electrospraying method has a great potential as a cost-effective and large scale fabrication of TCO films due to its simplicity and adaptability compared to other vacuum-based film deposition methods.
