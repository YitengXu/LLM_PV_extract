    , Accepted 21st March 2011First published on 18th April 2011AbstractIn this article, we would like to demonstrate an electric field annealing method to assist the self-organization of a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) hybrid without any thermal post-treatment. By applying a DC electric field perpendicular to the substrate during the solvent-drying process, the formation of fibrous P3HT crystalline domains and phase-separated domains of bulk heterojunctions can be achieved, resulting in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 4%. The grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurement suggests that the electric field-assisted annealing will facilitate the crystallization of P3HT in both lamellar stacking and vertical stacking, as a result of improved carrier transport and photovoltaic performance. The method of electric field-assisted annealing can easily be integrated into large-area and low-temperature processes, providing a new route to fabricate low-cost and flexible polymer solar cells.

Broader context

Polymer solar cells have attracted great interest for fabricating low-cost and mechanically flexible photovoltaic devices. Several approaches have been used to improve the power conversion efficiencies of polymer solar cells by controlling the nanoscale morphology of the photoactive layer, including thermal, solvent, and microwave annealing. Here, we would like to present a new fabrication method to control the morphology and performance of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/fullerene derivative phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) hybrid solar cells, by simply applying a DC electric field perpendicular to the substrate during solvent-drying processes without any thermal post-treatment. The applied electric fields assist the self-organization of polymer during film formation as a result of enhanced polymer chain ordering, giving a power conversion efficiency up to 4.1%. The electric field-assisted annealing method provides a new route to fabricate large-area polymer solar cells at low temperatures.

1. Introduction

Polymer solar cells1–4 have attracted great interest for fabricating low-cost and mechanically flexible photovoltaic devices with respect to their conventional inorganic counterparts. Recent advances for achieving high photovoltaic efficiencies close to 7–8% have been realized.5 Due to the short exciton diffusion length (∼10 nm) of a semiconducting polymer,6 the electron acceptors are usually intermixed with polymers (electron donors) on a nanometre length scale to form bulk heterojunctions (BHJs). It is concluded that the device performance strongly depends on an optimized phase separated donor–acceptor morphology of the BHJs for efficient charge separation and transport. Currently, the most popular materials for BHJ polymer solar cells consist of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and fullerene derivative phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) blends with power conversion efficiencies of 4–5%.4,7 Several approaches have been used to improve the power conversion efficiencies of polymer solar cells by controlling the nanoscale morphology of P3HT:PCBM blends, including thermal,8solvent,9 microwave10 and electrical11annealing. In addition, it has been demonstrated that phase separation can also be controlled by adding chemical additives.12 Since the main advantage of polymer solar cells is that devices can be fabricated over large areas using solution processing13 onto flexible substrates, it would be technologically favorable to develop deposition processes which can be implemented at low temperatures for the future industrial production of low-cost plastic solar cells. Recently, Yang and co-workers have demonstrated a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.5% by using only the solvent annealing approach to control the two major parameters of spin-coating time and solvent annealing time.9 Another low-temperature process for producing nanostructured P3HT fibers in solution before mixing with PCBM has also been demonstrated, exhibiting a PCE of 3.6%.14 Here, we would like to present a new fabrication method to control the morphology and performance of P3HT:PCBM hybrid solar cells, by simply applying a DC electric field perpendicular to the substrate during solvent-drying processes without any thermal post-treatment. The applied electric fields assist the self-organization of the polymer during film formation, as a result of enhanced polymer chain ordering, giving a PCE of up to 4.1%. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), anisotropic UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) results provide further structural information of photoactive layers under the influence of applied electric fields. The electric field-assisted annealing method provides a new route to fabricate large-area polymer solar cells at low temperatures.
2. Experimental
For the device fabrication, a 30 nm thick layer of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P 4083) was spin-cast onto the ITO substrate. After baking the PEDOT:PSS films at 120 °C for 1 h, the devices were moved into a nitrogen-purged glove box for subsequent depositions. The photoactive layer was deposited on the PEDOT:PSS layer by spin coating using a 1:1 weight ratio of P3HT:PCBM blend dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The film thickness of the devices is about 160 ± 10 nm. The electric field-assisted treatment was then performed by applying various magnitudes of voltage during the solvent-drying process for 30 min. The current between top and bottom ITO electrodes was monitored during the experiment, and indicated only a small leakage current (∼0.05 μA) in our setup. After the electric field-assisted treatment of the P3HT:PCBM hybrid layers, the top aluminium electrodes were then thermally evaporated under vacuum at a pressure of around 5 × 10−6 Torr. A typical device area was about 0.1 cm2. Current–voltage measurements (Keithley 2410 source meter) were obtained by using a solar simulator (Newport Inc.) with an AM 1.5 filter under an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) were measured by using an Xe lamp in combination with a monochromator (Oriel Inc.). The film thickness was measured by means of a Veeco M6 surface profiler. For optical anisotropic measurements, ellipsometric parameters (tan Ψ and cos Δ) were acquired using a SOPRA ellipsometer. Transmittance and reflectance spectra were recorded using a Hitachi U-4100 optical spectrometer at various incident angles. The measured data were fitted to a dispersion function, also called an oscillator model, describing the dielectric function. The oscillator model requires only a few oscillator coefficients to describe both the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index over a wide spectral range. GIXRD measurements were carried out on the wiggler beamline BL17A1 of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC, Taiwan), with a wavelength of 1.3332 Å. The data were recorded by an on-line image plate, Mar345. All of the samples were deposited on a heavily boron-doped silicon substrate. In order to increase the effective X-ray penetrating depth, the angle between the incident beam and the film surface was fixed at 0.2°. For the time-of-flight (TOF) measurements, the samples were illuminated by a Nd:YAG pulsed laser (λ = 532 nm, repetition rate = 10 Hz and a duration of ∼5 ns) from the transparent-electrode side, such as an ITO or semi-transparent Al electrode (d ∼ 20 nm), for examining the electron and hole mobility. The photoinduced charge carrier extraction in a linearly increasing voltage (Photo-CELIV) setup consists of a 532 nm pulsed laser, a delay generator (Stanford Research DG535), a function generator (Stanford Reaserch DS 345) and a digital storage oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS5052B). The Photo-CELIV measurements were carried out using the operating photovoltaic devices. Further details of the experimental procedures were mentioned by Mozer and co-workers15,16 The AFM images were obtained by using Innova scanning probe microscopy (Veeco Inc.) in tapping mode with a Si tip (resonance frequency: 75 kHz; spring constant: 4 N m−1) at a scanning rate of 0.5 Hz. Specimens for the transmission electron microscope (Philips Tecnai G2 LaB6 Gun TEM, 200 kV) were prepared by etching the bottom of a PEDOT:PSS film as a sacrificial layer with water. The resulting blend films were floated onto a water surface and immediately transferred to a Cu grid.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of the setup for the electric field-assisted annealing processes of the P3HT:PCBM BHJ solar cells. The top electrode consists of an indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass with dimensions of 40 mm × 20 mm × 1.0 mm, and is separated by a distance of 1.0 mm from the photovoltaic device, consisting of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM, before the deposition of the top Al electrode. After spin-coating the samples for 20 s, the electric field-assisted annealing treatment was then performed by applying various magnitudes of voltage (from 0 V to 1000 V) during the solvent-drying processes for 30 min.
 Fig. 1  A schematic representation of the electric field-assisted annealing process. 
The current between the top and bottom ITO electrodes was monitored during the experiment, and indicated that there is only a small leakage current (∼0.05 μA) in our setup, where the possibility of the current-injected heating effect can be ruled out. Fig. 2a shows the evolution of the optical absorption spectra of P3HT:PCBM hybrid films treated by applying different electric fields during the solvent-drying processes. For comparison, an “as-casted” sample corresponding to the blend film completely dried by spin-coating was also measured. For the “solvent-only” sample, the film was treated only by the slow solvent-evaporation process for 30 min, without applying any electric field. As the electric field during fabrication is increased from 0 to 6 × 103 V cm−1, a systematic red-shift of the absorption spectra is observed for the samples prepared by electric field-assisted annealing. In addition, the more obvious appearances of three vibronic shoulders (at ∼520, 550 and 600 nm), corresponding to stronger interchain interactions and higher ordering of P3HT, is also clearly observed.7 A further increase in the applied electric fields up to 1 × 104 V cm−1 results in a decrease in the absorption intensities. The sample prepared under the electric field-assisted treatment of 6 × 103 V cm−1 exhibits the strongest absorption intensity, with clear vibronic shoulders. Figs 3a–d show the tapping mode-AFM phase images for P3HT:PCBM hybrids fabricated under different treatment conditions, corresponding to the as-casted, solvent-only, and electric field-assisted annealed (6 × 103 V cm−1 and 1 × 104 V cm−1) samples, respectively. Since the contrast in the AFM phase image illustrates the distribution of crystalline regions separated by amorphous boundaries,17 the fibrillar crystalline domains of P3HT can be clearly visualized in the solvent-only sample, while the distinct crystalline regions in the as-casted samples are not clearly resolved. When an electric field of 6 × 103 V cm−1 is applied to the sample during solvent evaporation, the morphology shows larger crystalline regions with less amorphous boundaries, as shown in Fig. 3c. When the applied electric field is increased to 1 × 104 V cm−1, the size of the fibrillar crystalline domain is then reduced, as shown in Fig. 3d. The sample treated under an optimized electric field of 6 × 103 V cm−1 exhibits the highest polymer ordering, accompanied by the strongest absorption intensity and the most prominent vibronic peaks. We have further characterized the anisotropic absorption intensities of the solvent-only and electric field (6 × 103 V cm−1) annealed samples using ellipsometry measurements. Using the reflectance and transmittance spectra of polarized light at various incident angles, the TE polarized curve was fitted to acquire the in-plane extinction coefficient (k//); the TM polarized curve was then fitted to obtain the out-of-plane extinction coefficient (k⊥), as shown in Fig. 2b. Aligning the electric field of the incident light parallel to the direction of the polymer main chains, i.e. the orientation of the transition dipole moments, results in π–π* absorption.18,19 In Figs 2c and d, it is found that both the extinction coefficients (k// and k⊥) in the TE and TM polarized incidences are increased for the sample after electric field treatment compared to those in the solvent-only sample, suggesting that the application of an electric field during solvent evaporation can assist the polymer ordering in directions both parallel and perpendicular to the substrate. In addition, the degree of enhancement of k⊥ after the electric field-assisted annealing is more significant than the degree of enhancement of k//, in contrast to our previous report using the thermal annealing method.20 This result suggests that the self-organization of the polymer chains in the P3HT:PCBM samples by thermal annealing and electric field-assisted annealing might be different. More detailed structural analyses of P3HT:PCBM hybrids prepared under different treatment conditions will be discussed with the following GIXRD experiments.

Next, we deposited the top Al electrodes onto the films prepared under different treatment conditions to fabricate the solar cell devices. Figs 4a and b show the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of devices prepared under various electric fields. The “as-casted” device exhibits photovoltaic performance with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 6.14 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.53 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 46%, resulting in a power conversion efficiency (η) of 1.51% under AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) illumination. The device prepared under the solvent-only annealing exhibits an improved performance with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 8.23 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.57 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 51%, resulting in a power conversion efficiency (η) of 2.37%, which is comparable with the previous report in the literature.9 As the applied electric field is increased up to 6 × 103 V cm−1, a systematic enhancement in photovoltaic performance can be observed, giving the best power conversion efficiency (η) of 4.1% with the values of Jsc, Voc and FF of 11.60 mA cm−2, 0.59 V and 60%, respectively. A further increase in the electric field results in a decline in the photovoltaic performance of the devices. Table 1 summarizes the photovoltaic performance of devices prepared under different treatment conditions. The optimum photovoltaic performance of the device fabricated under an electric field of 6 × 103 V cm−1 is consistent with the results of enhanced absorption intensities and larger crystalline domains of the polymer shown above.

To further examine the effect of electric field-assisted annealing on the structure of P3HT:PCBM hybrids, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements were carried out using synchrotron X-ray radiation at NSRRC. All of the samples were deposited on heavily boron-doped silicon substrates without the PEDOT:PSS layers and then treated by different annealing methods. Figs 5a and b exhibit the diffraction images of the P3HT/PCBM hybrid films treated by the solvent-only annealing and electric field-assisted annealing processes, respectively. For comparison, the sample fabricated using a thermal annealing treatment was also measured as shown in Fig. 5c. The image consists of two crystallographic components, qx and qz. The qx corresponds to the in-plane direction of the substrate, and qz is perpendicular to the substrate surface. The lamellar (edge-on) structure of P3HT usually provides the (h00) diffraction peak in the out-of-plane direction and the (0k0) diffraction peak in the in-plane direction, corresponding to P3HT thiophene chains with alkyl stacking normal to the substrate and π–π stacking between P3HT thiophene chains parallel to the substrate, respectively. In Fig. 5d, it is shown that all three samples exhibit a highly ordered lamellar structure (edge on) with distinct (100), (200), (300) diffraction peaks (diffraction angle at θ = 4.7°, 9.4° and 14.1°, respectively), indicating that most of the P3HT shows a well-organized intraplane structure consisting of thiophene chains with alkyl stacking normal to the substrate.21 The (100) peak intensity for the sample prepared by electric field-assisted annealing is increased compared to that of the sample prepared by solvent-only annealing, suggesting that the crystallinity of the P3HT/PCBM hybrid is enhanced under the influence of electric field. The sample treated by thermal annealing shows the highest crystallinity, with the strongest (100) peak, with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM). In contrast, the trend of the (010) diffraction intensities is noticeably different from that of the (100) diffraction intensities, where the strongest peak intensity of (010) diffraction in the in-plane (qx) direction is observed for the sample treated by electric field-assisted annealing, as shown in the inset of Fig. 5d. Moreover, there is an additional diffraction peak (arrow, diffraction angle at θ = 20.2°) in the out-of-plane (qz) direction for the sample fabricated under electric field-assisted annealing as shown in the GIXRD image in Fig. 5b. Since the d-spacings of the (001) and (010) diffraction peaks of P3HT are the same (0.38 nm),21,22 the appearance of both (010) in the in-plane (qx) direction and (001) in the out-of-plane (qz) direction in the sample after electric field treatment suggests the possible formation of vertical-stacking of P3HT crystallites, in addition to the dominant lamellar stacking. During solvent evaporation (solvent-only), the polymer chains of P3HT are predominantly self-organized, with lamellar stacking accompanied by some amorphous regions. As the electric field is applied during the solvent-drying process, both the lamellar stacking and vertical stacking of P3HT can possibly be promoted within the amorphous regions. The formation of the vertical stacking of P3HT within the amorphous regions is also consistent with the observation of a larger enhancement in the out-of-plane extinction coefficient of k⊥ after electric field annealing, as shown in Fig. 2d. In contrast, the thermal annealing process is found to promote lamellar stacking predominantly. Although the detailed mechanism of the effect of the electric field on the orientation of the polymer chains is still not well-understood at the current stage, an investigation of the electric dipole moments of thiophene23 interacting with the external electric field, which may possibly be responsible for the enhanced ordering in the direction perpendicular to the substrate, is currently underway.

Figs 6a and b show bright-field (BF) transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the P3HT:PCBM hybrid films treated by the solvent-only and electric field-assisted annealing (electric field of 6 × 103 V cm−1) methods, respectively. In a typical TEM image, a P3HT-rich region is relatively bright compared to a PCBM-rich region, because of the lower density of P3HT (1.10 g cm−3)24 compared to that of PCBM (1.50 g cm−3).25 After the electric field-assisted annealing treatment, the domain sizes of the PCBM molecules are found to increase and to form an interpenetrated network within the P3HT matrix. The high-magnification TEM images in Figs 6c and d show that more fibrillar P3HT chains appear with a higher degree of crystalline regions after the electric field-assisted treatment. Hence, the P3HT:PCBM active layer, which consists of P3HT crystallites with higher chain ordering and larger PCBM network-like domains, provides more efficient transport paths for holes and electrons.26,27Fig. 7a shows the time-of-flight (TOF) electron and hole mobilities of the P3HT:PCBM hybrid thin films treated by solvent-only and electric field-assisted annealing (electric field of 6 × 103 V cm−1). Both the hole and electron mobilities are found to increase after the electric field-assisted annealing treatment. The charge recombination rate during transport of the BHJ solar cells under different treatments were further obtained using the photoinduced charge carrier extraction in a linearly increasing voltage (Photo-CELIV) measurement as shown in Fig. 7b. The calculated effective bimolecular recombination lifetime τB of 6.49 μs in the blend film after electric field-assisted annealing is longer than the 3.85 μs after solvent-only annealing. The enhanced charge-carrier mobilities and increased recombination lifetime of the P3HT:PCBM hybrid thin films prepared by the electric field-assisted treatment is consistent with the improved crystallinity within phase-separated domains in the blend films, as a result of the increased photovoltaic performance of Jsc and FFs in the devices.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated a simple annealing method to fabricate polymer solar cells by applying a DC electric field during the solvent-drying process without any thermal post-treatment. The structural analyses indicate that the electric field-assisted annealing facilitates the crystallization of the polymer and improves the carrier transport and photovoltaic performance of devices. This method can easily be integrated into large-area and low-temperature fabrication processes for the future development of flexible polymer solar cells.

Broader context

Polymer solar cells have attracted great interest for fabricating low-cost and mechanically flexible photovoltaic devices. Several approaches have been used to improve the power conversion efficiencies of polymer solar cells by controlling the nanoscale morphology of the photoactive layer, including thermal, solvent, and microwave annealing. Here, we would like to present a new fabrication method to control the morphology and performance of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/fullerene derivative phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) hybrid solar cells, by simply applying a DC electric field perpendicular to the substrate during solvent-drying processes without any thermal post-treatment. The applied electric fields assist the self-organization of polymer during film formation as a result of enhanced polymer chain ordering, giving a power conversion efficiency up to 4.1%. The electric field-assisted annealing method provides a new route to fabricate large-area polymer solar cells at low temperatures.
