    , Accepted 16th April 2014First published on 17th April 2014AbstractTo achieve 5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole and 2,7-linked silafluorene based soluble conjugated polymers, flexible side chains were attached at different positions of the conjugated polymers. Three soluble polymers PSiF-D(OT)DFBT, PSiF-TTDFBT, and PDOSiF-DTDFBT were prepared and used as donor materials for polymer solar cells. PSiF-D(OT)DFBT exhibits a band gap of 2.06 eV with a deep HOMO of −5.64 eV. PSiF-TTDFBT shows a band gap of 1.75 eV with the HOMO of −5.23 eV. PDOSiF-DTDFBT is of a band gap of 1.86 eV with the HOMO level of −5.37 eV. Among these three polymers, PDOSiF-DTDFBT shows the highest field effect transistor (FET) hole mobility up to 3.31 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, PDOSiF-DTDFBT:PC71BM blend films show the highest SCLC mobility up to 5.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and polymer solar cells (PSCs) with the blend of PDOSiF-DTDFBT:PC71BM (1:1, by weight) as the active layer gave a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.03% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.73 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 8.55 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.65. Our studies also reveal the structure–property relationship of 2,7-linked silafluorene and 5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole based conjugated polymers.
Introduction
The synthesis of new donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating conjugated polymers with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) is still an important topic in the research field of polymer solar cells (PSCs).1–7 Benzothiadiazole (BT) is a widely used acceptor unit, and many BT containing D–A alternating conjugated polymers have afforded high device performance when blended with PC71BM as the active layer for PSCs.8–12 The introduction of two fluoro atoms in the 5,6-positions of the benzothiadiazole unit not only lowers the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the resulted conjugated polymers to achieve higher open circuit voltage (Voc), but also increases the intramolecular polymer chain interactions to afford higher hole mobility.13 Compared with the corresponding BT based conjugated polymers, 5,6-difluorobenzothiazole (DFBT) based conjugated polymers usually gave better device performance.14–16 Except the above mentioned advantages, the introduction of DFBT into the polymer main chain usually brings about the DFBT containing polymers with poor solubility.3
Silafluorene has been used as the donor unit for the construction of D–A alternating conjugated polymers for high efficiency PSCs.12,17–19 The conjugated polymer PSiF-DBT, as shown in Chart 1, with BT as the acceptor unit, silafluorene as the donor unit, and thiophene as the spacer has been reported as the donor material with good device performance.12,20,21 In our previous paper, we have reported the synthesis of 5,6-bis(octyloxy)benzothiadiazole and silafluorene based conjugated polymer P2, as shown in Chart 1, for high efficiency PSCs.21 Due to the good solubility, high molecular weight P2 has been synthesized and PSCs with P2:PC71BM as the active layer gave a PCE of 6.05%.
 Chart 1 
Due to the fascinating properties of both DFBT and silafluorene, herein we would like to report the rational design and synthesis of DFBT and silafluorene based conjugated polymers. To achieve polymers with good photovoltaic performance, four D–A conjugated polymers PSiF-DTDFBT, PSiF-D(OT)DFBT, PSi-TTDFBT, and PDOSiF-DTDFBT, as shown in Chart 1, have been designed and synthesized. We first designed and synthesized PSiF-DTDFBT, which is insoluble even at elevated temperature in commonly used organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene (CB), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB), and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB), and cannot be used for the fabrication of PSCs. To obtain soluble polymers, we have attached an octyl chain on the 4-position of the thiophene unit, and synthesized polymer PSiF-D(OT)DFBT. The disadvantage of such a design is that the octyl chain on the thiophene unit will give rise to a large dihedral angle between the thiophene unit and silafluorene and result in poorer conjugation. To enhance the polymer chain conjugation, we incorporated two additional thiophene units into the polymer main chain and synthesized polymer PSiF-TTDFBT. It is worth noting that similar fluorene based D–A polymers PFO-M1-3 with four thiophene units in each repeating unit have been reported by Wang and Cao et al. and PFO-M-3 exhibited improved photovoltaic performance when compared with PFO-DTBT.22 Alternatively, we have designed and synthesized PDOSiF-DTDFBT by attaching four flexible chains onto the silafluorene unit to enhance the solubility of polymers. The structures of three soluble polymers were fully characterized, and their optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties were investigated in detail to explore their structure and property relationships.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
The syntheses of monomers M-1, M-2, M-3, and M-4 are outlined in Scheme 1. M-1 was synthesized using commercially available 4,5-difluorobenzene-1,2-diamine as the starting material according to the literature procedures.23 Suzuki cross-coupling of 3 with 4-octylthiophene-2-boronic acid pinacol ester was followed by bromination of the cross-coupling product with Br2 in methylene chloride at room temperature to afford M-2, which bears two octyl chains on the two thiophene units. Coupling of M-2 and thiophene-2-boronic acid pinacol ester using the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction furnished compound 6 in a yield of 75%, which was converted to M-2 by bromination with NBS in a solvent mixture of chloroform and DMF at room temperature. Compound 8 was synthesized according to literature procedures.19 Reaction between 8 and 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane under Miyaura conditions afforded M-4 in a yield of 59%. The synthesis of polymers PSiF-DTDFBT, PSiF-D(OT)DFBT, PSiF-TTDFBT, and PDOSiF-DTDFBT are outlined in Scheme 2. Suzuki polycondensation of M-1 with M-5,21M-2 with M-5, M-3 with M-5, and M-1 with M-4 afforded PSiF-DTDFBT, PSiF-D(OT)DFBT, PSi-TTDFBT, and PDOSiF-DTDFBT, respectively. Except PSiF-DTDFBT, all the other polymers are fully soluble in CB, DCB, and TCB at elevated temperature. Molecular weights and molecular weight distributions of these three soluble polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using TCB as an eluent at 150 °C with narrowly distributed polystyrenes as the calibration standards, and the results are summarized in Table 1. PSiF-D(OT)DFBT showed a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 69.6 kg mol−1, a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of 218.3 kg mol−1, and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 3.14. PSiF-TTDFBT showed a Mn of 31.0 kg mol−1, a Mw of 100.6 kg mol−1, and a PDI of 3.25. PDOSiF-DTDFBT showed a Mn of 40.0 kg mol−1, a Mw of 119.8 kg mol−1, and a PDI of 3.00. For many polymers, the photovoltaic performance of devices is highly dependent on their molecular weight. Only high molecular materials can furnish good device performance. It is worth noting that we have obtained soluble and high molecular weight PSiF-D(OT)DFBT, PSiF-TTDFBT, and PDOSiF-DTDFBT. These three polymers are of good thermal stability as indicated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements. The 5% decomposition temperatures of PSiF-D(OT)DFBT, PSiF-TTDFBT, and PDOSiF-DTDFBT are 447 °C, 440 °C, and 397 °C, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements from 20 to 300 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere showed that there is no obvious glass transition for these polymers. Powdery X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out to investigate the packing of polymer chains in the solid state. As shown in Fig. 1, XRD diffraction patterns of PSiF-D(OT)DFBT, PSiF-TTDFBT, and PDOSiF-DTDFBT exhibited two diffraction peaks. The first peak in a small angle region, which reflects the distance of polymer backbones separated by the flexible side chains, is located at 2θ of 4.36° for PSiF-D(OT)DFBT, 5.69° for PSiF-TTDFBT, and 4.57° for PDOSiF-DTDFBT, corresponding to a distance of 20.27, 15.53, and 19.69 Å, respectively. The three diffraction peaks in the wide angle region reflect the π–π stacking distances between polymer backbones, which are located at 2θ of 20.94° for PSiF-D(OT)DFBT, 25.43° for PSiF-TTDFBT, and 24.16° for PDOSiF-DTDFBT, corresponding to π–π stacking distances of 4.24, 3.50, 3.68 Å, respectively.

Optical properties
UV-vis absorption spectra of polymers PSiF-D(OT)DFBT, PSiF-TTDFBT, and PDOSiF-DTDFBT in DCB solutions at 100 °C and as thin films are shown in Fig. 2. To eliminate the influence of aggregation of polymer chains in DCB solutions, UV-vis absorption spectra of polymer solutions were measured at 100 °C. All polymers exhibit two absorption peaks both in solutions and as thin films, and the peak locations are summarized in Table 2. In comparison with their solution spectra, those of the films are all red-shifted and broadened due to the aggregation of polymer chains in the solid state. For PSiF-D(OT)DFBT, due to the steric hindrance of the octyl chain on the thiophene unit, the absorption spectrum of PSiF-D(OT)DFBT is much narrower, and its film absorption onset is 603 nm, corresponding to an optical band gap of 2.06 eV. For PSiF-TTDFBT, in comparison with PSiF-D(OT)DFBT, the introduction of two additional thiophene units in the polymer main chain can release the steric hindrance of the octyl chain and result in a small dihedral angle between the two adjacent thiophene units. Therefore, the film absorption spectrum of PSiF-TTDFBT is much broad, and the film absorption onset is 708 nm, which gave an optical band gap of 1.75 eV. For PDOSiF-DTDFBT, due to the supramolecular S–O interaction, the two octyloxy substituents on the silafluorene can planarize the polymer main chain to some extent.24,25 As a result, PDOSiF-DTDFBT as a film exhibited broader absorption with an absorption onset at 668 nm, giving an optical band gap of 1.86 eV. The absorption onsets and optical band gaps (Eg,opt) are also summarized in Table 2.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to study the electrochemical properties of polymers and the CV curves are shown in Fig. 3. The onset oxidation potentials of PSiF-D(OT)DFBT, PSiF-TTDFBT, and PDOSiF-DTDFBT determined by CV are 0.93 V, 0.52 V, and 0.66 V, respectively. According to the equation EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.71), HOMO levels were calculated to be −5.64 eV for PSiF-D(OT)DFBT, −5.23 eV for PSiF-TTDFBT, and −5.37 eV for PDOSiF-DTDFBT. Among these three polymers, PSiF-D(OT)DFBT is of the lowest HOMO level; compared with PSiF-D(OT)DFBT, the introduction of two additional thiophene units in the main chain has increased the HOMO level of PSiF-TTDFBT from −5.64 eV to −5.23 eV. Compared with PSiF-D(OT)DFBT, the introduction of two electron donating octyloxy substituents on the silafluorene has raised the HOMO level of PDOSiF-DTDFBT from −5.64 eV to −5.37 eV. LUMO levels were calculated according to the equation ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg,opt to be −3.58 eV for PSiF-D(OT)DFBT, −3.48 eV for PSiF-TTDFBT, −3.51 eV for PDOSiF-DTDFBT. The data are also summarized in Table 2. The low-lying HOMO level of PSiF-D(OT)DFBT is favorable for achieving higher open circuit voltage (Voc), as confirmed by device results (vide infra).

Field-effect transistor fabrication and characterization
Hole mobility up to 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 is usually required for polymer donors in order to obtain balanced electron and hole mobility for the polymer and PCBM blends, and balanced mobility is very crucial for achieving high performance polymer solar cells. Transport properties of polymers were therefore investigated by fabrication of field effect transistors (FETs). Bottom-contact devices were fabricated on Si/SiO2 substrates with the low resistance Si as gate and SiO2 (500 nm) as gate insulator. Polymer thin films were spin-coated on the OTS-modified Si/SiO2 substrates from DCB solutions, and Au electrodes with a thickness of 25 nm were vacuum deposited onto polymer thin films. The transfer and output characteristic curves of FET devices are shown in Fig. 4. Hole mobility (μ) was deduced from the derivative plots in the saturated regime through the equation IDS = μ(W/2L)Ci(VG − VT)2 where IDS is the drain current, W is the channel width, L is the channel length, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer (SiO2, 300 nm, Ci = 11 nF cm−2), VG and VT are the gain voltage and threshold voltage, respectively. Hole mobilities of PSiF-D(OT)DFBT, PSiF-TTDFBT, and PDOSiF-DTDFBT are 6.94 × 10−3, 3.09 × 10−2 and 3.31 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are close to the electron mobility of PC71BM. Hole mobilities, VT, and on/off ratios are summarized in Table 3.

Photovoltaic properties
Photovoltaic properties of polymers were evaluated by using the device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al. The performance of devices was optimized by variation of the weight ratio of polymer to PC71BM, the concentration of blend solution, the spin-coating speed, and the volume of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) or 1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN) as additives. The J–V curves of these polymer solar cells are illustrated in Fig. 5a. The use of DIO as the additive only showed a positive effect for PSiF-D(OT)DFBT based PSCs, but a negative effect for PSiF-TTDFBT and PDOSiF-DTDFBT based PSCs. The use of 1-CN as the additive has a positive effect for polymers PSiF-TTDFBT and PDOSiF-DTDFBT and a negative effect for PSiF-D(OT)DFBT. For PSiF-D(OT)DFBT, the active layer spin-coated from polymer:PC71BM in a weight ratio of 1:3 in DCB solutions gave the best device performance with a PCE of 0.96%, a Voc of 0.97 V, a Jsc of 2.63 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.38. The high Voc of devices agrees well with the wide band gap and the deep HOMO level of PSiF-D(OT)DFBT (vide supra). The use of DIO (2%, by volume) as the additive, the PCE was increased to 2.19% with a Voc of 0.96 V, a Jsc of 3.75 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.61. For PSiF-TTDFBT based PSCs, the active layer spin-coated from polymer:PC71BM in a weight ratio of 1:3 using DCB as the solvent gave a PCE of 1.61% with a Voc of 0.70 V, a Jsc of 5.09 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.45. By the use of 1-CN (2%, by volume) as the additive, the PCE was increased to 2.39% with a Voc of 0.70 V, a Jsc of 5.34 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.65. For PDOSiF-DTDFBT, devices fabricated from DCB solutions with a polymer to PC71BM weight ratio of 1:1 gave the highest PCE of 3.61% with a Voc of 0.72 V, a Jsc of 8.23 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.61. By the use of 1-CN (2%, by volume) as the additive, the PCE was increased to 4.03% with a Voc of 0.73, a Jsc of 8.55 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.65. The data are summarized in Table 4. Comparing PSiF-TTDFBT with PDOSiF-DTDFBT, we should mention here that the solubility of PSiF-TTDFBT was poorer than PDOSiF-DTDFBT, which makes it difficult to make a high concentration solution for spin-coating. The high Voc for PDOSiF-DTDFBT based PSCs is consistent with the fact that PDOSiF-DTDFBT is of a deep HOMO level. Among these polymers, the pure PDOSiF-DTDFBT film showed the highest hole mobility and the PDOSiF-DTDFBT:PC71BM blend film gave the highest space charge limited current (SCLC) mobility (vide infra). The hole mobility of the PDOSiF-DTDFBT:PC71BM blend film is almost three times higher than that of the PSiF-TTDFBT:PC71BM blend film. As we described (vide supra), the best photovoltaic performance was achieved for PSiF-TTDFBT:PC71BM in a polymer to PC71BM weight ratio of 1:3; whereas for PDOSiF-DTDFBT based PSCs, the best photovoltaic performance was achieved in a polymer to PC71BM weight ratio of 1:1. Therefore we think that the high Jsc of PDOSiF-DTDFBT based PSCs is due to the following two reasons: (1) the high hole mobility of the blend film, which is confirmed by the SCLC measurement; (2) the high polymer content blend films can absorb more photons, which is proved by the high absorption coefficient of PDOSiF-DTDFBT:PC71BM (1:1) blend films. UV-visible absorption coefficient curves of PSiF-D(OT)DFBT:PC71BM (1:3), PSiF-TTDFBT:PC71BM (1:3), and PDOSiF-DTDFBT:PC71BM (1:1) blend films fabricated under optimized conditions are shown in Fig. S1.† The absorption coefficient was calculated by film absorbance/film thickness (nm). We can clearly see that the absorption coefficient of the PDOSiF-DTDFBT:PC71BM (1:1) blend film is markedly higher than that of the PSiF-D(OT)DFBT:PC71BM (1:3) blend film in the range of 350 to 700 nm. The poorer solubility of PSiF-TTDFBT:PC71BM in 1,2-dichlorobenzene prohibited the fabrication of a device with a high polymer concentration. Compared with fluorene based D–A polymers PFO-M1-3,22 the introduction of two fluorine atoms on the benzothiadiazole ring resulted in poorer solubility of the final polymers, and led to poorer performance of PSiF-TTDFBT:PC71BM based PSCs. Hole mobilities of blend films were measured by the SCLC method, and the results are also summarized in Table 4. PDOSiF-DTDFBT and PC71BM films exhibit the highest hole mobilities among these blend films, which is consistent with the highest short circuit current obtained from PDOSiF-DTDFBT based PSCs.

To correct the Jsc results obtained from J–V measurements, external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of devices used for the J–V investigation were measured and are shown in Fig. 5b. In the range of 360 to 600 nm, EQEs of PSiF-D(OT)DFBT and PSiF-TTDFBT are around 35%; whereas the EQE of PDOSiF-DTDFBT is around 50%. For all devices, Jsc obtained from the integration of the EQE with an AM 1.5G reference spectrum matched well with the Jsc obtained from the J–V measurements.
Film morphologies
The morphology of polymer:PC71BM blend films, which has a significant influence on exciton separation, charge carrier mobility, and photovoltaic performance, was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping-mode. AFM images of PSiF-D(OT)DFBT:PC71BM (1:3), PSiF-TTDFBT:PC71BM (1:3), and PDOSiF-DTDFBT:PC71BM (1:1) blend films fabricated from DCB solutions without and with additives are shown in Fig. 6. For PSiF-D(OT)DFBT, the use of DIO as an additive led to a smaller domain size with the root-mean-square (rms) value decreased from 6.16 nm to 1.55 nm; whereas for PSiF-TTDFBT and PDOSiF-DTDFBT, the use of 1-CN as an additive also led to a smaller domain size with the rms values decreased from 5.61 nm to 0.793 nm for PSiF-TTDFBT and from 0.401 nm to 0.364 nm for PDOSiF-DTDFBT. As an experiential rule, DIO prefers to dissolve PCBM; whereas CN prefers to dissolve the conjugated polymers. Usually, the use of DIO can reduce the domain size of PC71BM;26 whereas the use of CN can usually reduce the domain size of polymers.27,28 The change in morphology after the addition of additive is consistent with the enhancement of the performance of PSCs.

Conclusions
We have designed and synthesized four D–A alternating conjugated polymers based on 5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole and 2,7-linked silafluorene. PSiF-DTDFBT is insoluble in common organic solvents and not suitable for fabrication of PSCs by solution processing. PSiF-D(OT)DFBT, PSiF-TTDFBT, and PDOSiF-DTDFBT are soluble in DCB and TCB and could be used for the fabrication of PSCs. PSiF-D(OT)DFBT with an octyl chain on the thiophene unit is of a band gap of 2.06 eV with a deep HOMO of −5.64 eV. PSiF-TTDFBT with two additional thiophenes at each repeating unit in the polymer main chain exhibits a band gap of 1.75 eV with the HOMO of −5.23 eV. PDOSiF-DTDFBT with two additional octyloxy chains on the silafluorene unit has a band gap of 1.86 eV with the HOMO level of −5.37 eV. The hole mobilities of these polymers are in the range of 6.94 × 10−3 to 3.31 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, which match the electron mobility of PC71BM. Hole mobilities of polymer:PC71BM blend films measured by the SCLC method are in the range of 1.92 × 10−5 to 5.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. PSCs with the blends of PSiF-D(OT)DFBT:PC71BM, PSiF-TTDFBT:PC71BM, and PDOSiF-DTDFBT:PC71BM as the active layer gave PCEs of 2.19%, 2.39%, and 4.03%, respectively. Additionally, our research also provides a better understanding on the structure–property relationship of silafluorene and 5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole based conjugated polymers.
