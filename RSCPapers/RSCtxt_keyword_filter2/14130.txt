    , Accepted 11th February 2009First published on 17th March 2009AbstractA series of four small band gap polymers have been synthesized and have been incorporated into bulk heterojunction solar cells. The polymers were prepared via Yamamoto coupling and consist of alternating electron-rich dithiophene and electron-deficient bisquinoxaline or thienopyrazine units. In the thin solid films the optical band gaps (Eg) vary from 1.38 eV for the bisquinoxaline to 1.21 eV for thienopyrazine containing polymers. All polymers provide a photovoltaic response when blended with a methanofullerene as electron acceptor in the near infrared region up to the optical band gap. The best cells reach an efficiency of η = 1.5% under estimated standard solar light conditions (AM1.5G, 100 mW/cm2).
Introduction
Organic solar cells generally use a blend of electron donor and acceptor materials in which nanoscale phase separation of the two components is created to achieve both quantitative charge generation after photoexcitation and effective collection of these charges. The most efficient bulk heterojunction solar cells of this type combine a conjugated polymer as an electron donor and a methanofullerene derivative as an electron acceptor. To further improve the performance, small band gap polymers have attracted considerable attention in recent years.1–15 The small band gap enhances the overlap of the polymer absorption spectrum with the solar emission that peaks around 700 nm (1.77 eV). The extended absorption potentially increases the photocurrent by absorbing more photons.
A successful and flexible strategy to design small band gap polymers involves the alternation of electron-rich and electron-deficient units along the polymer chain. In fact, varying the strength of the electron rich and electron deficient units allows judicious positioning of the energy levels of the polymer with respect to those of the acceptor. When designing small band gap polymers for photovoltaics, several aspects need to be taken into account. Decreasing the band gap can be achieved by either lowering the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) or raising the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the polymer, or both. However it is generally considered that a minimum offset of ∼0.3–0.4 eV between the LUMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor is required to ensure quantitative charge separation at the donor/acceptor interface.16,17 This minimum offset limits lowering of the LUMO of the polymer. The alternative approach, i.e. obtaining a narrow band gap by decreasing the oxidation potential of the polymer, i.e. raising the HOMO level, will lower the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the solar cell, because the Voc is governed by the energy difference of the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor.18,19 If the HOMO is raised, the maximum attainable Voc will decrease and substantially reduce the power output of the photovoltaic device. It is thus crucial to optimize the positions of the energy levels of the polymer with respect to the acceptor.
Of course many other factors govern the efficiency of polymer bulk heterojunction solar cells. Schilinsky et al.20 showed that the molecular weight (Mw) of a polymer may have a large influence on the device performance. In particular for semicrystalline polymers, a higher Mw resulted in a better intermolecular ordering (π-stacking) and therefore enhanced charge carrier (hole) mobility compared to low Mw material. Furthermore, controlling the morphology of the active layer, e.g. the typical size of the phase separation between donor and acceptor and the presence of suitable percolation pathways for both holes and electrons, is crucial for obtaining efficient solar cells.21–25 The polymer's solubility, crystallization behavior, and miscibility with the acceptor are key factors in determining the phase behavior of the blend.26,27
Here we report on the synthesis of a series of four small band gap polymers and evaluate their photovoltaic performance together with methanofullerenes [60]PCBM and [70]PCBM (i.e. the [6,6]-phenyl C61 and C71 butyric acid methyl esters). The polymers, shown in Fig. 1, consist of a dithiophene unit as the electron-rich part with either a thienopyrazine or a bisquinoxaline unit as the electron deficient part. The substituents are varied to fine-tune the electronic as well as the physical properties of the polymers.

Experimental
The synthetic procedures for preparing monomer and polymers, and their characterization by 1H and 13C NMR are described in detail in the ESI.‡ Molecular weights were determined using size exclusion chromatography in HPLC-grade o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) at 80 °C against polystyrene standards on a Polymer Laboratories-GPC 120 high temperature chromatograph, a PD 2040 high-temperature light scattering detector, and a Midas autosampler. A mixed-C 300 × 7.5 mm column was used, together with a pre-column. The flow rate was 1 ml/min and the injection volume 100 µl.
UV-vis absorption spectra were measured with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (scan rate = 100 mV/s) was performed on an Autolab PGSTAT30 potentiostat in a three-electrode single-compartment cell using ODCB containing 0.1 M TBAPF6 (Fluka) as electrolyte. The working electrode was a platinum disk, the counter electrode a silver wire, and the reference electrode Ag/AgCl. Potentials are relative to Fc/Fc+.
Photovoltaic devices were made by spin coating EL-grade PEDOT:PSS onto pre-cleaned, patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates (14 Ω per square) (Philips Research). The photoactive layer was deposited by spin coating from the appropriate solvent. The counter electrode of LiF (1 nm) and aluminium (100 nm) was deposited by vacuum evaporation at 5 × 10−6 mbar. The active area of the cells was 0.17 cm2. Monochromatic spectral response was measured on devices kept behind a quartz window in a nitrogen filled container with a Keithley 2400 source meter, using light from a tungsten halogen lamp, dispersed by an Oriel Cornerstone 130 monochromator. A calibrated Si cell was used as reference. All data points were corrected for the difference in illumination intensity during spectral response measurements and the solar emission, using the measured light intensity dependence of Jsc (Jsc ∝ Intensityα, with α = 0.89–0.92). The light intensity difference is determined from Jsc under monochromatic light and the estimated Jsc under AM1.5G. J–V characteristics were measured under ∼110 mW/cm2 white light from a tungsten-halogen lamp filtered using a Schott GG385 UV filter and a 300 nm ITO on glass near-IR filter, using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The Jsc obtained from the J–V curves is an overestimate due to the spectral mismatch and relatively high intensity (110 mW/cm2) of the tungsten-halogen lamp compared to the solar spectrum. Short circuit currents under standard solar illumination conditions (Jsc(SR)) were obtained from convolution of the spectral response with the AM1.5G (100 mW/cm2) solar spectrum. The estimated power conversion efficiency was determined by combining Jsc(SR) with Voc and FF from the J–V measurements. We have reported previously that, for similar devices, this procedure affords estimated conversion efficiencies that are virtually identical to those obtained with a solar simulator and correcting for spectral mismatch.13
Tapping mode AFM was measured in a NanoScope Dimension 3100 microscope (Veeco, Digital Instruments) using PPP-NCHR probes (Nanosensors).
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthesis routes for PTBEHT and PTBOT are depicted in Scheme 1. Starting from methyl-3,5-dihydroxybenzoate 1, a Williamson-ether synthesis afforded compound 2a and 2b. Due to the different side chains, 2a is a white solid, while 2b is a transparent oil. Both esters were converted into the corresponding diketones 3a and 3b by applying a sodium induced acyloin coupling.28 Formation of byproducts and a tedious purification limited the yield in these reactions to 35–45%. Precursor 6 was obtained via Stille coupling of 2,5-dibromo-3,4-dinitrothiophene29 (4) with 2-tributylstannylthiophene using PdCl2(PPh3)2 and a subsequent reduction of the nitro groups by applying SnCl2. The starting compound for this route, 4, was synthesized via nitration of 2,5-dibromothiophene. Condensation coupling of 3a or 3b with 6 afforded monomers 7a and 7b in good yields. Adding 2 equivalents of N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) resulted in the formation of 8a and 8b, which can be polymerized in a Yamamoto coupling reaction using bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) (Ni(cod)2) and bipyridine. The molecular weight (Mw) of PTBEHT was 160 kg/mol with a large polydispersity (PDI) of 6. It proved to be more difficult to obtain high-Mw PTBOT, probably because it is less soluble and precipitates out of solution at an earlier stage during polymerization. The longest polymer had Mw = 50 kg/mol with PDI = 3.3.

Incorporation of the bisquinoxaline unit was accomplished via the routes shown in Scheme 2. First, bromination and subsequent nitration of benzothiadiazole, 9, afforded 1,4-dibromo-5,6-dinitro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole 11 in a 21% overall yield. Stille coupling of 11 with 2-tributylstannylthiophene provided 12 in a good yield. Subsequently, the nitro groups are reduced by adding iron dust in acetic acid to give 13. Starting from compound 13, the routes that lead to either PTBEHBQ or PTOBQ deviate. For the latter, reduction of the thiadiazole ring using zinc dust in acetic acid, followed by a condensation coupling with 9,10-octadecanedione provided monomer 16, which was brominated with NBS to give 17. Polymerization of 17via Yamamoto coupling yielded PTOBQ as a blue polymer with Mw = 16 kg/mol and PDI = 3.2. To obtain PTBEHBQ, a different route is required. Starting again from 13, the bromine substituents were incorporated at this point in the route, because after condensation coupling with 3b the unsubstituted positions of the phenyl rings were equally susceptible towards electrophilic substitution as the α-positions of the thiophene rings. After bromination of 13 with NBS, the thiadiazole ring of 14 was then reduced using zinc dust in acetic acid and subsequent condensation coupling with 3b afforded 15 in moderate yields. Some cleavage of bromine was observed, but the side-product was easily removed by column chromatography. Monomer 15 was again polymerized via a Yamamoto coupling giving a green polymer with Mw = 54 kg/mol and PDI = 3.6.

Optical properties
The optical absorption spectra in Fig. 2 demonstrate that each polymer possesses a small optical band gap, ranging from 1.2–1.5 eV (Table 1). The spectra of PTBOT, PTBEHT, and PTBEHBQ dissolved in ODCB are very similar with absorption maxima (λmax) at or a little above 800 nm. Likewise, the optical band gaps (Eg) of these polymers, defined as the onset of absorption, are all at approximately 1.3 eV (Table 1). In contrast, the spectrum of PTOBQ is clearly blue shifted with λmax = 675 nm and Eg = 1.49 eV. This illustrates the influence of the substituents on the band gap of the polymer. The alkyl chains reduce the electron deficiency of the bisquinoxaline unit which results in a larger gap for PTOBQ.

 Fig. 2  Room temperature UV-Vis absorption spectra of the polymers (a) in ODCB solution and (b) as thin films. 
The side chains not only influence the electronic properties, but also affect solubility. The difference between PTBOT and PTBEHT is the linear or branched nature of the side chains. The linear octyl chains were introduced to enhance aggregate formation and allow a closer packing of the polymer chains. A shorter interchain distance is thought to lead to higher charge mobilities30 and would contribute to charge transport and photovoltaic performance.31 The temperature dependent absorption measurements (Fig. 3) indicate that indeed aggregate formation occurs for PTBOT in ODCB. At 20 °C aggregate absorption is dominating the spectrum, while at 80 °C and above the polymer appears to be molecularly dissolved. Cooling to 20 °C results in an almost fully aggregated species, as inferred from the near absence of a shoulder at shorter wavelengths.
 Fig. 3  Temperature dependent absorption of PTBOT in ODCB in the heating (a) and cooling (b) runs between 20 and 100 °C. 
When going from solution to the solid state, the absorption spectra of PTBEHT and PTOBQ display a bathochromic shift of λmax of approximately 35 nm (Fig. 2b). In contrast, the spectrum of PTBOT undergoes only a very small red shift, while PTBEHBQ even exhibits a small blue shift. The fact that aggregated polymer chains are already present in solution, as is clear from the absorption spectrum (Fig. 3), explains the small shift for PTBOT. For PTBEHBQ, we propose that the bulky substituents prevent formation of a planar structure and inhibit the aggregation of polymer chains that usually causes the bathochromic shift in a conjugated polymer film.
Electrochemistry
Cyclic voltammetry was performed for each of the four polymers dissolved in ODCB and the results are collected in Table 1. The difference between the onsets of the oxidation and reduction potentials (Ecvg = Eoxonset − Eredonset) is virtually identical to the optical band gap (Eg) determined in solution (Table 1). The influence of the type and strength of electron acceptor used in the polymer is clearly reflected in the cyclic voltammetry data, shown in Table 1. PTBOT and PTBEHT, which differ only in the nature of the alkyl side chains, possess nearly identical oxidation and reduction potentials. The slightly lower oxidation and higher reduction potentials for PTBEHT are probably in part due to a higher Mw, resulting in longer conjugation lengths and thus a lower band gap. In addition, the better solubility of PTBEHT might also play an important role. It was suggested by Guay et al.,32 who performed electrochemical studies of polymers in good solvent, that the dissolved and highly flexible chains obtained a more planar conformation in the vicinity of the electrode.33
Interchanging the thienopyrazine unit with a bisquinoxaline electron acceptor has a pronounced effect on the positions of the energy levels. The reduction potential of PTBEHBQ is considerably lower than that for PTBEHT, because the bisquinoxaline unit is a stronger electron acceptor. The lower reduction potential of PTBEHBQ is, however, accompanied by a higher oxidation potential. For PTBEHBQ two effects contribute to this increase. First, the thienopyrazine unit itself has a fairly electron rich thiophene ring, while the more aromatic central phenylene ring of bisquinoxaline is less electron rich. Second, the backbone of PTBEHBQ is twisted, as was apparent from the absorption spectra, which disrupts conjugation in the HOMO and results in a higher Eox. Replacing the bulky 3,5-bis(2′-ethylhexyl)phenyl side chains by n-octyl chains significantly reduces the electron deficiency of the bisquinoxaline unit via an inductive effect and this causes the reduction potential of PTOBQ to be increased to a value close to those of PTBEHT and PTBOT. The electron releasing octyl chains also explain the lower oxidation potential of PTOBQ compared to PTBEHBQ, possibly assisted by a more planar conformation of the polymer due to the sterically less demanding octyl chains.
Photovoltaic devices
The polymers were applied in bulk heterojunction solar cells with either [60]PCBM or [70]PCBM as electron acceptor. The active layers were spin coated onto an indium tin oxide (ITO) covered glass substrate covered by a 60 nm film of PEDOT:PSS (HC Starck). After drying in air, 1 nm LiF and 100 nm Al were thermally evaporated as back electrode. Generally, spin coating the polymer/PCBM mixture in a ratio 1:4 (by wt.) from either chlorobenzene (CB), o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), or chloroform (CHCl3), with a polymer concentration of 5 mg/ml, afforded the best photovoltaic performance. Thermal annealing did not improve device performance.
The optimized solar cell efficiencies are summarized in Table 2. The best cells with PTBEHT:[60]PCBM give Voc = 0.57 V, Jsc = 4.8 mA/cm2, and a fill factor FF = 0.57 (Fig. 4a) under 110 mW/cm2 white light illumination from a tungsten-halogen lamp (the Jsc obtained from the J–V curves is an overestimate due to the spectral mismatch and relatively high intensity (110 mW/cm2) of the tungsten-halogen lamp compared to the solar spectrum). Convolution of the spectral response (SR) (Fig. 4b) with the AM1.5G spectrum afforded an estimate of Jsc(SR) = 2.9 mA/cm2 under standard solar light conditions (AM1.5G, 100 mW/cm2), providing an estimated energy conversion efficiency of η = 0.94%.34 PTBOT was designed to enhance aggregation, potentially leading to improved photovoltaic performance. However, from the J–V curves in Fig. 4a, it is immediately clear that the cells based on PTBOT have a substantially lower short circuit current of Jsc = 2.4 mA/cm2 [estimated AM1.5G Jsc(SR) = 1.3 mA/cm2]. The Voc and fill factor are comparable to those of PTBEHT, but the low current limits the power conversion efficiency to 0.46%. This large difference in Jsc is also reflected in the spectrally resolved external quantum efficiency (EQE, i.e. the number of charges collected at short circuit per incident photon), shown in Fig. 4b. Both EQEs extent to about 1 µm, but PTBEHT displays higher EQEs over the entire wavelength region, with EQEs up to 8% in the 700–900 nm range and well above 15% at 400–500nm.

 Fig. 4  (a) J–V curves of polymer:[60]PCBM solar cells under 110 mW/cm2 white light illumination. (b) Monochromatic EQE of polymer:[60]PCBM solar cells. 
The solar cells based on PTBEHBQ show a relatively high Voc of 0.72 V compared to the previous polymers. This is because the Voc is mainly determined by the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor,18,19 and the relatively low lying HOMO of PTBEHBQ enhances the open circuit voltage. However, the limiting factor for the photovoltaic performance is the low current, Jsc = 0.9 mA/cm2 [estimated AM1.5G Jsc(SR) = 0.6 mA/cm2]. Together with a FF of 0.53, the power conversion efficiency is limited to 0.24%. The poor current is also clear from the spectral response measurements (Fig. 4b). The EQE exceeds 6% in the 400–500 nm range, but remains below 2% at longer wavelengths. The lack of significant photoresponse in the 700–900 nm region can be explained by the positions of the energy levels of the polymer (donor) and the electron acceptor, [60]PCBM. A consequence of the high electron affinity of PTBEHBQ is a small offset between the LUMO of the polymer and the LUMO of PCBM. To ensure an efficient charge separation, it has been suggested a minimum LUMO(D)–LUMO(A) offset of ∼0.3–0.4 eV is required.16,17 The difference between the LUMO of PTBEHBQ and the LUMO of [60]PCBM (Eredonset = −1.07 V) is only 0.11 V, which indeed appears to be insufficient for efficient electron transfer at the donor/acceptor interface from the excited state of the polymer that has the smallest band gap of the two components. Therefore, only a small fraction of the absorbed photons are dissociated into charge carriers that can reach the electrodes under influence of the internal electric field.
PTOBQ:[60]PCBM blends show a slightly improved solar cell performance compared to PTBEHBQ:[60]PCBM. The best cells gave Voc = 0.63 V, Jsc = 1.8 mA/cm2 [estimated AM1.5G Jsc(SR) = 1.2 mA/cm2], and a fill factor FF = 0.49 (Fig. 4a) resulting in an efficiency of 0.37%. Despite a larger offset between the LUMOs of PTOBQ and [60]PCBM, the low current remains a limiting factor. In fact, throughout the series of these small band gap polymers the low currents are, in large part, responsible for the relatively low power conversion efficiencies.
Incorporating [70]PCBM into the active layer, instead of [60]PCBM, results in an increase in efficiency for all polymers (Table 2). This higher fullerene derivative has similar electronic properties compared to [60]PCBM, but a considerably higher absorption coefficient in the visible region due to its lower symmetry that causes dipole forbidden transitions to become (partly) allowed.35 The active layers were spin coated from ODCB with a polymer:[70]PCBM ratio of 1:4 for PTBOT and PTOBQ. The best performance of PTBEHT:[70]PCBM solar cells was achieved with a 1:3 ratio. The spectral responses of the polymer:[70]PCBM solar cells are shown in Fig. 5. In the 400–600 nm range, the photocurrent is enhanced, due to the additional absorption of [70]PCBM.35 At these short wavelengths the EQE exceeds 40% for PTBEHT, providing a short circuit current of Jsc(SR) = 5.9 mA/cm2. On the other hand the contribution of the polymer at long wavelength is reduced in this cell. In combination with a Voc of 0.645 V and FF = 0.38, an estimated efficiency of 1.46% is achieved. PTBOT and PTOBQ also exhibit an increased overall efficiency in a blend with [70]PCBM, to 0.61% and 0.72% respectively. No solar cells of PTBEHBQ:[70]PCBM were made because of the low lying LUMO level of the polymer. Given that the LUMO level of [70]PCBM is nearly identical to [60]PCBM,35 an inefficient electron transfer was again to be expected.

Morphology
The interpenetrating network of the donor and acceptor is of critical importance in bulk heterojunction solar cells.22–26,36 A large donor–acceptor interface is required to ensure efficient charge dissociation, while percolating pathways need to be present to allow efficient transport of the charge carriers to the electrodes. It is thus essential to control the phase behavior of the blend upon spin coating. It has been shown that the active layer morphology is influenced by compound ratio, solvent and post-production treatments such as annealing.26,37–39 In Fig. 6, the AFM height images of the polymers with [60]PCBM are shown. Similar images were recorded for the corresponding polymer:[70]PCBM blends (see ESI‡). The active layers of PTBOT and PTBEHT (Fig. 6a and b, respectively) were spin coated from CHCl3. Both blends exhibit a rather uniform and smooth film formation which suggests the absence of large features that might reduce the interface between polymer and fullerene potentially limiting device performance.22,35 Spin coating a PTOBQ:[60]PCBM mixture from ODCB resulted in even smoother and more homogeneous films (Fig. 6d), which is not uncommon when using a high boiling solvent. PTBEHBQ:[60]PCBM blends were also processed from CB, but gave very inhomogeneous films (Fig. 6c). Voids with a diameter up to 1 µm are present that extend approximately 30–50 nm into the active layer.

Conclusions
In summary, four new small band gap polymers (Fig. 1) were synthesized via Yamamoto coupling with optical band gaps ranging from 1.4 to 1.2 eV in the solid state. The relatively high oxidation potential of PTBEHBQ resulted in a Voc of 0.72 V for PTBEHBQ:[60]PCBM solar cells. The difference between its Voc and optical band gap (1.28 eV) of only 0.56 eV is one of the smallest for a working organic solar cell. However, the current densities in these cells are low and limit the overall power conversion efficiency to 0.24%. This is likely a consequence of a reduced tendency for electron transfer caused by the high electron affinity of the polymer. The octyl side chains of PTOBQ reduce the electron affinity and, hence, increase the driving force for electron transfer from the polymer to PCBM. The PTOBQ:[60]PCBM cells show a modest increase in performance. The best photovoltaic performance was obtained for thienopyrazine polymers with efficiencies up to 0.94% for PTBEHT:[60]PCBM and 1.5% for PTBEHT:[70]PCBM solar cells. The use of [70]PCBM instead of [60]PCBM increases the performance for all polymers, due to additional absorption of [70]PCBM in the visible region of the spectrum.
