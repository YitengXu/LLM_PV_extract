    , Accepted 24th December 2021First published on 24th December 2021AbstractLuminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) have been widely considered to be promising large-scale sunlight collectors for photovoltaics (PV) due to their low cost and applicability to building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). However, low quantum efficiency and small Stokes shift of luminophores often deteriorate the performance of LSCs. In this work, Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 nanoparticles (Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs) (where pr-ted is 1-propyl-1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-1-ium) with a large Stokes shift of 1.04 eV and ultra-high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 92.2% were synthesized and used as the luminophore to fabricate LSCs. At the same time, the LSCs based on carbon dots (CDs) with a high PLQY of 91.1% were prepared to construct the tandem LSCs, which could further enhance the optical conversion efficiency (ηopt) of the LSC. The as-prepared semi-transparent tandem LSCs based on Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs and CDs (dimension: 5 × 5 × 0.2 cm3) achieved ηopt of 6.40%, which is superior to that of LSCs reported previously with the same size. The as-fabricated LSCs also show a very good stability. The results indicate that these eco-friendly luminophores possess a great potential for fabricating high-performance LSCs for BIPV systems in the future.

Broader context
Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are semi-transparent windows which are able to generate electric power through light absorption. Thus, LSCs show huge promise for realizing building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of LSCs is usually low which greatly hinders their real applications. In this work, we address this challenge by combining Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 nanoparticles (Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs) (where pr-ted is 1-propyl-1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-1-ium) and carbon dots (CDs) to construct tandem LSCs with ultra-high PCE. Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 nanoparticles with an ultra-high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 92.2% and CDs with a high PLQY of 91.1% were synthesized, respectively. The two eco-friendly fluorescent nanomaterials were used as luminophores for fabrication of tandem LSCs, in which Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs were used as luminescent species to fabricate the LSC top layer, while CDs were used to prepare the LSC bottom layer. The PCE of the tandem LSCs (dimension: 5 × 5 × 0.2 cm3) based on Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs and CDs could reach 6.3%, which indicates that these eco-friendly luminophores possess a great potential for fabricating high-performance LSCs for BIPV systems in the future.

1. Introduction
Due to the world's energy shortage, solar energy, an eco-friendly and renewable energy source, is increasingly being valued and favored, which has spurred the rapid development of photovoltaic technology. Currently, the most common means of utilizing solar energy is to convert sunlight into electric power using solar cells.1 However, the simple and efficient collection of sunlight in order to reduce the cost of electricity is still a major challenge in photovoltaic power generation. As a promising light concentrating device, luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) were introduced in 1976 for optimizing conventional photovoltaic systems.2 LSCs are generally composed of optical waveguide materials and luminophores. Typically, luminophores are well dispersed in a high refractive index optical waveguide matrix or mixed with a film-forming agent and further coated on the surface of the optical waveguide. Sunlight from different incident directions can be absorbed and re-emitted at a shorter or longer wavelength by luminophores, and the vast majority of the emitted luminescence is concentrated along the optical waveguide by total internal reflection, and diffused into the photovoltaics attached at the edges of the waveguide.3–5 LSCs not only can replace some of the solar cells to reduce the cost of photovoltaic power generation, but also are suitable for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) system thanks to their great designability (color, size, shape, and transparency).4,6–8 To obtain high-efficiency LSCs, luminophores should exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), small overlap between the absorption and emission spectra, broad absorption spectra, and good stability.7,9,10
In recent years, considerable efforts have been invested in finding suitable luminophores for fabricating high-performance LSC devices. Initially, organic dyes were used as luminophores for LSCs, but their further application in LSCs was limited because of the large overlap area between their absorption and emission spectra (high reabsorption) and poor stability.5,11,12 Subsequently, heavy-metal-containing quantum dots (QDs) were developed for high-efficiency LSCs due to their high PLQY, tunable Stokes shift, and long-term photostability.4,13 However, considering the large-scale production and practical usage and disposal, environmental contamination could be a major issue for these heavy-metal-containing QDs-based LSCs. Recently, a series of eco-friendly QDs were synthesized and employed as luminophores in LSCs, such as CuInS2/ZnS,14,15 InP/ZnO,16 silicon QDs,6,17–19 carbon dots (CDs),20–24 metal nanoclusters,25–27etc. Among them, CDs exhibited tunable emission spectra, wide absorption spectra, high PLQY, good photostability, and low cost, which make them considered a promising candidate as a luminophore for LSCs.10,11,28 In 2017, Gong et al.24 first reported the fabrication of LSCs with an external optical efficiency of 4.75% by using N-doped CDs dispersed in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Very recently, Zhao et al.10 utilized CDs with large Stokes shift and high PLQY as the luminophore to prepare large-size LSCs (15 × 15 × 0.5 cm3), which exhibited an optical efficiency of 2.2%. As another type of eco-friendly phosphor, copper–iodide (Cu–I) based crystalline inorganic–organic hybrid materials have been explored for decades, which can replace traditional phosphors containing rare earth elements in solid-state-lighting applications because of their abundant raw materials, low cost, eco-friendliness, and high PLQY.29 In 2017, a new type of Cu–I based hybrid cluster, called “all-in-one” (AIO) structure, was reported, possessing high PLQY, high stability, and good solution processability compared to other structural types of Cu–I hybrid clusters.30 The AIO structured Cu–I based hybrid cluster is formed by anionic Cu–I inorganic modules with the cationic organic ligands through ionic and coordination bonds.30 Furthermore, Wang et al.31 prepared AIO structured Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 nanoparticles (NPs) by incorporating Cu–I inorganic units and 1-propyl-1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-1-ium (pr-ted) ligands into polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) ethanol solution. Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs not only exhibit high PLQY and large Stokes shift, but can also be easily dispersed in alcohol solvent and water, which has the potential to be used for the preparation of LSCs. Notably, in addition to optimizing luminophores, the rational design of the tandem structured LSCs is also an effective approach to obtain high-efficiency LSC devices.28,32,33 The advantage of tandem LSCs is that different types of fluorophores can be introduced into each LSC layer individually for matching sunlight at different wavelengths in order to efficiently utilize sunlight, thus exhibiting higher efficiency than single-layer LSC.28,32
In this work, we first demonstrate the fabrication of tandem LSCs (5 × 5 × 0.2 cm3) based on Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs and CDs with ultra-high PLQYs. For the tandem LSCs, the Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP composite was spin-coated onto the glass substrate to fabricate the LSC top layer, and the LSC bottom layer was prepared by drop-coating the CDs/PMMA mixture on the glass substrate. The tandem structured LSCs can absorb solar radiation in a wider wavelength range than the single-layer LSC. As a result, under one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2), the tandem LSCs can achieve an optical conversion efficiency (ηopt) of up to 6.40%.
2. Results and discussion
Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs can be obtained by stabilizing and dispersing Cu–I inorganic units with the polymer (PVP) and then adding pr-ted ligands for coordination reactions. As demonstrated by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. S1, ESI†), the main diffraction peaks of the obtained NPs are in general agreement with the diffraction peaks of simulated XRD patterns from the Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 single crystal, which proves the formation of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs.31 By comparing the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 pure powder, PVP and Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs (Fig. S2, ESI†), it is clear that absorption bands at 1290 cm−1 and 1648 cm−1 appear in Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs, which correspond to the stretching vibrations of C–N and CO, respectively, demonstrating the presence of PVP.31,34 Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 nanocrystals were dispersed in the PVP matrix to form Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs, which can be further observed from the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. S3, ESI†). Additionally, Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs are adhered together and have an average particle size of about 106.56 nm (Fig. 1b), as seen from the TEM image (Fig. 1a). Based on these results, PVP not only has a significant role in obtaining small-sized Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 clusters but is also involved in the formation of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs.31 The inset in Fig. 1a is the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of an individual Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 nanocrystal with the lattice fringe spacing of 0.33 nm, which corresponds to the (331) plane of the Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 crystal. The as-synthesized Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs can be easily dispersed in methanol with an ultra-high PLQY of 92.2%.

CDs were prepared via a solvothermal method using sodium citrate, urea, and barium chloride dihydrate as precursors, and toluene as the solvent. As shown in Fig. 1c, the quasi-spherical CDs are uniformly dispersed and have a diameter range of 1.5–6 nm with an average size of ∼3.18 nm (Fig. 1d). The HRTEM image (the inset in Fig. 1c) shows CDs with a lattice spacing of 0.21 nm, which corresponds to the (100) crystal plane of graphitic carbon.35 The diffraction peaks at 11.6° and 20.1° can be observed in the XRD patterns (Fig. S4, ESI†), corresponding to the (002) facet of graphene and amorphous carbon.36,37 The chemical structures of CDs were analyzed using the FTIR spectrum. The stretching vibrations of O–H/N–H (3200–3500 cm−1), CO/CN (1659 and 1634 cm−1), CC (1648 cm−1), C–N (1379 cm−1) and C–O (1261 cm−1) can be observed in the FTIR spectra, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†).38 From the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectrum (Fig. S6a, ESI†), it can be found that CDs are mainly composed of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen elements. The presence of N–H, C–OH and CO groups in the CDs was further demonstrated by high-resolution XPS (Fig. S6b–d, ESI†), which is consistent with FTIR analysis.39 The as-prepared CDs have a high PLQY of 91.1% in toluene.
Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSCs were fabricated by mixing Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs in methanol with PVP and spin-coating them onto the glass substrate. The mixture formed by mixing CDs in toluene with PMMA was drop-coated on the glass substrate to obtain CDs/PMMA based LSCs. The optical properties of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs and CDs before and after being embedded in the polymer film were investigated. As shown in Fig. 2a and c, Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs in methanol exhibited absorption in the UV wavelength range of 300–425 nm, while CDs in toluene exhibited a broad absorption spectrum covering from 300 to 550 nm. The maximum PL excitation peaks of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs and CDs were located at 360 nm and 460 nm, respectively. As a result, the absorption spectra of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs and CDs can cover the solar spectrum from 300 nm to 550 nm, which facilitates tandem LSCs to capture solar radiation more efficiently.21 The emission spectrum of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs was obtained under the excitation of 360 nm, and exhibited a maximum emission peak located at 515 nm. For CDs, the emission spectrum was obtained under the excitation of 460 nm and showed a maximum emission peak located at 548 nm. Obviously, there is very small overlap between the absorption and emission spectra of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs, which indicates low reabsorption. The Stokes shifts for Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs and CDs are 1.04 eV and 0.43 eV, respectively. After incorporating Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs and CDs into PVP polymer thin film and PMMA polymer thin film, respectively, their absorption and emission spectra hardly changed compared with the ones in solution, as shown in Fig. S7a and b (ESI†). The PL spectra of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSCs and CDs/PMMA based LSCs under different excitation wavelengths are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The fluorescence emission intensity of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP increased and then decreased with the increase of excitation wavelength from 300 nm to 420 nm, and the maximum emission intensity appeared at 360 nm, which was consistent with its excitation spectrum. With the increase of excitation wavelength, the position of emission peak for Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP LSCs did not shift, which indicates that it exhibited a typical excitation-independent emission behavior. The position of the emission peak for CDs/PMMA based LSCs did not vary with the excitation wavelength. This suggests that the CDs/PMMA based LSCs also exhibited excitation-independent fluorescence because the as-synthesized CDs have a highly homogeneous surface structure.40 Furthermore, the PL decay curves of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs and CDs before and after being encapsulated in the polymer (PVP or PMMA) were measured and fitted by two exponential functions and first-order exponential decay function, respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 2b and d. The average PL lifetimes of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs before and after being introduced into the PVP polymer thin film were 9.74 μs and 8.49 μs, respectively. The PL lifetime at the microsecond level indicates that Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs exhibit phosphorescence emission behavior, which is attributed to the radiative recombination of electrons that pass through the intersystem crossing process to reach the lowest excited triplet state with holes in the ground state.30 The lifetime of CDs/PMMA based LSCs is 8.86 ns, which is close to the lifetime of CDs in solution (8.55 ns). The very small variation of the PL lifetimes before and after polymer encapsulation indicates the optical properties of the Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs and CDs did not change significantly. Consequently, both Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs and CDs exhibited identical dynamics before and after being embedded in the polymer, indicating that the LSCs preparation process did not significantly affect the nonradiative decay rate of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs and CDs.10,28 Based on the above data, it is clear that the as-synthesized Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs and CDs are very promising as efficient luminophores for the fabrication of high-efficiency tandem LSCs.

In order to obtain the optimum performance of the tandem LSCs, PL spectra and transmittance spectra of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSCs with various concentrations of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs and CDs/PMMA based LSCs with various concentrations of CDs were investigated, respectively, as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). According to Fig. S9a (ESI†), when the concentration of CuI6(pr-ted)2 NPs increased from 75 mg mL−1 to 300 mg mL−1, the PL intensity at 515 nm of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSCs increased continuously at the excitation wavelength of 360 nm. The transmittance spectra (Fig. S9c, ESI†) showed that the Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSC exhibited a high transmittance (T > 50%) in the UV-visible range from 400 nm to 700 nm even when the concentration of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs was 300 mg mL−1. Since further increase in the concentration of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs would decrease the transmittance of the Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSCs, 300 mg mL−1 was selected and used as the optimal concentration for fabricating LSCs. For CDs/PMMA based LSCs, the fluorescence intensity at 548 nm increased and then decreased with increasing concentration from 2 mg mL−1 to 10 mg mL−1 at the excitation wavelength of 460 nm, reaching a maximum at 8 mg mL−1 (Fig. S9b, ESI†). At a higher concentration of CDs, CDs/PMMA based LSCs exhibited lower fluorescence intensity, which is mainly attributed to the aggregation-induced luminescence quenching encountered by CDs.41 CDs/PMMA based LSCs with the concentration of CDs of 8 mg mL−1 showed a transmittance greater than 60% in the UV-visible range of 400–700 nm, as shown in Fig. S9d (ESI†). The thicknesses of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP polymer thin film and CDs/PMMA polymer thin film were 10.5 μm and 85.7 μm, respectively, at the optimal concentration of luminophores (Fig. S10, ESI†).
As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the word “LSC” can be clearly seen under the Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSCs and CDs/PMMA based LSCs in an ambient environment. This indicates that Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSCs and CDs/PMMA based LSCs are semi-transparent, which is consistent with the results of the transmittance spectra. When excited at 395 nm, the concentrated green and yellow light can be clearly observed from the edges of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSCs and CDs/PMMA based LSCs, respectively (Fig. 3c–e). In addition, the calculated solar absorptions of the tandem LSCs are shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The top LSC based on Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs absorbed 4.1% of the solar energy and the bottom LSC based on CDs absorbed 8.4% of the solar energy. Overall, the tandem LSCs absorbed 12.5% of the sunlight, which is higher that of an individual LSC (10.2% of the LSC based on CDs), indicating that the tandem configuration can more efficiently absorb the sunlight. Furthermore, the PL spectra of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSCs and CDs/PMMA based LSCs as a function of the optical path were measured to evaluate the reabsorption loss of LSCs.10Fig. 3f and g show the normalized PL spectra measured at different optical paths for Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSCs and CDs/PMMA based LSCs, respectively. For Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSCs, only a very slight red shift of the PL spectrum was observed when the distance increased from 0.5 cm to 4.5 cm. For CDs/PMMA based LSCs, the PL spectra did not shift with increasing distance. The above phenomenon is due to the very small overlap between absorption and emission spectra of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs and CDs. In addition, we calculated the ηopt of LSCs with different dimensions (Fig. S12, ESI†). When the length increased from 1 cm to 100 cm, the ηopt of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSCs decreased by only 13.3% (relative to 1 cm), which is significantly lower than that of CDs/PMMA based LSCs (35.1%). The smaller reduction of the ηopt in the LSC based on Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs is attributed to the smaller overlap between the absorption and the emission spectra of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs as compared to CDs.42 Theoretically, tandem LSCs could have ηopt of 6.32% in dimensions of 100 × 100 cm2, which is higher than that of individual single-layer LSC based on Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs or CDs. This result indicates that the current proposed luminophores represent a great potential in LSCs. It is worth mentioning that the calculated ηopt is higher than the experimental value, which might be due to the following reasons: (i) the defects in the waveguide and polymer matrix may serve as the recombination centers to quench the fluorescence; (ii) the surface of the as-prepared LSC is not absolutely flat, which may induce certain scattering energy loss.

Photographs of the tandem LSCs (c), Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSCs (d) and CDs/PMMA based LSCs (e) under a 395 nm UV lamp. LSC dimensions: 5 × 5 × 0.2 cm3. Normalized PL spectra measured at different optical paths (L, the distance between the vertically illuminated spot of a certain excitation wavelength and the edge of the LSC in the detector direction) for Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSCs (λex = 360 nm) (f) and CDs/PMMA based LSCs (λex = 460 nm) (g). 
To evaluate the performance of the LSC system, a testbed was designed to measure its photovoltaic (PV) behavior. In this testbed, a crystalline-silicon (c–Si) solar cell with the extra portion covered with black tape was coupled to one edge of the LSCs to configure the LSCs-PV system.43 Under such a configuration, the PV performance of the LSCs was evaluated under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The schematic diagram of the tandem LSCs is shown in Fig. 4a. Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSC as the LSC top layer was stacked with CDs/PMMA based LSC as the LSC bottom layer to comprise the tandem LSCs (dimensions: 5 × 5 × 0.2 cm3). In addition, an air gap of 2 mm was introduced between the LSC top layer and the LSC bottom layer to prevent parasitic reabsorption.44 Before evaluating the performance of the tandem LSCs, the concepts and calculation procedures of some major PV parameters were introduced. According to the previous literature, ηopt, as an important parameter for evaluating the performance of LSCs, can be calculated using the following equation:4 (1)where PLLSC represents photoluminescence intensity at edge of the LSC, while PL is the incident excitation intensity. The geometric factor (G) is defined as the ratio of the top surface area of the LSC to the area of the edges of the LSC coupled by the solar cells. In our case, G is 6.25.

(b) Relationship of the photocurrent density and photovoltage (J–V) and ηopt of single-layer Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSC, single-layer CDs/PMMA based LSC, and the tandem LSCs. 
The power conversion efficiency (η) as another key parameter was calculated as24 (2)where Jsc refers to the short circuit current density, Voc is the open circuit voltage, FF is the fill factor, and Pin refers to the irradiation intensity (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G solar simulator).
The Jsc, Voc, FF, and η of the c–Si solar cell were first measured under one sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) and are 46 mA cm−2, 0.55 V, 72.65%, and 18.38%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b, the typical J–V characteristic curves and ηopt of single-layer Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSC, single-layer CDs/PMMA based LSC, and the tandem LSCs are shown, and more detailed values of the PV parameters are listed in the Table S1 (ESI†). The ηopt and η of a single-layer Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSC are 3.60% and 3.59%, respectively while a single-layer CDs/PMMA based LSC exhibits an ηopt and η of 2.88% and 2.82%, respectively. When the tandem structure is used, the tandem LSCs exhibit a higher current density compared to the single-layer Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSC and single-layer CDs/PMMA based LSC, as shown in Fig. 4b. As a result, the tandem LSCs reach an ηopt of up to 6.40% and η of up to 6.29%, respectively, which are relatively higher than the results of other similar studies (Table S2, ESI†). The high efficiency of the tandem LSCs in this study is mainly attributed to the following reasons: (1) two emitters responding to different wavelength bands are used to fully utilize the sunlight; (2) Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs and CDs exhibit high PLQYs and small overlap area between absorption and emission spectra to reduce the reabsorption loss.
Furthermore, the stability of the tandem LSCs was investigated by measuring the η of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSCs and CDs/PMMA based LSCs within 14 days in ambient conditions (under natural sunlight irradiation in Wuhan, China; the average daily light intensity: ∼64 mW cm−2; the average daily illumination time: ∼10.5 hours). As shown in Fig. 5a, after two weeks, the η of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSCs and CDs/PMMA based LSCs remained essentially unchanged, indicating the good stability of the as-prepared tandem LSCs. We also monitored the PL spectra of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSCs and CDs/PMMA based LSCs at temperatures ranging from 253 K to 343 K, as presented in Fig. 5b and c. As the temperature increases from 253 K to 343 K, the PL position and shape of the emission peaks exhibited little change for Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSCs and CDs/PMMA based LSCs. When the temperature is below 298 K, compared to that at 298 K, the PL intensity increases (proportional to the integrated PL area) for Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSCs, while for the CDs/PMMA based LSCs the integrated PL area is almost constant (Fig. 5d). When the temperature increases from 298 K to 343 K, the integrated PL area of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs/PVP based LSCs can maintain 64% of the value at 298 K, while the integrated PL area of CDs/PMMA based LSCs can maintain 92% of the value at 298 K. These results show that the tandem LSCs based on Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs and CDs can operate properly at the actual operating temperature.

3. Conclusions
In summary, novel tandem LSCs (5 × 5 × 0.2 cm−3) based on two types of eco-friendly luminophores with ultra-high PLQY were designed. For the LSC top layer, Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs were used as the luminescent species because of their high absorption of the ultraviolet light, high quantum efficiency and small overlap area between absorption and emission spectra. For the LSC bottom layer, CDs were used to prepare LSC due to their tunable absorption and emission spectra, easy preparation and low toxicity. Under sunlight illumination (100 mW cm−2), the ηopt of the tandem LSCs based on Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs and CDs could reach 6.40%. This result suggests that Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs and CDs are promising for the fabrication of high-efficiency tandem LSCs. Additionally, based on the ultra-high PLQY and large Stokes shift of Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs and CDs, there is promising potential to further prepare large-area and high-efficiency tandem LSCs by optimization of the fabrication process in the future.

Broader context
Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are semi-transparent windows which are able to generate electric power through light absorption. Thus, LSCs show huge promise for realizing building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of LSCs is usually low which greatly hinders their real applications. In this work, we address this challenge by combining Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 nanoparticles (Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs) (where pr-ted is 1-propyl-1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-1-ium) and carbon dots (CDs) to construct tandem LSCs with ultra-high PCE. Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 nanoparticles with an ultra-high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 92.2% and CDs with a high PLQY of 91.1% were synthesized, respectively. The two eco-friendly fluorescent nanomaterials were used as luminophores for fabrication of tandem LSCs, in which Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs were used as luminescent species to fabricate the LSC top layer, while CDs were used to prepare the LSC bottom layer. The PCE of the tandem LSCs (dimension: 5 × 5 × 0.2 cm3) based on Cu4I6(pr-ted)2 NPs and CDs could reach 6.3%, which indicates that these eco-friendly luminophores possess a great potential for fabricating high-performance LSCs for BIPV systems in the future.
