    , Accepted 27th March 2019First published on 28th March 2019AbstractHeterojunction solar cells with transition-metal–oxide-based carrier-selective contacts have been gaining considerable research interest owing to their amenability to low-cost fabrication methods and elimination of parasitic absorption and complex semiconductor doping process. In this work, we propose tantalum oxide (Ta2O5) as a novel electron-selective contact layer for photo-generated carrier separation in InP solar cells. We confirm the electron-selective properties of Ta2O5 by investigating band energetics at the InP–Ta2O5 interface using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Time-resolved photoluminescence and power dependent photoluminescence reveal that the Ta2O5 inter-layer also mitigates parasitic recombination at the InP/transparent conducting oxide interface. With an 8 nm Ta2O5 layer deposited using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) system, we demonstrate a planar InP solar cell with an open circuit voltage, Voc, of 822 mV, a short circuit current density, Jsc, of 30.1 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 0.77, resulting in an overall device efficiency of 19.1%. The Voc is the highest reported value to date for an InP heterojunction solar cells with carrier-selective contacts. The proposed Ta2O5 material may be of interest not only for other solar cell architectures including perovskite cells and organic solar cells, but also across a wide range of optoelectronics applications including solid state emitting devices, photonic crystals, planar light wave circuits etc.
Introduction
The direct conversion of sunlight into electricity makes solar cells one of the most promising renewable energy technologies as solar energy is an abundant, inexhaustible clean-energy resource. III–V semiconductors are considered ideal candidates for high efficiency solar cells owing to their direct band gaps, high optical absorption, longer minority carrier lifetimes and high mobilities. Among III–V compounds, InP and GaAs possess optimal band gaps for high efficiency single junction solar cells.1,2 So far, the best reported efficiencies for homojunction GaAs and InP solar cells are 28.8 ± 0.9%2,3 and 22.1 ± 0.7%2,4,5 respectively, making GaAs the highest efficiency single junction solar cell to date. Despite achieving high efficiencies, III–V solar cells are still limited to non-terrestrial applications due to the scarcity of materials and very high costs involved in device processing. At present, considerable research is devoted to the reduction of device costs while maintaining high efficiencies. This can be achieved through the development of cost-effective materials and the use of low-cost processing such as non-epitaxial thin films6 and epitaxial lift-off processes.7–9 Heterojunction device architectures with carrier-selective contacts hold the key to realising high efficiency photovoltaics via simple and cost-effective approaches.10,11
The two basic mechanisms that constitute the operation of a solar cell are: (i) electron–hole pair generation in a semiconductor by the absorption of photons and (ii) separation and extraction of photo-generated carriers to generate a current in the external circuit. In order to achieve the limiting solar cell efficiency for a given absorber, predicted by Shockley and Queisser12 using thermodynamic considerations, the absorption in the semiconductor, and therefore electron–hole pair generation needs to be maximized and the photo-generated carriers need to be extracted at the quasi-Fermi levels. In inorganic solar cells (Si and III–Vs), the photo-generated electrons and holes are conventionally swept away to different regions of the solar cell by creating electric field gradients inside the semiconductor by selectively introducing p- and n-type dopants to form a p-n junction.13 p–n junctions, however, do not extract photo-generated carriers at the quasi-Fermi levels, resulting in lower than predicted open-circuit voltages in solar cells. Further, the heavy doping of semiconductors to increase conductivity causes an increase in non-radiative recombination, a decrease in carrier mobility, a decrease in contact selectivity, and an increase in minority carrier conductivity due to parasitic absorption, all of which are detrimental to the solar cell performance.14–18 Developing electron and hole-selective contacts or electron-transparent, hole-blocking and electron-blocking, hole-transparent layers may enable photo-generated carrier extraction from solar cells at the quasi-Fermi levels.19,20 The electron (hole) selective layer should have a band alignment with the absorber semiconductor such that there is no impediment to electron (hole) transfer into the selective layer, but a large valence (conduction) band offset that reflects holes (electrons).13,21,22 Carrier-selective layers with large band gap may offer additional advantages in terms of surface passivation and reduced parasitic absorption within the heterocontacts.
Development of electron-selective and hole-selective contacts will enable the realisation of p–n junction-less solar cells. This concept is relatively new in the context of inorganic (Si and III–V) solar cells. However, organic solar cells, perovskite solar cells and dye sensitized solar cells have always used this approach for photo-generated carrier extraction at the contacts. Recently, there are an increasing number of reports investigating carrier-selective contacts for inorganic solar cells.21–33 NiO, WOx, MoOx, and CrOx have been studied as hole-selective, electron-blocking layers for Si23,26,27,34–39 and GaAs35 absorbers. TiO2, TaOx and TaNx have been investigated as electron-selective, hole-blocking layers for Si30–33,38,40 and InP10,28 absorbers. Battaglia et al.22 observed reduced parasitic absorption for Si solar cells featuring MoOx as a hole-selective contact, which resulted in an increased photocurrent density. Wan et al.30,31 reported power conversion efficiencies exceeding 20% for crystalline silicon solar cells by employing magnesium oxide (MgOx) and magnesium fluoride (MgFx) as electron-selective contacts. Most recently, Yang et al.32 demonstrated over 20% power conversion efficiency for n-type c-Si solar cells using tantalum nitride (TaNx) as an electron-selective contact. The significant improvement in the open-circuit voltage and fill factor due to improved passivation and reduced contact resistivity contributed to the improved power-conversion efficiency of the solar cells. Despite several reports on silicon solar cells with carrier-selective contacts, to the best of our knowledge very limited work has been reported on InP heterojunction solar cells with carrier-selective contacts. So far, Yin et al.10 has demonstrated the highest ever reported power conversion efficiency of 19.2% for InP heterojunction solar cells with TiO2 as an electron-selective contact. They further investigated the influence of the material quality of TiO2 on solar cell performance and found that 10 nm of TiO2 in the amorphous phase is optimal to achieve a maximum open-circuit voltage of 780 mV.
In this manuscript, we propose and demonstrate Ta2O5 as an efficient electron-selective, hole blocking layer for InP solar cells. Ta2O5 is an extremely potent and stable material that has been used in anti-reflection coatings, multi-layer interference filters and DRAM capacitors,41–43 owing to its large refractive index and dielectric constant. Ta2O5 is also transparent to incident solar radiation due to its large band gap.44–46 It has been shown that Ta2O5 has good electron conductivity due to defects that can be controlled via doping.46 These properties make Ta2O5 a potential candidate material for electron-selective contacts for inorganic solar cells. Very recently, TaOx has been reported as a passivating electron-selective contact for Si solar cells.47 However, TaOx films were subjected to a hydrogenation process before being employed as electron-selective passivation contacts which resulted in sub-stoichiometric TaOx films. Herein, we report for the first time stoichiometric Ta2O5, using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) system, as an electron-selective contact by demonstrating an InP heterojunction solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 19.1%, representing 9.4% absolute enhancement over the reference cell without a Ta2O5 layer.
Results and discussion
To investigate the stoichiometry and understand the behavior of Ta2O5 as an electron-selective layer for photo-generated carriers in InP, we performed XPS and UPS measurements on ALD-deposited Ta2O5 on InP. Calibration of XPS and UPS was carried out using a silver (Ag) reference before performing the measurements. Fig. 1(a) illustrates the Ta 4f core level XPS spectrum of Ta2O5 measured using 1486.68 eV monochromatic Al Kα photons. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the 4f core level spectrum is split into a spin–orbit doublet of Ta 4f7/2 and Ta 4f5/2, corresponding to the Ta5+ valence state. These Ta 4f7/2 and Ta 4f5/2 peaks originate at a binding energy of 26.7 and 28.6 eV respectively, with a separation of 1.9 eV. We were able to fit the experimental spectrum using two Gaussian components. No noticeable peaks relating to the Ta+, Ta2+, Ta3+/4+ valence states are observed in the Ta 4f core level spectrum towards lower binding energies (<26.7 eV). These Ta 4f core level spectrum results are in reasonable agreement with the literature48,49 for Ta2O5 stoichiometry, indicating that our TaOx films have the same stoichiometry. Fig. 1(b) shows the XPS core level spectrum of O 1s, which is fitted with two Gaussian components centered at 530.9 and 531.8 eV. The small peak located at 531.8 eV is usually attributed to surface contamination.50 The peak located at the lower binding energy of 530.9 eV is ascribed to Ta–O binding in TaOx films.49 The ratio of areas under the O 1s and Ta 4f core level spectra results in an O to Ta atomic fraction of ∼2.51. This further confirms that our ALD-deposited TaOx has Ta2O5 stoichiometry.

Fig. 1(c) and (d) show the XPS valence band spectra of Ta2O5 and InP respectively. The position of the valence band maximum is extracted by linear extrapolation of the valence band spectrum, while the Fermi level (EF) is located at 0 eV binding energy. As shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d), linear extrapolation fixes the valence band maxima (VBM) of Ta2O5 and InP at 3.36 and 0.69 eV below EF respectively. The work function of these materials was determined from UPS spectra using the expression Work function (Φ) = hν − (Ecut-off − EF).(1)where hν is the energy of the He–I source (21.2 eV), Ecut-off is the cut-off of the tail at the higher binding energy end of the UPS spectrum and EF is the Fermi energy, which is located at 0 eV. Fig. 1(e) shows the UPS spectra of both Ta2O5 and InP, from which the work functions of Ta2O5 and InP are determined to be same (∼5.1 eV), which means that EF is placed at 5.1 eV below the vacuum level for both materials. The conduction band minimum (CBM) of Ta2O5 deduced from the work function, band gap and position of the VBM below the Fermi level falls at 4.56 eV below the vacuum level. We have used the literature-reported band gap of 3.9 eV (ref. 44 and 45) in determining the CBM of Ta2O5. The information on the Fermi level position below the vacuum level and the VBM below the Fermi level fixes the VBM of Ta2O5 at 8.46 eV below the vacuum level. A similar analysis for InP yields the VBM located at 5.79 eV and CBM at 4.44 eV below the vacuum level.

Fig. 1(f) shows a schematic of the band alignment at the InP–Ta2O5 interface calculated using the XPS and UPS data shown in Fig. 1(c–e). The Fermi levels in InP and Ta2O5 are aligned at equilibrium, resulting in a conduction band offset ΔECB = [(ECB)InP − (ECB)Ta2O5] of 0.12 eV and a valence band offset ΔEVB = [(EVB)InP − (EVB)Ta2O5] of 2.67 eV. The conduction band offset favours the transfer of photo-generated electrons in the InP absorber to the Ta2O5 layer. The ΔECB is sufficiently larger than the thermal energy of electrons at room temperature to prevent electron transfer back into the InP layer. The large valence band offset of 2.67 eV at the interface prevents or blocks the photo-generated holes from transferring to the Ta2O5 layer. Hence the InP–Ta2O5 interface should act as an efficient electron-selective, hole-blocking layer for photo-generated carriers in InP.

Fig. 2(a) shows a schematic of the simple device structure of the InP solar cell with a Ta2O5 carrier-selective layer, while Fig. 2(b) shows a cross-sectional high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image of the ITO–Ta2O5–InP interfaces. TEM analysis shows that the ALD-deposited Ta2O5 layer is amorphous in nature and forms a sharp interface with InP, with an average thickness of ∼8 nm. EDS maps of the cross-section of the ITO–Ta2O5–InP interface confirm the presence of uniform Ta2O5 in the device (as shown in the ESI (Fig. s2†)).

Fig. 2(c) shows the J–V (current density vs. voltage) characteristics for a reference InP solar cell (InP–ITO) and an InP solar cell with Ta2O5 carrier-selective layer. With the Ta2O5 electron-transparent, hole-blocking layer, the solar cell exhibits higher Voc, Jsc, fill factor and efficiency compared to the reference solar cell. The Voc is increased by 12.4%, from 731 to 822 mV and the Jsc is increased by 43%, from 21.02 to 30.1 mA cm−2. The Voc for the InP–Ta2O5 solar cell is the highest reported value for a heterojunction InP solar cell and is only 6% lower than the highest reported value for a single junction (p–n junction) InP solar cell.5 The fill factor for the InP–Ta2O5 solar cell is 0.77, resulting in an overall device efficiency of 19.1%. The device area for the solar cells reported in this work (1 cm2) is 4 times larger than the device area for the InP–TiO2 heterojunction solar cells (0.25 cm2) recently reported by Yin et al.10 Despite this, the InP–Ta2O5 solar cell efficiency is comparable to the efficiency of the InP–TiO2 heterojunction solar cell (19.2%). Table 1 lists and compares the Voc, Jsc, fill factor and efficiency of the InP–Ta2O5 carrier-selective solar cell with a reference solar cell, InP–TiO2,10 InP–CdS11,51 heterojunction and InP p–n homojunction5 solar cells.

Fig. 2(d) shows the reflectance (R) spectra, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) data for the reference solar cell and the solar cell with a Ta2O5 carrier-selective layer for the wavelength range 400–1000 nm. The IQE data is calculated from the experimentally measured EQE and reflectance spectra using the relation . The maximum short circuit current density for an ideal solar cell assuming 100% absorption of above band gap energy solar radiation in this wavelength range (Jsc-ideal) calculated using  is 34.54 mA cm−2. The reflectance spectra are for the final devices with ITO and Ag fingers for the top contact. The reflectance spectra for both devices are very similar, suggesting that the differences in device characteristics shown in Fig. 2(c) are a consequence of the electronic properties of the device. The maximum Jsc calculated from the reflectance spectra for both solar cells is ∼32.8 mA cm−2. A short circuit current density of ∼1.74 mA cm−2 or 5% of the ideal Jsc-ideal is lost due to reflection losses from the front contact. The Jsccalculated from the experimentally determined EQE spectra shown in Fig. 2(d) match closely with the Jsc values measured from J–V characteristics with less than 3% error for the reference and the InP–Ta2O5 solar cells.
Photoluminescence (PL) studies were carried out to understand the solar cell performance. Fig. 3 compares the PL emission characteristics of InP–ITO and InP–Ta2O5–ITO samples. The InP–Ta2O5–ITO sample consistently shows higher PL intensity compared to the InP–ITO sample at all excitation powers (Fig. 3(a)). The time-resolved PL curves for the two samples are shown in Fig. 3(b). The minority carrier lifetimes extracted for the InP–ITO and InP–Ta2O5–ITO samples from the time resolved PL data are 138 ps and 494 ps, respectively. The larger emission intensity and longer minority carrier lifetime for the InP/Ta2O5/ITO sample indicates reduced non-radiative recombination processes at the InP/ITO interface due to the presence of the Ta2O5 layer. The reduced parasitic recombination at the InP surface leads to a ∼9 mA cm−2 gain in the Jsc of the solar cell (Fig. 2(c)). PL images of the InP–ITO (reference sample) and the InP–Ta2O5–ITO sample are shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d) respectively. The PL images are taken for the solar cells fabricated from the InP–ITO and InP–Ta2O5–ITO samples. The front contact fingers can be seen in the images. As expected from the reduced recombination at the InP–ITO interface due to the presence of the Ta2O5 interlayer (and hence longer minority carrier lifetime in the InP–Ta2O5–ITO sample), the InP–Ta2O5–ITO sample is brighter compared to the reference sample. Reduced parasitic carrier recombination at the InP–ITO interface in the InP–Ta2O5–ITO sample compared to the reference sample should lead to a higher Voc, as is observed experimentally (Fig. 2(c)).

The PL results are further used to explain the low IQE of the reference solar cell in the short wavelength region (IQE < 0.6 for λ < 500 nm) as shown in Fig. 2(d). The IQE increases from 0.28 at 400 nm to 0.77 at 860 nm. From Fig. s3† in the ESI, the PL intensity and minority carrier lifetime of InP is observed to drop drastically after ITO deposition compared to bare InP. This indicates that ITO deposition caused surface damage to the InP surface. As a result, our reference solar cell exhibits a poor IQE response in the short wavelength region. This is because short wavelength incident light has a very shallow absorption depth (∼20 nm for incident wavelength of 400 nm) and extensive surface damage leads to inefficient collection of carriers generated by the absorption of short wavelength light. However, the PL intensity of InP after ITO deposition recovers significantly when Ta2O5 is introduced in between InP and ITO, as shown in Fig. s3† in ESI. This indicates that Ta2O5 acts as a protection layer in addition to being a carrier separation layer. As a consequence, the InP–Ta2O5 solar cell exhibits larger gains in the IQE at short wavelengths than in the long wavelength region compared to the reference solar cell. The IQE increases from 0.28 to 0.76 at 400 nm, 0.74 to 0.95 at 600 nm and 0.77 to 0.94 at 860 nm. This corresponds to an increase of 171% at 400 nm, 28% at 600 nm and 22% at 860 nm. A large increase in the short wavelength response of the solar cell is due to the reduction of surface damage and efficient carrier separation closer to the InP surface where most short wavelength light is absorbed, due to the presence of the Ta2O5 carrier-selective layer.

Fig. 4 shows the variation of the InP–Ta2O5 solar cell performance characteristics (Jsc, Voc, FF and efficiency) with the thickness of the Ta2O5 layer. The characteristic parameters for the reference solar cell are also shown (i.e. at a thickness of 0 nm). The Jsc, Voc, FF and efficiency of the solar cell first increase with the thickness of the Ta2O5 layer and then decrease beyond a thickness of 8 nm. The reverse saturation current densities, Jo extracted from the dark J–V data (please see Fig. s4 in ESI†) for the InP–ITO solar cell, InP-5 nm Ta2O5 solar cell and InP-8 nm Ta2O5 are 37 μA cm−2, 60 nA cm−2 and 0.1 nA cm−2, respectively. The reverse saturation current density decreases with increasing thickness of the Ta2O5 layer, indicating that a thicker Ta2O5 layer acts as a better barrier against InP surface damage due to ITO deposition. However, thick Ta2O5 layers also exhibit increased resistance to electron flow to the metal contact. The series resistance Rs of the solar cell increases from 3 Ω cm2 for 8 nm of Ta2O5 to 67 Ω cm2 for 12 nm of Ta2O5. Hence there exists an optimal thickness of ∼8 nm for the Ta2O5 layer to maximize the efficiency of the solar cell. However, doping the Ta2O5 layer to increase its electron conductivity46 may alleviate the issue of increasing Rs and result in better performance for thicker Ta2O5 layers.

Experimental details
For solar cell fabrication, 2 μm thick undoped InP epitaxial films were grown using metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on p-doped (Zn: 3–5 × 1018 cm−3) InP single side polished wafers. The ohmic back contacts to the InP wafers were made by DC sputtering of 20/100 nm Zn/Au films followed by annealing in H2 + N2 (5% H2) gas at 400 °C for 40 min. Before depositing the back contact film, the native oxide layer on InP wafer was removed by dipping it in diluted HCl (6 to 7%) for one minute. A Ta2O5 layer was then deposited on the front side of the wafer using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) system. Tantalum ethoxide maintained at 195 °C and H2O at 25 °C were used as tantalum and oxygen precursors, respectively, while the temperature of the deposition chamber was maintained at 225 °C. Ellipsometry (JA Woollam M-2000D) was used to calibrate the thickness of the Ta2O5 films. In the next step, indium tin oxide (ITO) was deposited at room temperature using RF magnetron sputtering. The thickness of the ITO was adjusted so that the total thickness of the Ta2O5 and ITO was maintained at a constant value of 70 nm to minimize reflections from the solar cell surface in the visible region of the solar spectrum. Front contacts were fabricated using photolithography followed by a metal lift-off process on a 200 nm e-beam evaporated silver (Ag) layer. This process created a Ag grid on top of the ITO with a fringe width of 11 μm and a spacing of 490 μm. The area of the solar cell including the outer edge bus bar of the Ag grid was 1 cm × 1 cm. A schematic of the processing steps involved in the solar cell fabrication is shown in ESI (Fig. s1†). A reference solar cell without the Ta2O5 layer was also fabricated following the above processing steps.
A PerkinElmer Lambda 1050 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer was used for reflectance and transmission measurements of the solar cells. The photovoltaic performance of the solar cells was investigated under simulated one sun illumination using a Newport solar simulator equipped with an AM1.5G filter. The solar simulator power was calibrated against a commercial solar cell using their J–V measurements. A QE measurement system from Protoflex Corporation (QE-1400-03) was employed to study the quantum efficiency of the solar cells.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out using a JEOL 2100F instrument operated at 200 keV for structural characterization and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of the Ta2O5 layer used in the solar cells. A focused ion beam (FEI Helios 600 NanoLab) was used for the preparation of the cross sectional TEM lamella of the solar cell by using a Ga beam and an in situ lift-out process. Prior to the sample preparation, a layer of Pt was deposited on top of the solar cell using a FEI Helios 600 NanoLab ion beam deposition system to avoid any damage to the device layers from Ga ion milling.
A Thermo ESCALAB250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) with a monochromatic Al K-alpha X-ray source was employed for stochiometric analysis and measurements of the valence band spectra of Ta2O5 and InP. This equipment was operated in ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) mode, using helium I (21.2 eV) as the UV source, to measure the work function of Ta2O5 and InP.
Power dependent photoluminescence and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements of InP and InP–Ta2O5 samples were carried out at room temperature using a 522 nm wavelength pulsed laser excitation, which was generated by a BBO crystal through frequency doubling of an Yb:YAG laser. The excitation pulse had a duration of 300 fs and a repetition rate of 20.8 MHz. The laser beam was focused on the sample through a 100× (NA 0.75) microscope objective lens and the emitted light from the sample was also collected by the same lens. For lifetime measurements, the collected light from the objective lens was transferred to a single photon avalanche diode, which was connected to a Picoharp 300 time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) system.
Conclusions
In summary, our work establishes stoichiometric Ta2O5 as a promising carrier-selective (electron-transparent, hole-blocking) layer for InP heterojunction solar cells. We calculated the conduction band offset and valence band offset at the InP–Ta2O5 interface to be 0.12 and 2.67 eV respectively using XPS and UPS measurements. The favourable band offsets enable efficient separation of photo-generated electrons and holes into the Ta2O5 and InP layers respectively at the InP–Ta2O5 interface. Using an ALD-deposited ultra-thin Ta2O5 layer, we demonstrated an efficiency of 19.1% in a planar InP solar cell with the highest ever reported open circuit voltage, Voc, of 822 mV for an InP heterojunction solar cell with carrier-selective contacts. This work paves way for the development of novel solar cell architectures using Ta2O5 electron-selective contacts that have the potential to achieve very high efficiencies. The ultrathin Ta2O5 films may also attract attention in photoelectrochemical applications and interfacial engineering.
