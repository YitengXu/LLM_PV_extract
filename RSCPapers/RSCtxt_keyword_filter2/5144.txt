Stearic acid as a coadsorbent, which has a low dipole moment and high solubility, retarded the rate of dye adsorption during the competitive anchoring process on the TiO2 layer in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), thereby increasing the content of strongly bound dye on the TiO2 surface. This resulted in an approximately 25% improvement in both JSC and the power conversion efficiency of the DSCs, even for much lower dye coverage.
In both academia and industry, tremendous effort has been devoted to improving the power conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) to exploit their high efficiency and low production costs.1–4 The efficiency of a DSC is determined by the short circuit current density (JSC), the open circuit voltage (VOC), and the fill factor (FF). These key parameters are strongly governed by the characteristics of the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, at which many electrochemical reactions occur.5 Modifications of the interfacial properties, particularly by introduction of coadsorbents, can alter the conduction band edge and shield the trap states of TiO2, thereby influencing VOC, JSC, and the recombination reaction of the photoinduced electrons with any oxidized species.4,6–8 Some electronic levels (e.g., the Fermi level, EF) are at energies below the conduction band (ECB) edge due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Ti species at the surface of the TiO2 layer.9 The negative shift in the Fermi level, for instance, introduced by 4-guanidinobutyric acid (GBA)5,9 or chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA),10 was shown to increase the energy gap (VOC) between the potential of the redox couple and the Fermi level (Fig. 1).

In contrast, 3-phenylpropionic acid (PPA)2,11 passivates the surface of TiO2, thereby decreasing the recombination reaction and improving the charge collection efficiency. In addition, coadsorbents, such as deoxycholic acid (DCA)3 and CDCA,4,12 reduce the aggregation of dyes, thereby enhancing the light harvesting efficiency. These results suggest that the nature of the coadsorbents anchored on the TiO2 surface influences the electronic state and passivates the surface to differing degrees. Furthermore, a competitive anchoring process plays an important role in organizing and orienting dye adsorption on TiO2 surfaces.12 A closer look at the properties of adsorbents in the context of competitive anchoring is warranted to gain an understanding of the roles of coadsorbents in achieving high-efficiency DSCs.
Here, we report that dye sensitization on TiO2 surfaces may be controlled by the presence of coadsorbents. The coadsorbents increased the amount of strongly bound relative to weakly bound dye molecules to yield improved JSC and power conversion efficiencies in the devices. As shown in Fig. 2, we selected three coadsorbents (GBA, PPA, and stearic acid (SA)) with different dipole moments (debye: D), solubilities, and end group functionalities to investigate the competitive anchoring process as a function of coadsorbent. The solubility of GBA (20.5 D) measured in this study was found to be less than 0.15 mM13 in a mixture of acetonitrile (AN) and tert-butanol (1∶1 v/v) at ambient temperatures, much lower than that of N719 (0.3 mM). SA (1.80 D) and PPA (1.65 D) showed high solubilities in solution. A nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode 8 μm thick was immersed in an N719 (0.3 mM) solution or a solution containing N719 and GBA, PPA, or SA (at a series of coadsorbent concentrations of 0.3, 1.5, or 3.0 mM) at room temperature for 18 h to produce, respectively, the device-G, device-P, and device-S series.

Fig. 2 shows the relative UV-Vis absorption intensities of N719 detached from the TiO2 electrodes in the presence of 0.1 M KOH. GBA and PPA at concentrations of 0.3 mM yielded absorption intensities of 97% and 91%, respectively; these values decreased slightly as the concentration of coadsorbent was increased by a factor of 10 (to 3.0 mM) (Table 1). Meanwhile, the absorption intensity of N719 dramatically decreased when SA was used as a coadsorbent. The intensity was ca. 58% at the same molar ratio of SA to dye (0.3 mM). This intensity reached 15% at a concentration 10 times higher (3.0 mM). These results suggest that the anchoring process is highly competitive between dyes and coadsorbents10 and that SA effectively retards the rate of dye adsorption during the anchoring process.

The photovoltaic performances of the devices were measured under AM 1.5 solar conditions to measure the effect of the coadsorbents on JSC and VOC (Table 1 and Fig. 3). The device-G series with a larger dipole moment yielded higher values of VOC (40–60 mV) with slightly improved values of JSC compared with those of the control device, due to the reduced driving force for the electron injection (ΔGinj, see Fig. 1).9 Meanwhile, the device-P and device-S series, with hydrophobic end groups, yielded slight decreases in VOC (10–20 mV) and improved JSC. In particular, device-S(0.3), with 58% of N719 coverage, showed a 25% improvement in JSC (14.2 mA cm−2) relative to the control device (11.4 mA cm−2). Further increases in SA content (1.5 mM), such that the N719 coverage on the TiO2 surface was 27%, yielded a JSC value (12.8 mA cm−2) that was slightly lower, yet still larger than that of the control device. More surprisingly, the device with only 15% dye coverage (device-S(3.0)) yielded a JSC of 10.6 mA cm−2 (see Fig. S2 and Table S1 in ESI† for devices performance obtained from a more wide range of SA concentrations).

Fig. 4 shows the normalized attenuated total reflectance FTIR (ATR-FTIR) spectra of highly porous TiO2 electrodes sensitized by N719 and SA in the range 1000–1800 cm−1. This range was used to compare the relative amounts of carboxylic acid and carboxylate groups because the intensity of the carboxylic acid may be ascribed to dyes attached to the TiO2 surface by a single carboxyl group, by one carboxylic acid and one carboxylate group, or both.14,15 The signal at 1377 cm−1 was assigned to the symmetric stretching mode of the carboxylate groups anchored to the surface of the TiO2, and the peak feature at 1730 cm−1 was attributed to the free carboxylic acid of N719.14,15 Therefore, the intensity at 1730 cm−1 relative to that at 1377 cm−1 indicates the relative amounts of weakly and strongly bound dye molecules on the TiO2 surface. The amount of weakly bound N719 decreased dramatically in the TiO2 electrode films prepared from the N719 solution with SA, but not in the PPA or GBA systems (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†). This finding indicates that anchoring of N719 on the TiO2 electrode surface was enhanced in the competitive process.10 This result provides an explanation for the dramatically improved JSC in device-S(0.3), even though the N719 content was lower.

The signals at 1377 cm−1 and 1730 cm−1 were assigned to the symmetric stretching modes of, respectively, the carboxylate groups (red circles) of N719 anchored to the TiO2 surface and the free carboxylic acid groups (blue circles) of N719. 
To investigate the change in the trap state induced by the coadsorbents and to reveal the change in VOC, cyclic voltammetry was performed on each TiO2 electrode sensitized with N719 or N719 and the coadsorbents together with 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (BMIB)2 (see Fig. S4 in the ESI†). The capacitive currents of the electrodes displayed gradual onsets under a forward bias. As shown in Fig. 5, the onset was around −0.74 V (vs. FOC) for the bare TiO2 electrode having a direct contact with the electrolyte, whereas the TiO2 electrode covered with N719 or N719 and the coadsorbents together displayed onsets in the range −0.79 to −0.85 V. This observation indicates that N719 or the coadsorbents passivated the bare TiO2 electrode surface, and the edge of the TiO2 conduction band moved to lower values toward the vacuum level. The TiO2 electrode covered with GBA having a larger dipole moment exhibited a slightly more negative onset shift than was observed for the electrodes prepared in the presence of PPA or SA, which yielded onsets that were nearly identical to those obtained for the TiO2 electrode sensitized with N719 only.

Fig. 6(a) and (b) show the recombination resistance and electron lifetimes of devices in the dark using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with fits to an equivalent circuit. All EIS results were fit to the transmission line model, which has been discussed in detail in the literature.16 Apparently, the recombination resistances (Ω) of the device-G(0.3) series were greater and their electron lifetimes (τe) were longer than those of the control and other devices. This occurred despite the increased driving force (ΔGrec in Fig. 1) between the TiO2 band edge and the redox species due to the negative shift in the band edge. This result suggests that GBA on the TiO2 surfaces of electrodes may effectively protect the approaching I3−, possibly due to secondary interactions between the guanidinium end groups and tBP. No great differences were observed for device-P(0.3) and device-S(0.3) in terms of their recombination resistances compared with the control, especially in the vicinity of VOC. This indicates that the passivation effects of PPA and SA on the approaching I3− are not as large as those of GBA, probably due to the absence of secondary interactions with tBP. In turn, the secondary interactions of the coadsorbents with tBP probably play an important role in improving VOC.

In summary, we have shown that the nature of the coadsorbent end groups anchored to the TiO2 surface strongly influences the interfacial properties of DSCs. Additionally, coadsorbent sensitization of nanoporous TiO2 films plays an important role in organizing and orienting the adsorbed dyes. The SA coadsorbent retards the rate of dye adsorption via a competitive anchoring process, thereby increasing the surface concentration of strongly bound dye. As a result, both JSC and the power conversion efficiency were improved by 25% (11.4 → 14.2 mA cm−2 and 5.9 → 7.4%, respectively, without and with the SA coadsorbent), even for much lower coverages of the dye. We are currently systematically optimizing the adsorption conditions and structures of the coadsorbents to further reduce cost and facilitate the preparation of DSCs.
