    , Accepted 14th November 2013First published on 19th December 2013AbstractThe power conversion efficiency of organic photovoltaics of a benzobisthiazole/benzothiadiazole copolymer we have recently reported was significantly increased from 3.8% to 6.5%, by exploring the inverted cell structure (ZnO/polymer:fullerene/MoOx/Ag), the use of [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), and optimizing film thickness, which demonstrates an improved correlation with time-resolved microwave conductivity.
At the heart of the successful progress of organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) is the development of new p-type low bandgap polymers1–4 and device architectures,5,6 which include energy level alignment to maximize the output voltage and photocurrent generation. In order to achieve a high efficiency OPV, utmost care has been taken to the realization of an optimized bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure composed of a p-type polymer and n-type soluble methanofullerene, which provides a large interface to separate excitons into charge carriers and transport pathways towards electrodes. The highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single-junction cells have reached 7–9%7–15 and it exceeded 10%16 for a multi-junction cell at a laboratory level. A low bandgap polymer is generally synthesized by coupling electron-rich and electron-deficient units, yielding an alternating copolymer that concurrently imparts large short circuit current density (Jsc) and high open circuit voltage (Voc). The designing of novel π-conjugated units and exploration of their combinations concomitant with the appropriate device structure are of paramount importance in this field.
In this regard, we have recently reported a benzobisthiazole (BBTz) and benzothiadiazole (BT) alternating copolymer with solubilizing linear and branched alkyl chains, PBBTzBT-DT (Fig. 1a, DT represents 2-decyl-tetradecyl chains).17 The underlying strategy of this polymer is that BBTz and BT are commonly recognized as electron-deficient (acceptor) moieties, and thus either of them is polymerized with electron-rich (donor) units;18–21 however, we coupled them by regarding BBTz as a weak donor, which delivered a crystalline solution-processable polymer with inherent optoelectronic property, the deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of −5.7 eV (typically −5.0 to −5.5 eV for low bandgap polymer), and a moderate position of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) at −3.9 eV.17 The conventional normal cell of PBBTzBT-DT:[6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) = 1:2 using a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) anode buffer layer and a Ca/Al cathode resulted in a PCE of 2.37%, the current–voltage (J–V) curve of which showed an S-kink near the open circuit condition,22 presumably due to the large energy offset and/or interfacial resistance between PEDOT:PSS and PBBTzBT-DT. In contrast, the inverted cell (titanium oxide, TiO2 as cathode buffer layer, molybdenum oxide, MoOx as anode buffer layer, and Au as anode) revealed a PCE of 3.84% without undesired strong electric field dependence on charge extraction. Throughout the study, laser-flash23 and Xe-flash24 time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) was exploited as a tool for decision-making on the molecular design and screening of processing conditions (solvent, additive, p/n blend ratio, and thermal annealing). The PCE/Voc plotted by TRMC photoconductivity maxima for four BBTz-based polymers demonstrated a good correlation;17 however, the observed sublinear curve suggests that there is extra room for improving the PCE of PBBTzBT-DT.

This motivates us to explore the inverted cell structure using zinc oxide (ZnO) as a cathode buffer layer (electron transport layer) and MoOx/Ag as the anode. The energy diagram of the device is shown in Fig. 1b. The ZnO layer on the indium tin oxide (ITO) transparent electrode was prepared by the sol–gel method reported by Heeger et al.25 and other researchers.13,26,27 The active layer of PBBTzBT-DT:PC61BM (or PC71BM) = 1:2 in weight fraction were spin-coated from chlorobenzene (CB) containing 3 volume% of solvent additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). After removing the remaining DIO in a vacuum chamber, a MoOx hole transport layer and a Ag anode were subsequently deposited by thermal evaporation. The blend films (PBBTzBT-DT:PC61BM and PBBTzBT-DT:PC71BM) show good sunlight-absorbing properties, whereas their colors are dark green and black brown, respectively (Fig. 1c). In addition to this optical property, we should note that the balance between the charge separation efficiency and charge carrier lifetime is maximized at a 1:2 blend ratio, as surveyed by laser and Xe-flash TRMC.17
The OPV performance was measured under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) as shown in Fig. 2a and the parameters are summarized in Table 1. Strikingly the PCE was enhanced, which was 3.84% for the previous inverted cell (TiOx/PBBTzBT-DT:PC61BM/MoOx/Au),17 whereas the present one (ZnO/PBBTzBT-DT:PC61BM/MoOx/Ag) attained 4.68%, owing to the increased Jsc (8.01 to 8.71 mA cm−2) and the fill factor, FF (0.57 to 0.66), regardless of slightly decreased Voc (0.84 to 0.80 V). The recent high efficiency inverted OPV adopts ZnO as a cathode buffer layer,10,13,16,27 because of its relatively high electron mobility,25 environmental stability,26 and high transparency.28 Light soaking did not occur in our ZnO-based devices, in contrast to often-observed TiOx cells.29

Moreover, the use of PC71BM in place of PC61BM with the same processing conditions showed a further improvement in Jsc (10.79 mA cm−2) and PCE (5.87%). This is readily attributed to the superior photoabsorption of PC71BM in the visible region (Fig. 1c), which is evident from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PC61BM and PC71BM devices (Fig. 2b). The difference between Jsc under 1 sun condition and JEQEsc (short circuit current density calculated by integrating the product of the solar and EQE spectra) was as small as 1.5–1.6% (Table 1), corroborating the precise device evaluation.
Encouraged from the remarkable improvement of PCE even for the relatively thick active layer (170 nm), we further investigated the role of film thickness in the PBBTzBT-DT:PC71BM devices (Fig. 2c). Notably, at the 210 nm thickness, the PCE is boosted up to 6.53% with a marked increase in Jsc (12.09 mA cm−2) with identical Voc (0.80 V) and FF (0.67). Accordingly the EQE spectrum was raised keeping its flat feature from ca. 450 to 650 nm (Fig. 2d, the maximum of 62% at 500 nm). The film thickness of 210 nm is close to the optimal one from the viewpoint of interference of light at the electrode.30 The first interference peak at around 100 nm thickness has been usually employed for amorphous low bandgap polymers such as the high-performance thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene copolymer, PTB77,8 and cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene/benzothiadiazole copolymer, PCPDTBT.31 In contrast, crystalline regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene), P3HT can utilize the second peak (around 200 nm) without deterioration of FF.32 This fact exemplifies the crystalline nature of PBBTzBT-DT, which is confirmed by X-ray diffraction17 and able to maximize the product of Jsc and FF.
Subsequently we examined 310 and 760 nm-thick active layers. The J–V curves of these devices in turn led to the decrease of both Jsc and FF (Fig. 2c), where the EQE spectra show truncated features in comparison with that at the optimal thickness (Fig. 2d). The PCEs of 310 and 760 nm-thick devices were found to be 5.47 and 4.70%, respectively, where not only Jsc and FF but also Voc were degraded. The predominant factor among them is the decrease of FF from 0.67 to 0.60 and 0.55. Osaka and Takimiya et al. have reported the synthesis of an alkylated naphthodithiophene/naphthobisthiadiazole crystalline copolymer (PNNT-12HD), presenting 7.5% PCE for PNNT-12HD:PC61BM maximized at 290 nm thickness without a significant loss of FF and 8.2% by the use of PC71BM (300 nm thickness).12 They explained the preserved high FF (∼0.64) in spite of the thick active layer by preferential face-on orientation on the PEDOT:PSS layer, which benefits the long hole transport in the vertical direction. Meanwhile, Chen, Chang, Facchetti, and Marks et al. demonstrated a prominent PCE of 8.7% with an exceptionally high FF (0.78) for the bithiophene-dicarboximide/terthiophene copolymer (PBTI3T):PC71BM.13 They also highlighted the face-on orientation, vertical p/n gradation, and the ordered bicontinuous network. Regardless of such an excellent FF and semi-crystalline property, the optimal thickness of PBTI3T:PC71BM was ca. 120 nm. These studies suggest that the optimal thickness is a result of interplay between photoabsorption including the interference effect and efficient charge transport facilitated by morphology (orientation and network) engineering. In our case of thick PBBTzBT-DT:PC71BM films, the latter factor, more specifically, the charge carrier loss prior to its collection, is assumed to be responsible for the degraded Jsc and FF, because the Jsc/JEQEsc is monotonically decreased from 98.5, 97.3, 94.4, to 93.5% with the film thickness from 170 to 210, 310 nm and 760 nm respectively (Table 1). Jsc is measured under illumination of bright pseudo-sunlight, while JEQEsc is reconstructed from the photo-response against respective low-power monochromated light. Therefore bulk charge recombination loss is likely more effective for Jsc than JEQEsc, leading to the decrease in Jsc itself, Jsc/JEQEsc, and FF.
In order to discuss the thickness dependence on Voc, we performed dark current analysis of each device based on the diode model as given by33,34 (1)where J0 is the saturation current density, n is the ideality factor, Rs is the series resistance in Ω cm2 unit, Rp is the parallel resistance in Ω cm2 unit, q is the elementary charge, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and Jph is the photocurrent density (Jph = 0 in the dark). Under the open-circuit condition (J = 0) under illumination, the assumption that Jph is equal to Jsc leads to the approximation of Voc ≪ JscRp and J0 ≪ Jsc, and thus the calculated Voc (= Vcaloc) is expressed by34,35 (2)
The fitting results of eqn (1) to the observed dark J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3a (the analyzed parameters are listed in Table 2). Subsequently, the observed Voc is plotted against Vcaloc (Fig. 3b). For the devices thinner than 210 nm, Voc scales well with Vcaloc with a small downward offset of 0.025 V; however, this shift was almost doubled for the thick devices in spite of the identical p/n composition and processing of the active layer. Apparently J0, understood as charge transport and injection over p/n junction36 related to built-in potential,6 increases with the film thickness (Table 2). Credgington and Durrant derived the following expression using ionization potential of donor, IPD, electron affinity of acceptor, EAA, and nongeminate recombination current density, Jbi.37 (3)

By substituting IPD by HOMO of PBBTzBT-DT and EAA by LUMO of PC61(71)BM, the Jbi was calculated from the observed Voc (Table 2). Indeed, Jbi was increased with the film thickness, indicative of bulk charge recombination as the primary factor of decreased Voc. It should be noted that the decrease of Jsc does not solely account for the large Voc loss, approximately 0.6–0.7 eV calculated from the second term of eqn (3).
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed for the PBBTzBT-DT:PC71BM films (Fig. 4). Fiber-like structures with 10–15 nm width are clearly observed in the 210 nm-thick film. The size of these fibers became bigger for the thick films, in conjunction with the increase of the surface roughness from 4.2 nm (210 nm-thick) to 5.7 nm (310 nm-thick) and 7.6 nm (760 nm-thick). Therefore the morphology change, in particular, the inferior bicontinuous network including its p/n interface formed from concentrated solution at a low spin-coating speed, is assumed to impair the long-range charge transport without recombination, thereby leading to the decrease of Jsc, FF, and Voc as discussed above.

Fig. 5a and b display two-dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXRD) images of pristine PBBTzBT-DT and PBBTzBT-DT:PC71BM (1:2) blend films, respectively which were prepared in the same way with the OPV device. In the pristine film, the pronounced inter-lamellar diffraction peaks up to the third order are resolved (d-spacing = 23.9 Å) along the out-of-plane direction. Notably, an arc attributed to the π–π stacking distance (d = 3.61 Å) was observed in the out-of-plane direction with the corresponding first-order inter-lamellar diffraction peak in the in-plane direction. Therefore the 2D-GIXRD study revealed that PBBTzBT-DT forms both face-on and edge-on orientations as illustrated in Fig. 5c.

Upper and lower panels are the 2D image and extracted spectra in the out-of-plane (red) and in-plane (blue) directions, respectively. (c) Schematic representation of the polymer orientation. (d) PCE/Voc of the devices as a function of ϕ∑μmax measured by laser-flash TRMC excited at 355 nm. The black diamond, cross, and square are BBTz-based copolymers of PBBTzCz, PBBTz-ran-TPD, and PBBTzBT-HD, respectively (see ref. 17). The triangles are the optimized PBBTzBT-HD:PC61(71)BM for each device structure. The lines are eye-guides. 
In spite of the decreased diffraction intensity and anisotropy, the π–π stacking and inter-lamellar distances were almost the same even for the PC71BM-blend film (Fig. 5b), accompanying a hollow arisen from the random orientation of PC71BM. The degree of face-on orientation is lower than that of the face-on-preferential orientation of PNNT-12HD;12 however, comparison with the 2D-GIXRD image of the benchmark PTB738 or thiazolothiazole-based copolymers39 implies that the partial face-on stacking does not always limit the efficiency. We thus conclude that the thin film of PBBTzBT-DT (<ca. 210 nm) possesses efficient vertical charge transport granted from its partial face-on orientation, contributing to the high Jsc and FF. Interestingly, the observed thickness dependence on FF is in line with the category of “bimodal” orientation reported in the series of thiazolothiazole-based copolymers.40
Finally we compared PCE divided by Voc (PCE/Voc = Jsc × FF) with the photoconductivity transient maxima, ϕ∑μmax (ϕ and ∑μ denote the charge carrier generation efficiency and the sum of positive and negative charge carrier mobilities, μ+ + μ−), measured by laser-flash time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC). Higher ϕ∑μmax was expected for better OPV performance, as proved in P3HT:PC61BM blends23 and low bandgap polymers.24 The plots of black symbols in Fig. 5d are taken from our previous paper for four benzobisthiazole-based copolymers including PBBTzBT-DT.17 The TRMC experiments were conducted for the polymer:PC61BM films at the optimal p/n blend ratio upon excitation at 355 nm laser pulse. Note that the blend films without electrodes attached were subjected to the measurement. As mentioned in the Introduction, a good sublinear dependence was found between PCE/Voc and ϕ∑μmax as drawn by the dotted line. Replacement by the present device data (ZnO as buffer layer) made the interpolated curve steeper and even straight for the PC71BM devices (solid line in Fig. 5d). This improved correlation highlights that device performance could reach the level expected from the TRMC evaluation.
In summary, we have succeeded in remarkable improvement of the PBBTzBT-BT:PC71BM device for the thickness-optimized inverted cell structure, revealing 6.5% PCE, the highest value so far among BBTz polymers. This was consistent with partially face-on orientation as dictated by GIXRD and fiber-like morphology. Excessively thick films led to the decrease in Jsc, FF, and Voc, due to the increased charge recombination inferred from dark current analysis, decrease of Jsc/JEQEsc, and AFM observation. Correlating TRMC transient and PCE/Voc was proved as a fruitful guide for the device tuning.
Experimental
Polymer and characterization
PBBTzBT-DT was synthesized according to the reported procedure.17 The molecular weight was determined by a gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using THF as an eluent on the basis of polystyrene standards, giving the weight-averaged molecular weight of 107 kg mol−1 and the polydispersity index of 2.1. Steady-state photoabsorption spectroscopy was performed using a Jasco V-570 UV-vis spectrophotometer. AFM analyzes were performed by a Seiko Instruments Inc. model Nanocute OP and Nanonavi II. GIXRD experiments were conducted at the SPring-8 on the beam line BL19B2 using 12.39 keV (λ = 1 Å) X-ray. The GIXRD patterns were recorded with a 2-D image detector (Pilatus 100K).
Organic photovoltaic cell (OPV)
A ZnO layer was fabricated onto a cleaned ITO layer by spin-coating of ZnO precursor solution (0.1 g ml−1 zinc acetate dihydrate and 0.028 g ml−1 ethanolamine in 2-methoxyethanol). The substrate was annealed on a hot plate at 200 °C for 30 min. An active layer consisting of the polymer and PC61(71)BM (purchased from Frontier Carbon Inc.) was cast on top of the ZnO layer in a nitrogen glove box by spin-coating. The thickness was controlled by changing the rotation speed and measured by a surface profiler, an ULVAC model Dektak 150. An anode consisting of 10 nm MoOx and 100 nm Ag layers was sequentially deposited through a shadow mask on top of the active layers by thermal evaporation in a vacuum chamber. The resulting device configuration was ITO (120–160 nm)/ZnO (30 nm)/active layer/MoOx (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm) with an active area of 7.1 mm2. Current–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a source-measure unit (ADCMT Corp., 6241A) under AM1.5G solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun, monitored by a calibrated standard cell, Bunko Keiki SM-250KD) from a 300 W solar simulator (SAN-EI Corp., XES-301S). The EQE spectra were measured by a Bunko Keiki model BS-520BK equipped with a Keithley model 2401 source meter. The monochromated light power was calibrated by a silicon photovoltaic cell, Bunko Keiki model S1337-1010BQ.
Time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC)
A resonant cavity was used to obtain a high degree of sensitivity in the conductivity measurement. The resonant frequency and microwave power were set at ca. 9.1 GHz and 3 mW, respectively, so that the electric field of the microwave was sufficiently small not to disturb the motion of charge carriers. Third harmonic generation (THG; 355 nm) of a Nd:YAG laser (Continuum Inc., Surelite II, 5–8 ns pulse duration, 10 Hz) was used as an excitation source. The nanosecond laser intensity was set at 4.6 × 1015 photons per cm2 per pulse. The samples were drop-cast on a quartz plate from solutions of the polymer and PC61BM and dried in a vacuum oven. The TRMC experiments were performed under ambient conditions at room temperature.
