The synthesized SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure nanostructures can provide a high surface area and porous structure for improving the dye loading capacity and hence the amount of photogenerated charges contributing to the photocurrent. The formation of heterostructures between SrTiO3 and TiO2 with a uniquely matched band gap energy structure can efficiently separate photogenerated charge carriers. Photoluminescence emission and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements reveal a lower recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes, and a longer electron lifetime for DSSCs based on the SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures. The photoelectric conversion efficiency and short-circuit current density of DSSCs based on SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures are greatly enhanced over those of pure TiO2 nanosheets. DSSCs based on the SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures show a highest short-circuit current density of 12.55 mA cm−2 and a maximal photoelectric conversion efficiency of 7.42% under one sun illumination.
1. Introduction
Among the third-generation photovoltaic devices, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been recognized as one of the most promising alternatives for low-cost and high solar-to-electricity energy conversion efficiency due to their low cost and possible fabrication of flexible solar cells.1–7 In the past few decades, considerable efforts have been made on novel sensitizers,8–10 electrolytes,11,12 and photoanodes13–16 to improve the power conversion efficiency and long-term stability of DSSCs.2 The structural design of the photoelectrode plays a key role in improving cell performance, which depends mainly on the light harvesting capacities related to the dye adsorbing ability, surface area, porous microstructures, and the band gap energy properties of the photoelectrodes. Among the various oxide semiconductors, nanocrystalline TiO2 has proven to be one of the most suitable materials for solar energy conversion in view of its outstanding properties, such as suitable band position, non-toxicity, low cost, chemical and photonic stability, and biocompatibility.17 Since the morphology, crystal structure and size of TiO2 are crucial factors in determining its chemical, optical and electrochemical performances, variety of structured TiO2, such as nanoparticles,18 nanosheets,19 nanotubes,20 nanowires,21 and nanospheres22 have been fabricated and applied to the photoanode for DSSCs. Among all kinds of morphologies, porous and two-dimensional TiO2 nanosheets have attracted widespread attention due to their high-surface area and porous structure which are favorable for more dye adsorption and charge separation.23–25
Nevertheless, TiO2 as an intrinsic semiconductor has a common predicament with lower quantum efficiency leading to poor photocatalytic activity. This is due to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, which greatly decreases the photocatalytic efficiency in decomposing organic pollutants and photo-electrical conversion efficiency in solar cells.26 It is well documented that charge separation of photogenerated electrons and holes is required for high performance DSSCs. Several attempts have been made to enhance photoelectric conversion performance by suppressing recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs via coupling of semiconductors such as PbS,27 SnO2,28 ZnO,29 Nb2O5,30 and CdS31 with TiO2. Recently, DSSCs based on TiO2 nanosheets as photoanodes have attracted much attention.19 The photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs based on Au nanoparticle loaded TiO2 nanosheets is proven to be greatly enhanced.32 DSSCs based on TiO2 photoanodes with a gradient structure in the nanosheet/nanoparticle film exhibit an enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiency of 6.48%, exceeding that of pure nanoparticle-based DSSCs.19
SrTiO3, as a well-known uniquely perovskite structured semiconductor, has attracted considerable attention. SrTiO3 offers favorable energetics for photocatalysis since its conduction band edge is 200 mV more negative than that of TiO2.33 This makes SrTiO3 a good candidate for coupling with TiO2 to improve photo-electrochemical performance. In this regard, a suitable combination of SrTiO3 with TiO2 can lead to improving not only electron transfer ability from the conduction band of SrTiO3 to that of TiO2, but also hole transfer kinetics from the valence band of TiO2 to that of SrTiO3. Some researchers investigated the photocatalytic performance and related mechanism of SrTiO3/TiO2 photocatalysts, suggesting that the coupled SrTiO3/TiO2 composite could improve the charge separation and achieve a higher photocatalytic activity.34–37 For example, heterostructured TiO2/SrTiO3 nanotube array photocatalysts display enhanced photocatalytic properties compared with pure TiO2 nanotube arrays in decolorizing methylene blue in aqueous solution.38 Zhu's study on the SrTiO3/TiO2 composite film presents a higher separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, achieving a good photocathodic protection effect on stainless steel.39
Importantly, the enhanced charge separation effect between photo-induced generated electrons and holes of SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures is expected to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs based on the SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures.40 Compared with the study of SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructured catalysts for photocatalytically decolorizing and degrading organic pollutants, only a few studies have been reported on the photovoltaic performance based on SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure photoanodes. Song et al.41,42 synthesized a tailored SrTiO3–TiO2 porous spherical heterostructure, demonstrating an enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiency. Recently, Zhang et al.43 reported that coupling SrTiO3 with TiO2 nanotubes can provide synergetic effects for achieving better charge separation and thus producing improved photocurrent and photovoltage in a photoelectrochemical cell. While the solar cell based on SrTiO3–TiO2 nanoporous heterostructures displays an overall conversion efficiency increase from 3.81 for TiO2 to 4.39% for SrTiO3–TiO2 heterostructures.44 The study by Hu's group suggests that the power conversion efficiency of radio frequency magnetron sputtering synthesized SrTiO3-modified TiO2 thin film electrodes can be enhanced to 5.91% from 4.78% for pure TiO2 electrodes.45
However, the synthesis of a large surface area SrTiO3/TiO2 nanosheet heterostructure with a controlled substitution of Sr into the lattice of TiO2 nanosheets is greatly challenging and important to obtain promising photoelectric conversion efficiency. Furthermore, the relationship between the charge separation behavior, the optical emission and adsorption performance, and the photoelectric conversion performance needs to be investigated. In this study, SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures with a novel nanostructure were prepared by a two-step hydrothermal method for the first time. Controlled substitution of Sr into TiO2 nanosheets to form the novel SrTiO3/TiO2 nanosheet heterostructure provides us with a means to examine the influence of content of SrTiO3 in improving the photoelectrical conversion performance. The microstructure of the unique SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures can be tuned by adjusting the molar ratio of Sr and Ti precursors.
The synthesized SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure nanostructures can provide a high surface area for dye loading, and a uniquely matched band gap energy structure between SrTiO3 and TiO2 for the SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures can efficiently separate photogenerated charge carriers. Photoluminescence emission and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements reveal a lower recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes, and a longer electron lifetime for DSSCs based on the SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures. The photoelectric conversion efficiency and short-circuit current density of DSSCs based on SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures are greatly enhanced. DSSCs based on the SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures show a highest short-circuit current density of 12.55 mA cm−2 and a maximal photoelectric conversion efficiency of 7.42% under one sun illumination. Compared with the conversion efficiency of 5.45%, with a short-circuit current density of 9.17 mA cm−2 for DSSCs based on pure TiO2 nanosheets, the photoelectric conversion performance is greatly improved.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure nanocrystals

Synthesis of TiO2 nanosheets. 
A typical anatase TiO2 nanosheet was prepared by a hydrothermal method.46 A 10 mL titanium butoxide (Ti(OC4H9)4) was transferred in a Teflon-lined 50 mL autoclave at ambient temperature, followed by the addition of 1.2 mL hydrofluoric acid solution (49 weight%) under stirring, and the reaction was kept at 200 °C for 24 h. Then the resulting white TiO2 precipitates were centrifuged and washed with ultra-pure water and ethanol several times, and finally the obtained samples (designated as TiO2 nanosheets T1) were dried at 50 °C for 24 h.


Fabrication of SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure nanocrystals. 
The obtained TiO2 nanosheets acted not only as a structure-directed template but also as the Ti source for the production of SrTiO3. In a typical procedure, 60 mL of Sr(OH)2 solution (10 mM) was transferred to a Teflon-lined (90 mL) autoclave, followed by the addition of TiO2 nanosheets under stirring at ambient temperature. After stirring for 30 min, the autoclave was sealed and kept at 180 °C for 18 h. After the reaction, the resultant products were centrifuged, thoroughly washed with 0.1 M HCl and ultra-pure water several times, and finally dried in air at room temperature. Corresponding to an adjustable Sr/Ti molar ratio of 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 6/4 according to the initial amount of raw materials, the obtained SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure samples are denoted as ST0, ST1, ST2, ST3, and ST4, respectively.

2.2 Solar cell fabrication

Preparation of SrTiO3/TiO2 photoanodes. 
To prepare the photoanode of SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure nanocrystals, fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass as transparent conducting glass (FTO glass, 15 Ω−1) was cleaned by sonication in soapy water, acetone and ethanol for 20 min during each washing step. Firstly, the blocking layer solution was created by treating with an aqueous solution of TiCl4 (40 mM) at 60 °C for 15 min to retard interfacial recombination between electrons in the highly conducting FTO and the I3− oxidized electrolyte.47 Secondly, a layer of SrTiO3/TiO2 paste was spin-coated onto the FTO glass plates by the spin coating method at a speed of 2000 rpm for 30 seconds. The thickness of the photoanode is about 10 µm obtained by repetitive spinning several times. The paste fabrication process is as follows:48 briefly, a 10 wt% ethyl cellulose solution contains 0.12 g ethyl cellulose powders and 1.08 g ethanol. The solution was injected into another suspension (0.2 g of SrTiO3/TiO2 power and 0.8 g of terpineol which was diluted with 1.0 mL of ethanol). Then, the mixture suspension was stirred in an agate mortar and sonicated three consecutive times; the two steps were both kept for 20 min. Finally, a heating process (dried at 125 °C for 10 min, and gradually heated under flowing air at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min and 500 °C for 15 min) was carried out to remove the polymer template and organic compounds.


Fabrication of DSSCs. 
The annealed electrodes were sensitized by immersing into a 5 × 10−4 M N719 (cis-diisothocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium)) dye solution dissolved in equal volumes of acetonitrile (Aladdin-reagent, China) and tert-butanol (Aladdin-reagent, China) at ambient temperature for 24 h, followed by washing with acetonitrile to remove non-chemisorbed dye, and dried before being assembled in solar cells. The Pt counter electrodes were prepared by coating with a drop of 0.01 M H2PtCl6 ethanol solution on the cleaned FTO glass and sintered at 400 °C for 15 min. The two electrodes were thermally sealed together with a 25 µm thick Surlyn polymer seal (Surlyn, DuPont) into a sandwich type cell. The electrolyte (electrolyte of 0.6 M 1-methy-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.05 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in a (85:15 vol%) mixture of acetonitrile (Aladdin-reagent, China) and valeronitrile (Aladdin-reagent, China)) were injected through a hole in the counter electrode of the assembled cell and driven into the cell via vacuum backfilling. The hole was sealed using another piece of slide glass-backed Surlyn.

2.3 Characterization
The composition and crystal structure of the obtained nanocrystals were examined with an X-ray diffractometer (Philips Rigaku D/Max-kA X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα source at 40 kV and 30 mA). The surface morphology of the as-prepared samples was analyzed by SU-70 field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The detailed microstructure of the synthesized product was analyzed by using a Phillips Tecnai 20U-Twin high-resolution transmission electron microscope attached to an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The surface area of the samples was evaluated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method using N2 physisorption analysis at 77 K with a Gold APP V-Sorb 2800P. Porosity distributions were calculated from the adsorption branch of the isotherm using the corrected form of the Kelvin equation by means of the Barrette–Joynere–Halenda (BJH) method. Prior to physisorption, the samples were degassed at 160 °C under vacuum for 3 h. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of the material binding energy distributions were carried out in a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB250 spectrometer.
Absorption spectra were recorded with a TU-1901 spectrophotometer to obtain the information about the band gap energy of the as-synthesized nanocrystals. Dye uptake content per unit area (1 cm2) was investigated using UV-vis spectroscopy (TU-1901) by the dissolution of dye adsorbed on the sample film membrane in 0.2 M NaOH water and ethanol (50:50, v/v) solution.20 The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a conventional spectrometer (Cary-50 Varian Co.). Current–voltage characteristics under simulated AM 1.5 illumination were measured using a solar simulator (Newport, Class 3A, 94023A) at one sun (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) by using a Keithley 2420 source meter equipped, and light intensity was measured using a calibrated Si solar cell (certificated by NREL). The photoactive area of 0.16 cm2 was defined by a black metal mask slightly larger than the active area to cut off stray light.49 The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed using a Princeton Parstate 2273A in a two-electrode design; the photoanode served as a working electrode and the Pt-coated on FTO as a counter electrode at an applied bias of the open circuit voltage under one-sun irradiation. The frequency range of 100 mHz to 100 kHz with an AC voltage magnitude of 10 mV. The EIS data were analyzed with an appropriate equivalent circuit using simulation software.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure characterization
The crystal structures of the SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures are determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 1). Fig. 1a shows the XRD pattern of pure TiO2 (T1), all diffraction peaks can be indexed to anatase TiO2 (JCPDS: 21-1272). For the SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures (Fig. 1b–d), there are two series of peaks, one type can be attributed to anatase TiO2, another can be well assigned to cubic SrTiO3 (JCPDS 35-0734). Furthermore, it is clearly shown that with the molar ratio of Sr/Ti increasing, the peak intensity of the TiO2 phase becomes smaller, while the peak intensity of the SrTiO3 phase gets stronger. As the ratio of Sr/Ti is up to 6/4, the diffraction peaks related to anatase TiO2 disappear (see Fig. S1b†). It is shown that we can tune the microstructure and phase components by adjusting the molar ratio of Si/Ti. When the content of molar ratio of Sr/Ti for precursors is lower than 6/4, the synthesized products are composed of anatase TiO2 and cubic SrTiO3, and as the molar ratio of Sr/Ti is larger than 6/4, only cubic SrTiO3 can be obtained.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the as-prepared TiO2 nanosheets and SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure samples synthesized in different Sr/Ti molar ratios: (a) T1, (b) ST1, (c) ST2 and (d) ST3. 
The morphology of the as-prepared TiO2 and SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure samples synthesized in different Sr/Ti molar ratios is examined by FESEM (Fig. 2). Fig. 2a and b show FESEM images of the T1 sample hydrothermally synthesized at 200 °C for 24 h. The low SEM image in Fig. 2a reveals a well-defined sheet-shaped structure with a rectangular outline with a side length of 100–120 nm.46 The magnified SEM image in Fig. 2b shows a rough surface characteristic for the TiO2 nanosheet sample. The rough structures can increase the surface area of the sample, providing much favorable space for dye loading. SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure nanocrystals are easily synthesized by heating the mixture of TiO2 nanosheets and strontium hydroxide octahydrate solution at 180 °C for 18 h under hydrothermal conditions. As revealed in Fig. 2c and d, at a low Sr/Ti molar ratio of 2/4, the as-prepared SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure nanosheets (ST1) retain the same morphology and structures as those of pure TiO2 nanosheets. As the Sr/Ti molar ratio increases to 4/4, the synthesized ST3 sample is mainly composed of cubes with relatively large thickness, a small amount of thin nanosheets can also be observed among the cube-like products, as shown in Fig. 2e and f.

Fig. 3 depicts transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of ST1 heterostructures. From low magnification TEM images in Fig. 3a and b, it is suggested that the products are composed of uniform nanosheets and some fine nanoparticles homogeneously distributed among the nanosheet matrix. The nanosheets display a size of 100–120 nm, while the fine nanoparticles show an average size of only 1–2 nm. Fig. 3c depicts a typical high resolution TEM lattice image of the products showing the hybrids of the nanosheet and nanoparticle. The marked d-spacing of 0.27 nm for a nanoparticle is in good agreement with that of the (110) plane of cubic SrTiO3, while the marked d-spacing of 0.23 nm and 0.24 nm in the lattice image for the nanosheet corresponds well with the d-spacing of (12) and (01) planes of anatase TiO2, respectively. The electron diffraction (ED) pattern reveals the phase components of the ST1 samples (Fig. 3d), with the diffraction rings corresponding well with that of (101), (200), (215), and (303) planes of anatase TiO2, and (110), (111), (211), (220), (311), and (303) planes of cubic SrTiO3, respectively. It is clearly illustrated that the nanoparticle is cubic SrTiO3 and the nanosheets are anatase TiO2.

The marked d-spacing of 0.27 nm for a nanoparticle is in well agreement with that of (110) plane of cubic SrTiO3, while the marked d-spacing of 0.23 nm and 0.24 nm corresponds well with d-spacing of (12) and (01) planes of anatase TiO2, respectively. (d) Electron diffraction pattern reveals the phase components of the ST1 samples, the diffraction rings corresponding well with that of (101), (200), (215), (303) planes of anatase TiO2, and (110), (111), (211), (220), (311), (303) planes of cubic SrTiO3. 
For the T1 sample of pure TiO2 nanosheets, Fig. 4a and b depict two typical low-magnification TEM images obtained from different views. The as-prepared TiO2 nanosheets sample (T1) shows a side length of 100–120 nm (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4b depicts a typical side-viewed TEM image of TiO2 nanosheets, indicating an average thickness of 5 nm for the TiO2 nanosheets. Fig. 4c demonstrates a HRTEM lattice image of a single TiO2 nanosheet. The marked d-spacing of 0.35 nm corresponds well to that of (101) plane of anatase TiO2. Fig. 4d is a typical ED pattern from the pure TiO2 nanosheets, the diffraction rings corresponding to the (101), (004), (200), (211), and (204) planes of anatase TiO2, respectively.

(f) and (g) HRTEM lattice images, the fringe spacing of 0.35 nm in (f) corresponds to d-spacing of (101) plane of anatase TiO2 nanosheet, while the fringe spacing of 0.27 nm in (g) matches well with d-spacing of (110) plane of cubic SrTiO3. (h) ED pattern clearly shows that the ST3 sample is composed of cubic SrTiO3 and anatase TiO2, with diffraction rings corresponding well with (101), (200) planes of anatase TiO2, and (110), (111), (211) planes of cubic SrTiO3, respectively. 
From the low magnification TEM image of the ST3 sample in Fig. 4e, it is shown that as the Sr/Ti molar ratio is 4/4, the synthesized ST3 sample is mainly composed of SrTiO3 cubes, and also a small amount of TiO2 nanosheets, in good agreement with above XRD results. The SrTiO3 cubes show a cube-like morphology with a size of 100 × 80 nm. The fringe spacing of 0.35 nm in Fig. 4f corresponds to the d-spacing of the (101) plane of the anatase TiO2 nanosheet. While, a fringe spacing of 0.27 nm in Fig. 4g matches well with the d-spacing of the (110) plane of cubic SrTiO3. The ED pattern in Fig. 4h clearly shows that the ST3 sample is composed of cubic SrTiO3 and anatase TiO2, with diffraction rings corresponding well with (101), (200) planes of anatase TiO2, and (110), (111), (211) planes of cubic SrTiO3, respectively.
X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) results for different samples are shown in Fig. S2.† EDS data of the heterostructure materials suggest that the samples were composed of Sr, Ti, and O elements. The actual molar ratio of Sr/Ti in the prepared samples is 15%, 43%, 75%, 86% and 98%, corresponding to the samples ST0, ST1, ST2, ST3 and ST4, respectively. It is obviously shown that the actual molar ratio of Sr/Ti obtained is slightly lower than the theoretical value of each sample (Table S1 and the inset of Fig. S2†). Also, EDS data reveal that only Ti and O constituents for pure TiO2 nanosheets. The Cu peak is from the TEM grid used to support the samples.

Scheme 1 illustrates the formation process of SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures. It is shown that this unique heterostructure is a result of a dissolution–precipitation mechanism.50 After the growth of TiO2 nanosheets, TiO2 nanosheets were put into the alkaline solution to react with Sr2+ ions of strontium hydroxide octahydrate [Sr(OH)2·8H2O]. The morphology, crystal structure, and phase components can be tuned by adjusting the molar ratio of Sr/Ti. As the molar ratio of Sr/Ti is low, fine nanoparticles of SrTiO3 can nucleate and grow on the TiO2 nanosheet to form the SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure.51,52 With the molar ratio of Si/Ti further increasing, more SrTiO3 nanocrystals are formed through the reaction of TiO2 with Sr(OH)2, the TiO2 nanosheets are gradually depleted, and SrTiO3 nanocrystals grow and assemble into cube-like crystals.53–55 By increasing the molar ratio of Sr/Ti to 6/4, pure SrTiO3 cube-like structures are obtained.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the preparation process of the SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure nanocrystals. 
The chemical composition and chemical bonding structure of SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures (ST1) are investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). According to XPS analysis, the relative Sr/Ti atomic percent of the ST1 sample is determined to be 8.80/18.08 = 49%. The result is in agreement with the EDS data. The general survey spectra in Fig. 5a indicate the existence of Ti, Sr and O elements in the ST1 sample. The high-resolution spectrum of the Ti 2p shown in Fig. 5b suggests that the characteristic peaks centered at 458.33 eV (Ti 2p3/2) and 464.09 eV (Ti 2p1/2), indicating a Ti4+ oxidation state in the SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure.56,57 The XPS spectrum of the Sr 3d region can be deconvoluted into two peaks of Sr 3d5/2 and Sr 3d3/2 centered at 132.74 and 134.47 eV, respectively (Fig. 5c). The peak at 132.74 eV is in accordance with those reported for perovskite SrTiO3, and the energy peak at 134.47 eV can be attributed to SrO complexes.40,58 The XPS spectral peak of O 1s shows two small peaks, (Fig. 5d) one centered at 529.56 eV should be associated with TiO2 and SrTiO3, whereas another peak centered at 531.78 eV is believed to be related to the adsorbed oxygen such as carbonates and hydroxyl oxides.55,58

The textural properties of the specific surface area, pore size distribution and pore volume of TiO2 nanosheets and SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures prepared under different molar ratios of Sr/Ti of ST0, ST1, ST2, ST3 and ST4 samples are characterized using the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. 6). For pure TiO2 nanosheet sample (T1), it shows a type III isotherm (based on IUPAC classification) with a smooth capillary condensation step occurred at a relative pressure of (P/P0 ≈ 0.90–1.0) and H3 type hysteresis loops, indicating their relatively large pore size and a large specific surface area. This is due to the presence of large amounts of pores between the TiO2 nanosheets, and also probably caused by the crevice hole within TiO2 nanosheets. However, the SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures display still type III isotherms, with a smooth capillary condensation step occurring at high relative pressures (P/P0 ≈ 0.9–1.0) and H3 type hysteresis loops. The textural parameters, such as the specific surface area, pore diameter and pore volume of TiO2 nanosheets and SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure materials, are summarized in Table 1. As revealed in Table 1, sample ST0 has a specific surface area of 72.43 m2 g−1 and a pore size distribution centered at 27.09 nm. With the molar ratio of Sr/Ti increasing, the surface area decreases to 68.92 m2 g−1 for ST1 and 16.66 m2 g−1 for the ST4 sample from 76.69 m2 g−1 for the T1 sample, and the pore size decreases to 27.09 nm for the ST0 sample, and increases to 37.66 nm for the ST4 sample from 27.48 nm for the T1 sample.

3.2 The performance of solar cells
The photovoltaic activity of DSSCs is closely related to the lifetime of photogenerated electrons and holes. Photoluminescence emission signals (PL) result from the recombination of photoinduced charge carriers. To describe the charge separation behavior and efficiency in the samples, PL spectra of (a) T1, (b) ST0, (c) ST1, (d) ST2, (e) ST3 and (f) ST4 samples are comparatively investigated, as shown in Fig. 7. The PL emission spectrum is obtained by using a spectrophotometer containing a xenon lamp with 360 nm excitation wavelength. All the samples display a broad-band emission from 360 to 440 nm with a similar emission peak at 390 nm. The pure TiO2 (T1) and SrTiO3 samples display relatively strong emission compared with ST0, ST1, ST2, and ST3 samples. Generally, the emission peak intensity of the SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures increase with the molar ratio of Sr/Ti increasing. The ST1 heterostructure sample shows the weakest PL emission at about 390 nm among the SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure samples, indicating the lowest recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes, with the longest lifetime of photogenerated electrons and holes.

Comparison of J–V characteristics of DSSCs based on T1, ST0, ST1, ST2, ST3, and ST4 electrodes is shown in Fig. 8. The inset in Fig. 8 suggests that the thickness of the film is around 10 µm. Open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), fill factor of the cell (FF), power conversion efficiency (η), and dye adsorption are listed in Table 2. The capacity of dye loading exerts a profound influence on the photocurrent density for DSSCs,20 in order to estimate the amount of adsorbed N719 dyes by measuring the eluted dye molecules from SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. It is worth noting that the dye concentration is 102.62 nmol cm−2 for T1, 97.02 nmol cm−2 for ST0, 93.83 nmol cm−2 for ST1, 65.15 nmol cm−2 for ST2, 36.39 nmol cm−2 for ST3, and 24.51 nmol cm−2 for ST4, respectively. The results suggest that the ST0 sample had 1.03 times higher dye adsorption than the ST1 sample, while it was 3.96 times for the ST4 sample. As shown in Table 1, the decreased surface area of SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures was a direct consequence of the weaken dye loading capacity.

The open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) keeps an increasing trend with the increase of molar ratio of Sr/Ti for SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures. The DSSCs based on T1 shows the lowest Voc due to the intrinsic property (band gap = 3.2 eV) of TiO2 pure nanosheets, also the highest fill factor (FF) value is obtained for the T1 sample due to the pure TiO2 nanosheet film showing better contact with the FTO glass substrate, resulting in lower contact resistance. The ST1 sample displays the highest FF value among the SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure samples. With the molar ratio of Sr/Ti ranging from 1/4 to 6/4 (ST0 to ST4), the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) first increases from 10.95 mA cm−2 (ST0), to a maximum value of 12.55 mA cm−2 at (ST1), and then decreases gradually with further increasing the molar ratio of Sr/Ti. The power conversion efficiency (η) and short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) display a decreasing trend with the molar ratio of Sr/Ti increasing. For example, DSSCs based on the ST2 heterostructure with a molar ratio of 3/4 for Sr/Ti show the highest short-circuit current density of 10.22 mA cm−2 and a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 5.68%. While DSSCs based on the ST1 heterostructure show the highest short-circuit current density of 12.55 mA cm−2 and a maximal photoelectric conversion efficiency of 7.42%. Compared with the conversion efficiency of 5.45% and a short-circuit current density of 9.17 mA cm−2 for DSSCs based on the pure TiO2 nanosheet sample (T1), the conversion efficiency and short-circuit current density of DSSCs based on the ST1 sample are increased by 36% and 37%, respectively.
The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) is more pertinent than UV-vis absorption/reflection for studying the photocurrent generation of DSSCs. The corresponding IPCE spectra of all the samples are shown in Fig. 9, which is in good agreement with the conversion efficiency of the solar cells (Table 2 and Fig. 8). IPCE spectra do not shift significantly for the different samples, which is consistent with their UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra. Clearly, the maximum IPCE increases, reaches a maximum at sample ST1 and then decreases with the increase of Sr content, having the same trend with the variation of Jsc.

To better understand the interfacial reaction of photoexcited electrons and the effect of the film structure on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed to reveal the electron transport kinetics during the photovoltaic process of DSSCs.59,60Fig. 10a shows the Nyquist plots of DSSCs based on T1, ST1, ST3, and ST4 film electrodes. The equivalent circuit is shown as the inset in Fig. 10a using non-linear-least-square (NLLS) fit analysis software (Zview software) and the fitting data are given in Table 3. Rs can be recognized and fitted according to an equivalent circuit model as the sheet resistance of the FTO glass substrate and the contact resistance at the FTO/TiO2 (SrTiO3/TiO2) interface.61 The Rs values of DSSCs based on T1, ST1, ST3, and ST4 electrodes calculated according to the equivalent circuit are 16.41, 16.83, 17.32, and 17.89 Ω, respectively. It is clear that the Rs of T1 and ST1 electrodes is smaller than that of ST3 and ST4 electrodes, implying better electronic contact between TiO2/FTO, ST1/FTO than that of the interface between ST3/FTO and ST4/FTO glass. The small semicircle in the high frequency region is related to the charge transfer resistance (Rct1) and interfacial capacitance (CPE1) at the interface between the electrolyte and Pt electrode.62 The electron transport resistance (Rct2) at intermediate frequency and interfacial capacitance (CPE2) give information on the impedance at the TiO2 (SrTiO3/TiO2)/electrolyte interfaces,63 while this at low-frequency on behalf of the impedance (Rdiff) is related to the finite diffusion of the electrolyte.64 In particular, the electron transport resistance (Rct2) plays a vital role in the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs in that it is related to the number of electrons going back to the electrolyte at the SrTiO3–TiO2/electrolyte interface.63 The Rct2 values of DSSCs based on T1, ST1, ST3, and ST4 electrodes calculated according to the equivalent circuit are 52.30, 22.18, 119.39, and 133.43 Ω, respectively. It is clear that the Rct2 of the ST1 electrode is the smallest, indicating high charge transport ability at the ST1 photoanode.

Bode phase plots of the EIS can offer the lifetime information of electrons during the photovoltaic process and are shown in Fig. 10b. According to the EIS model developed by Kern et al.,64 the electron lifetime (τe) can be calculated according to the equation τe = 1/2πfmax, where fmax is the maximum frequency of the peak in the intermediate frequency region.65 The τe values of DSSCs based on T1, ST1, ST3, and ST4 electrodes are calculated to be 7.96, 15.79, 2.52, and 1.00 ms, respectively. The larger value of τe means the lower recombination rate of electrons and holes during the electron transfer across the working film, in good agreement with the result of electron transport resistance (Rct2). Longer electron lifetimes are observed for DSSCs based on ST1 electrodes, indicating more effective suppression of the back-reaction of the injected electrons with the I3− ions in the electrolyte.
The proposed charge transfer process in SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures is illustrated in Scheme 2. TiO2 is a kind of wide bandgap semiconductor (3.2 eV) with its valence band (2.91 V vs. NHE) and conduction band (−0.29 V vs. NHE); both the conduction band and valence band of TiO2 are more negative than the valence band (2.14 V vs. NHE) and conduction band (−1.26 V vs. NHE) of SrTiO3. The good matching of band edges between TiO2 and SrTiO3 is important to form a type II heterojunction. Under UV irradiation, electrons photogenerated from the conduction band of SrTiO3 pass to the lower lying conduction band of TiO2, while the photogenerated holes in the valence band of TiO2 transfer oppositely to that of SrTiO3. The simultaneous transfer of electrons and holes in the SrTiO3/TiO2 system increases the spatial separation of charge carriers, and thus reduces the probability of recombination.66 Furthermore; it is the close contact between TiO2 and SrTiO3 that the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes would be maximized. In other words, if the content of SrTiO3 is too large, the charge transfer activity and charge separation ability will be reduced. Thus, the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes was prevented effectively thus benefiting the higher photocatalytic efficiency of the ST1 sample than the other samples. So the optimized ratio of Sr/Ti for the SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure is 2/4.67
 Scheme 2  Schematic illustration of the proposed charge transfer process in SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure under UV light irradiation. 
On the basis of the above experimental results, the highest power conversion efficiency of the DSSCs based on ST1 electrodes can be attributed to the effects of three factors: firstly, the SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure nanocrystals has higher light absorbing ability for enhancing the utilization of solar light, which are confirmed by the UV-vis diffuse reflectance measurements (Fig. S3†). Secondly, the capacity of dye absorbed exerts a profound influence on the photocurrent density, the relatively high specific surface area and presence of large amounts of pores in SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure nanosheets (ST1) are in favor of high dye absorption ability. Thirdly, the electron transport resistance (Rct2) of the ST1 electrode is the smallest, which results in lower contact resistance and higher photocurrent density. Furthermore, as illustrated in Scheme 2, the matched bandgap structure of SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures (ST1) is beneficial for the simultaneous transfer of electrons and holes, which increases the spatial separation of charge carriers, and thus reduces the probability of recombination of electrons and holes. The good spatial separation of charge carriers can also be demonstrated by the ST1 heterostructure sample shows the weakest emission, indicating the lowest recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes, with the longest lifetime of photogenerated electrons and holes. The maximum IPCE appears at sample ST1, which can be a good description of high light-harvesting efficiency, electron injection efficiency from excited dye molecules to TiO2, and electron collection efficiency at the anode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) also reveals a lower recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes, and a longer electron lifetime for the DSSCs based on the SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures.
Although several studies about DSSCs based on the TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructure photoanodes are previously reported, it is still greatly challenging to develop a TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructure in a controlled way. Huang et al. recently reported a situ hydrothermal synthesis of SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure nanosheets to enhance photocatalytic degradation activity, showing that the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanosheets on degradation of RhB is enhanced by coupling SrTiO3.68 Compared with Huang's work, the present DSSCs based on SrTiO3/TiO2 nanosheet heterostructures show a superior photoelectric conversion performance than the previously reported DSSCs based on SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures, with a short-circuit current density of 12.55 mA cm−2 and a maximal photoelectric conversion efficiency of 7.42% under one sun illumination. Controlled substitution of Sr into TiO2 nanosheets to form the novel TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructure provides us with an effective mean to examine the influence of SrTiO3 in improving the photoelectric conversion performance of the TiO2/SrTiO3 heterostructured photoanodes for DSSCs. Compared with the reported conversion efficiency of DSSCs based on other types of SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructures,38–40 the photoelectric conversion performance is greatly improved. The work reported here provides a novel heterostructure with a structural advantage and with a uniquely matched band gap energy structure that can efficiently separate photogenerated charge carriers. The synthesized SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure nanostructures display a high surface area and porous structure for improving dye loading capacity and hence the amount of photogenerated charges contributing to the photocurrent.
The photoelectric conversion performance of the SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure can be comparable with previously reported studies. For example, as bare TiO2 nanotubes and heterostructured SrTiO3–TiO2 nanotubes are applied as photoanodes in DSSCs, a photoconversion efficiency of 0.18% and 0.48% can be achieved, respectively.41 For the core–shell nanoporous SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructured photoanodes for DSSCs, an overall conversion efficiency of 4.39% can be obtained, higher than the efficiency of 3.81 for the pure TiO2 photoanode.44 The study by Hu's group suggests that the power conversion efficiency of SrTiO3-modified TiO2 electrodes can be enhanced to 5.91% from 4.78% for the pure TiO2 electrode.45 It is obvious that we have obtained the excellent photoelectric conversion performance of DSSCs based on the tailored SrTiO3/TiO2 nanosheet heterostructured photoanodes. The unique heterostructures with high specific surface area suppress the recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, and prolong the carrier lifetime of photo-induced electrons and holes, demonstrating greatly enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiency.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a novel type of SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure was successfully synthesized by a facile two-step hydrothermal process for the first time. The microstructure and phase components of the heterostructure products can be tuned by adjusting the molar ratio of Sr and Ti precursors. DSSCs based on the ST1 photoanode exhibit the highest conversion efficiency of 7.42% and a fill factor of 76.82% under one sun illumination. The performance improvement of solar cells can be attributed to the strong light absorbing ability of SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure nanosheets, the strong uptake ability of the dye molecule due to the larger surface area and porous structure characteristics, and the electron transported facilitated by the heterojunctions.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the as-prepared TiO2 nanosheets and SrTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure samples synthesized in different Sr/Ti molar ratios: (a) T1, (b) ST1, (c) ST2 and (d) ST3.	 

 	Fig. 2  FE-SEM images of the as-prepared TiO2 nanosheets and the SrTiO3/TiO2 samples synthesized in different Sr/Ti molar ratios: (a) and (b) T1, (c) and (d) ST1, (e) and (f) ST3.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) TEM image of ST1 sample. (b) Magnified TEM image of ST1 sample. (c) HRTEM lattice image of ST1 sample. The marked d-spacing of 0.27 nm for a nanoparticle is in well agreement with that of (110) plane of cubic SrTiO3, while the marked d-spacing of 0.23 nm and 0.24 nm corresponds well with d-spacing of (12) and (01) planes of anatase TiO2, respectively. (d) Electron diffraction pattern reveals the phase components of the ST1 samples, the diffraction rings corresponding well with that of (101), (200), (215), (303) planes of anatase TiO2, and (110), (111), (211), (220), (311), (303) planes of cubic SrTiO3.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) and (b) Low magnification TEM images of T1 sample. (c) A typical HRTEM lattice image and (d) electron diffraction pattern for T1 sample. (e) Low magnification TEM image of ST3 sample. (f) and (g) HRTEM lattice images, the fringe spacing of 0.35 nm in (f) corresponds to d-spacing of (101) plane of anatase TiO2 nanosheet, while the fringe spacing of 0.27 nm in (g) matches well with d-spacing of (110) plane of cubic SrTiO3. (h) ED pattern clearly shows that the ST3 sample is composed of cubic SrTiO3 and anatase TiO2, with diffraction rings corresponding well with (101), (200) planes of anatase TiO2, and (110), (111), (211) planes of cubic SrTiO3, respectively.
