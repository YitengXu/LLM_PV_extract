    , Accepted 31st May 2016First published on 31st May 2016AbstractIn this work, we present a non-fullerene electron acceptor bearing a fused five-heterocyclic ring containing selenium atoms, denoted as IDSe-T-IC, for fullerene-free polymer solar cells (PSCs). This molecule exhibits a low band gap (Eg = 1.52 eV), strong absorption in the 600–850 nm region and a high LUMO level (−3.79 eV). When a large band gap polymer J51 (Eg = 1.91 eV) was used as the donor, complementary absorption of the polymer donor and acceptor was obtained in the wavelength range of 350–850 nm. The solar cell based on J51:IDSe-T-IC gives a maximum PCE of 8.6%, with a high Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 15.20 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 62.0%. Moreover, this performance is much higher than that of J51:PC71BM based PSCs under similar device fabrication conditions (PCE = 6.0%). The trade-off features of the Jsc and Voc existing in PSCs with fullerene acceptors have been minimized in the fullerene-free PSCs based on IDSe-T-IC and J51. The results demonstrate that fine-tuning the absorption and electronic energy levels of non-fullerene acceptors, and properly selecting a polymer donor to achieve complementary absorption, is a promising way to further improve the performance of the PSCs.

Broader context
Organic solar cells or photovoltaic cells (OPVs) fabricated from organic solutions will become cheap alternatives to commercialized Si based PV cells, due to their large scale production with printing techniques. Recently the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OPVs were enhanced to about 10% by synthesizing new materials, optimizing processes and gaining a deeper understanding of the device physics. However, the large scale OPV production and applications are severely hindered by the high cost of dominant electron acceptors (i.e. fullerene derivatives: PC61BM, PC71BM, and ICBA). Despite the contributions in the rapidly improved efficiencies of OPVs, fullerene derivatives have their own physical and structural insufficiencies such as poor absorption in the visible and NIR region, limited energy level variability by chemical modification and the very high cost of purification and production. In this study, we present a non-fullerene electron acceptor bearing a fused five-heterocyclic ring containing selenium atoms, denoted by IDSe-T-IC. This molecule exhibits low band gap (Eg = 1.52 eV), strong absorption in the 600–850 nm region and a high LUMO level (−3.79 eV). When paired with a large band gap polymer J51 (Eg = 1.91 eV), complementary absorption was obtained in the range of 350–850 nm. The device gives a record PCE of 8.6%, with a Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 15.20 mA cm−2 and a FF of 62.0%. Moreover, this performance is much higher than that of J51:PC71BM solar cells under similar device fabrication conditions (PCE = 6.0%). The trade-off features of the Jsc and Voc existing in fullerene acceptor based solar cells have been minimized in IDSe-T-IC and J51 systems. The results demonstrate that the fine-tuning of non-fullerene materials, properly paired with polymer donor to achieve complementary absorption, is a promising way to further improve the PCEs of solar cells.

1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on conjugated polymers as donors and fullerene derivatives as acceptors in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structures have been seeing rapid progress in power conversion efficiency (PCE) over the past few decades, with the PCE recently reaching over 10% for single junction devices.1 The molecular design of new conjugated donors plays an essential role in achieving high-performance PSCs,1,2 whereas, the development of acceptor materials has fallen far behind; so far, electron acceptors utilized in PSCs have mostly been fullerene derivatives (such as PC61BM, PC71BM, ICBA3etc.). Despite the contributions in the rapidly improved device performance (in PCE), fullerene derivatives have their own physical and structural defects, such as poor absorption in the visible and NIR region, limited energy level variability by chemical modification and high cost of purification and production.4 In contrast to the hardly adjustable C60 backbone, non-fullerene electron acceptor materials are able to further reduce energy loss and increase photocurrent density in devices, through facilely tailoring the conjugated structure, which has been quickly developed for PSCs research in recent years.
The most fascinating feature of non-fullerene electron acceptor materials is the various options in selecting building blocks, especially the n-type organic units, such as perylene diimide (PDI),5 naphthalene diimide (NDI),6 diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),7 and benzothiadiazole (BT).8 Considering that a promising non-fullerene acceptor material should have low reorganization energy, suitable energy levels, good electron transport properties, as well as good absorption in the visible and near infra-red (NIR) region, it is still a big challenge for one material to meet all the requirements. Moreover, such a material should simultaneously match well with a suitable polymer donor to cover the whole solar spectrum to achieve high PCE. Therefore, our focus was switched to selenium-based organic units, because selenium's larger and looser outermost electron cloud can improve orbital overlap with neighboring conjugated units, and thus decrease the band gap and increase the carrier mobility, which are the key properties for non-fullerene acceptors.9 Very recently, Wang and co-workers developed a selenophene containing a perylene diimide non-fullerene acceptor, denoted SdiPBI-Se, which showed absorption in the range of ∼400–600 nm.10 As this molecule was paired with another polymer donor, PDBT-T1, with absorption edge at ∼700 nm, a champion PCE of 8.4% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.95 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.48 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.70 was obtained. Although it is known as one of the highest values for non-fullerene acceptor based PSCs to date, if the remaining 700–850 nm light could be utilized, the entire solar spectrum would then be covered, and the Jsc and PCE could probably be further enhanced.
Since Zhan and co-workers reported an indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene based non-fullerene acceptor, recently, multi-fused ring ladder type molecules have been showing great promise as non-fullerene acceptor materials, with PCEs over 8%, due to their good electron transport properties and especially adjustable band gap (Eg).11 By changing the electron-withdrawing group and fusing more aromatic rings in the backbone, the non-fullerene acceptor materials with Eg ranging from 1.5 to 1.7 eV could be obtained. Herein, our strategy is to develop a new non-fullerene electron acceptor bearing a fused five-heterocyclic ring containing selenium atoms, denoted IDSe, which is firstly introduced into the design of non-fullerene materials. This block has a ladder-type backbone, bearing a rigidified coplanar structure for large conjugation and good carrier transport. The resulting acceptor IDSe-T-IC (see Scheme 1) exhibits a low band gap (Eg = 1.52 eV), strong absorption in the 600–850 nm region and a higher LUMO level. In order to absorb light efficiently to generate enough charge carriers, a large band gap polymer, named J51, was selected as a donor material.12 The main absorption of J51 is in the wavelength range of 350–650 nm, complementing well the absorption spectrum of IDSe-T-IC. Consequently, the PSCs based on J51:IDSe-T-IC showed maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.6%, with a high Jsc of 15.20 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.91 V and a FF of 62.0%, without any additive treatment in a simple conventional device structure. Importantly, it also outperformed a similar PC71BM-based device with identical polymer donor, showing great potential to substitute fullerene derivatives. These results could help us to develop more efficient non-fullerene acceptors based on multi fused-ring ladder-type conjugated molecules, and understand in-depth that pairing with suitable donor polymers is of crucial importance for realizing high-performance non-fullerene PSCs.

2. Results and discussion
The chemical structures of J51 and IDSe-T-IC are shown in Fig. 1a. The donor polymer J51 was used as received. The synthetic route for IDSe-T-IC is shown in Scheme 1. Compound 3 was prepared in 93% yield through the Stille cross-coupling reaction between commercially available compound 2 and compound 3, with a palladium catalyst. Subsequent Knoevenagel condensation between compound 3 and 3-(dicyanomethylidene)indan-1-one afforded the final product IDSe-T-IC in 72% yield. The chemical structure of each new compound was fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MALDI-TOF MS. Thermal properties were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† IDSe-T-IC shows good thermal stability with the decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) of 315 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is also used to analyze the thermal properties. Fig. S2 in the ESI† shows that the glass transition temperature of IDSe-T-IC is 105 °C, the melting temperature is 187 °C, and there is no crystallization peak in the temperature range of −80 °C to 250 °C. This is mainly due to the four phenyl groups on the IDSe unit, which are out of the plane of the backbone of the molecule, disrupting the π-stacking interactions and preventing crystallization.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of IDSe-T-IC were investigated both in chloroform (CF) solution and thin film (Fig. 1b). The IDSe-T-IC in CF exhibits broad and strong absorption in the 400–800 nm region, with a shorter wavelength band at 400–500 nm, due to π–π* transitions, and a longer wavelength band at 500–800, due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). The absorption peak of IDSe-T-IC in CF is located at around 680 nm. Notably, IDSe-T-IC in thin film exhibits a marked red-shift (∼60 nm) in maximum absorption, compared to in solution, which may correlate with its solid state packing. The band-gap extracted from its absorption band edge is estimated to be 1.52 eV. Fig. 1c shows absorption spectra of the films of J51, IDSe-T-IC and their blended film, clearly giving satisfactory absorption in the visible range of 350–850 nm for the J51:IDSe-T-IC blended film (1:1, w/w). The complementary absorption of J51 and IDSe-T-IC is desirable for enhancing the light harvest so as to increase the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the solar cells.
The frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels of J51 and IDSe-T-IC, measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV) on film and the cyclic voltammograms, are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels are calculated based on the onsets of the oxidation and reduction curves. The HOMO/LUMO levels of J51 and IDSe-T-IC are −5.29/−3.30 eV and −5.45/−3.79 eV, respectively. The energy diagram relative to the vacuum level is shown in Fig. 1d. It is noted that their energy offset in the LUMO level is 0.49 eV, which leads to sufficiently efficient electron transfer from J51 to IDSe-T-IC. Because the acceptor absorption also contributes to the overall photocurrent, the hole transfer from the acceptor to the donor needs to be considered.13 However, in this case, the energy offset of HOMO levels (ΔEH) between J51 and IDSe-T-IC is only 0.16 eV, which is smaller than the widely referenced empirical threshold value of 0.3 eV. Although this system has a small ΔEH of 0.16 eV, it shows efficient hole transfer from IDSe-T-IC to J51, which is confirmed by the high EQE values of the device in the spectral range of 650–850 nm, where the light absorption of J51 is negligible.
To gain deeper insight on the effect of heteroatom substitution in these acceptor materials, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on analogous models of IDSe-T-IC and the ever reported IDT-T-IC.11c The calculated results are summarized in Table S1 in ESI.† From Fig. 2, we can clearly see that the HOMO/LUMO wave functions of both molecules are well delocalized over the backbone. The predicted LUMO of the IDSe-T-IC is slightly decreased compared to the sulfur analogue. Calculations predict that selenium substitution will decrease the band gap by 0.06 eV, similar to the observed decrease of 0.05 eV in the optical band gap reported in the literature. The torsional angles of IDT-T-IC are θ1 = 0.1°, θ2 = 11.8°, θ3 = 0.1° and θ4 = 11.7°, when the sulfur atom is replaced with selenium, backbone twisting is reduced significantly, with resulting torsional angles of θ1 = 0.1°, θ2 = 0.7°, θ3 = 0.1° and θ4 = 0.2°, owing to the increased quinoid character of the backbone. The improved planarity is likely as a result of the improvement in the charge transfer mobility of IDSe-T-IC.

Three different solvent systems, chlorobenzene (CB), chlorobenzene with 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), and CF were carefully optimized, since the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs, particularly the FF is sensitive to the morphology of the organic films acquired during drying. Initially, the active layer was deposited by spin-casting from chlorobenzene with the polymer and non-fullerene acceptor blend ratios of 1:1. The device gave the best performance of 7.5% with a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 15.14 mA cm−2, and a FF of 55.0%, and then, DIO was used as an additive to fabricate the devices. It seems that DIO had no impact on the enhancement of the device performance. Thereafter, the solar cells were further optimized by CF. It is noted that FF was significantly increased, resulting in a high PCE of 8.6% with a Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 15.20 mA cm−2 and a FF of 62.0. Good reproducibility is also demonstrated. The efficiency histogram in Fig. S4a (ESI†) shows >75% of the devices (among 20 devices) having PCE higher than 8%. Importantly, this value is even much higher compared to that of J51:PC71BM solar cells under similar device fabrication conditions (Table 1). In order to gain a deeper insight into the nature of the morphology of the films cast from different solvents, tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed. The morphology of the J51:IDSe-T-IC films cast from CB, CB with 3% DIO, and CF solutions are shown in Fig. 4a and Fig. S5 (ESI†). The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the blend films are 1.09 nm for CB, 3.78 for CB with 3% DIO and 0.97 for CF. Large domains on the surfaces of the films cast from CB with 3% DIO can be observed. These large domains inhibit the formation of free charge carriers, and thus limit the Jsc and FF of the resulting devices. Moreover, the fibrous structure can be observed in the film cast from CF solution. As shown in Fig. 4b, this well-distributed nano-fibrillar structure will definitely improve the efficient charge generation and transport, and thereby lead to increased Jsc and FF of the corresponding solar cells.

Interestingly, it is worth noting that both Jsc and Voc as high as 15.20 mA cm−2 and 0.91 eV, respectively, were simultaneously obtained from the device. This is rarely reported in literature. As is known, the trade-off features of the Jsc and Voc exist in fullerene acceptor based organic solar cells. According to the fundamental working mechanism of PSCs, the realization of both high Jsc and Voc requires that the polymer must have both a narrower Eg and a deeper HOMO level. This presents a great challenge for organic chemists to develop highly efficient materials. However, our results indicate that non-fullerene organic solar cells have great potential to minimize the trade-off and approach higher performance, compared to fullerene-based solar cells, via carefully developing new non-fullerene acceptors and matching with donor polymers.
The corresponding EQE curve of the optimized device is presented in Fig. 3b. Obviously, the device based on the combination of J51 and IDSe-T-IC yielded broad EQE spectra from 300 to 850 nm, with the EQE values exceeding 50% at most wavelengths, and maximum peaks up to 66% at 600 nm. The calculated Jsc integrated from the EQE was 15.07 mA cm−2, in good agreement with that measured from the J–V curves; the mismatch is only 0.8%. Note that the EQE signal is reasonably high in the range of 650–850 nm, which corresponds well to the absorption of IDSe-T-IC. This result indicates that the 0.16 eV HOMO energy offset is sufficient to ensure the efficient hole transfer from IDSe-T-IC to J51.
The light-intensity (P) dependence of Jsc was examined to further understand the charge recombination behavior in this device. The correlation between light intensity and Jsc follows the relation, Jsc ∝ Pα. As shown in Fig. 5, in the case of J51:IDSe-T-IC (1:1. w/w), the α value is estimated to be 0.96, which is close to 1. This indicates that there is a relatively weak bimolecular recombination within the J51:IDSe-T-IC based device. This decreased bimolecular recombination thus resulted in high Jsc and better device performance.15

The good morphological stability of non-fullerene based PSCs represents another major merit for their potential applications. Since PCBM has a strong tendency to form large aggregates at high temperatures, the PSCs based on PCBM usually have poor thermal stabilities. Compared with PCBM based PSCs, non-fullerene based PSCs are expected to have much better thermal stabilities, owing to the near amorphous nature of non-fullerene acceptors.7b The stability of the PCEs for the devices based on J51:IDSe-T-IC (1:1, w/w) and J51:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) blended films after thermal treatment at 150 °C and 200 °C for different times are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The devices based on J51:IDSe-T-IC showed good thermal stabilities after both 150 °C and 200 °C thermal treatments. For the J51:PC71BM based devices, when the active layers were annealed under 200 °C for 30 min, the PCE of the corresponding device dropped by almost 50%, which was much faster than the J51:IDSe-T-IC based devices.
Generally, the energy loss (Eloss) defined by Eloss = Eg′ − qVoc is also an important parameter for interpreting the deviation of Voc. Note that Eg′ is determined by the smaller value of donor or acceptor materials. Herein the Eg′ refers to the Eg of IDSe-T-IC, which has a relatively smaller value (Eg′ = 1.52 eV). For most of the fullerene-based PSCs, the devices with high performance in literature had Eloss ranging from 0.7 to 0.8 eV (as shown in Fig. 6),16 which is much bigger than that of highly efficient perovskite solar cells, whose values are commonly below 0.5 eV.17 Here, we demonstrate that the use of polymer J51 as a donor and IDSe-T-IC as an acceptor, leads to Voc as high as 0.91 V and Eloss as low as 0.61 eV, which is much smaller than that of typical polymer systems. These unconventional features of the acceptor IDSe-T-IC will inspire the field of non-fullerene based solar cells towards further improvement of performance with both high Jsc and Voc.

The fluorescence spectra of pure J51, IDSe-T-IC and an optimized blended film of J51 with IDSe-T-IC are shown in Fig. S7 in ESI.† The PL intensities are significantly quenched for both J51 and IDSe-T-IC in the blended film. Given that nearly all the excitons in the polymer phases are created close enough to an interface, they are expected to be quenched in the blended film. This result indicates that effective photoinduced charge transfer occurred between J51 and IDSe-T-IC in the blended film, which will be beneficial for achieving high Jsc in solar cell devices.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed to study the molecular stacking of acceptor molecules (Fig. S8 in ESI†). As we expected, there is no obvious peak in the XRD pattern of IDSe-T-IC, suggesting its amorphous nature, which is probably attributed to the more bulky and twisted alkyl chain.18 This steric hindrance results in an appropriate reduction of the aggregation tendency of the fused multi-ring, and the formation of a suitable 3D conformation, thus making the IDSe-T-IC a promising non-fullerene acceptor material for PSCs.
While utilizing the non-fullerene acceptor materials for PSCs, the balanced hole and electron mobility are very critical to obtaining high performance devices, because it is directly related to charge transport and recombination. Their hole and electron mobilities were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method, using hole/electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/J51:IDSe-T-IC/Au and ITO/PDINO/J51:IDSe-T-IC/PDINO/Al at the optimized blend ratio. As shown in Fig. S9 in ESI,† the hole and electron mobilities of J51:IDSe-T-IC (1:1, w/w) are estimated as 8.25 × 10−5 and 7.72 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, corresponding to nearly balanced charge transport (μh/μe = 1.1). The high and balanced hole and electron mobilities play a crucial role in reducing bimolecular recombination. As a result, high values of Jsc and FF can thus be obtained.
3. Conclusions
In summary, a new multi fused-ring ladder-type molecule acceptor, IDSe-T-IC, was synthesized and utilized as an efficient electron acceptor for fullerene-free BHJ PSCs. The introduction of Se atoms into the multi fused-ring compound resulted in a more planar molecular configuration and a higher LUMO energy level. IDSe-T-IC showed a narrow band gap (Eg = 1.52 eV) and a strong absorption in the 600–850 nm region, which complemented well the absorption of the polymer J51. Application of the non-fullerene acceptor IDSe-T-IC and polymer J51 donor in the conventional device structure, without any additive, gave a high PCE of 8.6% with a Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 15.20 mA cm−2 and a FF of 62.0%. Importantly, it also outperformed the similar PC71BM-based device with identical polymer donor, showing great potential to substitute fullerene derivatives. The trade-off features of the Jsc and Voc existing in fullerene acceptor based solar cells have been minimized in the IDSe-T-IC and J51 system. This work demonstrated that fine-tuning the absorption and electronic energy levels of non-fullerene materials, and properly pairing them with a large bandgap polymer to achieve complementary absorption, is a promising way to further improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.

Materials and characterization
All chemicals, unless otherwise specified, were purchased from TCI and used as received. IDSe was synthesized according to the reported procedure.8a UV-vis spectra were measured using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda-9 spectrophotometer. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker AV400 and AV500 spectrometer operating at 400 and 125 MHz in deuterated chloroform solution with TMS as reference, respectively. Time of Flight MS-MALDI (TOF) MS were performed on a Bruker Autoflex II/Compass 1.0 from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering in Soochow University. Cyclic voltammetry was conducted on the polymer film in acetonitrile with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate, using a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. ITO, Ag/AgCl and Pt mesh were used as working electrode, reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The steady-state photoluminescence spectra were measured by utilizing Horiba Jobin-Yvon Lab RAM HR800 and a single photon counting spectrometer, which was combined with the Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (Horiba-FM-2015), respectively. The X-ray diffraction XRD spectrum was obtained by using an X′PertProMPD (Holland) D/max-γA X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the interfacial films were obtained using a Veeco Multimode V instrument. TEM images were recorded on a Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN instrument at 200 kV accelerating voltage.

Synthesis of compound 3. 
Compound 1 (1.32 g, 1.0 mmol) was dissolved in toluene (50 mL) and compound 2 (0.9 g, 3.0 mmol) was then added. The mixture was deoxygenated by bubbling nitrogen gas through it for 30 minutes and then Pd2(dba)3 (36 mg, 4 mol%) and P(o-tol)3 (54 mg, 18%) were added. The mixture was refluxed for 24 h under nitrogen atmosphere and then cooled to room temperature. The solvent was evaporated and the crude product was purified using silica gel chromatography, with 1:1 (DCM:hexane) as the eluent. Evaporation of the solvent yielded the product as a red solid (1.35 g, 93%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 9.80 (s, 2H), 7.51 (s, 2H), 7.41 (s, 2H), 7.32 (s, 2H), 7.16 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 8H), 7.08 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 8H), 2.69 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 4H), 2.58 (t, J = 8.0 Hz, 8H), 1.70 (m, 2H), 1.58 (m, 8H), 1.33 (m, 40H), 0.87 (m, 24H). 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 182.0, 157.5, 152.4, 146.2, 144.2, 141.3, 140.8, 139.4, 139.0, 138.6, 137.3, 128.0, 127.4, 125.5, 63.8, 39.4, 35.1, 33.2, 31.8, 31.2, 30.9, 28.7, 28.0, 25.0, 22.5, 22.1, 13.6, 10.0. MS-ESI (M + H)+ calcd for C90H110O2S2Se2, 1146.6278; found, 1446.829.


Synthesis of IDSe-T-IC. 
1,1-Dicyanamethylene-3-indanone (194 mg, 1.0 mmol) was added into the mixture of compound 3 (170 mg, 0.1 mmol) in chloroform with pyridine (1 mL). The reactant was deoxygenated with nitrogen for 30 min and then refluxed for 10 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reactant was poured into methanol and the precipitate was filtered off, then extracted with DCM and washed with water. The crude product was purified by silica gel using a mixture of hexane/DCM as the eluent to give a purple solid (130 mg, 72%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 8.75 (s, 2H), 8.68 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 7.91 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 7.72 (m, 4H), 7.58 (m, 4H), 7.45 (s, 2H), 7.21 (m, 16H), 2.73 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 4H), 2.60 (t, J = 8.0 Hz, 8H), 1.75 (m, 2H), 1.60–1.53 (m, 8H), 1.35–1.29 (m, 40H), 0.87 (m, 24H). 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 188.0, 159.9, 158.5, 153.2, 151.8, 148.4, 148.3, 141.4, 141.0, 140.5, 139.6, 139.4, 137.7, 136.8, 136.4, 134.6, 134.0, 133.7, 128.1, 127.4, 126.2, 124.8, 123.2, 121.7, 117.7, 114.2, 68.7, 63.9, 38.9, 35.1, 33.3, 31.9, 31.3, 30.9, 28.7, 28.0, 25.2, 22.6, 22.1, 13.6, 10.0. HRMS (MALDI) m/z: M+, calcd for C114H118N4O2S2Se2, 1799.7060; found, 1799.036.

Device fabrication
The PSCs were fabricated in the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/J51:IDSe-T-IC/PDINO/Al. ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned sequentially with deionized water, acetone, ethanol, and isopropanol under sonication for 10 min each and then treated by oxygen plasma for 15 min to generate the hydrophilic surface. The filtered PEDOT:PSS solution (Baytron P VP AI 4083 from H. C. Starck) was spin-coated onto the cleaned ITO substrates at 2000 rpm, followed by baking at 150 °C for 15 min in air. Subsequently, the substrates were transferred into a N2-filled glove box for spin-coating of the photoactive layer. J51 and non-fullerene acceptor (IDSe-T-IC) were dissolved in chloroform with a donor/acceptor weight ratio of 1:1. The mixed solution was spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer at 2500 rpm for 90 s, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min. A methanol solution of PDINO with a concentration of 1.5 mg mL−1 was then spin-coated onto the photoactive layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, an Al top electrode was deposited onto the PDINO buffer layer by thermal evaporation at a base pressure of 5.0 × 10−5 Pa. The deposition rate and film thickness were monitored with a quartz crystal sensor. The active area of the device was 4.7 mm2.
Device characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2450 source-measure unit. An Oriel Sol3A class AAA solar simulator (model, Newport 94023A), with a 450 W xenon lamp and an air mass (AM) 1.5 filter, was used as the light source. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 by a Newport Oriel 91150V reference cell. The EQE was measured by a solar cell spectral response measurement system (Enli Technology Co., Ltd, QE-R3011). The light intensity was calibrated using a single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell as a standard.

Broader context
Organic solar cells or photovoltaic cells (OPVs) fabricated from organic solutions will become cheap alternatives to commercialized Si based PV cells, due to their large scale production with printing techniques. Recently the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OPVs were enhanced to about 10% by synthesizing new materials, optimizing processes and gaining a deeper understanding of the device physics. However, the large scale OPV production and applications are severely hindered by the high cost of dominant electron acceptors (i.e. fullerene derivatives: PC61BM, PC71BM, and ICBA). Despite the contributions in the rapidly improved efficiencies of OPVs, fullerene derivatives have their own physical and structural insufficiencies such as poor absorption in the visible and NIR region, limited energy level variability by chemical modification and the very high cost of purification and production. In this study, we present a non-fullerene electron acceptor bearing a fused five-heterocyclic ring containing selenium atoms, denoted by IDSe-T-IC. This molecule exhibits low band gap (Eg = 1.52 eV), strong absorption in the 600–850 nm region and a high LUMO level (−3.79 eV). When paired with a large band gap polymer J51 (Eg = 1.91 eV), complementary absorption was obtained in the range of 350–850 nm. The device gives a record PCE of 8.6%, with a Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 15.20 mA cm−2 and a FF of 62.0%. Moreover, this performance is much higher than that of J51:PC71BM solar cells under similar device fabrication conditions (PCE = 6.0%). The trade-off features of the Jsc and Voc existing in fullerene acceptor based solar cells have been minimized in IDSe-T-IC and J51 systems. The results demonstrate that the fine-tuning of non-fullerene materials, properly paired with polymer donor to achieve complementary absorption, is a promising way to further improve the PCEs of solar cells.
