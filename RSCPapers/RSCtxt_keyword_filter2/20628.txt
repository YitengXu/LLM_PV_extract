    , Accepted 10th August 2017First published on 10th August 2017AbstractA new family of perylene diimide (PDI) arrays, heterologous ones (di-PDI and tri-PDI), were designed and efficiently synthesized by Suzuki cross-coupling reactions using two heterologous PDI monomers with different positions of bay- and ortho-substitution, respectively. The compounds exhibit unique photophysical and electrochemical properties and were successfully applied in non-fullerene organic solar cells with a superior power conversion efficiency of 4.55% for tri-PDI.
1. Introduction
Perylene diimide (PDI) arrays, an important type of PDI derivatives, are constructed by coupling PDI monomers directly through chemical bonds (singly-, doubly-, and triply-linked), with no other space linker units.1 Due to their favorable combined properties of exceptional thermal- and photo-stability, high molar extinction coefficient, and excellent electron-transporting abilities, PDI arrays have been utilized in a variety of applications in organic electronics.2 Among them, the singly bonded ones have been successfully used in organic solar cells (OSCs) as electron acceptors because of their better matching energy levels, flexibility and twisted structures.3 In particular, through tailor-made molecular design and synthesis, the singly bonded PDI dimer derivatives have realized great achievement in non-fullerene OSCs, of which the power conversion efficiency (PCE) values are comparable or even superior to those of the corresponding classic fullerene ones.4 Therefore, molecular design is a crucial factor affecting the different properties of the materials.
As we know, the PDI monomer contains two different reactive positions: ortho- (α-) and bay- (β-) positions (Fig. 1a). Because the bay positions of PDI are more reactive toward electrophilic substitutions, bay-substituted PDI derivatives have been more highly studied than ortho-substituted PDI derivatives.5,6 Up to now, all the reported PDI arrays are homologous ones, which are usually synthesized by efficient Ullmann coupling reactions using bay-halogenated PDI monomers (Fig. 1b).7 However, the corresponding heterologous PDI arrays, especially the ones coupled with the bay-position and ortho-position of the PDI (Fig. 1c), are a great challenge to obtain because of the difficulty in the selective reaction of the ortho-positions of PDI. Fortunately, in recent years, new catalytic systems of Ru- and Ir-based catalysts have been developed to specifically catalyze the ortho-positions of PDI, which provides an opportunity to design and synthesize this type of PDI derivative.8 In addition, because of the large contribution to the conjugated structures and electron density distributions, substituent effects at the bay-positions are substantial, while substitution at the ortho-positions has been proved to be less effective to modify the optical and electronic nature of the parent PDI.6,8,9 Compared to the homologous ones, heterologous PDI arrays may exhibit some unique photophysical and electrochemical properties. Inspired by this, we have a desire to achieve this type of heterologous PDI array to investigate their intrinsic properties and photovoltaic properties.

Herein, we present the first examples of heterologous PDI arrays synthesized by Suzuki cross-coupling reactions with two heterologous PDI monomers at the bay-position and ortho-position, respectively. Their photophysical and electrochemical properties are characterized in detail and give some important interesting phenomena. More importantly, these molecules, as non-fullerene electron acceptor materials, have been successfully applied in OSCs with a high PCE of 4.55%.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and characterization
Two heterologous PDI molecules (di-PDI and tri-PDI) were prepared by efficient Suzuki cross-coupling reactions between the ortho-position borate of one PDI and the bay-position bromide of the other PDI (Scheme 1), with high yields of 69% and 75% for di-PDI and tri-PDI, respectively. It should be noted that homologous PDI arrays are usually synthesized by classical Ullmann coupling reactions with the dihalogen- or tetrahalogen-substituted PDI monomers. As a result, a series of homologous PDI arrays with different amounts of oligomers are obtained in one-pot synthesis.7 However, this method is only suitable for the synthesis of homologous PDI arrays, and not for heterologous ones. In addition, it is very difficult to obtain a single PDI array by column chromatography from a series of oligomers. In contrast, the Suzuki cross-coupling reactions, which were used in our synthesis, are suitable for not only homologous PDI arrays but also heterologous ones. Moreover, the different alkyl or aryl groups connected with the imide position of PDI would affect the charge transport, solubility, and morphology of the thin films, and further determine their optoelectronic properties and device performance.10 Therefore, we chose two different alkyl-functionalized (3-pentyl for PDI1 and 8-pentadecyl for PDI2) PDI monomers to construct the heterologous PDI arrays. The target compounds di-PDI and tri-PDI are highly soluble in common organic solvents and fully characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. In addition, the compounds exhibit excellent thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (with 5% weight loss) of 350.1 °C and 383.8 °C for di-PDI and tri-PDI, respectively (see the ESI†).

2.2 Photophysical properties
As shown in Fig. 2a, the three compounds exhibit similar UV-vis absorption spectra in dilute dichloromethane solution and strong absorption with maximum molar extinction coefficients of 9.0 × 104, 9.0 × 104, and 1.2 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for N,N′-bis(1-ethylpropyl)perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid diimide (PDI) (Scheme 1), di-PDI, and tri-PDI, respectively. Compared with that of PDI (524 nm), the maximum absorption peaks of di-PDI (529 nm) and tri-PDI (530 nm) only exhibit small red shifts of 5 nm and 6 nm because of the enlarged conjugation, which indicates that this method of connection with the ortho-position and bay-position almost retains the inherent absorption properties of PDI. In the thin films (Fig. 2b), all the absorption spectra show a relatively broad absorption of 400–600 nm with two peaks at 497 and 538 nm, 498 and 535 nm, and 496 and 533 nm for PDI, di-PDI, and tri-PDI, respectively. Although the corresponding maximum peaks in the films exhibit some red shifts relative to those in solution because of the intermolecular interactions, the values of the red shift become small from 14 nm for PDI to 3 nm for tri-PDI, which reveals that the intermolecular interactions are weakened. More importantly, the ratio of the two maximum peaks has changed a lot, which illustrates that the morphology of the molecular aggregation has also changed greatly. In addition, it is important to note that for PDI, the maximum absorption in solution is the 0–0 peak, but in the thin film, the maximum absorption is the 0−1 peak because of the very strong intermolecular π–π packing. However, from di-PDI to tri-PDI in thin films, the peaks of 0−1 gradually weaken while the peaks of 0−0 become more intense, which reveals that their strong intermolecular aggregation has been efficiently inhibited. All these results could be attributed to the reason that the dimers and trimers form a stereo-conjugated framework in which steric hindrance results in non-coplanar structures. As demonstrated by quantum-chemical calculations using density functional theory (DFT) (see the ESI†), there exist big molecular planar distortions of 65° and 75° for di-PDI and tri-PDI, respectively, between the PDI monomers. All these results indicate that these heterologous PDI arrays could not only retain PDI's unique absorption characteristics but also prevent strong intermolecular aggregation.

2.3 Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to investigate their electrochemical properties (Fig. 3a). Compounds di-PDI and tri-PDI exhibit five and three one-electron reduction waves in dichloromethane, which is more than PDI with two reduction waves. With expansion of the π-conjugated system, the first reduction potentials of the PDI arrays undergo a positive shift from −1.16 V for PDI to −1.07 V for di-PDI, and to −1.09 V for tri-PDI, indicating the increase of electron-accepting abilities. From the onset reduction potentials, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels are estimated to be −3.92, −4.01, and −3.99 eV for PDI, di-PDI, and tri-PDI, respectively.

To obtain further insights into the electronic structures of PDI, di-PDI and tri-PDI, their geometries were optimized by DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G level. As shown in Fig. 3b, compared to PDI, di-PDI and tri-PDI give different electron density distributions. What is more interesting is that the LUMOs are mainly located on the ortho-connected PDI units, while the HOMOs are mainly located on the bay-connected PDI unit. The asymmetry in the location of the HOMO and LUMO indicates that it is possible for charge transfer to occur from the ortho-connected PDI unit to the bay-connected PDI unit, while it is not found in the homologous ones.7d The calculated LUMO levels are −3.64, −3.85 and −3.84 eV for PDI, di-PDI, and tri-PDI, respectively. Although the calculated LUMO energy levels are slightly higher than the observed ones, the regularity of the values is consistent with the experimental data.
2.4 Photovoltaic properties
In order to estimate the photovoltaic properties using the two PDI derivatives as electron acceptors, non-fullerene OSCs were fabricated with an inverted device architecture of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:di-PDI or tri-PDI (1:1)/MoO3/Al, where ITO is indium tin oxide, and ZnO and MoO3 were used as the n- and p-type interfacial layers, respectively, to facilitate charge transport and collection. PTB7-Th, which has complementary absorption with the electron acceptor (see the ESI†) and well-matched energy levels, was chosen as the electron donor. Fig. 4a and Fig. S4–S8 (see the ESI†) show the current density–voltage (J–V) curves, and the photovoltaic performance data are listed in Table 1 and Tables S1–S5 (see the ESI†) for a clear comparison. Firstly, the devices with a varying PTB7-Th:di-PDI (or tri-PDI) mass ratio from 1.5:1 to 1:1.5 were prepared and tested. The device based on PTB7-Th:tri-PDI with a 1:1 blend ratio shows an optimized average PCE of 2.54% with a JSC of 9.36 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.661 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 41.1%. Under the same conditions, the other device based on PTB7-Th:di-PDI gives a relatively low PCE of 1.95% with a JSC of 7.08 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.673 V, and an FF of 40.8%.

To further enhance the performance of the devices, the thermal annealing process and some additives such as 1,8-diodooctane (DIO), chloronaphthalene (CN), and diphenyl ether (DPE) are often used to improve the morphology of the blend films. In our system with an optimal D/A weight ratio of 1:1 (Table S2 and Fig. S5) (see the ESI†), when the thermal annealing temperature is 160 °C, the device exhibits a dominant device performance with a PCE of 3.94%. Then when utilizing different amounts of CN as the additive, all the blend films have obtained the optimal photovoltaic performance, while the PCEs adding DIO and DPE are not improved (Table S3 and Fig. S6) (see the ESI†). It is found that the addition of 2% CN can dramatically improve the JSC value of the devices from 9.36 to 13.41 mA cm−2, accompanied by a slight increase in the VOC and FF values. Therefore, the device based on PTB7-Th:tri-PDI (1:1) with 2% CN additive shows the best performance: a JSC of 13.41 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.713 V, an FF of 40.0%, and a PCE of 3.82%. At the same time, the device based on PTB7-Th:di-PDI also gives an improved PCE of 2.68% with a JSC of 9.98 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.661 V, and an FF of 40.6% (Table S4 and Fig. S7) (see the ESI†). Finally, combined with thermal annealing (160 °C) and an additive of 2% CN (Fig. 4a and Table 1), the devices exhibit the best photovoltaic performances with a PCE of 4.55%, a JSC of 12.61 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.751 V, and an FF of 48.1% and a PCE of 2.84%, a JSC of 10.51 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.661 V, and an FF of 40.9% for PTB7-Th:tri-PDI and PTB7-Th:di-PDI, respectively. In addition, although the homologous PDI trimer array has been synthesized in one-pot synthesis, it is very difficult to obtain a single PDI trimer array by column chromatography from the series of oligomers, and their OSC device performance was not reported.7 A detailed comparison of the homologous and heterologous PDI arrays would be a very interesting study,11 and further studies on comparison are underway and will be presented in a forthcoming paper.
The high JSC values of the devices with 2% CN additive can be confirmed from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimized devices (Fig. 4b). The devices show significant photo-to-current responses in the range of 300–800 nm, which agrees well with the absorption spectra of the donor and acceptor materials (Fig. S3, ESI†). After additive processing, the JSC values are much higher than those of the primitive ones. In particular, for tri-PDI-based devices processed with 2% CN, high EQE values over 50% are observed in a wide range of 450–750 nm, with peak values of about 60% at 520 and 630–680 nm. Therefore, tri-PDI exhibits the best device performance because of the higher JSC values, which is attributed to stronger light absorption properties. The integrated short-circuit current from the EQE spectra is consistent with experimental data obtained from the J–V measurement with a small deviation of less than 5%.
2.5 Charge mobilities
To further investigate the structure–properties–performance relationship of the materials, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was used to measure the hole and electron mobilities with the device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al and ITO/ZnO/active layer/Ca/Al, respectively.12 In the pure film (di-PDI or tri-PDI) SCLC electron-only devices (Fig. 5a), tri-PDI gives a higher electron mobility of 3.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 than that (2.59 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) of di-PDI. In their blend film SCLC devices (Fig. 5b), high hole mobilities of 8.39 × 10−5 and 8.69 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained for the PTB7-Th:di-PDI and PTB7-Th:tri-PDI blend films, respectively. And in the electron-only devices, the relatively low electron mobilities of 1.11 × 10−5 and 1.94 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained for the PTB7-Th:di-PDI and tri-PDI blend films, respectively. By comparing the hole mobilities with the electron ones, the former are much higher than the latter corresponding ones. And the ratios of hole/electron mobilities (μh/μe) are 7.6 and 4.5 for the PTB7-Th:di-PDI and PTB7-Th:tri-PDI blend films, respectively. Obviously, besides the higher electron mobility of pure tri-PDI, the higher carrier mobilities and more balanced carrier transport of the blend film can partially explain the better solar cell performance observed in the tri-PDI OSCs than that of the di-PDI ones.

2.6 Active layer morphology
The nanoscale phase-separation morphology also plays an important role in the performance of the OSC devices. As shown in Fig. 6, the blend films without treatment based on both PTB7-Th:di-PDI and PTB7-Th:tri-PDI show large-size phase-separated domains, and the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values are 14.4 and 10.3 nm, respectively. After the optimization of thermal annealing and additive processing, the surface of the blend films becomes smoother with RMS values of 6.1 and 3.2 nm for the PTB7-Th:di-PDI and PTB7-Th:tri-PDI blends, respectively. In particular, the surface of the PTB7-Th:tri-PDI blend gives a favorable morphology and small-size phase separation, which are in accordance with the much better performance of the PTB7-Th:tri-PDI device.

3. Conclusions
In summary, a new family of PDI arrays, with heterologous PDI oligomers, were designed and synthesized through efficient Suzuki cross-coupling reactions between the ortho-position borate of one PDI monomer and the bay-position bromide of the other PDI monomer. Absorption spectra revealed that the two compounds not only retain the prototype PDI's intrinsic characteristics of strong absorption in the visible light region, but also could prevent strong intermolecular aggregation in the thin films due to the stereo-conjugated molecular configurations. In electrochemical characterization, di-PDI and tri-PDI exhibited more negative LUMO levels of about −4.0 eV, which are slightly lower than that of PDI. A very interesting result is that, for the heterologous PDI arrays, intramolecular charge transfer may exist from one PDI to the other PDI unit. Upon using the two compounds as electron acceptors, the non-fullerene OSC devices based on tri-PDI gave a superior performance of up to 4.55%. All these results indicate that developing heterologous PDI derivatives has provided another way to investigate the non-fullerene electron acceptors for high efficiency OSCs.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Materials and general methods
All reagents were purchased from Aldrich or Acros and used without further purification. The solvents for chemical synthesis were purified according to the standard procedure. Indium-tin oxide (ITO) on glass was purchased from Xiangcheng Science and Technology Co. Ltd. All chemical reactions were carried out under an inert atmosphere.

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a 500 MHz Bruker in CDCl3 at 293 K using TMS as a reference. Accurate mass corrections were measured with a matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (MALDI micro MX). UV-vis spectra were recorded using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Model HP8453) with a 1 cm quartz cell. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded on a BSA100B/W electrochemical workstation using glassy carbon discs as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode, and a Hg/Hg2Cl2 electrode as the reference electrode at a scanning rate of 0.1 V s−1. 0.05 M tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) dissolved in dichloromethane was employed as the supporting electrolyte, which was calibrated by the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the redox couple. The energy of Fc/Fc+ is 5.08 eV relative to vacuum.13 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen flow of 20 mL min−1.
Geometry optimizations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G level by density functional theory (DFT). All the calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 program. To simplify the calculation, alkyl chains were replaced by CH3 groups. AFM measurements were carried out in tapping mode. All film samples were spin-cast on ITO/ZnO substrates under the same conditions of the corresponding OSC devices.
4.2 OSC device fabrication and measurements
ITO glass plates were cleaned in a sonication bath in acetone, isopropyl alcohol and deionized water sequentially, dried by blowing nitrogen, and then treated with O2 plasma for 15 min before use. An about 25 nm thick ITO-modifying layer of ZnO was spin-coated on top of the ITO and then baked for 30 min at 200 °C. Then the PTB7-Th and di-PDI (or tri-PDI) blend liquid was spin-coated on the ZnO layer to get an 80 nm thick film. Finally, MoO3 and Al layers were evaporated on top of the active layer. The device area, the overlap section between the ITO and Al electrodes, was about 7 mm2.
The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit under illumination of simulated sunlight (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) provided by an Oriel Sol3A solar simulator (Newport USA, Model: 94023A) using an AM1.5 filter in ambient air. The IPCE characterization of all devices was performed in ambient air by hypermonolight (SM-25, Jasco Co. Ltd, Japan). A calibrated Si photodiode (818-UV Newport) was used as the reference in order to determine the intensity of incident light on the device, allowing the IPCE spectrum to be deduced.
4.3 SCLC device fabrication and testing
ITO glass plates with a 15 Ω cm−2 resistor were cleaned in a sonication bath in acetone, isopropyl alcohol and deionized water sequentially, dried by blowing nitrogen, and then treated with O2 plasma for 15 min before use. For the electron-only devices, a thin layer (∼25 nm) of ZnO sol–gel was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 40 seconds onto the ITO glasses and annealed at 200 °C in ambient air for one hour and then transferred into a glove box immediately. Active layers were spin-coated using the prepared solutions at 1000 rpm for 30 seconds in the glove box, and the thickness is about 300 nm. After that, the substrate was transferred to a vacuum thermal evaporator, followed by deposition of the Ca/Al (10 nm/100 nm) cathode at a base pressure of 4 × 10−4 Pa. And for the hole-only devices: a thin layer (∼45 nm) of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 40 seconds onto the ITO glasses and annealed at 120 °C in ambient air for 30 min, and then transferred into the glove box. Active layers were spin-coated using the prepared solutions at 1000 rpm for 30 seconds in a glove box, and the thickness is about 300 nm. After that, the substrate was transferred to a vacuum thermal evaporator, followed by deposition of the MoO3/Al (10 nm/100 nm) cathode at a base pressure of 4 × 10−4 Pa. All SCLC devices were characterized with a computer-controlled Keithley 2420 Source Measure Unit.
