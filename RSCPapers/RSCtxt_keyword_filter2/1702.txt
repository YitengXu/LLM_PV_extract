    , Accepted 21st September 2018First published on 27th September 2018AbstractThe recent success of perovskite solar cells is based on two solid pillars: the rapid progress of their power conversion efficiency and their flexibility in terms of optoelectrical properties and processing methods. That versatility makes these devices ideal candidates for multi-junction photovoltaics. We report an optically optimized double junction CH3NH3PbI3–CH3NH3PbI3 tandem solar cell where the matched short-circuit current is maximized while parasitic absorption is minimized. The use of an additive vacuum-deposition protocol allows us to reproduce calculated stack designs, which comprise several charge selective materials that ensure appropriate band alignment and charge recombination. This rationalized configuration yields an unprecedented open circuit voltage of 2.30 V. Furthermore, this tandem solar cell features efficiencies larger than 18%, higher than those of the individual sub-cells. Low photo-current values allow reducing the losses associated to the series resistance of transparent contacts, which opens the door to the realization of efficient large area modules.

Broader context
Metal halide perovskite based solar cells have rapidly evolved to reach power conversion efficiencies around 23% and operational lifetimes in excess of several thousand hours. Significantly higher efficiencies are predicted for solar cells integrating two different bandgap perovskite absorbers. This has however not been achieved to date, due to insufficient increase of photo-voltages when employing wider bandgap perovskite absorbers and due to the difficulty to form perovskite multi-layer stacks from solution processes. Using optically flat and well controlled vapor phase deposited layers, the optical constants of all layers in a tandem solar cell were determined. These results were employed to calculate the ideal configuration for a tandem cell based on two sub-cells with the same perovskite absorber. The tandem stack design is crucial requiring that both sub-cells generate the same current. The targeted film thicknesses were experimentally reproduced using industrial scale compatible vapor phase deposition methods. As a result, solar cells exhibiting an open-circuit voltage of 2.3 volts were obtained. Besides their application in photovoltaic conversion, such high voltages enable their use as photovoltaic-driven electrochemical cells, including direct power conversion from solar to chemical fuels (water splitting hydrogen production) and carbon dioxide reduction.

Introduction
The use of multiple absorbers in multi-junction solar cells has been demonstrated as a successful strategy to push the power conversion efficiencies (PCE)1 in several photovoltaic technologies further. Such a device architecture is based on the combination of two or more light absorbers that allow harvesting a broad region of the solar spectrum with lower thermalization losses than a single junction device.2 Among the different architectures, monolithic (or two-terminal) tandem solar cells lead to an easier management of the generated power and a considerable cost reduction since a lower amount of transparent conductive materials is required. In this monolithic configuration, where all the sub-cells are connected in series, the current through the different sub-cells is ideally the same, while their voltages are added. As a result devices showing high PCE with lower current densities can be demonstrated, which reduces the losses related to series resistance at the contacts and, thus, enabling larger area solar cells.3 In addition, the intrinsic high voltage in such systems is interesting per se for other applications such as photovoltaic-driven electrochemical cells, including direct power conversion from solar to chemical fuels (water splitting hydrogen production) and carbon dioxide reduction.4,5
In organic photovoltaics, the combination of the same absorber for each junction was used to circumvent low mobilities of the used materials. In this case, a thick-film solar cell is split into two thin sub-cells, which shortens the distance that charges must travel to be collected and facilitates an efficient light harvesting.6–12 Due to their easily tunable optoelectronic properties and processability,13 perovskites are excellent candidates for tandem devices. Perovskite solar cells have been used in combination with silicon based solar cells leading to PCE's of 25%14–16 for four-terminal and two-terminal configurations, respectively. Also, the combination with CIGS in a four terminal approach has led to tandem cells with a PCE exceeding 20%.17,18 Aiming at providing a true candidate for the widespread use of an emerging PV technology, recently, perovskite–perovskite tandems have been demonstrated, reaching PCE's above 20% for four-terminal and 18% for two-terminal tandem configurations.19–25 In general, reports use different perovskites for each sub-cell, with an optimized combination of band-gaps according to the detailed balance model.26 The currently main limitation of these tandem cells is the limited open circuit voltage (Voc) generated by the wider bandgap perovskite absorber. In all above-mentioned reports, the Voc of the wide bandgap perovskite sub-cell is limited to 1.2 V, except when pure-bromide perovskites are used. Their bandgap is however larger than 2.2 eV which does not lead to sufficient high currents for their use in two terminal tandem cells.2,24,27 Therefore, it is of interest to examine the potential of double junction solar cells using the same CH3NH3PbI3 absorber in both sub-cells. Although this configuration will not benefit from reduced thermalization losses, it still has the previously mentioned multi-junction advantages of high voltages and reduced currents. Furthermore, charge recombination layers developed for homo-tandems can be directly applied on hetero-tandems, as previously reported.28 Nevertheless, perovskite tandems using the same absorber in both sub-cells have not been optimized so far. To this end, it becomes necessary to develop optical optimization tools accounting for the light absorption in the different materials comprising the device, as has been previously demonstrated for single junction perovskite solar cells.29,30 However, the complex nature of the multilayered tandem device would require a technique capable of accurately reproducing the layer thicknesses extracted from the optical modelling. In this regard, vacuum processing has been extensively used for perovskite deposition with control over the film thickness at the nanometer scale. Not only for perovskite layers, but also for fully evaporated single junction devices.31–33 Vacuum processing is an additive technique by nature, which makes it extremely suitable for tandem applications.34 The deposition is realized at room temperature and complex layer structures can be sublimed to secure low ohmic losses and high transparency.35
Here we report an optical model that, combined with a genetic algorithm, allows the optimization of the monolithic tandem layout. Using this optical model, efficient CH3NH3PbI3/CH3NH3PbI3 vacuum-deposited tandem solar cells with open circuit voltages close to the theoretical limits are developed. The spectral behavior of the external quantum efficiency of the tandem solar cells matches with that predicted by the calculations. The proposed tandem design reaches an efficiency higher than the respective sub-cells, with a Voc of 2.3 V, the highest obtained to-date for any monolithic perovskite-based solar cell. In addition, lower current densities avoid transparent conductive oxide's high resistance losses3 and enable a perfect recombination layer based on a combination of doped electron and hole transporting layers. This allows the preparation of devices with larger active area without losses in the fill factor (FF).
Results and discussion
The development of an efficient CH3NH3PbI3/CH3NH3PbI3 tandem photovoltaic device requires the optimization of the light absorption in every sub-cell to avoid current mismatch. The materials of choice derive from previous work in which we demonstrate fully evaporated single junction devices where organic charge selective contacts are employed to attain appropriate band alignment.35 In order to calculate the fraction of the incident light absorbed by each layer in the stack, the optical constants of the different materials comprising the device were determined for individual thin films with a high optical quality fabricated using a sublimation based deposition protocol. Fig. 1a and b depict SEM images of a cross section of films of CH3NH3PbI3 and C60, respectively (see also Fig. S1, ESI†). The films exhibit plane-parallel interfaces over large distances, which results in high optical quality materials with negligible light scattering, suitable for an in-depth spectroscopic characterization. The spectral dependence of light transmitted and reflected at different angles and polarizations of the incident beam (see ESI†) was measured. Based on both the structural and optical characterization, the real (n) and imaginary (k) parts of the complex refractive index of the films of interest were extracted (see ESI†).29 To illustrate this, Fig. 1c displays the comparison between measured and calculated specular reflectance and ballistic transmittance of a 65 nm-thick C60 film demonstrating excellent agreement (see also Fig. S2, ESI†). Fig. 1d shows the complex refractive indices of TaTm, C60 and CH3NH3PbI3. Note that the full set of optical constants of vacuum-deposited intrinsic and doped organic layers along with that of methylammonium lead iodine perovskite are provided, to our knowledge for the first time (see Fig. S3, ESI†). Similar optical constants for vacuum deposited CH3NH3PbI3 as obtained by us were reported by Meredith et al.36 Having determined the optical constants of the individual films, this now allows for the optical modeling of a CH3NH3PbI3/CH3NH3PbI3 tandem solar cell. The proposed configuration comprises a monolithic combination of two vacuum-deposited CH3NH3PbI3 sub-cells. The front sub-cell is formed by a fully evaporated stack on a solution-processed titanium dioxide (TiO2) electron selective layer (ESL), which is deposited on a transparent contact. This configuration was selected as it yields the highest open circuit voltages among pure CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells in a single junction configuration (1.17 V).37 The back sub-cell employs instead of the TiO2/C60 a doped C60/intrinsic C60 as ESL.35 The fully evaporated recombination layer consists of a combination of organic materials, intrinsic (TaTm) and doped (TaTm:F6-TCNNQ), which allows the extraction of the photogenerated holes of the front cell, along with doped (C60:Phlm) and intrinsic (C60) layers to extract the electrons of the back cell (details in Experimental section). The combined intrinsic and doped layers are referred to hole and electron selective layers (HSL and ESL, respectively). The direct connection of both doped materials assures a proper electrical contact in the recombination layer with low optical losses,24 whereas the intrinsic layers enhance the charge selectivity and reduce surface recombination. The device is completed with a thicker layer of the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber and the TaTm/TaTm:F6-TCNNQ hole extraction layers with the Au contact, as depicted in Fig. 2a. Fabrication details are available in the ESI.†

We combine our optical model with a generic algorithm to find the device configuration that results in optimum light harvesting. In order to do that, the spatial and spectral variation of the electric field intensity throughout the complete stack of the evaluated tandem cell architecture are calculated (Fig. 2b). Then, the Jsc for each sub-cell is extracted by estimating the actual amount of light absorbed in each perovskite layer (productive absorption displayed in Fig. 2c). Light penetration in the device depends strongly on the incident wavelength. Calculations indicate that most of the high-energy photons are absorbed within the first few nanometers of the front CH3NH3PbI3 layer. At the same time, this layer is thin enough as to allow low-energy photons to be harvested by the back perovskite layer (see blue and red lines in Fig. 2c). Our optimization model maximizes the short circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of both front and back sub-cells while the photocurrent mismatch is minimized. This method allows us to attain an optimum configuration by evaluating a few thousands of architectures in which the thicknesses of the different layers present in the system are varied at the same time. Table 1 summarizes the result of the optimization, indicating the thickness of each layer in the best-performing device. The thickness of front and back CH3NH3PbI3 layers are rather dissimilar (95 nm vs. 420 nm) and yield Jsc values of front and back cells of 10.35 mA cm−2 and 10.21 mA cm−2, respectively, which give rise to an effectively minimized photocurrent mismatch (0.14 mA cm−2). At the same time, these results indicate that the thickness of both ESL and HSL materials should be kept below 40 nm to minimize the impact of parasitic absorption, which is more critical for those organic layers that are at the front side of the cell.

Based on this design, CH3NH3PbI3/CH3NH3PbI3 tandem solar cells were prepared with the layout depicted in Fig. 2b and with layer thicknesses close to the optimized ones from the calculations, which are listed in Table 1. Small deviations between the calculated optimum values and the experimental ones are due to the need of maintaining the thickness of intrinsic charge transport layers as low as possible, to compensate for their low charge mobility. As for the perovskite absorbers, the deviations between calculated and experimental values are due to small experimental variations (plus or minus 25 nm). Table 1 shows average experimental values.
An initial study of the individual sub-cells is useful to understand the working conditions of the tandem. Therefore, single-junction CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells were prepared with a structure equivalent to that of each of the sub-cells, in the 2T tandem structure. Specifically, the structure of the analyzed devices was ITO/TiO2/C60/CH3NH3PbI3/TaTm/TaTm:F6-TCNNQ/Au with an absorber thickness of 90 nm as a reference for the front cell; and ITO/C60:PhIm/C60/CH3NH3PbI3/TaTm/TaTm:F6-TCNNQ/Au with a perovskite thickness of 400 nm as a reference for the back cell. We have calculated EQE of individual sub-cells assuming that all light absorbed by the CH3NH3PbI3 layers is converted into photocurrent. Using the 2T tandem and both single junction cells the EQE of these cells were also experimentally determined (details in the ESI†). Fig. 2d displays the comparison between experimental and calculated values. The current density calculated from the single junction devices is reported in the ESI† (Fig. S7). Our model reproduces the optical features observed for both individual front and back cells fairly well.
The current–voltage (J–V) curves under 100 mW cm−2 illumination of the tandem and single junction reference cells are depicted in Fig. 3. The front single junction reference cell shows a very high fill factor (FF) over 80%, which is indicative of the optimum charge transport and low extraction barrier at the contacts. The former can be attributed to the thickness of the perovskite, thinner than in standard perovskite solar cells, whereas the excellent extraction by the employed contacts had been previously reported.35,37 Similarly, the achieved Voc, 1.19 V and 1.13 V for the front and back single junction cells respectively, indicate low recombination rates dominating the devices’ performance. The value obtained for the thinnest device, 1.19 V, is to the best of our knowledge the highest one obtained for pure CH3NH3PbI3 based solar cell. It exhibits only 410 mV deficit with respect to the bandgap value calculated from the absorption, very close to the theoretical limit.38,39 This is a clear sign of reduced non-radiative losses, with minimized bulk recombination (in line with the thin absorber layer), and optimized interfaces.37 In contrast, the relatively low short circuit current (Jsc) of the devices, 12.5 and 18.7 mA cm−2 for front and back cells respectively, limits the power conversion efficiency to ∼12% and ∼17%, as predicted with our optical model for thin absorbers layers. To mirror the conditions of the back single junction sub-cell in the tandem configuration, it was also measured under filtered illumination. The filter consists of a glass/CH3NH3PbI3 sample with perovskite thickness similar to that of the front cell. Consequently, the Voc was marginally reduced and the Jsc is reduced by approximately 50%: the FF however increased slightly, probably related to the reduced influence of the series resistance when a smaller current density is extracted. Table 2 summarizes the results.

Fig. 3 also shows the J–V curve of the monolithic tandem cell. The forward (from Jsc to Voc) and reverse (from Voc to Jsc) J–V curves are depicted and show an almost negligible hysteresis. The FF remains high (>80%), which highlights the quality of the charge recombination layer (CRL). Notably, a Voc as high as 2305 mV is observed, very close to the sum of the photovoltages of each reference cell (front cell plus filtered back cell). The Jsc of the tandem is 9.84 mA cm−2, slightly lower than the one calculated from the simulations (10.16 mA cm−2) that consider the same layer thicknesses as the ones experimentally achieved. This value, however, is higher than that observed for the filtered reference back cell, which had a Jsc of 7.52 mA cm−2. This value would be expected to be the limiting value for the tandem cell performance as the front and back cells are in series in the 2T configuration. In order to confirm the measured current, the tandem's external quantum efficiency was determined by pulsed light controlled by a monochromator and a lock-in amplifier, while a background white light ensured the proper extraction of the charges (Fig. 2d). Comparing the integrated Jsc, we observe that the one of the tandem is 1.8 mA cm−2 higher than the Jsc of the reference back cell filtered (Table 2), which confirms that the back sub-cell limitation in current is much lower than deducted from the standalone reference back cell Jsc. The origin of the mismatch between the filtered back cell and tandem back subcell is related to the optical losses in the glass/perovskite sample used as filter (Fig. S8, ESI†). As a result, the tandem achieves a power conversion efficiency of 18.02%, which exceeds the PCEs of both reference cells.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated operational CH3NH3PbI3–CH3NH3PbI3 tandem solar cells with PCEs similar to single junction devices (>18%), yet with a strongly reduced current density and a very high open circuit voltage (2.3 volts). Using carefully determined optical constants of all the layers in the stack and an optical model the ideal configuration of the tandem was accurately predicted. This was verified by comparing the simulated and the measured external quantum efficiency curves, which show a good resemblance. The use of molecular based charge recombination layers leads to very low voltage losses and allows for the very high open circuit voltage of the tandem stack. These results validate the use of vapor process for the development of complex perovskite device architectures such as tandems. This approach opens the path to the preparation of devices with larger active area without losses in the fill factor.

Broader context
Metal halide perovskite based solar cells have rapidly evolved to reach power conversion efficiencies around 23% and operational lifetimes in excess of several thousand hours. Significantly higher efficiencies are predicted for solar cells integrating two different bandgap perovskite absorbers. This has however not been achieved to date, due to insufficient increase of photo-voltages when employing wider bandgap perovskite absorbers and due to the difficulty to form perovskite multi-layer stacks from solution processes. Using optically flat and well controlled vapor phase deposited layers, the optical constants of all layers in a tandem solar cell were determined. These results were employed to calculate the ideal configuration for a tandem cell based on two sub-cells with the same perovskite absorber. The tandem stack design is crucial requiring that both sub-cells generate the same current. The targeted film thicknesses were experimentally reproduced using industrial scale compatible vapor phase deposition methods. As a result, solar cells exhibiting an open-circuit voltage of 2.3 volts were obtained. Besides their application in photovoltaic conversion, such high voltages enable their use as photovoltaic-driven electrochemical cells, including direct power conversion from solar to chemical fuels (water splitting hydrogen production) and carbon dioxide reduction.
