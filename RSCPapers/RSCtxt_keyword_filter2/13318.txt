    , Accepted 21st December 2019First published on 24th December 2019AbstractWe developed perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a ZnO electron-transporting layer (ETL) of which the surface was passivated with methoxybenzoic acid self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). The self-assembled monolayer (SAM) simultaneously improved the photovoltaic performance and device stability. First, the methoxybenzoic acid, which is noncovalently bonded to the methylammonium of the perovskite layer, effectively induced dipole moments; in particular, 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid (TMBA) gave a larger workfunction shift of ZnO ETL compared with 4-methoxybenzoic acid (MBA) and 3,4-dimethoxybenzoic acid (DMBA) owing to its strong dipole moment and hydrogen-bonding between the methoxy group and ammonium. This effectively enhanced the built-in voltage of the perovskite solar cell (PSC) device, which resulted in an improved electron transfer from the active layer to the ETL and a higher open-circuit voltage. Secondly, the SAM layer controlled the wettability of the perovskite precursor solution on the ZnO ETL and significantly improved the crystalline properties of the perovskite layer. Moreover, the ZnO/SAM ETL remarkably increased the PSC device stability under ambient conditions by preventing the proton transfer reaction between the perovskite layer and the ZnO ETL. As a result, the TMBA-SAM based PSC device achieved a significantly enhanced efficiency of 13.75% compared to 1.44% for the bare ZnO with high long-term stability.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites have attracted remarkable attention as the most promising candidates for photoactive materials for solar cell applications due to their outstanding electronic properties such as a high absorption coefficient (>3 × 104 cm−1), a small exciton binding energy (<50 meV) and a long carrier diffusion length (∼175 μm at single crystal).1–5 The certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) utilizing hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites as light absorbers have increased from 2.8% to 25.2% in a short period, which is comparable to that of commercialized crystalline silicon solar cells.6 Such a notable result was achieved by synergistic developments in the processing engineering and the material composition of the perovskite active layer, device architectures, and interfacial engineering of the active and charge transporting layers.7–9
In PSCs, the electron-transporting layer (ETL) is a key element for achieving a high solar cell performance; the ETL ensures rapid charge transport without charge recombination from the perovskite active layer to the individual electrodes, and TiO2 is the most widely used ETL because it has a high photostability and appropriate energy levels for efficient charge transfer.8,10–12 However, a high temperature annealing process over 500 °C is necessary to prepare high quality TiO2 ETL, which can hinder scalable PSC production and application to flexible devices. ZnO has been considered as a promising alternative to the TiO2 ETLs because it provides good physical properties, a higher electron mobility and optical transmittance in the visible range compared with TiO2.13–17 Also, ZnO is easily solution-processed at low temperatures of 200 °C and thus is potentially applicable to flexible PSC devices.10 In a typical flexible-type PSC, flexible plastic substrates, such as poly(ethyl benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate) (PET) and poly(ethylene-2,6-naphthalate) (PEN), are commonly used. To fabricate PET or PEN substrate-based flexible devices, low temperature processability is required because the flexible PET or PEN has a relatively lower melting temperature (PET: 260 °C, PEN: 270 °C). Thus, ZnO is potentially applicable to flexible PSC devices. Recently, with surface modified-ZnO ETLs, Lim et al. demonstrated PSCs on flexible substrates which exhibit an average PCE of 11.9% under low-temperature fabrication.18 Furthermore, Dou et al. demonstrated that a flexible perovskite solar cell employing the In-doped ZnO (IZO) achieved the highest efficiency of 18.1% among the ZnO ETL-based flexible devices owing to the high open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF).19 However, there is a critical limitation which prevents the utilization of the ZnO ETL in PSC devices. The perovskite photoactive layer deposited on the ZnO ETL is easily decomposed.14,20 The surface of ZnO tends to be more basic compared to that of TiO2, with isoelectric points higher than 8.7, and the isoelectric point of TiO2 is 4–8.14,21,22 Therefore, during the thermal annealing of perovskite deposited on ZnO, deprotonation reactions take place between the hydroxyl group of the ZnO ETLs and perovskite, resulting in the degradation of the perovskite film into a PbI2 precursor as described in eqn (1)–(3).20,23 OH− + CH3NH3I → CH3NH3OH + I−(1) CH3NH3OH + heat → CH3NH3↑ + H2O↑(2) CH3NH3I + PbI2 ↔ CH3NH3PbI3(3)
As shown in eqn (1), the OH− on the surface of the ZnO transfers to CH3NH3I to form CH3NH3OH. During the perovskite thermal annealing at 100 °C, this CH3NH3OH can be easily degraded to CH3NH3 and H2O (eqn (2)), which further accelerates the reaction of eqn (1). Obviously, the deprotonation reaction of the methylammonium cations on the perovskite crystal structure leads to the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 as described in the reverse process of eqn (3).
There have been research trials performed resolve this problem, which have included the doping of ZnO ETLs, two-step perovskite film deposition, and interface modification. Among them, the surface engineering of ZnO ETLs has proven to be an effective way to improve the solar cell efficiency by enhancing the charge extraction properties of ETLs so that the charge carrier recombination can be effectively suppressed.10,24–26 In addition, the surface modification of the ZnO ETLs can control the morphology and crystallinity of the upper perovskite crystals, which can influence the electrical properties of the perovskite photoactive layer. Based on these effects, many promising results were reported for the interface modified ZnO-based PSCs. Recently, polyethyleneimine (PEI) and polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE) were found to be the most commonly used materials as interfacial modifiers of the surface of ZnO ETLs because of their high dipole effect induced by the amine functional groups, which can control the workfunction of the ZnO ETLs to facilitate the charge extraction from the perovskite to the ETLs.27–31 However, the insulating properties of these polymers can decrease the charge transporting properties of the ETLs and thus the solar cell efficiency.32
Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of organic molecules on ETLs have been considered as an alternative to the conventional polymer surface modifier. SAMs are organic molecules that can chemically adsorb onto the surface of a metal or metal oxide to form thin and stable molecular assemblies. SAM molecules typically consist of three different parts; anchoring groups (also referred to as head groups), linkers, and functional groups (also referred to as terminal groups).26 Once the SAM molecules are introduced to the surface of the metal atoms, the anchoring groups of the organic molecules (e.g., silane, carboxylic acid and phosphonic acid) form a mono- or bidentate coordination with metal atoms through the condensation reaction. Unlike the case of the metal atoms, only monodentate coordination is possible when binding to the surface hydroxyl group, confirming that the anchoring group of SAM and the hydroxyl group of the metal oxide ETLs (e.g., ZnO, SnO2 and TiO2) can form a monodentate coordination bond. The monodentate binding is formed by etching the surface hydroxyl groups of the metal oxide ETLs and releasing a water molecule, and the functional groups can tune the electrical properties of the ETL surfaces.33,34 Chen et al. first employed 3-aminopropanoic acid (C3-SAM) on the surface of the ZnO ETLs and with the incorporation of the SAMs, the workfunction of the ZnO ETLs was modified to give better alignment of the energy levels.35 As a result, the PCE significantly enhanced from 11.96% to 15.67%. A number of SAM organic molecules such as 3-(aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES), ethanolamine, and 1,2-ethanedithiol have been investigated as surface modifiers of the ETLs to form SAM layers.36–38 However, although these SAM layers are effective for improving the device stability, the PSC device showed a relatively low performance because the high crystalline perovskite grain growth was suppressed by the functional groups of the SAM layers.
Herein, we developed a strategy to simultaneously enhance the PSC performance and the device thermal stability of ZnO-based PSCs by systematically investigating the effects of three different benzoic acid derivatives as the SAM layer on the ZnO ETLs: 4-methoxybenzoic acid (MBA), 3,4-dimethoxybenzoic acid (DMBA), and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid (TMBA). We found that the methoxybenzoic acid, which is noncovalently bonded to the methylammonium of the perovskite layer induced dipole moments at the interface. TMBA formed a larger built-in voltage in the device compared with MBA and DMBA owing to its strong dipole moment and the hydrogen-bonding between the methoxy group and ammonium. Also, the methoxy group of the SAM layer affects the perovskite crystal growth with different grain sizes and crystallinity, which can suppress the recombination at the perovskite photoactive layers. As a result, the PCE of the device was enhanced from 1.44 to 13.75% after employing the optimized SAM interlayer, which was mainly ascribed to the significantly increased VOC. We proved that methoxybenzoic acid-based SAMs on ZnO ETLs are a simple and effective method of preparing high performance PSCs with a high device stability.

Lead(II) iodide 99.9985% (PbI2), 4-methoxybenzoic acid 98+% and 3,4-dimethoxybenzoic acid 99% were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was purchased from Greatcell solar. Spiro-OMeTAD was purchased from Borun New Material Technology Limited.
Synthesis and fabrication of the ZnO sol–gel ETL film
Zinc acetate dehydrate (1.64 g) with 0.5 g of ethanolamine was dissolved in 10 mL of 2-methoxyethanol. The resulting ZnO sol–gel solution was filtered using a PVDF syringe filter (0.2 μm), and spin-coated onto the ITO/glass substrate at 5000 rpm for 50 s, followed by an annealing step at 200 °C for 30 min. To deposit the SAM layer, 0.7 mg mL−1 of three different benzoic acid derivatives were dissolved in methanol and stirred for 6 h at room temperature. The ITO/ZnO substrate was soaked in the SAMs solution for 24 h and washed with methanol solvent to remove the physically adsorbed SAM molecules. After washing, the substrate was dried under an N2 gas flow.
Device fabrication
The ITO/glass substrate was washed in acetone, isopropyl alcohol and deionized water with ultrasonic treatment for 20 min at each step. After washing, the substrate was dried under an N2 gas flow and subjected to O2 plasma treatment. The sol–gel ZnO ETLs were spin-coated onto the ITO/glass substrate, followed by a consecutive annealing process. Additionally, the optimized concentration of the SAM solution was deposited onto the substrate using the dip-coating method and the substrate was washed with methanol solvent. 1 M of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite precursor solution was synthesized by dissolving stoichiometric quantities of lead iodide and methylammonium iodide in a mixture of DMSO/GBL (1:1 v/v). The perovskite solution was stirred at 70 °C for 2 h and filtered using a PTFE syringe filter (0.2 μm). After this, the solution was spin-coated onto the ITO/ZnO substrate via a 2-step consecutive speed spin-coating process at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for 60 s, sequentially. During the second step of the spin-coating process, 1000 μL of chlorobenzene was dropped onto the center of the perovskite film as an antisolvent to promote crystallization of the perovskite grains. The substrate was then annealed at 100 °C for 1 h for crystallization of the perovskite layer. For preparing the hole transporting layers, 63 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 20 μL of tBP, and 70 μL of Li-TFSI (170 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) was dissolved into 1 mL of chlorobenzene. The solution was then spin-coated on the substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s without a further annealing step. Finally, 100 nm of Au film was thermally evaporated as a top electrode under vacuum conditions. The above described device fabrication method is illustrated in Fig. S10.†
Characterization
The optical measurements of ZnO ETLs and perovskite film were performed using ultraviolet-visible-near infrared spectrometry (Varian Technology, Cary 5000). Steady-state photoluminescence was obtained using a Photon Technologies International, QuantaMaster 400 scanning spectrofluorometer at 298 K. The critical feature of the perovskite crystal structure was measured using wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu-Kα radiation (D/max RA, Rigaku Co). To measure the surface morphology of the ZnO ETLs and the perovskite film, atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode (Digital Instruments Dimension 3100 scanning force microscope) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JEOL, JSM-6700F) were used respectively.

Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. 
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) spectra of the ZnO ETLs before and after surface modification were measured using a PHI-5000 ultrahigh vacuum surface analysis system with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray (hν = 21.22 eV) under ultrahigh vacuum conditions (<1 × 10−6 Pa). The workfunctions (ϕ) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels (EHOMO) of the ZnO ETLs with and without SAM surface modifications were calculated from the binding energy cutoff (Ecutoff) and the binding energy onset (Eonset) of the UPS spectra, using eqn (4) and (5) respectively. ϕ = hν − Ecutoff(4) EHOMO = ϕ + Eonset(5)In which, hν = 21.22 eV is the incoming photon energy from the He I source. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level (ELUMO) of the ZnO ETLs was further calculated using the bandgap energy of the ETLs (Eg) obtained from the UV-Vis spectra and EHOMO using eqn (6). ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg(6)


Device characterization. 
A class AAA solar simulator was used to measure the J–V characteristics of the devices with a scanning rate of 0.05 V A−1 from the reverse bias using a Keithley 2400 instrument. The AM 1.5 (1 sun, 100 mW cm−2) solar power was calibrated using a silicon reference solar cell and supplied to the device. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the solar cell was measured (HS Technology Inc.). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were measured under a simulated AM 1.5 G illumination intensity of 1 mA cm−2 (McScience Inc.) using an electrochemical measurement system (InviumStat.XR, Invium Technologies). The EIS measurements were performed using a frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 MHz.

Results and discussion
The configuration of the ZnO ETLs-based conventional PSCs and a schematic diagram of the formation of SAMs on the ZnO ETLs are illustrated in Fig. 1. Three different types of benzoic acid derivatives, MBA, DMBA, and TMBA were employed to form a self-assembled structure on the surface of ZnO ETLs and the molecular structures of these three SAMs are displayed in Fig. S1.† The carboxyl functional groups of SAMs can react with the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the ZnO ETLs to induce a condensation reaction at the interface between the ZnO ETLs and the SAMs interlayers (Fig. 1b).39 Benzoic acid is a representative ligand which can effectively bind to a metal oxide and tune the physical properties of the resulting organo-metal complex. The methoxy group can form an O–H hydrogen bonding with a methylammonium (MA) cation in the perovskite layer which can effectively suppress the deprotonation reaction between the methylammonium cation and the hydroxyl group of ZnO. Furthermore, the partial plus charge on the methoxy group may induce a dipole moment at the interface and thus enhance the internal field in the device. We calculated the dipole moments of the complex structure of the methoxybenzoic acid derivatives and the methylammonium cation as shown in Fig. 1c. The resulting dipole moments are 10.6302, 13.5606, and 13.2981 D, respectively and therefore, multiple substitutions of the methoxy group give a higher dipole moment. TMBA did not show a further increment in the dipole moment from DMBA because the excessive substitution of the methoxy group can increase the strength of the hydrogen bonding and delocalize the generated charge on the benzoic acid as the methoxy group is electron-donating. In the results of the density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the MA-SAM complex, the bond length between the oxygen atoms of the methoxy group on SAM and the hydrogen atoms of the methylammonium cation on the perovskite is lower than 2.5 Å, confirming that the SAM and the perovskite form the hydrogen bonding.

To prepare the SAM layer of the methoxybenzoic acid derivative, the ZnO ETLs film was dipped in the SAMs solution for more than 24 h to sufficiently induce the condensation reaction. Herein, we refer to the pristine ZnO as ZnO and the benzoic acid derivative modified ZnO as ZnO/MBA, ZnO/DMBA and ZnO/TMBA respectively. Fig. 1d shows the energy band diagrams of the optimized device and the dotted lines on ZnO indicate the workfunction of the ZnO ETLs.
The surface morphology images of the unmodified and modified ZnO ETLs were characterized using topographical AFM measurements and the results are shown in Fig. 2a–d and S2.† The root-mean-square (RMS) value of the bare ZnO obtained from the AFM measurement is 0.92 nm, while this value decreased to 0.45, 0.42 and 0.89 after surface modification of ZnO with MBA, DMBA and TMBA, respectively. The reduced surface roughness suggests that each of the SAMs was effectively formed by anchoring the carboxylic group to the ZnO and the surfaces of ZnO were uniformly covered by the SAM molecules. To further confirm the deposition of SAMs on the surface of ZnO, the surface wettability of the unmodified and modified ZnO ETLs was investigated by measuring the water contact angles of each ZnO ETL. As seen in Fig. 2e–h, the water contact angle of the ZnO surface significantly increased from 23.66° to 51.05, 51.12 and 51.18° after being modified with MBA, DMBA and TMBA respectively, which indicates the enhanced hydrophobic properties of ZnO surfaces. This is probably because the hydrophilic hydroxyl groups on the ZnO surface were replaced with the more hydrophobic methoxy groups of SAMs.

It was demonstrated that the chemical interaction between the perovskite and the charge transporting layer can affect the morphology of the upper perovskite layer, especially in the case of the perovskite film being formed by a one-step process.35,40–43 Thus, the effects of SAM treatment on the morphology of the perovskite films coated on the ZnO ETLs were studied by measuring the XRD and the top-view SEM images. We prepared the perovskite films by spin-coating using a one-step deposition process followed by a 100 °C thermal annealing step. Fig. 3a shows the XRD results of the perovskite films deposited on four different ZnO/SAM-based ETLs. All of the samples show the intense diffraction peaks at 14°, 28° and 31°, which are attributed to the (110), (220) and (310) crystal planes of the 3D cubic perovskite structures respectively. It is demonstrated that the perovskite film spin-coated on the ZnO ETLs without any SAM shows a low thermal stability because the CH3NH3PbI3 3D perovskite structure is decomposed into PbI2 after the 100 °C thermal annealing process, as indicated by the increase of the (001) PbI2 diffraction peak. Consistently, as seen in the photographs of the perovskite film deposited on the ZnO ETLs in Fig. S3,† a brownish perovskite film was observed right after spin-coating of the perovskite solution on top of the ZnO ETLs in the first 3 min of the thermal annealing process, but the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film was decomposed to the PbI2 precursor after annealing the film for longer than 5 min, which is depicted by the color change of the brownish film to a yellow color. On the other hand, the characteristic features of the 3D perovskite structure were conserved when the perovskite film was spin-coated on the SAM modified ZnO ETLs, because the direct contact between the perovskite layer and the ZnO ETLs, which can induce the decomposition of the perovskite layer by thermal annealing, is blocked by the SAM interlayers. As shown in the XRD results, the intensities of the critical diffraction peaks of the 3D perovskite structure are significantly enhanced after SAMs treatment, suggesting that the perovskite crystallinity is enhanced when it is deposited on the SAM modified ZnO ETLs. This is probably because the SAMs favorably influence the growth of the perovskite crystal domains. It is reported that the perovskite crystallinity can be increased if the perovskite nucleation is suppressed and the critical radius for the nucleation is increased. This can extend the perovskite nucleation time enough to generate highly crystallized perovskite layers.44,45 This mechanism of enhancing the nucleation time of the perovskite is summarized in Fig. S4.† Similar trends can be observed in the top-view SEM images of the perovskite films as represented in Fig. 3b–e. Statistical distributions of the perovskite grain sizes were obtained using ImageJ software and the results are represented in Fig. S5.† Larger perovskite grains were observed from the SAM modified ZnO compared to those of the pristine ZnO, which is attributed to the reduction of the ZnO surface wettability. The average grain size of the perovskite on the pristine ZnO is around 135 nm, whereas the size is significantly enhanced up to 180 nm for the perovskite deposited on the ZnO/SAM.

Fig. S6† shows the results of the optical transmittance measurements of the ZnO deposited glass substrates with and without SAMs treatment. In the visible light wavelength range (from 380 to 780 nm), the ZnO/glass substrate shows a high optical transmittance above 90%, which is even higher when compared to the conventional TiO2 ETLs under the same thickness conditions (Fig. S7†). The transmittance of ZnO is kept almost the same after SAM treatment, suggesting that the introduction of SAM interlayers on the surface of ZnO does not reduce the optical transparency of the final ZnO ETL-based PSCs. We extracted Tauc plots from the UV-Vis absorption spectra (Fig. S6†) to further analyze the optical bandgap energy (Eg) of each of the ETLs and the results are given in Fig. 4a and S8.†46 The bandgap energy of the pristine ZnO was obtained and was found to be 3.22 eV, which is in excellent agreement with the reference value and does not change after three types of treatment with SAM interlayers (Fig. S8†), which demonstrates that the SAM interlayer treatment does not affect the bandgap energy of the bottom ZnO layers. To elucidate the interfacial effects induced by the introduction of SAM interlayers, the energy levels of the unmodified and SAM modified ZnO were analyzed using UPS, as shown in Fig. 4b and S9.† In Fig. 4b, the left hand side represents the enlarged binding energy cutoff region and the enlarged binding energy onset region is shown on the right.46,47 The workfunction values and the HOMO energy level values of the four different ZnO ETLs are estimated from the binding energy cutoff region and the onset region respectively. The LUMO energy levels of the ZnO ETLs can be derived from the optical bandgap energy (Eg) obtained from the Tauc plots (Fig. 4a) and the HOMO energy levels. The workfunction and the LUMO energy level values of each of the ZnO ETLs extracted from the optical transmittance and the UPS measurements are summarized in Table 1. The binding energy cutoff region of the ZnO film shifts to a higher energy level by 0.10, 0.16 and 0.22 eV for the MBA, DMBA and TMBA treated ZnO films respectively, indicating the reduction of the workfunction and the LUMO energy level. The calculated workfunction values reduced from 4.62 eV for the pristine ZnO to 4.52, 4.46 and 4.40 eV for the MBA, DMBA and TMBA modified ZnO films. Consequently, the LUMO energy level of the ZnO which was 4.61 eV reduced to 4.51, 4.45 and 4.39 eV for the MBA, DMBA and TMBA treated samples respectively. This result confirms the interfacial dipole effects induced by the SAM molecules.39 Furthermore, this effect was maximized as the number of methoxy functional groups increases, as demonstrated by the greatest change in the workfunction and the LUMO energy level after the ZnO was treated with TMBA.

We obtained the energy band diagrams of the PSC devices and the electron transporting mechanisms as illustrated in Fig. 1d. The energy bands of the other perovskite photoactive layer, the hole transporting layer (HTL) and the two electrodes have been reported previously.31,48,49 With SAMs modification, the workfunction of the ZnO ETLs substantially reduced and among all of the candidates, ZnO/TMBA showed the lowest workfunction value amongst all of the ZnO/SAMs. It is reported that the lowest workfunction of the ETLs can induce higher built-in voltages in the solar cell device which are typically determined by the difference between the workfunction of the ETLs and that of the HTLs. The higher built-in voltage can also induce larger energy band bending of the photoactive layer, which is beneficial for the electron transfer from the perovskite photoactive layer to the ETLs. Consequently, the charge carrier recombination at the interface of the PSC device can be reduced.36,50
We performed UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy studies and the results are shown in Fig. 4c. The perovskite films deposited on the bare glass substrate and the SAM modified ZnO/glass substrates showed similar absorption features and peak intensities to each other, which means that the perovskite crystal structure formed well when deposited on the SAM modified ZnO. However, in the PL spectra, the perovskite film deposited on the glass substrate shows the highest PL intensity, whereas the PL was significantly reduced when deposited on the SAM modified ZnO ETLs. The PL quenching by introduction of the SAMs modified ZnO layer is attributed to the charge transfer from the perovskite layers to the ZnO layer. The TMBA modified sample shows the lowest PL intensity, which suggests that the charge extraction is the most efficient among the SAMs modified ZnO ETLs.
The conductivity of the unmodified and SAMs modified ZnO ETLs was compared. We fabricated the devices with a structure of ITO/ZnO/(SAM interlayers)/Ag and characterized the current–voltage (I–V) curves for each device. From the slope of the I–V curves in Fig. 4d, the conductivity (σ) of each ETL was estimated using eqn (7), in which d is the thickness of the samples and A is the device area.51 σ = (I × d)/(V × A)(7)
The I–V slope of the ZnO-based device slightly enhanced after insertion of the SAM interlayers, which indicates the enhanced conductivity of the ETL. This might be because the charge trap site in the ZnO ETL was passivated by the SAM and the charge transportation in the ZnO/SAM becomes more favorable.
To investigate the effect of the ETL surface modification on the device performance, ZnO ETL-based planar PSCs were fabricated, the structure of the devices was ITO/ZnO/(SAM interlayers)/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au (Fig. 1a). The SAM interlayers were introduced on top of the sol–gel ZnO ETLs using the dip-coating method, followed by the solvent washing process to remove physically adsorbed SAM molecules. The details of the solar cell fabrication are described in Fig. S10.† The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the best performing PSCs are shown in Fig. 5a and b respectively and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. As shown in the Fig. 5a and Table 2, the pristine ZnO-based control device showed a very low PCE of 1.44% with a VOC of 0.82 V, a short circuit current (JSC) of 7.97 mA cm−2 and a FF of 21.98%. Notably, all of the SAM interlayers achieved substantially improved PCEs of 12.60, 12.97 and 13.75% for the MBA, DMBA and TMBA respectively. The TMBA modified device showed the highest performance with a VOC of 1.05 V, JSC of 21.38 mA cm−2 and an FF of 60.96%. In the EQE spectra shown in Fig. 5b, the SAMs modified devices have higher EQE values in the range of 350 to 800 nm compared to those of the unmodified ZnO-based device. The calculated JSC values obtained from the EQE spectra are 20.60, 21.15 and 21.47 mA cm−2 for the MBA, DMBA and TMBA modified devices which are in good agreement with the JSC values obtained from the J–V characteristics. The enhanced JSC and EQE values obtained with the SAM treatment are attributed to the improved electron transfer at the interface of the perovskite layer and the ETL and increased charge transporting properties of the ZnO/SAM ETLs. The TMBA modified ZnO showed the lowest LUMO energy level which is better aligned with the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the perovskite layer, resulting in the highest JSC and EQE value for the TMBA modified devices. We compared the statistical distributions for the VOC and PCE of the devices with and without the SAM treatment using 18 samples for each condition. In Fig. 5c, it was found that the VOC and JSC values gradually enhanced as the number of methoxy functional groups in the benzoic acid SAM material increased. This might be because of the enhanced built-in voltage and charge transfer at the interface. The hydrogen-bonding interaction between the methoxy groups in the SAM and the methylammonium of the perovskite layer effectively induces a dipole moment and as indicated from the calculation, the dipole moment is higher for TMBA and DMBA than MBA. Furthermore, TMBA is more effective at forming hydrogen bonding because of the electron donating effect from the neighboring methoxy groups that do not participate in the bonding. This results in a more efficient interface modification of the TMBA-based SAM compared with DMBA. As a result, the ZnO/TMBA ETL-based device achieved the highest PCE among all of the PSC devices, as shown in Fig. 5d.

To further compare the charge behavior among the ZnO ETLs non-modified and modified with three different SAMs, EIS measurements were performed for the four different types of devices and the results are presented in Fig. S11a.† The Nyquist plots of the PSCs were measured at an open circuit voltage under standard AM 1.5 G irradiation and with a frequency ranging from 1 Hz to 1 MHz. The equivalent circuit proposed in this work is given in Fig. S11b† and it was composed of parallel charge transport resistance (Rtrans) and parasitic chemical capacitance (Ctrans), while the recombination resistance (Rrec) and chemical capacitance (Crec) represent the charge recombination resistance and capacitance, respectively. We obtained the charge transport resistance to compare the charge transportation at the interface between the perovskite and ZnO ETLs. The charge transport resistance of the bare ZnO ETL-based PSC was 502.67 Ω, while this value decreased to 339.25, 324.78 and 322.02 Ω for the MBA, DMBA and TMBA modified ZnO-based PSCs. The lower Rtrans value of the device with SAM treatment indicates that the surface modification of the ZnO with SAM can lower the resistance to promote the charge transportation from the perovskite to the ZnO ETLs, leading to a higher device performance.
The PSC device stability was studied by monitoring the device performance for 7 d. The unencapsulated devices were stored under ambient conditions with a relative humidity (RH) of 45% under dark conditions. As shown in Fig. 6a and S12a,† the resulting devices maintained 68.42%, 63.66% and 66.81% of their initial PCE values for MBA, DMBA, and TMBA respectively, whereas the pristine ZnO based device almost entirely lost the photovoltaic performance after 7 days of ambient air exposure. The contribution of this drastic PCE reduction in the pristine ZnO-based PSC resulted in a significantly decreased JSC as shown in Fig. 6b and S12b,† which is most probably related to the degradation of the perovskite photoactive layer.52 As a result, the SAM is effective, not only for enhancing the solar cell performance, but also for improving the device stability due to the significantly reduced perovskite degradation, which originates from the proton transfer reaction of the ZnO.

Conclusions
In summary, we developed a novel strategy to fabricate highly stable and efficient PSC devices by introducing ZnO/SAM ETLs based on methoxybenzoic acid derivatives. The SAM layer, which formed hydrogen-bonding to the methylammonium of the perovskite layer, effectively induced dipole moments at the interface, resulting in energy band bending and an increased built-in voltage, which results in an improved charge transfer and thus JSC, and also the increased VOC of the PSC device. Furthermore, the SAM interlayers effectively contributed to increasing the charge transporting properties of the PSC device by: (1) the conductivity of the ZnO ETL was improved owing to the passivation of the trap sites in ZnO; and (2) the methoxy group in the SAM effectively enhanced the surface hydrophobicity of the ZnO ETLs, which helps the crystal grain growth of the upper perovskite layers. As a result, the new PSC based on ZnO/TMBA achieved a significantly increased PCE of 13.75%, which was significantly higher compared to that of the bare ZnO-based devices (1.44%). More importantly, the SAM layer effectively improved the device stability by significantly suppressing perovskite degradation owing to the proton transfer reaction of the ZnO with the perovskite layer. The SAM formation based on the methoxybenzoic acid derivatives is a simple and practical device processing approach which can simultaneously enhance the device performance and the long-term stability and thus, provide insights into designing PSC device structures and processing methods for mass production and commercialization of the PSC devices.
