, Accepted 24th July 2013First published on 19th August 2013AbstractIn this paper, we investigated the aggregation behavior of a squaraine dye in solid films, as well as the effects on its optical and electrical properties. We observed a strong intermolecular interaction in thin films, which can be controlled via processing solvents. Two typical aggregation behaviors, i.e. H- and J- aggregation, can be selectively formed via the proper selection of solvents, resulting in a significant difference in material properties and the resultant photovoltaic performance. In addition to the monomer absorption between 600 nm and 700 nm, the H-aggregation mainly absorbs green light around 500–600 nm, while the J-aggregation shows a strong absorption in the near infrared range up to 850 nm. Therefore in squaraine/fullerene bi-layer hetero-junction photovoltaic cells, we demonstrated a significant contribution of J-aggregation to the photocurrent. Furthermore the J-aggregation films have a deeper ionization potential, most likely due to the intermolecular charge-transfer interaction, and thus gave rise to a larger open circuit voltage than those of the H-aggregation based devices. The J-aggregation formation shall be considered as an effective approach to tune the optical/electrical properties in organic optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
Organic materials feature tunable chemical structures and thus a bandgap, and offer the possibility to capture photons from 300 nm to 1000 nm. Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells have been considered as a promising candidate for renewable energy sources.1,2 Photoactive layers normally consist of the pair of an electron donor and acceptor. After light absorption, the energy offset between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the donor and acceptor separates the photogenerated excitons into free charges. Then, the free charge carriers travel through the bulk film, and reach their respective electrodes. The ratio of the extracted charge carriers to incident photons is thus defined as the external quantum efficiency (EQE). Meanwhile, the electrical potential that the PV cells deliver is essentially proportional to the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor. Tuning the HOMO level of donor materials by modification of their chemical structure has been recognized as a general approach to obtain a high open circuit voltage (Voc),3,4 and hence improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE).
In order to maximize the PCE, both the energy levels and charge transport are essentially critical factors. In organic semiconductors, interactions among adjacent molecules, normally weak inter-molecular interactions via van der Waals force, determine the bulk properties in organic films. In general, the carrier mobilities are as low as 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 due to the nature of charge hopping from one molecule to another in organic semiconductors,5 limiting the film thickness to the order of 100 nm. Therefore, a high extinction coefficient is an alternative way to tackle this issue, in order to obtain a trade off between the light absorption and charge transport. As shown in a previous report, 10 nm thick organic films may result in the significant absorption of incident light by using an appropriate light absorbing organic molecule.6–8 Another important factor is the matching of the absorption band with the solar spectrum in the infrared range, where the photon flux is mainly distributed in promoting the photocurrent of the PV cells. In other words, a low-bandgap material is required to harvest infrared light.
Bearing in mind these factors for high-efficiency PV cells, the intermolecular interaction in organic semiconductor films is an important factor that dominates the behaviors of excitons and charge carriers. Therefore J-aggregates have recently become an interesting topic in the OPV field. A J-aggregate refers to a special self-organization of chromophores,9 and such an ordered molecular packing in one dimension (1-D) results in a significant bathochromic shift and an intensive enhancement of absorption, i.e. the J-bands. J-aggregation features a strong absorption beyond the usual band-edge of monomers. Thus, film absorption has a better spectral match with the solar spectrum, which is one of the prerequisites for efficient light conversion. Besides, due to strong inter-molecular coupling, J-aggregation provides a potential opportunity to tune the optical and electrical properties of organic thin films.10,11
However, in contrast to J-aggregation in the solution phase which has been intensively studied in the past several decades,12 J-aggregation in thin films has drawn much less attention due to the fact that it is rare to observe distinctive J-aggregates in solid states. There are few reports on such properties in solid films,13 and on applications in optoelectronic devices.14 However, in order to conform to thermodynamically metastable J-aggregation states, the molecules should have a strong permanent dipole, even an ionic nature.12 In such a case, it is somehow difficult to have efficient charge transport. The key challenge is to explore materials possessing both J-aggregation and semiconductive properties in solid states.
Though there are reports that J-aggregation states are supposed to contribute to the photocurrent from bulk heterojunction based OPV cells, it is difficult to prove that the formation of a J-aggregate in a blend system without a direct observation and experimental proof. A red-shift in the absorption is merely part of the characteristics of J-aggregation. However, in order to confirm the existence of J-aggregation, it is necessary to look at the unique characteristics of a J-aggregate. Firstly, a strong dipole coupling causes strong narrow absorption peaks, red-shifting with respect to the monomer band. Secondly, though monomers may have no or a low fluorescence, the aggregation states induce a higher probability of radiative recombination from the allowed electronic transition upon photoexcitation. Also, due to the coupling, very little Stokes shift and a narrow photoluminescence (PL) bandwidth are expected. These distinctive properties are convincing evidence for J-aggregation.12
In this communication, we report the strong J-aggregate formation of a squaraine dye, 2,4-bis[4-(N,N-dibutylamino)phenyl] squaraine (SQ) in neat films via a solution process. In addition to a monomolecular absorption, a new absorption band ascribed to the J-aggregation exhibits a strong absorption in the long wavelength range, and good charge transporting properties in the thin films, as well as a desirable ionization potential (Ip) level for PV cells. We found that the aggregation behaviors were strongly dependent on the processing solvents, providing an effective method to control the optical and electrical properties of thin films without modifying the molecular structure. Bilayer heterojunction (HJ) PV cells were fabricated based on the SQ dye as a donor and fullerene C60 as an acceptor, in which the strong photoresponse of J-aggregation is observed. Additional to its monomeric band, the intensive absorption of the J-aggregate enhances the photocurrent by ∼30% in the OPV cells, by extending the band-edge from 720 nm to 800 nm. Therefore, we demonstrated an example with direct experimental proof, showing that J-aggregation has potential applications in OPVs.
Results and discussion
UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence
Fig. 1 shows the chemical structure of SQ and the UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption of SQ both in dilute solution (1 × 10−5 M) and as a thin film (∼20 nm). SQ in a chloroform (CF) solution has a narrow absorption band at ∼641 nm, with an impressive extinction coefficient (ε) 3.4 × 105 M−1 cm−1 and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of ∼35 nm. A 20 nm thick spin-cast film, however, demonstrates two distinctive absorption peaks at 655 nm and 770 nm with a FWHM of 90 nm and 60 nm, respectively. The 655 nm peak can be ascribed to monomer absorption in the solid film, which shows a reasonable red-shift and broadening with respect to the monomer absorption in solution. Another peak at 770 nm is stronger and narrower than that of the monomer. In comparison with the monomer band in solution, interestingly, it shifts to a longer wavelength range by 125 nm, most likely indicating J-aggregation.

To further investigate the origin of the absorption properties, we characterized the PL emission spectra of SQ in dilute solution and as thin films. Fig. 2 shows the PL spectra of SQ in both a CF solution and as a solid film spin-coated from a CF solution, excited at 615 nm and 661 nm, respectively. In solution, the PL emission at 666 nm has a mirror image of the absorption band, corresponding to typical S1–S0 transitions with a FWHM of ∼35 nm. In the spin-cast films, however, the PL emission is surprisingly narrowed, having a FWHM of 25 nm with a band maxima at 775 nm, and a small Stokes shift of 4.5 nm relative to the narrow absorption peak at 770.5 nm. Note that the above-mentioned experiment was carried out at room temperature. Narrow bands in the absorption and PL emissions normally occur in organic materials at low temperatures, when the vibration and distortion energies of the molecules are limited.15 In some cases, non-linear processes, e.g. amplified spontaneous emission or laser, reduce the PL bandwidth. It has been reported that second harmonic generation occurs in such compounds.16 However, these possibilities can be ruled out in our case, since our observation was made at room temperature without any non-linear effects.

Obviously, the unusual absorption and PL properties suggest a high order intermolecular interaction, which is dramatically different from the isolated monomer in a dilute solution. Such strong and narrow bands of the absorption and PL correspond to the allowed transitions between the ground states and a set of narrowly distributed levels of an excited state. Taking both the red-shift and spectral narrowing into consideration, we thus confirmed the formation of highly ordered structures of the SQ molecules in a solid film, i.e. a J-aggregate. A PL measurement at low temperature revealed more features of a J-aggregate as shown in Fig. 3. At 77 K, the PL band red-shifts to approximately 800 nm with a similar FWHM, which indicates the enhancement of the molecular coupling at low temperature, resulting in a further bandgap shrinkage of the J-aggregate. At 6 K, the FWHM is narrowed to approximately 20 nm, which is very likely due to a reduction in the molecular vibration, consistent with the previous report.17
 Fig. 3  PL spectra of a 20 nm thick SQ film spin-coated from a CF solution at various temperatures, as well as in presence of a layer of 5 nm thick C60 acceptor (at 293 K). 
It is noted that the two absorption bands of the SQ film cast from the CF solution show a non-symmetrical and significant broadening with respect to the PL emission. The bands can be deconvoluted via a multi-peak fitting with a minimum peak number of 4, as shown in Fig. S1.† Each band consists of two sub-bands with a relatively smaller FWHM. The band at the lowest energy side corresponds to the 0–0 transition of the J-aggregate, which almost overlaps with the PL emission. The second lowest energy band should be also from the J-aggregate with a lower ordering of molecular coupling, while the other two high-energy sub-bands should still be related to the monomer absorption. The above-mentioned spectroscopic properties were measured in a 1 × 10−5 M CF solution, and 20 nm thick films spin cast from a 3 mg ml−1 solution in CF.
For further insights into the aggregation behaviors in solid films, we then investigated the casting solvent effects on the spin-coated films. Considering the good solubility of SQ in halogenated solvents, four typical halogenated solvents, dichloromethane (DCM), CF, chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) were chosen. The boiling points of the four solvents follows the ascending trend, i.e. DCM < CF < CB < ODCB, giving various times for the molecules to reorganize during the transition from the solution phase to the solid state. It is noted that the absorption and PL spectra of the SQ films spin-coated using the different solvents are very different, even though the absorption and PL emissions of the molecules in solution are not sensitive to the solvents as shown in Fig. S2.† The spin-cast films show a narrow and red-shifted absorption peak characterized as a J-aggregate when the films are processed using DCM, CF and CB as solvents (Fig. 4). However from an ODCB solution, a dramatically blue-shifted absorption peak arises at 544 nm with a FWHM of ∼70 nm, in addition to the monomer peak at 645 nm. Such a peak is normally considered as a thermodynamically stable H-aggregate, which shall be attributed to the parallel alignment of the molecular dipole moments. A J-aggregation state is kinetically meta-stable, while an H-aggregation state is thermodynamically stable.12,18 This explains that low-boiling point solvents led to the J-aggregation state, and the high-boiling point solvent led to H-aggregation. A slower solvent evaporation allows the molecules to reorganize into their thermodynamically stable state. Kinetically meta-stable J-aggregation can only be trapped and realized in a fast evaporation process. In contrast to the strong PL from the metastable J-aggregate, an H-aggregate film gives rise to no detectable PL emission, meaning strong exciton quenching occurs. This is consistent with the extremely low PL intensity, too low to measure under our current experimental conditions.

Energy level and hole mobility
The energy levels of SQ were determined experimentally in both the solution and solid phases. The measured HOMO and LUMO levels, via a cyclic voltammetry (CV) method in a DCM solution, were −5.02 eV and −3.36 eV, respectively (Fig. S3†). On the other hand, the Ip levels in the solid state were measured by photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS) as summarized in Table 1. An ODCB solution produces films with the shallowest Ip level of −4.95 eV, whereas the other three solvents resulted in deeper Ips, from −5.22 eV to −5.36 eV. These results indicate that Ip level of J-aggregation is deeper than that of H-aggregation. In J-aggregation, the aggregation state is stabilized by the intermolecular charge-transfer (CT) interactions between the more electron-deficient squarylium moiety and the electron-rich dialkylamino phenyl groups.18 Therefore, the electron-density of the HOMO in a single SQ molecule can be reduced by the surrounding molecules via a CT interaction leading to the deeper Ip in J-aggregation. The electron affinities (Ea) were then derived from the optical bandgaps which were determined by the absorption band-edge. Obviously, the bandgaps of the SQ films varied with the processing solvents.

As shown in a single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) molecular structure (Fig. S4†), the SQ molecule with linear N-butyl groups tends to keep the two phenyl rings co-planar with the central four-membered ring leading to a stronger π–π stacking and increased hole mobility of the SQ in the film.19 We also obtained XRD measurements on the SQ films. It is evident (Fig. S5†) that the two types of films from the different casting solvents are quite different in molecular packing and orientation. In the films from the CF, DCM and CB solutions, the SQ molecules tend to form an edge-on and J-aggregation manner, while from the ODCB solution, a face-on and H-aggregation dominate. If these hypotheses are correct, the film from the ODCB solution should show better charge-transporting properties in the direction perpendicular to the surface of the substrates. The hole mobility of the H-aggregation films reached 1.59 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (as shown in Table 1), which is decent for an amorphous film. However, it is interesting that the hole mobilities for the J-aggregation films are an order of magnitude higher than that for H-aggregation. This shall be ascribed to the strong intermolecular coupling of the J-aggregation states.
OPV performance
The SQ films processed via various solvents were then combined with fullerene C60 films to fabricate bi-layer HJ cells. Fullerene C60 has been widely used as a good electron accepting material in organic donor–acceptor PV systems. It can be thermally evaporated in a vacuum to form smooth films, possessing a well-defined interface with donor films. As shown in Fig. 3, the PL emission of the SQ film can be quenched by approximately 90% upon depositing a layer of C60, indicating an efficient CT occurs from SQ to the C60. Therefore, we employed the device architecture of ITO/MoO3 (5 nm)/SQ (spin-coated film, 20 nm)/C60 (40 nm)/BCP (8 nm)/Al (100 nm) to make PV cells. Here, MoO3 was deposited on top of an ITO anode, forming an anode contact of work function of ∼5.8 eV,20 and BCP (bathocuproine) was used as a cathode buffer.
Fig. 5a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PV cells under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5 illumination. An ∼20 nm thick SQ film acting as a donor layer was prepared from a spin coating SQ solution in DCM, CF and CB or ODCB. The aggregation behaviors and hence electronic structures obviously result from the solvents used for the film fabrication. The SQ film processed from the ODCB solution exhibits a PCE of merely 0.50% with a Voc of 0.25 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 3.79 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.5. As we noticed, the low Voc is mainly ascribed to the shallow HOMO level, and the low Jsc is due to very low photoresponse of H-aggregation in the spectral range 600 nm to 800 nm (Fig. 5b). In contrast, in the devices based on SQ films spin-coated from a CF solution, the Voc reaches ∼0.51 V, the Jsc 6.44 mA cm−2, and the FF 0.53. Both the Voc and Jsc are three times higher than those from the ODCB processed devices, yielding a PCE of 1.7%. Similarly, the DCM and CB solutions deliver a comparable PV performance as the CF casting case. On one hand, the Jsc improvement comes from a photoresponse beyond 600 nm. On the other hand, we also noticed morphological difference of these films. The height images of the films measured via atom force microscopy (AFM) are shown in Fig. S6.† The three films processed by DCM, CF and CB have relatively rough surfaces. On the contrary, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the H-aggregate film is 0.93 nm, which is the smallest among all the four films. The large surface roughness of the J-aggregate films may result in large donor–acceptor interfaces in the PV cells, and therefore an efficient CT from donor to acceptor.

The difference in the Voc in various casting solvent processed PV devices can be explained by the Ip level difference of the SQ films spin-coated from different solvents. Normally Voc in organic heterojunctions is determined by the difference between the Ip of the donor and the Ea of the acceptor.21 Deeper Ip levels of the SQ films processed from the DCM/CF/CB solvents contribute to the higher Voc of the PV devices than that of the ODCB processed device. The difference in the Ip level and hence the Voc can be clearly ascribed to the aggregation behaviors due to the solvents used in the coating process.22
Conclusions
In summary, J-aggregation enhances the PV performance of SQ/fullerene bi-layer HJ cells. The optical and electrical properties of the thin films were found to be strongly correlated to the casting solvents, and thus determined the PV characteristics. With the tuning of the bandgap and the Ip level of the SQ films via solvent effects, we were able to obtain a PCE of 1.80% from low boiling point solvents, which is three times higher than that of 0.50%, using ODCB. Such an example demonstrates that J-aggregation is a useful approach in OPV, but not limited to that. Since it is confirmed in our investigation that the charge mobilities can be enhanced due to the formation of J-aggregation, this finding offers the potential to further explore its potential applications in optoelectronics.
Experimental
Material
The SQ dye was synthesized according to the literature procedure;23 > 99.9% purity of the SQ was proved by NMR and elemental analyses. The patterned indium-tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates, MoO3, C60 and the BCP were commercially available. The ITO glass substrates were cleaned using detergent, de-ionized water, acetone and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath, respectively, then the cleaned substrates were dried in an oven at 80 °C for 12 hours before use. The MoO3 and BCP were used as received and the C60 was purified 3 times by using vacuum sublimation before use.
Photophysical characterization
The UV-vis absorption spectra were collected using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU, UV-3150). The PL spectra were measured using a FluroMax-2 (Jobin-Yvon-Spex) luminescence spectrometer. The solution for the UV-vis absorption and PL measurements was at a concentration of 1 × 10−5 M in the different solvents. The thin films for the UV-vis absorption and the PL measurements were prepared by spin coating a solution in different solvents on a quartz substrate.
Electrochemical properties
The CV measurement was performed using a PC controlled Auto-Lab PSTAT10 electrochemical workstation in an Ar filled glove box with oxygen and water <5 ppm. The experiment was carried out in a CH2Cl2 solution with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TBABF4), as supporting electrolyte) at a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1 using a glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. Ferrocene was used as an internal standard.
PYS measurement
The Ip was determined by PYS under a vacuum (∼10−3 Pa).24 20 nm thin films as samples were made by spin coating the CF solution on the indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates in a N2 filled glove box.
Film morphology analysis
In-plane and out-of-plane XRD patterns were performed using a high-resolution XRD diffractometer (SmartLab, Rigaku Co.). The AFM images were collected in air on a Veeco AFM using a tapping mode. The films for the XRD and AFM measurements were prepared by spin coating a SQ solution in different solvents on the 5 nm thick MoO3 coated ITO glass substrates.
Hole mobility characterization
Hole only devices with the structure ITO/MoO3 (5 nm)/SQ (50 nm)/MoO3 (5 nm)/Al (100 nm) were fabricated to characterize the hole mobility of the SQ in thin films, by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model.25
Bi-layer HJ cells fabrication and characterization
The cleaned ITO substrates were exposed to UV–ozone for 30 min and immediately transferred into a high-vacuum chamber for the deposition of 5 nm MoO3 at a base pressure of 1 × 10−5 Pa. SQ layers (thickness: ∼20 nm) were fabricated by spin-coating a SQ solution (3 mg ml−1 in DCM/CF and 10 mg ml−1 in CB/ODCB) on the MoO3 coated ITO surface in the N2 filled glove box, then the substrates were transferred back to the high-vacuum chamber where a 40 nm thick C60 acceptor layer, and the BCP (8 nm) and Al (100 nm) top electrode were thermally deposited, respectively. The active area of the PV cells was 0.09 cm2 defined by the overlap of the ITO anode and the Al cathode. The J–V and EQE characterizations of the bi-layer HJ cells were carried out on a CEP-2000 integrated system made by Bunkoukeiki Co. The bright state J–V characteristics were measured under a simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G irradiation from a Xe lamp with an AM1.5 global filter. The EQEs were measured with a Xe lamp, monochromator, optical chopper, and a lock-in amplifier. The integration of the EQE data over the AM1.5G solar spectrum yields calculated the Jsc with less than 3% experimental variation from the measured Jsc under the illumination of simulated solar light.
