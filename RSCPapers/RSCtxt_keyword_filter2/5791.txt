    , Accepted 7th April 2017First published on 11th April 2017AbstractMetal halide perovskites have achieved remarkable efficiency in solar cells. However, the origin and impact of preferential crystallographic orientation of thin films are still not well understood. In this work, using in situ grazing-incidence X-ray scattering, we show that a preferential crystallographic orientation of a thin ‘seed’ layer (∼65 nm) on top of a thick (∼350 nm) randomly oriented film can propagate through the entire film. The thin cubic (100) oriented layer on top was formed by using a simple solution based treatment with methylammonium chloride (MACl) on randomly oriented methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) films. Upon thermal annealing, the cubic (100) orientation propagates through the entire MAPbI3 film underneath which eventually cools down to tetragonal (110) orientation at room temperature. The treatment results in significantly improved solar cell power conversion efficiency, highlighting the importance of controlling the crystallographic orientation of grains.
Metal halide perovskites (MHP) have attracted enormous attention in recent years due to their power conversion efficiency of solar cells rapidly rising from 3.8%1 to over 20%,2–5 which rivals that of silicon solar cells. Moreover, MHPs combine these high efficiencies with earth-abundant compositions and low-cost solution processability. In terms of device stability, promising results that demonstrate maintaining more than 95% of the original efficiency after 6 months of real operating conditions have been reported.6 With these advances, the next step toward realizing the wide-spread commercial deployment of MHP solar cells is to robustly achieve scale-up to large area devices while further improving efficiency and stability. To this end, understanding the MHP thin film formation processes7–13 and how the thin film structure impacts the solar cell performance will be critically important.
Recent studies have demonstrated that different crystallographic terminations have a major impact on solar cell performance. Leblebici et al. showed that different surface terminations of grains result in widely varying open circuit voltage and short circuit current due to different electronic trap site density on these surfaces.14 Yang et al. showed that surface defects are the dominant contributions in limiting carrier lifetime, which further highlights the importance of controlling the surface termination and passivation.15 Docampo et al. found tetragonal (110) preferential orientation of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) thin film is beneficial to solar cell performance16 while other studies have concluded differently.17,18 Further studies with MHP thin films with well-controlled grain orientations are needed to obtain deeper understanding.
However, it is not yet well understood how the preferential crystallographic orientations in MHP thin films form. Previous reports have shown that various crystallographic orientations can be obtained by using different precursor solutions and treatments. A process referred to as the “mixed halide method” that incorporates methylammonium chloride (MACl) or lead chloride (PbCl2) in precursor solution has been shown to result in a preferential tetragonal (110) orientation.8,19–25 Various other fabrication methods involving methylammonium bromide,26 methylamine gas,27 lead acetate28 or tetrahydrothiophene oxide29 were also shown to yield perovskite films with different preferential orientations. The mechanisms responsible for formation of these preferentially oriented films are poorly understood and cannot yet be well controlled.
Here we show that the orientation of a MAPbI3 film can be tuned through a post-fabrication MACl treatment. In situ grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS) reveals that the deposition of MACl on pre-formed randomly oriented MAPbI3 films (∼350 nm) results in an oriented intermediate phase top layer (∼65 nm), which, upon thermal annealing, converts to a preferentially oriented MAPbI3 top layer. Upon further thermal annealing, the preferentially oriented top layer induces the same orientation in the entire MAPbI3 film underneath. This process occurs on various MAPbI3 films independent of initial film fabrication methods. We found that this simple and general MACl treatment results in significantly improved solar cell performance. Furthermore, we isolated the intermediate top layer and found it to be identical to the one formed with the widely used “mixed halide” method. Our work provides deeper insight into the formation of preferentially oriented MHP thin films and its impact on solar cell performance.
In Fig. 1(a) and (b), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and GIXS results show that MAPbI3 thin films (360 nm thick) formed by “inter-diffusion” method30 have random crystallographic orientation. We found that this random orientation can be converted to a strong tetragonal (110) orientation using a simple MACl treatment in which a dilute MACl solution in isopropanol (4 mg mL−1) is spun cast on top of the MAPbI3 film and thermally annealed at 150 °C for 30 seconds (Fig. 1(c)). The widely used “mixed halide method”31,32 also results in tetragonal (110) orientation, albeit at a lower degree of preferential orientation compared to the post-deposition MACl treatment method as evidenced by low intensity rings in the GIXS pattern in our work (Fig. 2(g)).

(a) From bottom to top are X-ray diffraction patterns of a randomly oriented perovskite film made with inter-diffusion method (black line), the same film after MACl treatment (blue line), and a film made by mixed halide method (red line). (b) and (c) are GIXS patterns of the same randomly oriented perovskite film before and after MACl treatment, respectively. The hallow diamond symbols mark the calculated GIXS peak positions. 
 Fig. 2  Structural evolution during MACl treatment and mixed halide process. In situ GIXS patterns during MACl treatment (a–d) and mixed halide process (e–g). In MACl treatment, depositing MACl on (a) a thin randomly-oriented MAPbI3 film forms (b) an oriented intermediate phase, which turns into (c) oriented cubic (100) oriented MAPbI3 with thermal annealing and cools down to (d) tetragonal (110) orientation. In mixed halide method, (e) a crystalline precursor phase that is identical to the one in (b) forms after spin-coating the precursor solution, which follows the same structural evolution with (b) to form an oriented tetragonal (110) film. 
We performed in situ GIXS experiments to probe the transformation process. Upon MACl deposition, the ring pattern resulting from the original randomly oriented MAPbI3 remains while new peaks with larger spacing and strong preferential orientation emerge (Fig. 3(a) and (b)). The new peaks arise from the reaction product between MAPbI3 and MACl, which we denote “intermediate” structure, as the peaks are from neither MAPbI3 nor MACl (Fig. S1 and S2†). To isolate the diffraction pattern of the intermediate phase from the excess MAPbI3 signal, we carried out the same MACl treatment on thinner MAPbI3 films with various thicknesses (Fig. S1†) and found that up to ∼65 nm of MAPbI3 gets completely converted into the intermediate phase, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The intermediate phase has long range repeating units as shown by the peak at Q = 4 nm−1 which corresponds to 1.6 nm spacing that is much larger than the Pb–I bond length of 0.39 nm. Based on the large spacing and preferential orientation parallel to the substrate, we speculate that the intermediate structure is similar to the previously reported intercalated structures where the organic molecules are placed between two-dimensional lead iodide networks forming repeating units.7,33
 Fig. 3  Proposed mechanism for MACl assisted structural evolution of a thick perovskite film by an orientation propagation process. After MACl deposition on (a) a thick perovskite film (∼350 nm), the GIXS pattern shows (b) a mixture of oriented intermediate phase labelled by stars (★) and randomly oriented MAPbI3 labelled by diamonds (◆). After thermal annealing, the entire film converts to (c) a cubic (100) orientation, which cools down to (d) tetragonal (110). (e) Shows an illustration of the proposed homoepitaxial mechanism. 
Upon thermal annealing at 150 °C, our in situ GIXS results show that the oriented intermediate phase converts into an oriented cubic (100) MAPbI3 film (Fig. 2(c)) that eventually cools down to the tetragonal (110) orientation at room temperature (Fig. 2(d)). We note that the final reaction product is referred to as MAPbI3 since it has been shown previously that Cl does not get incorporated inside the MAPbI3 crystal to any significant extent.34,35 This is supported by a good agreement between GIXS pattern and calculated peak positions using lattice parameters of MAPbI3, as shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). Instead, Cl is likely to reside at the surfaces and grain boundaries and play a critical role in passivating traps and facilitating interfacial charge transfer.35–38
Interestingly, we found that the intermediate structure formed by depositing MACl on top of pre-formed MAPbI3 film has a structure identical to the crystalline precursor structure formed with the mixed halide method.19 Comparison of Fig. 2(b) and (e) shows a striking similarity in the GIXS patterns. This reveals a new insight that the crystalline precursor from the mixed halide method likely forms through a reaction of MACl with MAPbI3, as MACl could be a reaction product of mixed halide method by co-dissolving PbCl2 and MAI.39 Both the intermediate phase and the crystalline precursor structure converts into tetragonal (110) oriented MAPbI3 films after thermal annealing through the same pathway (Fig. 2).
For thicker randomly oriented MAPbI3 films with thickness around 350 nm, it is intriguing that the entire perovskite film achieves a complete tetragonal (110) orientation (Fig. 3(d)). Upon MACl deposition on top of ∼350 nm thick MAPbI3 film, GIXS peaks from both the intermediate structure and MAPbI3, marked with star and diamond symbols respectively in Fig. 3(b), are observed. This pattern matches well with a superposition pattern of a thin oriented intermediate (Fig. 2(b)) and a 350 nm thick randomly oriented MAPbI3 film, as shown in Fig. S3.† The preferentially oriented intermediate component indicates that it is unlikely to be randomly distributed throughout the bulk of film nor at boundaries of randomly oriented MAPbI3 grains. In those cases, the intermediate component will not exhibit a high degree of orientation with respect to the substrate. Based on these evidences, we conclude that the oriented intermediate structure formed a top-layer with the rest of the film underneath being a randomly oriented MAPbI3 grains. To explain the formation of preferential orientation in the entire film upon thermal annealing, we propose that an orientation propagation process is responsible for the transformation (Fig. 3(e)). The top ∼65 nm of the randomly oriented MAPbI3 film converts into a highly oriented intermediate structure upon MACl deposition and becomes cubic (100) oriented MAPbI3 film with thermal annealing. After this step, this highly oriented cubic (100) thin film atop randomly oriented grains serves as a “seed” for growth of cubic (100) orientation through the entire perovskite layer. This result demonstrates that the orientation of a MHP film can be engineered by using a simple chemical treatment, which can be used as a platform for studying the effect of film orientation. It also suggests the possibility to achieve other orientations using various chemical treatments.
Salts other than MACl were tested to determine whether MA or Cl is responsible for the significant change in structure. Similar treatments with methylammonium bromide (MABr), methylammonium iodide (MAI), ammonium chloride (ACl), ammonium iodide (AI), ammonium acetate (AAc) and ammonium formate (ACOOH) were performed on randomly oriented MAPbI3 films. As shown in Fig. S4,† after deposition of ACl, AI, AAc and ACOOH, no change in perovskite orientation was observed. A weakly oriented intermediate pattern appeared after deposition of MABr and MAI, resulting in a small change of orientation after annealing, but to a much lesser extent than MACl treatment. This suggests that the formation of an ordered intermediate with the presence of both MA and Cl is responsible for this drastic change in the crystallographic orientation of MAPbI3. However, it does not rule out the possibility that the other salts tested here influencing the film formation as additives to perovskite precursor solutions, as it has been reported previously with ammonium chloride40,41 and ethylammonium chloride.42
We fabricated solar cells with a structure of ITO/planar TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. MACl treatment was performed before deposition of spiro-OMeTAD, yielding a highly oriented tetragonal (110) on TiO2 substrate from a randomly oriented MAPbI3 film (Fig. S5†). A description of device fabrication can be found in ESI.† The MACl treatment improved solar cell performance significantly, as shown in Fig. 4(a) and S6.† After MACl treatment, the average efficiency increased by 35%, with a champion device of 17% (Fig. 4(b)). Detailed solar cell parameters (Fig. S6†) shows that the MACl treatment decreases series resistance, leading to higher fill factor and efficiency. The decreased series resistance could be a result of superior charge transporting property or reduced interfacial resistance due to the strong tetragonal (110) orientation in the vertical direction. This is in agreement with a recent observation that perovskite photovoltaic performance is influenced by crystal orientation on the microscopic scale.14 Since most of the reported record efficiency perovskite solar cells4,43 have random grain orientation, our results imply that higher performance could be achieved with enhanced orientation.
 Fig. 4  The impact of preferential crystallographic orientation on solar cell efficiency. (a) Solar cell efficiency histogram of perovskite thin films with random orientation (blue) and MACl treated tetragonal (110) orientation (red). The average efficiency increases from 11% to 15% with MACl treatment. (b) Best J–V curve obtained from control devices and MACl treated devices. The champion device, made with MACl treatment, has Voc = 1.01 V, Jsc = 22.2 mA cm−2, FF = 74.39%, PCE = 16.8%. 
Other factors could also contribute to the performance improvement. Chloride is known to passivate electronic trap sites and facilitate interfacial charge transfer in perovskite solar cell.21,36,44,45 The introduction of Cl by MACl treatment could be responsible for enhanced performance. Furthermore, Fig. S7† shows a substantial increase in grain size after MACl treatment while maintaining a full film coverage of the substrate, which could also help improve the solar cell performance by reducing surface trap sites.46 However, if the passivation by Cl or reduced surface trap sites due to larger grains were the dominant contribution to the increased solar cell efficiency, they would have resulted in a significantly increased open circuit voltage (Voc) but our devices show nearly identical Voc before and after the MACl treatment. Fully understanding the exact mechanism for the performance enhancement and the impact of preferential orientation of thin films requires further studies and the simple method to tune MAPbI3 orientation shown in this work provides a platform for further research.
Conclusions
We demonstrated a solution based MACl treatment to control the preferential orientation of MAPbI3 films. This treatment induces a strong tetragonal (110) orientation from a randomly oriented MAPbI3 film, independent from the film fabrication process. Through in situ GIWAXS measurements, we showed that MACl deposition on MAPbI3 film forms a preferentially oriented intermediate phase, which converts to an oriented MAPbI3 film. The structure of the ordered intermediate phase was found to be identical to the crystalline precursor structure found in mixed-halide method, suggesting a similar reaction mechanism. When there is an excess MAPbI3 compared to MACl, the treatment can still convert the whole film into a strong tetragonal (110) orientation through an orientation propagation process. The MACl treatment was also found to improve solar cell performance mostly by reducing the series resistance of devices. This study decouples perovskite orientation from film fabrication, offering a new dimension of orientation tunability to pinpoint its effect in future research.

 	Fig. 2  Structural evolution during MACl treatment and mixed halide process. In situ GIXS patterns during MACl treatment (a–d) and mixed halide process (e–g). In MACl treatment, depositing MACl on (a) a thin randomly-oriented MAPbI3 film forms (b) an oriented intermediate phase, which turns into (c) oriented cubic (100) oriented MAPbI3 with thermal annealing and cools down to (d) tetragonal (110) orientation. In mixed halide method, (e) a crystalline precursor phase that is identical to the one in (b) forms after spin-coating the precursor solution, which follows the same structural evolution with (b) to form an oriented tetragonal (110) film.	 

 	Fig. 3  Proposed mechanism for MACl assisted structural evolution of a thick perovskite film by an orientation propagation process. After MACl deposition on (a) a thick perovskite film (∼350 nm), the GIXS pattern shows (b) a mixture of oriented intermediate phase labelled by stars (★) and randomly oriented MAPbI3 labelled by diamonds (◆). After thermal annealing, the entire film converts to (c) a cubic (100) orientation, which cools down to (d) tetragonal (110). (e) Shows an illustration of the proposed homoepitaxial mechanism.	 

 	Fig. 4  The impact of preferential crystallographic orientation on solar cell efficiency. (a) Solar cell efficiency histogram of perovskite thin films with random orientation (blue) and MACl treated tetragonal (110) orientation (red). The average efficiency increases from 11% to 15% with MACl treatment. (b) Best J–V curve obtained from control devices and MACl treated devices. The champion device, made with MACl treatment, has Voc = 1.01 V, Jsc = 22.2 mA cm−2, FF = 74.39%, PCE = 16.8%.
