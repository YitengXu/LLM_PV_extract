Introduction
As a promising renewable energy source technology, solution-processed polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on p-type conjugated polymers as electron donors and n-type fullerene derivatives as electron acceptors with a nanoscale phase-separated bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphology have attracted considerable attention due to their advantages of flexibility and potentially inexpensive large area manufacturing.1–4 Over the past few years, rapid progress has been made in this field. Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of more than 10% for traditional single-junction PSCs5–8 and over 11% for tandem PSCs9–11 have been achieved. As is well known, the key factors that determine the PCE of PSCs are the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF).12–15 These parameters are closely related to the optical and electrical properties of the polymer donors and the blend morphology of the active layer in BHJ PSCs. Among conjugated polymer donors, donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating conjugated polymers attract great interest because of their tunable properties including their optical absorption band, molecular energy level and hole mobility.16–20 PSCs based on D–A copolymers have made great progress with PCEs over 10%.5–7
Indacenodithiophene (IDT) as a promising electron-rich donor unit has attracted considerable attention and has been widely used in BHJ PSCs due to its high degree of rigidity and planarity and unique heteroaromatic ladder-type structure.21–28 So far, PSCs based on IDT-containing polymer donors have exhibited PCEs over 7%.21,22 However, the relatively narrow absorption spectra of these polymers are their weak point which limit the Jsc and PCE of the corresponding PSCs. In order to enhance the light-harvesting capacity of IDT-based polymers, great efforts have been made, such as changing the bridging atoms of the backbone or modifying the side chains of the IDT unit.23,24 However, these methods are not effective in broadening the absorption spectra of these polymers. Another common way to strengthen the optical absorption of IDT-based polymers is to extend the conjugation length of the IDT backbone.22,25 For example, Jen et al. reported an IDT derivative with an extended π-conjugated skeleton, IDTT, that is fused to two thiophene rings on both sides of the IDT unit.22a Compared with IDT-based polymers,23,26 IDTT-based polymers exhibit a higher extinction coefficient, resulting from their enhanced planarity, but the absorption region of the polymers still changes little. From the structure of the IDT unit, it can be clearly found that the sp3-hybridized carbon at 4,9-positions only plays the role of forming the fused rings, but does not contribute electrons to the π-conjugated system of the backbone.29 Hence, to enhance the π electron delocalization of side chains on the IDT unit is a potential strategy to improve the light harvesting capacity of the polymers and hence achieve a higher Jsc and PCE for PSCs.
In this work, we synthesized a five-membered fused-ring donor unit with 22 π-electrons, IDTV, where the 4,9-positions of the IDT unit are fused with two vinylene groups (Scheme 1a). Compared to the IDT unit, the IDTV unit possesses a more extended conjugation in the vertical direction and more π-conjugated electrons, which will facilitate π-electron delocalization along the polymer backbone and thus reduce its optical bandgap. In addition, alkyl chains far from the skeleton of the IDTV unit can promote the rigid and coplanar structural properties of the resulting polymers to prevent rotational disorder and reduce the reorganization energy, which will be beneficial to enhance carrier mobility.22,25 Furthermore, the D–A copolymer PIDTV-ffBT (see Scheme 1b) based on IDTV as the donor unit and 5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole (ffBT) as the acceptor unit was synthesized for application as a donor material in PSCs. Generally, the broadening of the absorption spectra of polymers tends to up-shift the HOMO level, which will reduce the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the related devices.13,18a Therefore, compared to the similar polymer CIDT,23a we introduced two fluorine atoms in the benzothiadiazole (BT) unit to down-shift the HOMO level of the polymer. As we expected, compared to the analogue polymers,22–26PIDTV-ffBT shows a broader absorption in the wavelength range of 300–810 nm with a lower optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.53 eV, a high extinction coefficient of 1.34 × 105 cm−1 at 717 nm, and a hole mobility of 0.032 cm2 V−1 s−1. As a result, the PSCs based on PIDTV-ffBT:PC71BM exhibit an optimized PCE of 7.3% with a Voc of 0.70 V, a Jsc of 17.1 mA cm−2, and a FF of 61%. These PCE and Jsc values are the highest values reported in the literature so far for PSCs based on IDT-alt-BT copolymers.22–26 Moreover, the Jsc of 17.1 mA cm−2 is comparable to those of PSCs based on DPP-based13,30 and TT-based4b,7,20 low bandgap polymers, and is the highest Jsc value reported to date for PSCs based on IDT-containing polymers as donors.21–28

Results and discussion
Synthesis and thermal properties of PIDTV-ffBT
As shown in Scheme 1b, IDTV was prepared through an addition reaction with the participation of a Grignard reagent and an elimination reaction under acidic conditions according to the procedure in the literature.31 Compound IDTV-Sn was obtained by the reaction of tin reagents at low temperature. The polymer PIDTV-ffBT was synthesized by palladium catalyzed Stille-coupling polymerization with a yield of 73%. The number average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of PIDTV-ffBT were 28.0 kDa and 3.24, respectively, as estimated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent at a high temperature of 160 °C. The large PDI value may be due to the planar structure of the IDTV unit which reduces the solubility of the polymer. The polymer shows good solubility in high temperature halogen organic solvents such as chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). In the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the polymer displays a thermal decomposition temperature of 376 °C (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†) at 5% weight loss, which indicates a good thermal stability for PSC application.
Absorption spectra and electronic energy levels
The UV-vis absorption spectra of PIDTV-ffBT in o-DCB solution (1 × 10−5 M) and solid films are shown in Fig. 1a. In solution, the absorption spectrum of the polymer exhibits strong absorption in the 500–750 nm region with a maximum absorption peak (λmax) at 695 nm. In the solid film, the maximum absorption peak is red-shifted to 716 nm with an absorption coefficient of 1.34 × 105 cm−1 (Fig. 1a), due to the strong intermolecular π–π stacking interaction of the polymer. PIDTV-ffBT shows an optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.53 eV estimated from the absorption edge (810 nm) of its thin film, which is comparable to that of DPP-based polymers.13,30 Furthermore, compared to the IDT-alt-BT-based analogue polymers (λmax ≈ 620–650 nm and Eoptg ≈ 1.76–1.78 eV),22–26PIDTV-ffBT shows a red shift of the absorption peak and the absorption edge and a higher extinction coefficient. This phenomenon indicates that a strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect exists between the IDTV and ffBT units, due to the increase of the electron-donating ability by fusing two vinylene groups at the 1,1′-positions of the IDTV unit (Scheme 1a). Thus a high Jsc is expected in the PSCs with the polymer as the donor material.

Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out to estimate the energy levels of the polymer (Fig. 1b). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels estimated from the onset of oxidation and reduction potentials (Eox/Ered, 0.52/−1.02 V vs. Ag/Ag+) for PIDTV-ffBT are −5.23/−3.69 eV according to the empirical equations:13b HOMO = −e(Eox + 4.71) (eV), and LUMO = −e(Ered + 4.71) (eV), respectively. Moreover, the electrochemical bandgap (Ecvg) of PIDTV-ffBT is 1.54 eV, which is almost identical to its Eoptg.
Theoretical calculations
Theoretical calculations of the polymer were carried out by the density functional theory (DFT) method with a B3LYP/6-31G*(d,p) basis set. As shown in Fig. 2a, the HOMO is delocalized along the whole π-conjugated backbone while the LUMO is mostly concentrated on the acceptor groups. These results indicate the formation of a well-defined D–π–A structure and the intramolecular charge transfer behavior of the material. As shown in Fig. 2b, the polymer backbone displays an almost straight line side view, which means that it has an outstanding planar structure. Moreover, the polymer backbone also shows a dominant continuous positive electrostatic potential (ESP), as shown in Fig. 2c.

(d) XRD pattern of the pure PIDTV-ffBT film. 
XRD analysis and charge carrier mobilities
Meanwhile, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was measured to study the crystallinity and molecular packing of the pure polymer film, as shown in Fig. 2d. A sharp and strong (100) diffraction peak at 2θ = 5.10°, corresponding to a d-spacing of 17.4 Å, is observed in the XRD pattern of the pure polymer film. This is a smaller lamellar spacing compared with those of the most widely used polymers such as PTB7 (>18 Å)32a and PCDTBT (>21 Å).32b Notably, there is a clear diffraction peak at 2θ = 25.3°, corresponding to the (010) π–π stacking with a d-spacing of 3.51 Å, which is obviously lower than that of IDT-alt-BT-based conjugated polymer analogues (3.8–4.1 Å).23a,33 The nearly flat polymer skeleton, continuous positive ESP, and small lamellar spacing and π–π stacking spacing are conducive for PIDTV-ffBT to achieve high carrier mobility.34
To estimate the hole mobility of PIDTV-ffBT, bottom-gate/bottom-contact organic field-effect transistors (OFET) were fabricated. Fig. S2 in the ESI† shows the corresponding output and transfer curves of the PIDTV-ffBT-based OFET devices. The on–off ratio is 3.9 × 104 with a threshold voltage (Vt) of 12.5 V. The OFET hole mobility of PIDTV-ffBT is as high as 0.032 cm2 V−1 s−1. The results confirm our design concept, that is, the extension of the effective conjugation length and the improvement of the planarity can promote intermolecular chain packing and charge transport. Notably, the hole mobility of PIDTV-ffBT measured by the SCLC method is also up to 5.04 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (see Fig. S3 and Table S1 in the ESI†).
Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of PIDTV-ffBT, PSCs were fabricated with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PIDTV-ffBT:PC71BM/PrC60MAIodide Salt/Al (see Fig. S4 in the ESI†) and were characterized under the illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2), where the commercially available PrC60MAIodide Salt was used as the cathode interfacial layer because of its high performance in PSCs.14a The effect of the donor/acceptor (D/A, PIDTV-ffBT:PC71BM) weight ratios (w/w) in the active layer on device performance was first studied in the range of D/A weight ratios from 1:1 to 1:2 for the blends. Fig. 3a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices, and the corresponding device parameters are listed in Table 1. We found that the D/A ratio plays an important role in determining the device photovoltaic performance. All the PSCs with different D/A weight ratios in the active layer with a thickness of ca. 90 nm show good photovoltaic performance with an average PCE higher than 5.6%, an average Jsc higher than 13.2 mA cm−2, and almost the same FF of ca. 59%. The optimum D/A weight ratio was found to be 1:1.5; the corresponding PSC showed the highest PCE of 6.7% with a Voc of 0.70 V, a Jsc of 16.2 mA cm−2, and a FF of 59%. Subsequently, the commonly used processing additive DIO with a high boiling point was used to optimize the morphology of the active layer for obtaining more efficient PSCs. Fig. S5 in the ESI† shows the J–V curves and EQE curves of the devices based on PIDTV-ffBT:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) with different DIO additive contents, and the corresponding device parameters are listed in Table S2 in the ESI.† We found that introducing DIO into the o-DCB blend solution can significantly improve the photovoltaic performance of the device. When 0.5% (v/v) DIO was added to the o-DCB blend solution, the PSC demonstrated a higher PCE of 7.1% benefitting from its higher Jsc, which increased from 16.2 to 17.4 mA cm−2. The highest PCE of 7.3% with a Voc of 0.70 V, a Jsc of 17.1 mA cm−2 and a FF of 61% was obtained for the PSCs with the treatment of 1% (v/v) DIO additive. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 7.3% and the Jsc of 17.4 mA cm−2 are among the highest values reported for PSCs with IDT-alt-BT-based polymers as donor materials.

Fig. 3b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the PSCs based on PIDTV-ffBT:PC71BM with different D/A weight ratios and with 1% DIO additive treatment. All devices show a broad EQE response in the wavelength range from ca. 300 to 810 nm. EQE values higher than 65% were observed in the range of 380–720 nm, and the maximum EQE value was close to 80% at 420 nm for the champion device with a D/A weight ratio of 1:1.5 and 1% DIO additive treatment, which indicates that the blend film (1:1.5, w/w) processed with 1% DIO has more efficient photon harvesting, exciton separating and charge transporting ability. According to the EQE curves and the solar irradiance spectrum, the mismatches between the integral Jsc values from the EQE curves and the measured Jsc values from J–V curves are below 3%.
To understand the main mechanisms involved in the PIDTV-ffBT:PC71BM-based PSCs, the charge generation and extraction properties were studied. We measured the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) of the PSCs, as shown in Fig. 3c. Jph can be described as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the photocurrent densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff can be described as Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage at which the photocurrent is zero and Vbias is the applied external voltage bias.34,35 Thus, Veff determines the electric field in the bulk region and thereby determines the carrier transport and the photocurrent extraction. At high Veff values, mobile charge carriers rapidly move toward the related electrodes with minimal recombination. Jph reaches saturation (17.5 mA cm−2) at Veff ≥ 2 V, which implies that all photogenerated charge carriers can be extracted by the electrodes. Under short-circuit conditions of the devices, Jph is 17.1 mA cm−2, which is comparable to that at high Veff. Near the maximum power output point, recombination will be strongly competing with the carrier extraction as carriers slow down due to the reduced electric field. However, the Jph of the PSCs based on PIDTV-ffBT:PC71BM (1% DIO) is still as high as 13.8 mA cm−2 at the maximum power point, ≈79% of all photogenerated carriers collected by the electrodes, indicating efficient photogenerated exciton dissociation and charge collection.
We also measured Jsc under different light intensities (P) to study the charge recombination under the short-circuit conditions of the cells (Fig. 3d). The relationship between Jsc and P can be defined as Jsc ∝ PS. If all free carriers are transported and collected at the electrodes prior to recombination, S should be equal to 1, while S < 1 indicates the existence of bimolecular recombination.36 In logarithmic coordinates, the Jsc shows a linear dependence on the light intensity with a slope (S) of 0.96, indicative of efficient charge transportation and negligible bimolecular recombination.
In order to understand the effect of DIO additive on the photovoltaic performance of the device, the charge mobilities were measured by the SCLC method.14 As shown in Fig. S3 and Table S1 in the ESI,† the blend films processed with 1% DIO exhibited higher hole mobility and electron mobility (4.13 × 10−4 and 1.57 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) compared to the blend films without any post-processing (1.81 × 10−4 and 2.16 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The relatively higher charge mobilities of holes and electrons are beneficial to achieve higher Jsc and FF values for the PSCs.
AFM and TEM morphologies
To gain further insight into the surface and bulk morphologies of the active layer, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were carried out. Fig. 4 shows the TEM images of the PIDTV-ffBT:PC71BM blends with different D/A weight ratios or with 1% DIO. Without any post-processing, all the blend films showed fibrous features, while the blend films showed an increased fibrous structure with the increase of PC71BM content in the active layer. Upon mixing 1% DIO with the blend solution, the PIDTV-ffBT:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) film shows a bicontinuous D/A interpenetrating network with a more suitable fiber size of ca. 10 nm and a well-developed and uniform fibrillar morphology compared to the blend film without DIO treatment, which would be beneficial to obtain more efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport for devices, and thus a higher PCE value can be obtained. As shown in Fig. 5, the AFM images of the PIDTV-ffBT:PC71BM blend films (1:1.5, w/w) without or with 1% DIO confirm the results of the TEM measurements. When 1% DIO was added to the blend solution, the blend film showed a smaller root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value and a more uniform fibrillar structure compared to the blends without DIO. The RMS roughness values are 1.91 and 1.36 nm for the blends processed without and with 1% DIO, respectively.

Conclusions
A novel ladder-type conjugated D–A copolymer PIDTV-ffBT based on a 1,1′-vinylene-fused indacenodithiophene (IDTV) donor unit was synthesized for application as a donor material in PSCs. Compared to other analogue polymers, PIDTV-ffBT exhibited excellent planarity and a 22 π-electron fused system leading to enhanced charge carrier mobility and an extended absorption spectrum with a high absorption coefficient. The PIDTV-ffBT:PC71BM-based PSCs achieved a good PCE of 7.3% with a high Jsc of 17.1 mA cm−2, which is the highest Jsc reported for PSCs with ladder-type polymers as donor materials. Our work indicates that the introduction of the 1,1′-vinylene-fused structure into the IDTV unit for ladder-type polymers is an effective strategy to enhance the light absorption coefficient and improve charge carrier mobility for efficient PSCs.

The mixture was kept at −78 °C for 1.5 h; then, trimethyltin chloride (8.4 mL, 1 M in hexane) was added and the mixture was stirred overnight at RT. The mixture was poured into 100 mL water and extracted with diethyl ether, and the combined organic phase was washed with water and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The solvent was removed and the crude product was recrystallized with ethanol two times to obtain IDTV-Sn as light-yellow crystals (2.3 g, yield 79%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, TMS), δ (ppm): 7.61 (s, 2H), 7.34 (s, 2H), 6.32 (d, J = 10.2 Hz, 2H), 3.06–3.04 (m, 2H), 1.64–1.61 (m, 8H), 1.48–1.46 (m, 8H), 1.28–1.22 (m, 32H), 0.85–0.83 (m, 12H), 0.42 (s, 18H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3, TMS), (ppm): 151.10, 144.61, 141.20, 139.19, 132.84, 132.33, 130.56, 129.46, 111.22, 40.72, 39.88, 36.75, 35.93, 35.10, 31.84, 29.96, 29.57, 29.35, 28.42, 27.59, 26.76, 22.67, 14.50, 13.68, 8.55. MALDI-TOF MS (m/z) for C54H86S2Sn2, calcd: 1036.42, found: 1036.33.
Synthesis of the polymer PIDTV-ffBT
In a dry 50 mL flask, tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (3.5 mg) and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (5.1 mg) were added to a solution of IDTV-Sn (200 mg, 0.2 mmol) and ffBT-Br (64 mg, 0.2 mmol) in 12 mL degassed toluene under argon and stirred vigorously at 110 °C for 1.5 h. Then the mixture was poured into methanol (100 mL) leading to precipitation. The collected polymer was dried and dissolved in o-DCB, and then the solution was filtered through a silica gel column. The collected o-DCB solution was concentrated and precipitated with methanol to get a dark solid (124 mg, 71%). GPC: Mn = 28.0 kDa; Mw = 90.7 kDa; PDI = 3.24. Anal. calcd for C54H70F2N2S3 (%): C, 73.59; H, 8.01. Found (%): C, 72.81; H, 8.49.
