    AbstractWe report a novel preparation method for nanocrystalline TiO2 networks with controlled pore sizes using spherical polyelectrolyte brushes (SPB) as templates. The SPB consists of a solid polystyrene core from which anionic polyelectrolytes are densely grafted. The SPB templates are synthesized via conventional photoemulsion polymerization with efficient control of core size and brush length. Subsequently, the TiO2 precursor is hydrolyzed at room temperature within the anionic brush to obtain anatase nanocrystals of 12–20 nm size. These stable and form-persistent composite particles of SPB decorated with anatase nanocrystals are then assembled on a conductive substrate. The subsequent calcination of this composite layer leads to a robust nanocrystalline TiO2 network, in which the pores and the wall thickness are directly correlated to the polystyrene core size and the amount of TiO2 hydrolyzed within the brush respectively. In this study, we optimized different thin-film preparation methods and characterized the resulting nanocrystalline TiO2 networks using SEM and XRD. Moreover, the applicability of these nanocrystalline networks as electron transport layers are tested in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (SDSCs). The first test devices exhibited efficiencies up to 0.8%. The precise and individual control of parameters such as porosity, thickness and crystallinity makes this concept highly attractive for the realization of efficient solid-state hybrid devices.
Introduction
Low cost photovoltaic devices based on porous titanium dioxide electrodes have been the focus of scientific research within the last decades. The advantages of high chemical stability, low toxicity and good availability turn this material into the most attractive inorganic broad-band electron transport material.1 Several methods are established for the preparation of mesoporous nanocrystalline TiO2, which includes hydrothermal methods,2 chemical vapor deposition,3 liquid phase deposition4 and sol–gel processes.5 The latter is most commonly used in combination with polyethylene glycol additives to form stabilized mesoporous layers.6 Grätzel et al. obtained high power conversion efficiencies of above 10% on the basis of a mesoporous TiO2 layer sensitized with dye in combination with a I−/I3− redox electrolyte as hole transport material.7 However, to guarantee an adequate long-term stability for photovoltaic devices attempts have been undertaken to replace this liquid hole conductor using solid-state materials. Organic low molecular weight materials as well as semiconductor polymers are promising alternatives.8,9 Using low molecular weight spiro-OMeTAD efficiencies in the range of 5% have been already reported.10 On the other hand the use of polymer sensitizers and/or hole conductors lead to insufficient pore filling and decreased device performance.11–14 In general for solid-state devices, the thickness of the porous layer must be reduced to 1–2 μm from the original 10–20 μm in electrolyte cells to guarantee an efficient pore filling and charge transport through the solid organic hole conductor. Since the infiltration of porous TiO2 with solid-state hole conductors depends largely on the pore size and the pore continuity of the TiO2 network, an exact control of the morphology in terms of porosity is required.15 Additionally a high electron diffusion length, almost 2–3 times the thickness of the porous TiO2 layer is essential to transport and collect all separated charges.16–18 Therefore a better individual control of the pore size, morphology and thickness of the porous titania layer is desired for solid state devices. Several approaches have been attempted to gain control over the resulting TiO2 structures. One of these methods deals with the use of amphiphilic block copolymers as additives in sol–gel to control the resulting mesoscale structure of the titania network.19,20 This control is based both on the microphase separation and the diverse colloid structures of the block copolymer used. During this self-organization process several factors such as the polymer concentration, the nature of the colloid structures such as micelles or vesicles or the precursor content influence the resulting metal oxide network morphology. In consequence, much effort has to be spent in this concept to guarantee the control and reproducibility of the resulting titania networks. Another concept that is already successfully applied in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells is based on vertically aligned TiO2 nanostructures as nanotubes or rods prepared by anodic oxidation.21,22 Further initiatives utilize replica of titania prepared from blockcopolymer templates carrying sacrificial blocks23,24 or well ordered scaffolds of polystyrene latex particles as templates to gain control over the pore size as well as periodicity of the TiO2 network.25
We present a new convenient templated preparation of porous nanocrystalline metal oxide networks with control of the morphology. Spherical polyelectrolyte brushes (SPB) were used as templates to crystallize titania within these brushes and these SPB-TiO2 composite particles were assembled on a conducting surface. In a final step these hybrid layers were calcinated to remove the organic templates resulting in a nanocrystalline titania network with well-defined pore sizes. These porous titania layers were characterized using SEM and XRD. Further they were applied as electrodes in solid-state solar cells.
Experimental
Materials
Tetraethylorthotitanate (TEOT, 97%), glycerin (99%), 4-tert-butyl pyridine (99%), titanium(IV)bis(acetoacetonato)-di(isopropanoxylate) (TAA, 75 wt% solution in isopropanol) and N-lithiofluoromethane sulfonamide (LiN(SO2CF3)2, 99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. The solvents ethanol (VWR p.a.), DMF (Fluka, puriss. absolute over molecular sieve) and chlorobenzene (Fluka, puriss. absolute over molecular sieve) were also purchased and used as received. The Solid hole conductor, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenyl amino)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) was purchased from Merck, Germany. Glass substrates (Tec 15) covered with a 0.5 μm thick fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) layer having a sheet resistance of 15 Ohm per square were purchased from Hartford Glass Co. Inc., Indiana, USA. The dye cis-di(isothiocyanato)-(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid)-(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-bis[4-(diphenylamino)styryl]-ruthenium(II) (Ru-NCS-TPA) was previously synthesized in our workgroup.18
Characterization methods
Optical studies were made using a Zeiss Axio Imager A1m optical microscope. All images were recorded with an attached AxioCam MRc5 digital camera and transferred to the connected computer. All SEM images were recorded on a Zeiss 1530 field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The applied voltage was always between 1 and 3 kV. To increase the contrast and to improve the uniformity of the images, in some cases a thin layer of carbon (10–15 nm) was sputtered on the samples with a Bal-tec MED 010 machine under vacuum. TEM images were recorded on a Zeiss CEM902 transmission electron microscope. The samples were prepared by drying a drop of a highly diluted dispersion of SPB-TiO2 composite particles on a carbon coated Cu grid (200 mesh).
Preparation of the SPB-TiO2 composite particles
For the preparation of the SPB-TiO2 composite particles we used PS-NaSS (polystyrene sodium sulfonate) brush particles with a core radius of 74 nm (measured by dynamic light scattering) and a brush length of approximately 200 nm prepared by photo-emulsion polymerization.26,27 For the synthesis of TiO2 nanocomposite particles only a batch process has been used. The reaction conditions are listed in Table 1.

For a typical run, PS-NaSS brush particles were dispersed in ethanol. Water was then added while stirring to enable the hydrolysis of the TiO2 precursor. The reaction was initiated by adding a solution of 0.15 ml tetraethylorthotitanate (TEOT) dissolved in 8 ml ethanol. For a semi-batch process, the TEOT solution was added drop wise at a feeding rate of 0.08 ml/min. The reaction mixture was stirred vigorously for two more hours after the complete addition of TEOT solution at room temperature. The TiO2 alcosols were then washed with ethanol and water by repeated centrifugation 3 times and redispersed into water after cleaning.
For the exchange of solvent the aqueous dispersion was washed with ethanol via ultra filtration columns over a filter with 100 nm pore size until the water was removed completely. The glycerin dispersions were prepared by the addition of glycerin at a weight ratio of 9:1 against SPB-TiO2 composite and a subsequent evaporation of the ethanol.
TiO2 network preparation
To assemble the SPB-TiO2 composite particles on conductive substrates, 100 μl of a 5 wt% dispersion of SPB-TiO2 particles for example in ethanol were spread over an active area of 2.5 cm to 1 cm, leading to a film thickness of approximately 2 μm after drying. The alternative 10 wt% dispersions in glycerin were applied using a 30 μm doctor blade, to receive a comparable film thickness after evaporation of the solvent. All samples, their respective preparation conditions and the resulting dry film thicknesses are summarized in Table 2.

To avoid direct contact of FTO and hole conductor, the substrates were previously covered with a compact layer of TiO2 by spray pyrolysis of a 0.2 M titanium(IV)bis(acetoacetonato)-di(isopropanoxylate) solution in ethanol as reported elsewhere.28 The direct calcination in air was carried out on a thermally controlled hot plate according to the following program: heating to 250 °C at a ramp of 5 K/min, keeping at 250 °C for 6 h, further heating to 500 °C at a ramp of 5 K/min, keeping at 500 °C for 1 h and cooling to room temperature at a ramp of 20 K/min. In the two-step calcination process a robust carbon composite was obtained after 2 h at 250 °C and 5 h at 500 °C in a quartz glass tube thoroughly flushed with argon. The removal of this composite was achieved by heating the substrates for additional 30 min at 500 °C under air.
Solar cell preparation and characterization
After the calcination, the samples were washed with demineralized water to remove residual salt contents (see supporting information) and we immersed the substrates in a 0.5 mM solution of Ru-NCS-TPA for sensitization.29 For the preparation of the organic hole conductor layer, 70 μl solution of 0.14 mol/l 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenyl amino)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene, 0.02 mol/l Li[(CF3SO2)2N] and 0.12 mol/l 4-tert-butyl pyridine (t-bp) in chlorobenzene were spin coated at 2000 rpm for 40 s. Au was finally applied by sublimation in an AUTO 306 vacuum chamber from Edwards. The photovoltaic current–voltage measurements were carried out by a Keithley 6517 Source-Measure unit under AM 1.5 G conditions (xenon arc lamp, Air Mass filters from Oriel). The intensity of light was calibrated with a standard Si-reference cell from the Fraunhofer Institut für Solarenergie (ISE), Freiburg as 100 mW/cm2. For preparation of mesoporous TiO2 as reference, a commercial paste (Dyesol TiO2 Paste DSL 18NR-T) was diluted with terpineol to give a 2 μm thick layer after calcination, using a 90T screen printing mesh.
TiO2 content and dye load determination
All tested substrates with FTO and a compact TiO2 blocking layer were first weighted by a micro balance. After film preparation and calcination the weight of the substrates was again determined. Out of these values the weight of the dry film and the calcinated network was calculated. The TiO2 content is given as the fraction of the TiO2 network mass against the dry film mass.
For dye load measurements the substrates were laid into a glass basin of 20 ml volume without touching any side walls. For dye coating the substrates were covered with exactly 400 μl of an 0.5 mM solution of Ru-TPA-NCS in DMF and kept in the closed glass basins for 16 h. Afterwards, the substrates were carefully taken off the solution using a pair of tweezers. Kept above the basin the coated samples were washed with exactly 10 ml of DMF. For exact determination all solution must be collected in the glass basin. The concentrations of the washing solutions were estimated from UV-Vis absorption measurements. The exact dye amount in the solutions was calculated according to Lambert-Beer using the known absorption coefficients.30 As reference a bare substrate with blocking layer was treated equally and the dye amount in the washing solution was also calculated. Finally the exact dye quantity on the TiO2 network was determined as the difference of the residual dye amount in the reference cell solution and the respective sample solutions.
Results and discussion
The SPB template system consists of a solid polystyrene (PS) core, from which anionic polyelectrolyte chains are densely grafted by covalent bonds.26 Similar to simple latex particles, the polystyrene core is easily synthesized in an emulsion polymerization with good control of the polydispersity and size. Subsequently polyelectrolyte brushes are grown from the photoinitiator immobilized surface of the PS-core via photopolymerization of sodium styrene sulfonate (NaSS) monomer. These SPB particles allow the growth of nanocrystals of titania within the brush by the hydrolysis of any TiO2 precursor at room temperature. However these SPB particles – in contrast to common PS-beads – enable the control of the TiO2 wall thickness, by their adjustable brush length. Thus we combine the advantages of both the rigidity of the latex template process and the flexibility of the block copolymer templated sol–gel approach. Recently, we have reported the catalytic activity of similarly prepared SPB-TiO2 composites.27 Additionally, the possibility of obtaining porous TiO2 network from SPB-TiO2 nanocomposites were also demonstrated. However it is a challenge to prepare porous TiO2 electrodes from these composite particles on conducting substrates suitable for device application.
Here we report the successful preparation, optimization and application of porous TiO2 electrodes from SPB-TiO2 nanocomposites. In general, we used an aqueous dispersion of PS-NaSS brush particles with a core radius of 74 nm (measured by dynamic light scattering) and a brush length of approximately 200 nm prepared by photo-emulsion polymerization. By reducing the feed rate of tetraethylorthotitanate (TEOT), the hydrolysis of the precursor can be controlled and nanocrystalline TiO2 particles are formed within the brush at room temperature. After washing the as synthesized particles, we obtained stable SPB-TiO2 composite particles dispersed in water. The solvent was finally exchanged via ultrafiltration to improve the wetting characteristics of the dispersions. In this way, diverse dispersions in solvents such as ethanol and glycerin with different contents of SPB-TiO2 particle were prepared. For obtaining electrodes suitable for solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (SDSCs) we focused on a continuous assembly of composite particles on transparent conductive substrates (fluorinated tin-oxide: FTO). The dispersions were applied on conductive substrates using doctor blade or drop cast techniques and dried. The final removal of the polymer brush templates by calcination leads to a macroporous scaffold of anatase nanoparticles. A general scheme of the preparation of a porous network on a conductive substrate is shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  General scheme for the preparation of a porous TiO2 network with controllable crystalline structures and morphology on a FTO substrate using spherical polyelectrolyte brush (SPB) particles as template. The precursor tetraethylorthotitanate (TEOT) is hydrolyzed within the brush to form the SPB-TiO2 composite particles that are applied to a conductive substrate and calcinated to get a highly crystalline TiO2 network. 
Independent of the nature of the substrate the resulting nanocrystalline TiO2 networks exhibit a large surface area in the range of 60 to 70 m2/g (from BET analysis) after calcination in air. Fig. 2 presents SEM images of SPB-TiO2 nanocomposite particles on conductive substrate (a) and the resulting TiO2 network after calcination (b). Obviously the removal of the PS core leaves macropores of approximately 100 nm and robust TiO2 network walls of few nanometer thickness on FTO substrate.

Further XRD measurements of the SPB-TiO2 composite particles obtained at room temperature and the resulting scaffold after calcination in air were carried out (Fig. 3). Usually sol–gel approaches lead to amorphous TiO2 structures which can be transformed into anatase or rutile crystallites via heat and pressure treatment. In our case the XRD measurements of the composite particles indicate, that a pure anatase phase of the nanocrystals is formed at room temperature (Fig. 3a taken from ref. 27). After calcination on FTO substrate the pure anatase phase of titania is maintained in the porous titania network (Fig. 3b). All the characteristic reflection peaks of anatase phase could be observed in both samples.

A key requirement for highly efficient electrodes for solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (SDSC) is a homogeneous and uniform porous layer of nanocrystalline TiO2.9 Any formation of cracks during the assembly/drying or calcination process of the dispersions has to be avoided. In this context the surface polarity and roughness have a significant influence on avoiding cracks and the formation of smooth films. Secondly, several other factors such as temperature, humidity, nature of solvent (polarity, surface tension and boiling point) and colloidal concentration affect the assembly process of the SPB—TiO2 composite particles. For the preparation of homogeneous thin films with thickness of about 2 μm, we tested different solvents such as water, ethanol and glycerin as dispersion mediums, different drying temperatures and concentrations of SPB-TiO2 composite particles. Here we report the following four different preparation techniques SPB-TiO2-1a-d for the assembly and drying of composite particles. All these SBP—TiO2 composite particles were obtained by the hydrolysis of TEOT under the conditions of SPB : TEOT : water = 1:4:4 (weight ratio). The concentration of the SPB-TiO2 composite particles in dispersion was also varied from 1 to 10 wt%: Sample SPB-TiO2-1a: drop coating from 1 wt% water dispersion, dried at 25 °C, Sample SPB-TiO2-1b: drop coating from 5 wt% ethanol dispersion, dried at 25 °C, Sample SPB-TiO2-1c: drop coating from 5 wt% ethanol dispersion, dried at 2 °C, Sample SPB-TiO2-1d: doctor blading from 10 wt% glycerin dispersion, dried at 120 °C.
The resulting composite films on FTO obtained from the above four different preparation methods were characterized using optical as well as scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The films obtained from water (SPB-TiO2-1a) and ethanol at 25 °C (SPB-TiO2-1b) exhibited macroscopic cracks which could be observed in an optical microscope and therefore were not further considered for application. On the other hand the films from ethanol at 2 °C (SPB-TiO2-1c) and glycerin (SPB-TiO2-1d) showed almost uniform crack-free films under the optical microscope. Therefore these two samples were further characterized and the SEM images are given in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  SEM images of samples on an FTO substrate: a) Sample SPB-TiO2-1c (drop casted from 5 wt% ethanol dispersion, dried at 2 °C), b) Sample SPB-TiO2-1d (doctor bladed from 10 wt% glycerin dispersion, dried at 120 °C). 
The samples assembled from water led to an uncontrolled aggregation of the particles and a non-uniform surface. Also the fast evaporation of ethanol as solvent at 20 °C resulted in cracks. In order to reduce the evaporation speed, we additionally dried the dispersion on the substrates at low temperature of 2 °C. This approach results in an almost homogeneous and uniform layer (Fig. 4a), but at larger magnification still small cracks are visible. In spite of the relatively good film properties the preparation using ethanol as solvent also appeared to be very sensitive to the environmental conditions such as humidity. An exchange of the solvent from ethanol to glycerin resulted in dense dispersions suitable for doctor blade coating method. The high viscosity of this medium led to stable and homogenous wet films after coating. Due to the high boiling point of glycerin, we were also able to raise the temperature for the drying process to 120 °C inhibiting all humidity effects. This combination provided the best conditions for the reproducable formation of highly homogeneous films (Fig. 4b), which was not affected by any changes in environmental conditions.
The two latter assembly methods (sample SPB-TiO2-1c and sample SPB-TiO2-1d) were selected for the calcination step in which the SPB is burnt away and a TiO2 nanocrystalline network is generated. The surface SEM images of these two samples after calcinations in air are shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  Surface SEM images under different magnification of porous TiO2 films obtained from different samples on FTO substrates after calcination: a) Sample SPB-TiO2-1c (drop casted from 5 wt% ethanol dispersion, dried at 2 °C), b) Sample SPB-TiO2-1d (doctor bladed from 10 wt% glycerin dispersion, dried at 120 °C). 
The smooth surfaces as expected from the assembled films are maintained after the calcination step, but the porosity is increased considerably. Furthermore, as visible from the insets in Fig. 5, the pore size correlates well with the SPB particle size of 100 nm. Comparing the preparation techniques, the sample SPB-TiO2-1d exhibits better smoothness than the sample SPB-TiO2-1c. It has been shown in our earlier work that a two-step calcination procedure, first under argon followed by air, suppresses the tendency of the network to collapse. Moreover contaminations of the titania network could also be minimized.27 Therefore we applied a two-step calcination process for preparing electrodes (see methods section).
An additional question here was whether the TiO2 wall thickness/content can be varied by changing the added TEOT precursor concentration. In this regard, we varied the precursor and water content during the hydrolysis reaction from the standard SPB-TiO2-1 (SPB/TEOT/water ratio of 1/4/4 wt/wt) used for the assembly and thin film preparation described above to get additional SPB-TiO2-2 and SPB—TiO2—3 samples as summarized in Table 3. In SPB-TiO2-2 the water content was increased by a factor of about 4 keeping the TEOT amount constant, whereas in SPB-TiO2-3, the TEOT amount was also increased. The resulting SPB-TiO2 composite particles were examined by transmission electron microscopy. The TEM images of the respective samples are shown in Fig. 6.

 Fig. 6  Comparison of different SPB-TiO2 composite particles prepared according to the following reaction conditions: a) TEM image of SPB-TiO2-1 obtained from SPB/TEOT/water wt/wt ratio of 1/4/4, b) SPB-TiO2-2 prepared from SPB/TEOT/water wt/wt ratio of 1/4/18 and c) SPB-TiO2-3 from SPB/TEOT/water wt/wt ratio of 1/6/18. 
By increasing the water content from the sample SPB-TiO2-1 to sample SPB-TiO2-2, a dense layer of titania was formed covering the whole PS-core. A possible explanation is the presence of a dense layer of water soaked up in the polyelectrolyte corona at high water content, which hydrolyzes TEOT uniformly. In consequence at low water content (in SPB-TiO2-1) the precursor can only be hydrolyzed in the water covered parts of the SPB particle. On the other hand, the increase of the precursor content from sample SPB-TiO2-2 to SPB-TiO2-3 resulted in densely packed titania nanocrystals on SPB surface. Thus there is an enormous influence of precursor/water content on the resulting TiO2 nanocrystal morphology. For the assembly and calcination on conducting surface, SPB-TiO2-2 and SPB-TiO2-3 samples were treated under the same conditions as those for SPB-TiO2-1d (assembled from 10 wt% glycerin dispersion and dried at 120 °C) and calcinated in a two-step procedure as described above.
Finally, we prepared solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (SCSCs) in order to study the suitability of these differently prepared TiO2 networks as porous electrodes in devices. The details of the different preparation steps are given in the methods section. The FTO substrates used were previously covered with a compact layer of titania to avoid contact of the hole conductor with the FTO electrode as described earlier.28 Subsequent to calcination of different titania samples on such substrates, we immersed the substrates in a solution of cis-Di(isothiocyanato)-(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxy)-(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-bis[4-(diphenylamino)styryl]-ruthenium(II) (Ru-TPA-NCS) for sensitization.29 As organic hole conductor we used 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spiro-bifluoren (Spiro-OMeTAD), doped with N-lithiofluoromethane sulfonamide (Li[(CF3SO2)2N]) and tert-butyl pyridine (t-bp). This combination of dye and hole conductor materials is well tested in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells.9
The SEM cross sectional images of the various stages such as assembled SPB-TiO2 composite layer, calcinated TiO2 network and the complete solar cell from sample SPB-TiO2-1d as a typical example is shown in Fig. 7. The pore size in Fig. 7b corresponds to the composite particle size in Fig. 7a and a complete infiltration of the pores by the solid hole conductor is obvious in Fig. 7c. The thickness variation between Fig. 7a and 7b is due to a partial shrinkage of the structure during the calcination process and was visible in all samples.
 Fig. 7  SEM cross sectional images of sample SPB-TiO2-1d as a representative example for all samples at different stages of preparation: a) SPB-TiO2 composite particles assembled on conductive substrate, b) calcinated porous TiO2 network, c) SDSC sensitized with dye and filled with organic hole conductor. 
The solar cell performance from the samples SPB-TiO2-1c (under two different calcinations conditions) and SPB-TiO2-1d in a two-step calcination method are first compared in Fig. 8. Also a schematic presentation of the cross section of such a solar cell is given.For the sample SPB—TiO2—1c (one-step calcination in air), a low photocurrent and a photovoltage of 525 mV was observed. By changing the calcination process from one-step calcinations in air to the two-step procedure an increase of 160 mV was obtained for this sample. The lower open circuit voltages of sample SPB—TiO2—1c calcinated in one-step could be attributed to surface defects and impurity enclosures caused by the fast agglomeration of the particles while sintering under air. The impurities enclosed affect the electron transport in the TiO2 network and the energy level of its conduction band. In contrast, the two-step calcination leading to a robust carbon composite stabilizes the structure and leaves the surface unaffected. The final removal of the amorphous carbon occurs very fast and releases the solidified TiO2 structure so that no impurities are enclosed. Thus the solar cells prepared from titania obtained in a two-step calcinations process deliver a remarkable open circuit voltage of 685 mV, which is close to reported values for devices prepared with highly optimized commercial nanocrystalline TiO2 pastes. Additionally, a two-fold improvement in short circuit was achieved from 0.5 mA/cm2 (for the ethanol route) in SPB—TiO2—1c to 0.9 mA/cm2 in SPB-TiO2-1d using glycerin as medium for the assembly of the particles. The high Voc (> 650 mV) could be maintained in the sample SPB—TiO2—1d. This can be attributed to the improved smoothness and crack-free titania layers obtained in this sample (compare Fig. 5).

Additionally SPB-TiO2-2 and SPB-TiO2-3 were used for the preparation of the mesoporous TiO2 electrode and tested SDSC. For comparison an optimized commercial TiO2 paste (sample: com.

Drastic improvements in photocurrent as well as fill factor were observed by varying the preparation conditions of the SPB composite particles. Thus an Jsc to 1.3 mA/cm2 was obtained by increasing the water content during the hydrolysis of TiO2 in sample SPB—TiO2—2. A further increase in Jsc was observed to 2.3 mA/cm2 by a higher TEOT content in SPB—TiO2—3. For both samples SPB—TiO2—2 and SPB—TiO2—3 higher fill factor values above 50% were obtained. To understand the factors contributing towards improvement in the performance of TiO2 electrodes, the following studies with respect to the amount of TiO2 on FTO substrates as well as dye uptake and morphology were carried out. Table 6 shows a summary of these results.

First the exact amount of TiO2 in the composite film as well as TiO2 network was determined using gravimetric analysis. For this purpose, the exact weight of the bare substrate, the dry film and the calcinated network was determined using a micro balance and the TiO2 content was calculated. The TGA measurements of the dried bulk material confirm the gravimetric measurements performed on substrates (see supporting informations). The TiO2 content varies drastically from sample SPB—TiO2—1d to SPB—TiO2—2 and SPB—TiO2—3. It is obvious from Table 6 that with addition of more water during the hydrolysis, the TiO2 content in composite decreases drastically in sample SPB—TiO2—2, despite an equal precursor content in both samples. This can be explained as due to an enhanced hydrolysis of the TEOT outside the brushes, which is washed off during the purification. Moreover, an increased TiO2 content was observed in sample SPB—TiO2—3 with increasing precursor content. Thus sample SPB—TiO2—3 exhibits the highest TiO2 content after calcination.
In a second experiment the exact dye uptake for different titania electrodes was measured by UV-Vis spectroscopy. As the dye Ru—TPA—NCS shows only limited solubility in basic methanol or acetonitrile solutions, it was not possible to desorb the dye from the TiO2 surface completely. In consequence, we calculated the adsorbed dye amount from the residual dye solution left after chemisorbtion. The detailed procedure is given in the methods section. In short, the substrates were covered with exactly 400 μl of an 0.5 mM solution of Ru-TPA-NCS in DMF for coating over night (16 h) and after removing the substrates the residual dye solution was diluted and analyzed. As control experiment a bare substrate without a porous TiO2 layer was treated in a similar fashion and the amount of dye uptake for all substrates was corrected using this data. The dye uptake results were compared to the TiO2 contents as well as the obtained short circuit current for the solar cells using the respective samples (Table 6).
The absolute amount of dye adsorbed, which is a measure for the available active area on the TiO2 network for dye anchoring, is directly correlated to the TiO2 amount on the substrates as well as the porosity for all the samples. Thus SPB—TiO2—3 having highest TiO2 content absorbs also the highest amount of dye (3.45 10−8 mol per 0.336 mg of TiO2). Interestingly, SPB—TiO2—3 also delivers the highest Jsc in solar cells (2.3 mA/cm2). We also calculated the amount of dye adsorbed/mg TiO2 for all the samples. This gives a clear picture regarding the available surface area and compactness of the different films. Thus sample SPB—TiO2—1d with an appreciable amount of titania exhibits the highest amount of dye/mg TiO2, which means that the TiO2 network is very fine, favoring high dye uptake, but detrimental for electron transport in network. In sample SPB—TiO2—2 the absolute amount of TiO2 is the lowest corresponding to a less amount absorbed dye. It also corresponds to the lowest value of dye/mg TiO2, which can be explained as due to the presence of a more compact network structure, which favors better charge transport. Even though the absolute amount of dye adsorbed in sample SPB—TiO2—3 is the highest, the amount of dye/mg TiO2 increases. Therefore an expected 3fold increase in Jsc could not be observed on comparison with SPB—TiO2—2. On the other hand the commercial sample has very high amount of TiO2 with large available active area for dye adsorption. It also has an optimum of amount of dye/mg TiO2 (7.98 10−8 mol/mg) indicating dense TiO2 network, which favors efficient electron transport.
The above facts are fully supported by high resolution SEM images of the resulting morphology of the respective samples, shown in Fig. 10. While sample SPB—TiO2—1d mainly leads to the formation of a very thin network, sample SPB—TiO2—2 forms dense, even closed spherical TiO2 wall structures. These observations can be directly correlated to the TEM images of the composite particles (Fig. 6). The sample SPB—TiO2—3 possesses a similar dense structure as sample SPB—TiO2—2, but showing a increased roughness of the TiO2 structures. Thus this SPB template method allows the tuning of the network density, the absolute amount of TiO2 and morphology of the resulting porous electrode. Also the differences in solar cell performance could be well correlated with the network properties and dye uptake. It is also worthy to note that in first results, the electrode obtained from sample SPB—TiO2—3 exhibits an appreciable power conversion efficiency of 0.8% in a solid-state device.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we successfully introduced a new template system using spherical polyelectrolyte brush particles for the controlled preparation of a nanocrystalline TiO2 network on conducting substrates. We examined different preparation methods and studied the titania structures as photoelectrodes in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells. The dispersant as well as the drying conditions had a major influence on the resulting structure and in consequence on the device performance. One of the key advantages of this method is that the pore size in the final TiO2 network is well correlated to the SPB core size, which can allow the tuning of pore size by varying the SPB size. Additionally the size of the TiO2 nanocrystals as well as the wall thickness of the resulting TiO2 network can be regulated by varying the precursor/water content. The first results in solar cells emphasize the importance of a homogeneous film and a stable and pure TiO2 structure. Furthermore, by varying the morphology of the TiO2 network, dense and well connected TiO2 walls were found to be key parameters for efficient dye uptake and charge transport. Finally, the best device reached a power conversion efficiency of 0.8% under AM 1.5 G conditions. The advantages of controlling the different criteria like surface effects, pore size and wall thickness in an effortless and fast system offer this concept the potential to solve numerous issues concerning solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells. The final aim should be directed towards high TiO2 content with maximum active area for dye adsorption and optimum dense network morphology as in highly optimized commercial TiO2 pastes.
