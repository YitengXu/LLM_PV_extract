    , Accepted 14th September 2021First published on 22nd September 2021AbstractPerovskite solar cells (per-SCs) with high performance and cost-effective solution processing have been the center of interest for researchers in the past decade. Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been gradually improved up to 25.2% with relatively improved stability, which is an unparalleled progress in all generations of solar cell (SC) technology. However, there are still some prevailing challenges regarding the stability and upscaling of these promising devices. Recently, 2D layered materials (LMs) have been extensively explored to overcome the prevailing challenges of poor stability (under moisture, light soaking and high temperature), halide segregation, hysteresis, involvement of toxic materials (i.e., lead), and upscaling of devices. A critical review addressing the recent developments in the use of 2D materials, especially transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), is hence necessary. The development of novel synthesis and deposition techniques including liquid-metal synthesis and ultrasonic assisted spray pyrolysis has offered more efficient fabrication of 2D-LMs with controlled thickness and morphology. Effective functionalization approaches to increase the dispersability of 2D-LMs in non-polar solvents has boosted their potential application in solar cell technology as well. Moreover, compositing 2D TMDCs with suitable organic/inorganic compounds has enabled superior charge kinetics in all functional parts of per-SCs. In addition, newly developed materials such as graphyne and graphdyine along with 2D metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been employed in per-SCs to achieve PCEs up to 20%. This review summarizes the recent progress and challenges in the application of 2D-LMs in per-SCs and outlines the future pathways to further extend the PCE of per-SCs beyond 25%. This review particularly focuses on 2D-LMs as electrode materials and additives, the underlying charge (electron–hole) transport phenomenon in the functional layers, and their chemical and structural stability.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (per-SCs) get their name from a well-known mineral calcium titanate (CaTiO3), which is named as perovskite, since they have a similar structure as that of CaTiO3.1 Perovskite structures are represented by the generic formula ABX3, where A and B are cationic species while X represents the anionic component. A cuboctahedral geometry is formed by a 12-coordinated (X) A site while the B site forms an octahedral structure with 6-coordinated X species in a perovskite structure. The unique property of accommodating large-sized cations makes perovskite materials highly suitable for the fabrication of organic–inorganic SCs. Conventionally, per-SCs are categorized as normal (n–i–p) and (p–i–n) devices based on the direction of incident light transmission.2 Similar to dye-sensitized (DSSCs) and organic solar cells (OSCs), per-SCs can be easily converted into flexible, portable, and cost-effective power devices, along with high yielding solution-based fabrication.3–6 Intensive academic and industrial research work, therefore, has been reported on the development and advancement of per-SCs in the last 10 years. Significant improvements in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of per-SCs (3.8% to 25.5%) have been made from 2010–2020, competing with silicon-based SCs.7 The excellent optoelectronic features that make per-SCs highly desirable include adequate band gap, large absorption coefficient, longer diffusion lengths, exceptional charge mobility, and lower exciton recombination rate.8–12 Regardless of these magnificent properties, there are still some limitations regarding the stability, environment friendliness, and PCE of per-SCs for their practical and commercial use.13,14
Recently, researchers have diverted their attention to two-dimensional (2D) layered materials (LMs) to be used in solar cell technology for enhanced PCEs and stability, especially after the discovery of graphene (GR) as a counterpart of bulk graphite.15 Compared to their bulk forms, these 2D-LMs exhibit outstanding optical and mechanical properties, which make them highly favorable for diverse applications. Moreover, this particular family of materials is growing rapidly, with more than 150 materials that can be transformed into 2D monolayers already discovered and explored.16–19 These 2D-LMs mainly include silicene (2D silicone), MXenes (2D nitrides/carbides), germanene (2D germanium), hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), borophene (2D boron), and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as WS2, WSe2, and MoS2.20–24
2D-LMs having large length (1–10000 μm) to thickness (<1 nm) ratio show highly crystalline nature. The layered structure of 2D-LMs having strong covalent bonding (intralayer) and weak van der Waals interaction (interlayer) allows brilliant electronic properties. Moreover, this layered structure permits more conductivity (3–4 times magnitude) along the layers rather than in between the layers.25–27 Extensive research work has been conducted in the exploration of such 2D materials ever since the discovery of GR and its exclusive properties.28 The high transparency, large thermal conductivities, and distinct electronic band structure of GR outshone other classes of 2D materials at that time.29 These exceptional properties provided a significant replacement of the relatively expensive indium tin oxide (ITO), which is a frequently used conductive oxide in solar cell technology, LEDs, and liquid crystal displays.30 One problem, however, that intrigued researchers to look for other 2D-LMs, is the zero bandgap of semimetal graphene, which is not desirable in the SC technology. This resulted in the discovery of new classes of 2D-LMs, especially TMDCs, which possess adequate bad gap values ranging from 1.2 to 1.8 eV that correspond well with the solar spectrum.31 The reduction in the size without compromising the quality, reduced charge carriers scattering due to lesser dandling bonds, and large surface to volume ratio of 2D-based photovoltaic devices are highly appreciable.32,33
Various approaches have been applied worldwide to improve the stability and PCE of per-SCs. These approaches mainly include the use of low-dimensional active layers, which prevents ionic defects formation, reducing the grain boundaries by improving the quality of the active layers, use of doped active layers, and application of protective layers around the active layers.34–36 The use of carbon-based nanomaterials (C-NMs) has attracted the attention of many researchers in the fabrication of long-term stable per-SCs in the past few years. Their inertness toward halides and water-resistant nature make them highly favorable for improved stability in moist conditions.37 Moreover, C-NMs have found a variety of applications in all functional layers and interfaces of per-SCs because of their versatile properties.38 Furthermore, TMDCs such as MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, WSe2, and MoTe2 with exceptional electronic and mechanical properties have shown even better stability and PCE performance in SC technology.39,40 Smaller diffusion lengths and reduced charge recombination rates offered by TMDCs significantly improve the efficiency of per-SCs.
In the present study, we have focused on the application of 2D-LMS (especially carbon and TMDCs based materials) for improving the PCE and stability of per-SCs. An overview of 2D materials is presented in Scheme 1. In the first section, we provide a brief overview of the device structure of a typical per-SC, outline the prevailing challenges in the per-SC technology, and give a brief introduction of 2D layered materials to develop a better understanding. The second section is comprised of carbon and TMDCs-based 2D nanomaterials in per-SCs and how they have been effectively utilized to address several tedious challenges. Various uses of these 2D-LMs such as HTL (hole transport layer), ETL (electron transport layer), AL (active layer), electrodes, and interface modifiers have been briefly discussed.

2. Configuration of per-SCs
A typical solar cell is a device made up of a semiconducting diode without any outer biasing and upon incidence of photons (light), it generates and delivers electricity to the load. The basic structure of a conventional per-SC is demonstrated in Fig. 1. Three most common parameters that are widely adopted to describe the performance of a solar cell are short circuit current (ISC), open circuit voltage (VOC), and fulfil or filling factor (FF). One should have a good knowledge of these key factors beforehand in order to obtain maximum benefit from the contents of this feature review. The term ISC corresponds to the amount of current flowing in the circuit when the voltage drop across the circuit is zero, or in other words, when the terminals of the SC are short circuited. The term VOC refers to the value of externally applied voltage at which there is no net current streaming through the circuit. This is the point where the applied voltage effectively counterbalances the built-in voltage present in the device so there is no net current flowing through the circuit. The term FF is basically the ratio of the maximum power (Pmax) delivered by the SC to the product of ISC and JSC generated in the device. Generally, the FF of a SC is given in terms of the current density as shown in eqn (1). (1)where JMP and VMP correspond to the current density and voltage at which maximum power is generated by the device, respectively.

Another important factor to describe the performance of a typical SC is the PCE, which is the ratio of the total output power generated by the device to the total optical power provided as the input. It is given by eqn (2) (2)where Pin stands for the incident light irradiance and its standard value is 100 mW cm−2 for AM 1.5 spectrum.
In the typical device architecture of a per-SC, the perovskite material is used as an active layer (AL), which is sandwiched between HTL and ETL layers. The overall performance, which mainly includes the efficiency and stability of the device, is highly dependent on the charge transporting materials used.41,42 Both ETLs and HTLs play key roles in achieving the desirable performance of photovoltaic devices. The main role of these materials is to suppress the recombination of photogenic charge carriers and enhance their transportation between the AL and the electrodes.43
The fabrication of suitable and cost-effective materials with good stability and performance to design efficient ETLs and HTLs is paramount in solar cell technology. Researchers are vigorously looking for novel and robust materials with brilliant transport capabilities and 2D materials have recently gained intensive attention due to their exceptional properties. A great deal of research work has been reported in this regard and we believe that a comprehensive review is hence necessary to summarize the progress and development that has been achieved so far and the current prevailing challenges in the field of per-SCs. This review will help the research community, especially young researchers, to have an in-depth knowledge of the current challenges in order to proceed toward more productive and fruitful pathways.
3. Prevailing challenges in per-SCs
As mentioned earlier, apart from the extraordinary development and high PCEs of up to 25.2% achieved by the per-SCs, this technology still faces some crucial challenges that need to be addressed. The biggest challenge, however, is the lower stability of perovskite materials, which makes them highly undesirable for long-term commercial use. While evaluating the stability of perovskite devices, several degradation factors and pathways such as temperature, humidity, halide concentration, and dopant migration need to be properly addressed. The testing of these devices at higher temperature (above 60 °C) and the spontaneous heating of the perovskite films under constant irradiation causes serious degradation and hence poor stability. The thermal instability of the MA cations in the perovskite film is considered to be the main reason for the thermal degradation of these devices. However, recent studies have shown that the conventionally used spiro-OMeTAD HTL plays an important role in the thermal degradation as well. At elevated temperature, spiro-OmeTAD tends to crystallize, resulting in the frequent interaction of metal electrodes with the active layer of the device.45–48 The use of carbon and TMDCs-based electrodes can significantly improve the stability of the devices as they are thermally stable and can withstand higher temperature. Moreover, they do not interact with the active layers even at high temperatures.49–51
In contrast to organic SCs, the stability of per-SCs is highly affected by the moisture, which is a serious issue concerned with this technology. The degradation of per-SCs in the presence of moisture or electrolytes is ascribed to the decomposition of MAPbI3 and other mixed ion active layers into lead iodide and organic iodide. Researchers have found out that these perovskite devices are affected directly by moisture during their assembly and testing procedures.52 The formation of hydrate species has also been reported to be the reason for the degradation of perovskite active layers in the presence of moisture.53 Several encapsulation techniques, such as the fabrication of hydrophobic layers, use of Al2O3 layers, and incorporation of halogens into the active layer have been reported to overcome this challenge.54–56 But all these techniques increase the net cost of the fabricated device and the use of hydrophobic 2D layered materials is an effective alternative approach in this regard. The migration of different HTL dopants such as lithium through the active layer also results in the degradation of the device. Moreover, UV exposure is a crucial deciding factor to determine the stability of the per-SCs as well since it generates chemical changes in the ETL (especially TiO2) when absorbed.57,58 The use of materials with a wider band gap and application of UV filters have yielded good results in terms of long term UV stability but they compromise the recombination rates and cost of the devices.59,60
Apart from the above-mentioned extrinsic factors, ion migration is an intrinsic degradation factor that seriously affects the stability of the per-SCs. The current–voltage hysteresis observed in per-SCs is attributed to ion migration through the active layer.61 Ion migration in perovskite films can lead to both slow (reversible) and fast (hysteresis) degradation of devices. The reversible losses arise due to lattice deformation upon IR heating and can be regained after few hours of dark storage, while the latter losses result from slower cation migration as compared to halides.62,63 The use of carbon-based materials such as PCBM have yielded outstanding results in depleting ion migration and various other 2D materials are being explored to be used as buffer layers as well.
One of the most important aspect in the photovoltaic (PV) technology is the correlation between materials fabrication and their performance in the designed system. Various synthetic approaches that are widely adopted for the fabrication of perovskite films and other transporting layers have a significant influence on their performance. As far as the perovskite-based active layers are concerned, it is very necessary to develop a deep understanding of the crystallization process of perovskite materials. It is extremely crucial for tuning the morphology and structure of these active materials to gain optimum performance out of them. Although the deposition techniques allow complete coverage of the substrate's surface with active material to enhance the PCE of SCs, it is yet insufficient as far as the required standards are concerned. Intensive research has revealed that the maximization of the crystal domain by prolonging the crystal growth time periods via various crystallization strategies is extremely necessary to boost the performance of perovskite active layers.64 Several crystallization techniques such as heterogeneous crystallization, reverse temperature crystallization, and solid–liquid complex formation for solution-based processing of perovskite materials have been reported to achieve better control over the thickness and morphology. However, there is still a lack of an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms underlying these procedures and more robust studies are required for developing authenticity and integrity.65
Recent developments in the one-step solution processing of active materials in per-SCs have revealed that use of various anti-solvents such as isopropyl alcohol, benzene, chlorobenzene, chloroform, toluene, and xylene, which result in faster nucleation to generate micro-sized crystals.66 Furthermore, the use of various lead precursors such as PbCl2, PbI2, and PbAc2 seem to have significant effects on the crystallization phenomenon as well.67–69 However, controlling the one-step processing methods is relatively difficult in contrast to deposition techniques, in case of both planar and mesostructured TiO2 substrates, among others.70 Moreover, the fast crystallization or nucleation of active materials results in poor orientation, which greatly affects the photovoltaic performance. On the other hand, solid–liquid complex formation offers high degree of orientation due to slower crystallization generated from the formation of complex bonds between the solvent and precursors. However, films formed through this method do not exhibit great performance, which is a troublesome issue.71 Although, two-step processing has helped to overcome many challenges, there are still some crucial challenges that need to be addressed. In particular, the issue of Ostwald ripening that generates relatively large crystals on perovskite films is a big issue faced in two-step processing.72
Several vapor deposition techniques are also widely adopted to produce high quality perovskite films and these techniques also generate the possibility of fabricating flexible devices.73 However, there are a few prevailing challenges regarding the varying affinities of perovskite films with different substrates, which hinder the initial formation of the films and there is a need to develop intensive research on the physisorption and adsorption mechanisms of these active layers on different substrate materials in order to generate adequate crystallization. Furthermore, the challenges regarding the reproducibility of these devices are usually ignored and researchers need to focus more on the reproducibility of perovskite-based devices as well. In short, the main challenge regarding the fabrication and performance of materials is the synthesis of high-quality active layers with low temperature adequate crystallization to promote the performance and cost durability of the per-SCs.
These are some crucial limiting factors in the field of per-SC technology. Researchers have been looking for various robust methods to overcome these challenges; hence, 2D materials are being extensively explored in this regard. The unique optical and morphological features of these 2D-LMS along with the availability of a wide range of synthetic procedures make them potential candidates to improve the stability as well as the efficiency of the per-SCs. In the following sections, we have discussed in detail how 2D-LMS have been utilized in per-SCs to overcome the above-mentioned challenges. Furthermore, the emerging class of 2D-LMS, i.e., TMDCs have been discussed in detail since they offer many dominating advantages over carbon-based LMs as well.
4. A brief introduction of 2D-LMS
In the early 1900s, 2D materials and their existence has been the centre of discussion in the research community. As far as classical physicists are concerned, they strictly believe in the thermodynamical instability of 2D materials at any temperature value, which is due to the thermal fluctuations present in their lattices.74,75 This statement was greatly proved by the observation that upon reducing the thickness of 2D layered materials, the melting temperature significantly decreased. However, the lateral advancement in the spectroscopic techniques helped in the discovery of 3D materials having a layered structure, which initially included graphite and molybdenum disulphide (MoS2), followed by many others. However, at that time, exfoliating these bulk materials into their corresponding 2D monolayered structures seemed to be possible in the theoretical domain only.76 The Nobel prize winning discovery of Novoselov and Geim to isolate monolayers of GR from its bulk structure (graphite) brought about revolutionary changes in the field of material sciences in 2004.77 Further developments in various exfoliation methods have led to the successful isolation of almost every layered bulk material into monolayered structures.78 A huge variety of compounds including halides, hydroxides, chalcogenides, clays, carbides, layered oxides, hydrides, nitrides, phosphonates, and phosphates are known to have layered structures. A majority of the abovementioned materials possess binary layered structures; however, ternary layered structures such as CuSbS2 have also been manufactured.79 Based on the nature of interaction such as hydrogen bonding, London dispersion forces, or interstitial cationic interaction among the layers, these layered materials are further categorized.
Ever since their successful exfoliation, 2D layered materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), silicene, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), back phosphorous (BP), MXenes, and GR and its derivatives have gained great enthusiasm and attention from the research community. Owing to their intriguing and novel properties (mechanical, optical, and electronic) and their potential new applications, they have received considerable attention from researchers of numerous fields including nanotechnology, chemistry, material sciences, and condensed matter physics. For instance, the confinement of electrons in two dimensions has imparted fascinating electronic features to these 2D layered materials, boosting their potential for dynamic application in the field of electronics. In addition, the large surface area of these compounds offers greatly improved applications regarding surface activeness such as sensing and catalysis. Moreover, large anisotropy and the extremely small thickness of the 2D materials impart great optical and mechanical properties for the fabrication of efficient wearable and opto-electronic systems. Furthermore, they offer easy assembling to form various heterostructures with no processing compatibility and lattice matching limitations, which benefit a great number of applications involving synergistic effects.
Although great developments have been made in the domain of 2D layered materials, however, there are still some prevailing challenges that need to be addressed properly. The high quality production at a large scale with efficient control over the structure is yet to be achieved for successful commercialization. Moreover, efforts need to be made in order to correlate their structural features with the corresponding properties by developing defined control over their thickness, defects, doping, compositions, surface properties, vacancies, strains, crystal phases, and lateral sizes. Besides, several other non-layered 2D materials such as 2D perovskites and metal nanomaterials seem to possess fascinating properties, which need to be explored as well. Several informative reviews are available on the synthesis and properties of 2D materials, which provide great insights for the research community to further explore these materials. For instance, Cheng et al. have presented a detailed review on the recent developments and challenges regarding the chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-based synthesis of various 2D materials. Different types of CVD grown 2D materials including single crystal, continuous, and 2D heterostructures along with their potential applications were briefly reviewed.80 Li et al. reported a comprehensive review on the growth mechanisms involved in the CVD fabrication of TMDCs and elaborated the ability to generate high-quality TMDCs films with controlled thickness and brilliant electronic properties.81 Cheon et al. have briefly discussed the solution-based synthesis of 2D layered TMDCs and highlighted several advantages such as easy solution processing, cost effectiveness, molecular level control over composition/size, and scalability.82 Feng et al. gave insights into the interface-assisted fabrication processes for the production of organic and inorganic 2D layered materials and summarized the numerous advantages of these synthetic approaches along with suitable characterization tools for a better understanding of 2D materials.83 Similarly, several feature reviews based on recent advances and challenges in the field of 2D layered materials including organic, inorganic, non-layered, metal 2D nanomaterials, and their applications in electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and electronics, among others, are available.84–87
5. Carbon-based 2D-LMS
Carbon-based nanomaterials (C-NMs) depict different chemical and physical properties based on various structures.88 Generally, C-NMs are divided into four categories depending on their application in per-SCs, which include carbon nanotubes, fullerenes and their derivatives, GR and its derivatives, and graphite/carbon black.89 Since this study deals with the study and application of 2D-LMS only, we will only discuss the role of GR and its derivatives in per-SCs.
5.1. Graphene and its derivatives in per-SCs
Graphene is a sheet comprised of sp2 hybridized carbon (C) atoms packed into 2D honeycomb crystallites. With some modifications, it can be enfolded into (0D) structured fullerenes, rolled up to obtain (1D) carbon nanotubes, and stacked to form (3D) graphite.90 To date, different approaches such as metal-doped cathode layers, perovskite layers (surface modified), electrode modification, plasmonic NPs, and unprecedented introduction of GR-based composite within the device layers have been carried out to improve the performance and stability of the per-SCs.91 Much consideration has been given to graphene-based per-SCs as they offer low cost production, greater chemical stability, and impressive device designs.92 GR and its derivatives have been used in several per-SCs with different roles due to their impressive properties as electrode, ETL, and HTL.

5.1.1. As HTL. 
GR has been used in per-SCs as HTL because of its impressive photovoltaic performance. GR plays an important role in per-SCs stability, particularly in the device structure and because of its hydrophobic properties, thermal stability, and resistance against ion migration.89 Comparatively, because of better alignment with the valence band (5.4 to 6 eV) of the MAPbI3 active layer (AL), graphene oxide (GO)-based materials are most appropriate for per-SCs as HTL than graphene. GR can be easily processed by solution-based cost effective method.46,93 Normally, the work function of GO is 4.9 eV, which is greater than that of pristine GR (4.5 eV). Greater work function will create ohmic current, increasing the VOC while higher conductivity will result in greater FF owing to enhanced charge collection.94
It is a great challenge to have conductivity and higher work function for GO. This material consists of numerous functional oxygen groups, which results in high work function but more oxygen causes poor conductivity, which is a limiting factor for hole transfer. Thus, for improved activity, the conductivity and work function of GO must be carefully balanced.95 Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) has been utilized as a promising agent for overcoming this disadvantage.96 Owing to their excellent electrical features, GR derivatives, especially RGO, can be applied as a sole HTL in photovoltaic devices with the need of any doping. Facile solution processing routes have thus been utilized to employ RGO HTLs in inverted per-SCs to achieve high stabilities and comparable efficiencies in contrast to other traditional HTLs.97,98 However, the sole utilization of RGO HTLs to achieve higher efficiencies in per-SCs has been seldom reported since the full covering of the perovskite layer with polar solvents-processed RGO films is much difficult without damaging their structure. Few efforts have been made to successfully utilize sole RGO films in inverted per-SCs in the past. For instance, Carlo and colleagues applied an IPA-processed sole RGO film in a perovskite device via spray- and spin-coating routes. However, the fabricated device employing IPA-processed RGO HTL exhibited a poor efficiency of only 6%. The poor performance was attributed to the damage of the perovskite layer caused by the polar solvent IPA.99
To overcome this crucial problem, there is a need to develop non-polar solvents for sole RGO processing. But the presence of several oxygen containing groups on the edges and surface makes it very difficult to process RGO in non-polar solvents due to poor dispersibility. This results in the generation of relatively thicker HTL layers over the perovskite, which limits the performance of the device. Hence, the use of an additional HTL such as spiro-OMeTAD or compositing with other hole transport materials becomes mandatory for the realization of efficient inverted per-SCs employing RGO HTLs.100,101 The successful processing of RGO in non-polar solvents can significantly help in avoiding the use of additional HTLs or doping/compositing methodologies. Very recently, Park et al. reported a solution for the poor dispersibility of RGO in non-polar solvents. They reported an alkylated RGO (AF-RGO) film demonstrating great dispersibility in non-polar solvents such as chlorobenzene (CB) at high concentrations (Fig. 2a–c). The perovskite layer was completely covered by the AF-RGO HTL with no damage inflicted to the AL and a high efficiency of 17% was achieved. The sole RGO HTL exhibited minimum series resistance, great hole transport, and suppressed charge recombination in the fabricated device. Moreover, the device demonstrated greater ambient stability in contrast to the reference device (employing spiro-OMeTAD HTL) with a decrease of only 11% of the initial efficiency after 240 h.102

Chu et al. have reported a solution-processed P3HT/GR nanocomposite as a modified HTL, which exhibited great compatibility with paintable carbon-based electrodes in per-SC. The two-fold increased hole mobility of the order of 1.2 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved upon the incorporation of GR in the P3HT layers in contrast to bare P3HT. The tortuous charge transfer channels offered by the polymer film of pure P3HT result in great resistance losses and insufficient hole transfer. The addition of GR in the HTL formed well-ordered transport channels for the efficient transport of holes, as shown in Fig. 2d. The device demonstrated a high PCE of 18.1% with excellent stability by retaining 89% of its initial output after 600 h of irradiation.103 The doping of GR was reported to improve the hole extraction abilities in traditionally used PEDOT:PSS HTL. The homogeneous layer of GR HTL obtained via spin coating resulted in a significant increase in the charge mobilities without compromising the optical transmittance of the material. Furthermore, the HTL also improved the stability and crystallinity of the perovskite layer grown on it.105 The use of traditional HTLs such as PEDOT:PSS results in significant open circuit voltage losses, which is a crucial challenge in the field of per-SCs. Researchers are looking for alternate organic or inorganic materials to overcome this prevailing issue. In this regard, Xie et al. reported a perovskite device employing RGO-doped molybdenum oxide (MoOx) layers as the hole transfer material. The highly conducting MoOx:RGO HTL greatly reduced the VOC losses and improved the crystallinity of the active layer as well. The doping of RGO enhanced the work function of the MoOx layers and improved their hole mobilities significantly. A high VOC of 1.12 V with a PCE of 18.15% was achieved, which was due to the enhanced work functions of the layers upon RGO doping. Authors also stated that the contact angle of the MoOx films was effectively increased upon RGO incorporation (Fig. 2e), which offer lesser nucleation sites to promote better film growth of the perovskite.104
Habib et al. studied the effects of various doping concentrations of the PANI:GO nanocomposites on the hole transfer properties of the HTL in inverted per-SCs. Based on the Hall effect evaluations, the lowest film resistance of 6.7 × 102 Ω cm−2 was shown by the 1:0.5 doping concentrations of the PANI:GO composites. A further increase or decrease in the GO concentration resulted in an increase in the series resistance and poor hole extraction performance.106 Zhou et al. used a MOF-derived 2D porous carbon material enriched with nitrogen (NPC) as an additive for Li-TIFL-doped spiro-OMeTAD HTLs. The addition of NPC effectively optimized the layer quality and hole transport by reducing the number of defects and prohibiting the formation of Li salts in the HTL. Furthermore, the hydrophobicity and porosity of NPC increased the stability of the device by preventing the erosion of HTL due to moisture. An excellent PCE of 18.12% along with 85% retention of the initial output after 720 h of air exposure was demonstrated by the prepared device.107
Similarly, Palma et al. utilized reduced GO in mesoscopic per-SCs as a hole transport surface and experienced an enhancement in the lifetime of the device (1987 h), while spiro-OMeTAD-based devices exhibited decreased efficiency of about one order magnitude.108 Similarly, Wu et al. and Li et al. utilized GO as a replacement of PEDOT:PSS (having poor stability and inefficient electron blocking potential) in HTL with the enhanced crystallization of AL in the p–i–n heterojunction and better surface coverage.109,110 A further enhancement in the performance of the per-SCs was gained using solution-based fluorinated reduced graphene oxide as the HTL. Using this process, Yeo et al. obtained PCE up to 10.0% for the fabricated device. The molecularly doped RGO promoted AL crystallization and exhibited a rapid charge extraction ability. It is quite interesting that per-SCs were fabricated at the polyethylene napphthalate (PEN)/ITO substrate, which showed 8.1% PCE.111


5.1.2. As an electrode. 
To optimize the functioning, GR has been used as an electrode (cathode and anode) in several per-SCs, such as semitransparent per-SCs. You et al. fabricated a GR layer by CVD on CU foil and then coated it by a poly(methyl methacrylate) layer and a thin layer of poly(dimethylsiloxane) was used as the supporting layer.112 For enhancing the functioning of GR as the electrode, Liu et al. inserted the thin PEDOT:PSS layer on the surface of GR to act as an adhesive film for the perovskite film. This resulted in not only reduced film resistance but also induced p-type dopant in the GR electrode. The obtained device with a double layer of graphene exhibited 11.65% as compared to pristine GR and 12.02% from fluorine-doped tin oxide.113 However, the hydrophobic nature of GR causes a lot of challenges because of the wettability for its application in per-SCs as an electrode.114 Although the synthesis of GR via the CVD method gives superior-quality films, GO reduction is still a much cheaper synthetic technique. Yan with his team implemented single and multi-layered GR obtained from the reduction of GO as the hole electrode (hole extraction) in per-SCs. In case of hole extraction, multi layered (5.0 eV work function) GR worked better than single layered (4.8 eV work function) GR because of the as-formed Schottky barrier. Multi layered GR and AL interface accumulated as the Schottky junction with rectifying characteristics, which supported electron rejection and hole extraction effectively, while the interface of single layered GR with AL showed ohmic behavior.115
One special property of GR as the electrode is possible through chemical functionalization. For example, Shin et al. employed 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES)-treated GR as a transparent electrode to enhance the combination with ETL of graphene quantum dots (QDS)-doped phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester for flexible per-SCs. With the increase in the GR QDs concentration to 2.5 mg L−1, the PCE increased up to 16.4 and 15% on a rigid and flexible substrate, respectively, with GR/APTES TCE because of reduced recombination of the charge carriers at the ETL/perovskite interface and improved ETL conductivity. The per-SCs exhibited impressive bending stability maintained approximately 80% of the original PCE after 3000 bending cycles.116 It was found that nitrogen doping can further enhance the performance of the devices. Hui et al. developed nitrogen-doped GR QDs for achieving photoluminescence quantum yield to effectively convert UV light to visible photons for the sake of improving the per-SC efficiency. When it is inserted in γ-CsPbI3 per-SCs, it acts as an energy down shift layer for harvesting light in the short wavelength range (<350 nm). As a result, the PCE of the prepared device improved up to 16.02% as compared to the device having no nitrogen-doped GR QDs15.03%.117
The high transparency and two-dimensional morphology make GR an attractive candidate as a transparent electrode. Jeon et al. used GR as a transparent carbon electrode and compared its performance with CNT and ITO-based bottom electrodes. The PCEs reported were 14.2% and 12.8% for GR- and CNT-based per-SCs, respectively. Therefore, advanced methods for the preparation of GR would increase the capacity of the GR-based per-SCs.118 To enhance the mobility, AuCl3 was employed as a p-type dopant for transparent GR electrode (TCE) and 17.4–17.9% PCEs was achieved under one sun condition.119 Yoon et al. utilized GR as the TCE to fabricate a flexible per-SC (having the structure PEDOT:PSS/GR–Mo/PEN) and determined its stability against repeated bending. Under strain free condition, the device having conductive GR electrode showed 16.8% PCE, which actually retained approximately 90% of its initial value after it was bent 1000 times (R = 2 mm) (Fig. 3). However, the reference device significantly failed with PCE reduced from 17.3 to 4.3%, which was ascribed to the fracture produced in the ITO layer.120

Solution-based conductive transparent GR films have also been firstly tried by Munkhbayar et al. as an alternative to the TCO electrode at the electron collecting layers on the per-SCs. By optimizing and investigating the tradeoff between the sheet resistance and the transparency of the GR films, a PCE of 0.62% was obtained. This further increased to 0.81% by incorporating GR into the compact and mesoporous layers of TiO2.121


5.1.3. As an ETL. 
The stability and performance of the per-SCs depend upon the type of ETL used.122 ETL plays an important role in the performance of the per-SCs as it facilitates the withdrawal of photogenic excitons from the ETL and transfer them to the attached electrodes. Due to the resistance to chemical degradation and superhydrophobic properties, GR is attractive for improving the stability of per-SC. The GR insertion in ETL of several per-SCs has been reported to facilitate electron transfer. Yang et al. fabricated a perovskite solar cell with GR-doped TiO2 employed as an ETL. The optimized transport ability here is attributed to the enhanced electronic mobility produced from the addition of GR. Graphene incorporation in the TiO2 layer efficiently developed its mobility, which was confirmed via the Hall effect measurements.123 Gi-Hwan et al. fabricated a per-SC having edge-selectively fluorine-functionalized GR nanoplatelets having the p–i–n structure and achieved 82% stability with respect to the initial performance over almost 30 days of exposure (air) without any encapsulation.124
Besides, GR-based materials have been employed as additives to reduce the required annealing temperature of present inorganic ETLs, which is critical for applications on the flexible substrate of plastic and multi-junction architectures.125 Wang et al. fabricated low-temperature per-SCs by developing mesostructured per-SCs with ETL consisting of anatase-TiO2 NPs and GR nanoflakes. These GR nanoflakes provided superior charge density to the nanocomposites and enabled low temperature (150 °C) fabrication of the device as well. The lower temperature reduces the recombination losses and series resistance of the system. The device shows up to 15.6% PCE with 21.9 mA cm−2JSC, 73% FF, and 1.05 V VOC. Different per-SCs based only on the GR, TiO2 at high temperature, and only TiO2 exhibited 5.9%, 14.1%, and 10% PCEs, respectively. This study showed that GR-based per-SCs can be fabricated at low temperature to acquire high PCE value.126 Besides, the incorporated GR has the potential to facilitate charge transport and extraction. Han et al. reported RGO-doped TiO2 nanocomposites in processed mesostructured per-SC, which showed enhanced electron transporting property owing to reduced resistance. This device depicted improved charge collection behavior and fastened the diffusion coefficients, which is ascribed to the higher charge mobility of RGO. The amount of RGO added to TiO2-based ETL was optimized and their effect on the electron diffusion, photovoltaic performance, resistivity, and electron diffusion were improved relative to the device having just the TiO2 nanocomposites. RGO-doped TiO2 exhibited an improved PCE of 14.5%.127 Graphene has also been attempted to be doped with another popular ETL, SnO2. For instance, Zhao et al. incorporated nanocrystals of SnO2 in naphthalene diimide-GR for highly planar per-SC as an ETL. The modified SnO2 with highly conductive 2D naphthalene diimide–GR form van der Waals interaction between the surfactant and the perovskite and increase the surface hydrophobicity. This results in 20.2% PCE with improved FF of 82%. This enhanced FF and PCE was ascribed to the addition of SnO2-doped naphthalene diimide–GR, which offered better charge extraction and transport.128
Chen et al. utilized GR/SrTiO3 nanostructures as an ETL because of the superconductivity of GR along with the tuning amount of the starting GR for increasing the photo-harvesting ability of the absorber and decreasing the recombination rates. The device gained a great achievement by exhibiting a PCE of 10% with 18.08 mA cm−2 current density.129 Kyung et al. utilized RGO in the TiO2 mesoporous layer, which enhanced the charge transport and its injection with the layer of TiO2 uplifted the PCE to 19.54%.130
Another approach in modifying the ETL is to introduce a monolayer of GR at the interface of the perovskite absorber and ZnO ETL. The monolayer of GR not only enhanced carrier extraction and photovoltaic properties but also saved the ETL from decomposition at a high temperature, which improved the device stability.131 Mahdi et al. demonstrated enhanced photovoltaic stability and performance by introducing a monolayer of GR at the interface of the perovskite absorber and ZnO ETL. This resulted in a stable electric PCE of 19.81%. Graphene QDs have also been tried as an interlayer between the MAPbI3 layers and mesoporous TiO2 for fast electron extraction. The device boosted the PCE from 10.15 to 98.81% with higher VOC and JSC. The IPCE (incident photon to current conversion efficiency) spectrum represented a higher current efficiency by photons in the presence of GR QDs. According to the absorption measurements, the speed of electron extraction varied from 90–106 ps and 260–307 ps with and without the GR QDs, respectively.132 Agresti et al. also fabricated a per-SC having a lithium-neutralized layer on the TiO2 substrate to improve electron extraction into mesoporous TiO2.133 This caused an improvement in the FF, JSC, and overall PCE due to the incorporation of hydrogen atoms in the GO carboxyl groups, which decreased the GO work function to 4.3 eV from 4.9 eV. This delivered a suitable band alignment between GO and TiO2.110 Graphene is also used as a carrier transport material in several per-SCs applications. Chandrasekhar et al. revealed that a PCE of ZnO-based per-SCs can be enhanced by 47.5% from 7.01% after GR is doped in ZnO ETL. Enhancing the performance up to 48.0% can be ascribed to the formation of a superior perovskite thin film and improved electron transport/extraction using GR dopant (low surface roughness with larger grains).134 It is noted that the hollow-structured 3D GR scaffold can also be used as interface layer absorber layers and electron transfer in per-SCs. Several photovoltaic and characterization test results demonstrated that the RGO scaffold enhanced the carrier transportation and yielded 27% enhancement in the overall performance of the device. A PCE of 17.2% for RGO-based devices has been reported with an FF of 72%, VOC of 1.05 V, and JSC of 22.8 mA cm−2. The perovskite film in contact with a large surface area and light tricking property of the device is the main reason behind the enhanced quantum efficiency, which is ascribed to the GR scaffold.135 A list of carbon and MoS2-based 2D-LMs used in various functional layers of the per-SCs is formulated in Table 1.

5.2. Graphyne and graphdiyne in per-SCs
With the advancement in nanomaterial technologies, some novel derivatives of GR including graphyne (GY), graphdiyne (GDY), graphone, and graphane have been developed recently. GDY is a part of the GY family; first predicted by Haley et al. in 1997 and due to its exciting properties, it is considered a separate derivative of GR.136 It comprises of two linkages of acetylene in every unit cell rather than one linkage, as in GY. The two linkages in GDY double the carbon chains length connecting the hexagonal rings. Consequently, GDY does not share GY's mechanical character. It is a soft material as compared to GY or GR having 120 N m−1 of plane stiffness. The other two are the hydrogenated derivatives of graphene.137 These are promising materials and possess exclusive electronic, mechanical, chemical as well as structural properties for superior performance in applications such as energy, nanocomposites, and nanoelectronics.138 Moreover, the unique characteristics of these astonishing materials have been explored in per-SCs as well, which have been stated below.
Traditionally-used carbon materials have established huge potential in per-SCs owing to their stability and electrical properties. GDY, as an emerging allotropic form of carbon, features homogeneously distributed pores, unique electronic character as compared to traditional carbon materials, and endless design flexibility.139 Owing to these outstanding features, Kuang et al. used it as a dopant material for an ETL made up of PCBM for the per-SCs. The obtained results indicated that the performance of the device was boosted by introducing the derivative of graphene. In the meantime, GDY showed better coverage on the layer of the perovskite, which exhibited better interfacial contact, low recombination of charges, and fast electron mobility. As a result, a PCE of 14.4% and a stable power output was achieved with a small hysteresis.140 To increase the efficiency and stability of per-SCs, Li et al. successfully fabricated dual doping GDY in both zinc oxide (ZnO) and PCBM films. This scheme efficiently improved the films’ morphology and increased the electrical conductivity. It also passivated the trap sites at the interface, which reduced charge recombination and a PCE of 20.0% was achieved in MAPbI3 per-SCs.141 To further extend the performance and suppress the hysteresis, Li et al. employed chlorine-substituted GDY–PCBM as an ETL. The experimental study revealed a strong connection between chlorine-substituted GDY and PCBM and exhibited accelerated electron transfer and condensed charge recombination, which led to repressed J–V hysteresis. These results were supported by the DFT calculations that provided further the evidence of derivative GDY formation. This study also offered new perspectives and implications for novel molecular design and achieved 20.34% PCE.142 Recently, Yao et al. engineered a novel structure by incorporating GDY in an oxidized form into the SnO2 ETL. Due to its unique structural properties, GDY chemically bonded with uncoordinated Sn, which reduced the oxygen vacancies in SnO2 and ultimately improved the transportation of electrons as well as reduced the non-radiative recombination. The work function of graphdiyne oxide-doped SnO2 films matched efficiently with the perovskite conduction band (CB) and resulted in greater open circuit voltage. The prepared device established 21.23% PCE with a VOC of 1.13 V, FF of 76.9%, and JSC of 24.5 mA cm−2. Moreover, the encapsulated device upheld an initial efficiency of about 84% for 24 days at 80 °C and 71% of PCE for 160 h after constant illumination.143
Optimizing the interface properties of per-SCs by engineering with 2D material offers a direction for developing competent and stable per-SCs. In this regard, graphdiyne presents huge potential for practical applications. GDY, when utilized as a surface modifier, can effectively stimulate the optical and electronic properties of the per-SCs. To discover such features for higher light-to-electricity conversion efficiency, multiple investigations have been done to modify the interfacial interactions and electronic properties of the devices. In this regard, Xiao et al. introduced this novel derivative of graphene as a dopant to P3HT HTL for the first time. A strong π–π stacking interaction occurred between the GDY particles and P3HT, which is favorable for the transportation of holes. Furthermore, the scattering nature of some GDY aggregates helped to improve the light absorption range of the active layer and 14.6% light-to-electricity conversion efficiency was attained, which was superior to that of pure P3HT-based devices.144 The doping of GDY in MAPbI3 per-SCs was also reported by Li and colleagues as a hole-transport material. This work improved the surface wettability and morphology with uniform coverage and suppressed grain boundaries. Instantaneously, it amplified the hole-extraction and minimized charge recombination as well as enhanced the performance of the device. Therefore, a PCE of 19.5% was achieved based on increased short-circuit current and FF.145 To understand the abovementioned features, a computational study has been reported by Guo et al. where they examined atomic scale mechanisms and underlying properties of GDY/MAPbI3 interfaces. The heterostructure was designed on the basis of van der Waals interaction and the intrinsic electronic character of GDY and perovskite were found to be well preserved within the interface. These results supported the experimental studies and offered new insights toward the development of novel approaches for increasing the performance of per-SCs.146 Later, Zhang et al. used GDY as a hole transport modifier in the layer of perovskite for planar per-SCs. It was implanted on to the upper part of the layer of the perovskite utilizing GDY-containing chlorobenzene as an anti-solvent. Surprisingly, GDY served as the hole collector and transport tunnel, thereby promoting the separation as well as diffusion of electrons and holes inside the perovskite. Consequently, compared with individual planar per-SCs, the prepared device exhibited improved JSC and PCE, and the charge recombination and dark current were efficiently retarded.147
Apart from being used as an interface modifier or a dopant material for ETLs and HTLs, GDY has also been incorporated in the perovskite layers to enhance the light harvesting and stability of these devices. For instance, Li et al. incorporated GDY into the FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskite films to form planar per-SC. Due to the significant support of GDY, photogenerated charge extraction and mobility greatly increased, which improved the JSC and FF. The most important finding was the anti-moisture stability of the device, which could retain 95% of its initial performance after 140 days under ambient conditions.148 To cope with the issues of hysteresis and non-radiative recombination, Chen et al. introduced triazine–GDY (N rich material) into the active layer of per-SC. The presence of triazine–GDY modified the grain boundaries and promoted charge extraction and transportation. It also reduced non-radiative recombination in the active layer, which thus suffered a very low amount of hysteresis and yielded 20.33% PCE. Moreover, when triazine–GDY was used in the FAPbI3 system, it yielded a PCE of 21.16%.149 After that, Bi et al. studied a model of van der Waals heterojunction formed by the GDY and MAPbI3 perovskite films to increase the photocurrent response near the infrared region (NIR). To develop a better insight, first principles calculations were used to check the electronic properties of the GDY/perovskite heterojunctions. The results revealed that the transfer of charge between the perovskite and GDY lead toward a built-in electric field, which facilitated photogenerated charge separation and transport.150 Recently, Huang et al. utilized fluorinated and nitrogen-doped GDY (F:N/GDY) in the active layer of per-SC. The incorporation of heteroatoms turned out to be an efficient way for high performance per-SC, which increased 32.8% to 33%, better than the GDY-doped per-SCs. The doped GDY improved the surface and bulk crystallinity as well as reduced the surface defects. The amplified efficiency caused by F-GDY was ascribed to the improvement of FF, while JSC played a more significant role in N-GDY doping.151
6. TMDCs in per-SCs
Owing to the ambipolar nature, TMDCs have been utilized in various functional parts of per-SCs, especially in ETL and HTL. We can control the p and n type nature of the fabricated 2D materials and TMDCs by adopting suitable growth procedures. However, the ambipolar nature usually diminishes due to chalcogen vacancies, gas absorption, and oxidation. Several methods including surface charge transfer are adopted to induce ambipolar charge transfer in these materials. The methodology and mechanisms involved in ambipolar charge transfer in these 2D materials is beyond the scope of this article. In this section, we have discussed the various applications of TMDCs in per-SC technology briefly. Due to exceptional mechanical, electronic, and optical properties, they find many applications (especially opto-electronic) in photovoltaic devices.152 Moreover, they provide better advantages of improved thermal and moisture stability owing to the unique structural and electronic properties in contrast to carbon-based LMS.
6.1. MoS2 in per-SCs
Among TMDCs, MoS2 has been explored most extensively for various applications. The photo-absorption by MoS2 is in the visible and infra-red (IR) region, having an absorption coefficient of 105–106 cm−1 with tunable bandgap. Moreover, the reduction in the thickness of MoS2 from the bulk to few layers causes a shift in the indirect band gap (bulk) to direct band gap (exfoliated). Light–matter interaction in MoS2 is robust and manifests intense photoluminescence caused by the quantum confinement effect. All these mentioned features enable its utilization in photovoltaics as a buffer layer (BL), hole transport layer (HTL), as an interfacial layer, and also as an electron transport layer (ETL).153

6.1.1. MoS2 in ETL. 
To date, many ETLs have been fabricated, comprising metal oxides and its composites to establish better PCEs for per-SCs.154–159 Researchers have mainly focused on transition metal oxides such as zinc sulfate (ZnSO4), titanium dioxide (TiO2), tungsten trioxide (WO3), zinc oxide (ZnO), and tin dioxide (SnO2). TiO2 has proved to be an efficient ETL in planar per-SCs and outperformed PCEs over 15%.160,161 Although the rate of transfer of the electron from the active layer to TiO2 is rapid, it has certain limitations such as poor stability as well as high density of the trap sites, which results in the recombination of charges at the interface of TiO2/perovskite.162 Another downside of TiO2 ETL is high temperature sintering ∼400–500 °C required to synthesize the anatase phase, which is electrically conducting, thus restricting its usage in flexible electronics.163 According to several reports, SnO2 prepared at a low temperature of ∼180–200 °C164 and ZnO prepared by spin coating at low temperature annealing at ∼120–150 °C165,166 have been used as ETL in per-SCs and the PCEs achieved are in the range of 12–15%. Severe decomposition occurs on the films of the perovskite loaded on ZnO due to acetate ligand on the surface of the metal oxide or hydroxyl groups.167 Although SnO2 exhibits better stability regarding the environment, the major concerns about its utilization as ETL are, (i) it degrades at high temperatures and (ii) voltage loss due to its lower conduction band as compared to the perovskite.168 Some other organic composites have been employed as ETL (at a temperature of ≤100 °C) such as PCBM:C60:PCF169 and PEI:PCBM170 and revealed PCEs in the range of 17–19%. Nevertheless, the solubility of the lower ETL layers causes an issue in the fabrication of the per-SCs processes. Hence, in the ongoing drive to explore more efficient and stable ETLs for per-SCs, TMDCs thin layers, especially MoS2, have attained much interest. MoS2 thin film has multiple benefits as a transport layer due to its high flexibility and enables quick charge transportation in the vertical direction. In addition, it has fewer traps due to the absence of dangling bonds on the surface of layer as well as inert (chemically) with high mobility of electron. By adjusting the chemical composition, number of layers, elemental doping, and surface states, the MoS2 work function can be varied depending on the fabrication approach.171,172 Therefore, it can prove to be a potential candidate for ETL if its work function is comparably lower than TiO2 and SnO2.
Currently, the preparation of the transport layer by MoS2 has been attained by printing MoS2 inks or transferring a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown MoS2 film on the per-SCs electrode.171–175 Such deposited layers are thick enough in size and the vertical transport of the charges is very slow. The charge transportation on to the per-SCs electrode is not swift and not practical for large scale applications. The abovementioned approaches face the problem of weak adhesion with the electrode of per-SC. To resolve these fabrication issues of the MoS2 thin film, synthesis should be engineered at low temperature over a vast area without thermal annealing at high temperature. In addition, the fabrication should be brought about directly on the electrode of the per-SCs to get rid of the transfer process. In 2019, Singh et al. reported the use of the MoS2 thin film as the ETL in per-SCs for the first time (to the best of our knowledge), in which the uniform MoS2 thin film was deposited directly on the glass/FTO substrate at low temperature by microwave-assisted fabrication in the solution phase, as shown in Fig. 4a. This type of ETL set up a thermally stable interface without any annealing treatment with the perovskite. The MoS2 film appeared as a highly transparent and conducted electrically in the vertical direction, having a current density of ∼21.7 mA cm−2 and PCE of 13.14%. The performance was efficient enough as compared to the per-SCs synthesized by SnO2 and TiO2 as the ETL. According to their results, the thin film of MoS2 exhibits finer conductivity and healthy charge transportation at the interface of the perovskite/MoS2 layers.176 A comparison of various parameters between MoS2 (ETL)-based per-SCs and other commonly used ETLs is given in Table 2.

The abovementioned thin layers of MoS2 are inapplicable for the vast scale production of per-SC due to their complicated preparation technique and slower charge transfer in the vertical direction. Also, the acquired PCE of 13% was not so good but comparable to that of other ETL performances reported in the recent years. Thus, to avoid intricate challenges regarding the formation of efficient films, there was a need to develop nanosheets of 2D MoS2 at a low temperature to assist charge transportation efficiently in the vertical direction. These 2-D nanosheets having unique structures facilitate rapid transportation of charges and majorly carry few single nanosheets.177
Mahmood et al. in 2020 tried to overcome these difficulties by employing nanosheets of MoS2 thin films as ETL in the per-SCs. Nanosheets were generated by the hydrothermal process at low temperature, followed by the deposition of nanosheet layers through the electrospray process directly onto the FTO substrate. For comparison, nanosheets grown by the hydrothermal process were also generated over FTO by the spin-coating method. As compared to the spin coating method, the electrospraying technique formed the nanosheets layer-by-layer with better surface coverage. The PCE of the nanosheets deposited by electrospraying was 16%, which was higher than that of spin-coated nanosheets (13.93%) due to the uniform coverage of the surface by the MoS2 nanosheets and larger contact with the perovskite layer for quick vertical charge extraction.178 The following device fabricated with the structure of glass/FTO/MoS2 nanosheets (ETL)/perovskite absorber layer/HTL/Au revealed a PCE of 16.09% (average), which is higher than that previously reported by Singh et al. Various factors were involved in the improvement of the device performance such as better morphology, quick charge extraction at the interface of the MoS2/perovskite layer, and good electrical conductance (Table 3).

Another work was reported in 2020 by Malek et al. for the fabrication of ETL by an ultra-thin MoS2 nanosheet. They adopted low-cost ultrasonic spray pyrolysis method to fabricate the MoS2 ETL as compared to the conventionally used methods such as liquid phase deposition, CVD, and solvo-thermal method. By this method, nanosheets were prepared with precise control through simple modification on at a temperature of <250 °C. MoS2 was deposited on ITO substrate as ETL for triple cation Cs0.05[MA0.13–FA0.87]0.95Pb(I0.87Br0.13)3 perovskite absorber. The efficiency generated by this device was 3.36% with fill factor (FF) of 0.370, current density (JSC) of 16.24 mA cm−2, and voltage open circuit (VOC) of 0.56 V. These results are not as impressive as those reported previously due to the unfortunate generation of by product impurities.180 The performance can be enhanced by preparing high quality nanosheets of MoS2. Apart from its application as a ETL in the pristine form, MoS2 composites have also been utilized in SC technology. However, only limited work has been reported on MoS2 composites as ETL in per-SCs. Huang et al. adopted sol–gel synthesis to fabricate MoS2-doped ZnO composites, which was applied as the ETL on the inverted perovskite material in 2018 (Fig. 4b). They effectively varied the band gap value of the prepared composite (4.45–4.42 eV) after varying the doping concentration of MoS2 up to 0.5 wt% in ZnO. They achieved a relative increase of 15% in the PCE of the fabricated PTB7-TH:PCBM device with the help of MOS2-doped ZnO (0.5 wt%) ETL.179
Another composite of MoS2 with TiO2 was employed by Ahmed et al. as an ETL and absorption layer in perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 SC. They achieved an improved efficiency of 4.43% from 3.4% for the fabricated device owing to the reduced series resistance (consequently higher current density) because of the higher mobilities in MoS2-doped ETL.181 In another study, a thin MoS2 layer (2–5 nm) was deposited on PC61BM ETL via thermal evaporation by Wang et al. to fabricate glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/GO:PEGMAPbI3/PCBM:MoS2/Ag inverted device. They explained that the enhancement in the energy matching for HTL and Ag electrode can be improved by the deposition of the MoS2 layer on the ETL for efficient performance. An overall efficiency of 19.14% and large VOC of 1.135 V was attained with the fabricated per-SCs.182


6.1.2. MoS2 in HTL. 
MoS2 has been used as the HTL in per-SCs due to its excellent extraction (of holes) property. Although MoS2 and other TMDCs are highly favorable for photovoltaic applications, owing to their outstanding properties, there are still some challenges in the fabrication of such materials. The frequently used CVD method generates highly crystalline and uniform monolayers with a larger surface area; however, this technique is extremely costly. On the other hand, other techniques such as spray coating, drop casting, and spin coating have proven to be very cost effective but they compromise the quality of the films by inducing the aggregation and restacking defects. Researchers are looking for various cost-effective non-traditional fabrication routes to overcome such limitations. In this regard, Dasgupta et al. in 2017 reported a MoS2 HTL by adopting the centrifugal casting method to form single and few-layered uniform thin films of MoS2 on a large area. The fabricated sheets showed good crystallinity and fewer defects at a relatively lower cost. The established thin film reported in this work efficiently transferred the holes from MAPbI3 to MoS2, which also acted as an electron-blocking layer. The obtained PCE was ∼6% (with five layers of the MoS2 nanosheet), which is significantly lower than that of the conventional inverted per-SCs.183 The characteristic parameters of the prepared device are given in Table 4.

The numbers in the parentheses denote the average value of the respective parameters and their standard deviation. Since there was little variation in VOC, its standard deviation has not been shown.

Similar challenges regarding the cost effectiveness and fabrication of uniform films with a larger surface area were studied by another group. Kohnehpoushi et al. in 2018 studied MoS2 as a potential HTL for the fabrication of more efficient and cost-effective per-SCs (Fig. 5a and b). The key factor studied for high PCE was the thickness of MoS2. The light absorption and photo-generated charge carriers were analyzed by perovskite layer bandgap and its thickness. The optimum thickness limit for per-SCs was reported as 500 nm and further increment caused more recombination due to the defects and grain boundaries of the MoS2/perovskite layer. Moreover, suitable metal back contacts were found to collect the charge carriers from the TiO2 layer such as Cu, Ag, and Al with the work function of −4.8, 4.2–4.7, 4.06–4.24 eV, respectively. The open circuit voltage of 930 mV was obtained due to their work function, which was close to the conduction band of the TiO2 layer. The PCE secured by this device was ∼20.43% utilizing a single sheet of MoS2. The thickness of the perovskite layer and suitable metal back contacts lent unique photovoltaic properties to the designed per-SCs.184

Another challenge that the per-SC technology faces is the stability of the devices. Researchers are desperately looking for transport layers that are much stable in contrast to other traditional layers. TMDCs, being inorganic in nature, can prove to be highly effective in this regard. In 2020, the efforts of Shin et al. resulted in the fabrication of self-powered inverted (p–i–n) bifunctional per-SC with MoS2 employed as the HTL. Using the CVD method, 4–5 layers of MoS2 were deposited on polyethylene terephthalate and the glass substrates. The increase in the current (∼106 times) was observed at 0 V under light irradiation. The fabricated device exhibited a PCE of 13.09% with only 38% degradation in the first 30 days of working. Graphene was doped with Au on the electrode for better charge extraction and the performance of the device was analyzed on the basis of its degradation with time (as it degraded ∼38% after 30 days) along with ∼57% of the original photo-current maintained after 3000 bending cycles.185 The schematic structure and energy level diagram is presented in Fig. 5c and d.
Despite its many overwhelming advantages, MoS2 still suffers from the issue of extremely low solubility in many solvents. This limits the solution-processed fabrication (which is very cost-effective and desirable for large-scale production) of MoS2 layers. To overcome this issue, various physical and chemical blends of MoS2 are being utilized. Dai et al. reported a blend of MoS2 in PEDOT:PSS (a conductive polymer), which was used as the HTL to enhance the performance of per-SC with a PCE of 16.47% in 2017. They proposed a metal–organic compound Phenyl Acetylene Silver (PAS) to increase the solubility of MoS2 in commonly used solvents for cost-effective fabrication. The coordination between the S atoms of MoS2 and the Ag atoms coming from PAS resulted in superior solubility of the prepared blend in many solvents.186 The traditionally used material as HTL in per-SCs is made up of PEDOT–PSS, which suffers from some disadvantages. The shallow work function of PEDOT:PSS (4.9–5.1 eV) results in an imperfect Ohmic contact with the AL of the device. This significantly reduces the VOC of the device due to increased recombination rate of the charge carriers at the HTL/AL interface. Furthermore, the acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS is also a big concern since it poses the threat of corrosion to the ITO layer as well. To overcome such issues, a study was reported by Wang et al. in 2018 where they incorporated a hybrid HTL of MoS2-doped PEDOT:PSS in the inverted (p–i–n) per-SC. A high stability PCE of 18.5% compared to the control device was reported for the glass/ITO-PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3/PCBM/BCP/Ag inverted per-SC. The doping of MoS2 significantly increased the transport of the charge carrier in the HTL due to the high carrier mobility of MoS2, as depicted in Fig. 6. Moreover, 10% decrease in the contact resistance was observed for MoS2-blended PEDOT:PSS HTL, while the recombination resistance was improved up to 50% effectively.187

6.1.3. MoS2 in the buffer layer. 
Apart from its advantageous use as ETL and HTL in per-SCs, MoS2 has also been utilized as a buffer layer (BL) to prevent degradation and improve the stability of the device. Although the work reported on the use of MoS2 as BL in per-SCs is limited, it is very informative and offers more opportunities in this regard for researchers to explore. Due to the lower stability of spiro-OMeTAD HTL, researchers have been exploring other materials as a replacement. But no suitable replacement that can match the ideal positioning of spiro-OMeTAD band edges has been found yet. Another proposed solution to this challenge is the use of protective or buffer layers between the HTL/AL for the improved stability of the device. TMDCs can prove to be ideal candidates for such kind of applications in photovoltaics. To the best of our knowledge, the first use of MoS2 as BL in per-SCs for the long-term stability of the device was reported by Capasso et al. in 2016. They utilized MoS2 nanoflakes in the interface to prevent iodine migration from AL to HTL and the direct interaction of electrode contacts with AL (which prevents recombination losses) in per-SCs. They achieved a device with a PCE of 13.3%, having long term stability of more than 550 hours.203 Liu et al. recently fabricated a stable device with MoS2 BL, showing an efficiency of 18.31%. Due to the suitable configuration of energy levels, the MoS2 sheet acted as a BL at the perovskite and HTL interface, effectively reducing the recombination of excitons by hindering the transmission of electrons. Consequently, they overcame the issue of acidity and hydrophobicity of the PEDOT:PSS (poly-3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene:polystyrene sulfonate)-HTL based per-SCs by fabricating a more stable and efficient device with glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MoS2/CH3NH3PbI3:MoS2/PCBM/Bphen/Ag configuration.204
The schematic illustration and characterization plots of the inverted per-SCs fabricated by Liu et al. are given in Fig. 7 and 8, respectively.

In another study, Liang et al. synthesized 2D nanoflakes of MoS2via liquid-phase exfoliation to be used as BL, spin-coated between the spiro-OMeTAD (HTL) and perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) layer. They exfoliated bulk MoS2 in two different solvents, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and isopropanol (IPA), separately (Fig. 9) and compared the characteristics of both the devices. The improved efficiency of 14.9% with long term stability compared to the reference device was reported.205

6.2. MoSe2 in per-SCS
Another member of the TMDCs family is MoSe2, which is an inorganic compound comprising of molybdenum and selenium, having similar formation as that of MoS2. The 2D-MoSe2 possesses a structure similar to GR and exhibits superior electron mobilities in contrast to the 2D-MoS2 structure. Furthermore, the monolayer structure gives a direct band gap of ∼1.5 eV, which makes it desirable for photovoltaic applications.206 The first study (to the best of our knowledge) on the use of MoSe2-layered structure in per-SCs was reported by Chen et al. in 2016. They fabricated a device with the structure FTO/MoSe2/perovskite/C60/BCP/Ag via magnetron sputtering, where MoSe2 was employed as an HTL for effective hole extraction. Furthermore, they studied the domain size of the perovskite film deposited on the HTL as a function of the annealing temperature for the MoSe2 HTL. An increase in the perovskite film's crystallinity was reported on increasing the annealing temperature for the HTL film. The fabricated device exhibited a PCE of 8.23% with a JSC of 14.45 mA cm−2.207 Chang et al. also utilized MoSe2 as the HTL for per-SC in 2020 and fabricated a device with FTO/MoSe2/AL/PMMA/C60/AZO/Ag structure. They also studied the crystallinity of AL as a function of the annealing temperature for the HTL. A significant improvement from 10.2% to 18.0% was achieved for the optimized device, fabricated via polyethylene glycol solution. A significant increase in the FF (76.12%) and reduced series resistance (17.3 Ω) was reported for the manufactured device, with a 90 nm thin MoSe2 layer, as demonstrated in Fig. 10.208

In February, 2020, Huang et al. gave further insights into the interfacial coupling and band alignments between the monolayer MoSe2 and the perovskite layers of SCs. They utilized CsPbBr3 perovskite and MoSe2 as prototypes for their computational (HSE06 and GGA-PBE) calculations, which revealed type-II intrinsic band alignment between the two layers. They further emphasized on the interfacial deep defects sites between CsPbBr3/MoSe2, which could lead to enhanced PCE of the per-SCs in the future.209 Liang et al. reported the use of 2D-nanoflakes of MoSe2 employed as BL for enhanced stability and better interfacial quality of per-SCs. They employed MoSe2 nanoflakes between HTL (spiro-OMeTAD) and AL (FA85MA15PbI85Br15) and achieved a PCE of 14.9% with significant improvement in the stability as compared to the reference device. The fabricated device maintained 93.1% of its initial PCE after one hour of operation, which was significantly better than the reference device that retained 78.2% of its initial PCE after one hour.205 The traditionally used TiO2 ETL in per-SCs is, although, very effective but not much desirable due to high energy and time consumption in high temperature processing. On the other hand, the low temperature fabrication of such an ETL does not yield much desirable results in terms of the uniformity and crystallinity. Zhou et al. in April 2020 significantly improved the electron mobility of low temperature processed TiO2 (L-TiO2) ETL in per-SC by incorporating MoSe2 QDs in the layer. They adopted a low temperature processing route to fabricate QDs-modified L-TiO2 ETL for an all inorganic per-SC with a FTO/L-TiO2:MoSe2/CsPbBr3/C structure and achieved 10.02% PCE. The enhancement in the electron mobility of the ETL was attributed to the filling of the trap sites in L-TiO2 by the photo-induced electrons coming from MoSe2 QDs (Fig. 11). This significantly increased the charge density in the conduction band of TiO2, hence improving the conductivity of the film.210

6.3. WS2 in per-SCs
Tungsten disulphide (WS2) monolayer with a direct bandgap of ∼2.05 eV shows greater mobilities of the carriers, better conductivity (∼103 Ω−1 cm−1), and n-type semiconducting behavior. Stability, less toxicity, and environmental friendliness make WS2 a potential candidate for per-SCs applications.211 In this section, we have discussed some significant works reported on the application of WS2 in per-SCs. The first use of WS2 in per-SCs (to the best of our knowledge) was reported by Kim et al. in 2016, where they utilized WS2, MoS2, and GO thin layers as replacements for PEDOT:PSS HTL. The CVD approach was adopted to deposit 2D-WS2 layers on ITO and the fabricated glass/ITO/-WS2/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/LiF–Al structure exhibited a PCE of 8.02%. The schematic illustration of the synthetic procedure and the device structure adopted by the group are given in Fig. 12.15

As mentioned in earlier sections, the acidic and hygroscopic nature of PEDOT:PSS HTL makes it highly undesirable in per-SCs because of its reduced stability. Suitable replacements are required in this regard to improve the efficiency and stability of per-SCs. A study was reported by Huang et al. in 2017, where PEDOT:PSS HTL was replaced by the WS2 thin layer in p–i–n per-SCs. They signified the importance of the 1T-phase of 2D-layered TMDCs, which plays a central role in improving the PCE of per-SCs. In addition to that, no post heating procedure was adopted since it causes a significant decrease in the 1T content of TMDCs. The fabricated device exhibited a PCE of 15% while only 12.44% of PCE was shown by the control device with PEDOT:PSS HTL. Furthermore, the stability of the device improved significantly with 72% of the initial PCE retained after 56 days of working. On the other hand, the PCE of reference device dropped to zero after only 35 days of operation.212
Another study was reported by Bayram Kilic in 2018 where WS2 was utilized as the HTL in FTO/TiO2/perovskite/WS2/Ag per-SCs to achieve a PCE of 9.93% with more stability in contrast to the reference device.213 The latest study on the application of WS2 as HTL in per-SCs has been reported by Cao et al. in 2020. The performance of per-SCs is highly dependent on the interfacial as well as perovskite layer properties. These properties are much difficult to control via solution-based processes. They fabricated an inverted planar perovskite on defect-free 2D nanoflakes of WS2 used as a template for epitaxial growth. Furthermore, the cascaded alignment of the energy levels and reduced recombination at the HTL/AL interface was also achieved. This resulted in a device with a PCE of 21.1%, which is among the highest of the PCEs attained by inverted planar per-SCs. This significant work has motivated researchers for the further exploration of 2D-LMS, especially TMDCs, for efficient and stable photovoltaic devices. The device structure and epitaxial growth mechanism are demonstrated in Fig. 13.214

To increase the stability and performance along with low hysteresis losses in per-SC, Sobayel et al. for the first time in 2018, investigated WS2 as an efficient ETL through the SCAPS-1D simulator. This simulation method majorly focused on the amphoteric defects as well as temperature-related issues. The obtained results theoretically showed that WS2 can be exchanged with TiO2 as the ETL in the per-SCs, whereby the amphoteric defects have a great influence on its PCE, which appeared to be 25.7%. This estimation paved the way for TMDCs, more importantly for WS2 as an ETL in per-SC.215 Lead-based per-SCs face the challenges of toxic lead nature as well as lower stability. Researchers have recently diverted their attention on lead-free per-SCs for a sustainable future. Kumar et al. in 2020 projected a unique structure of lead-free per-SC using WS2 as an ETL. The proposed structure was analyzed quantitatively by the simulation of solar cell capacitance. The PCE obtained by these simulations was 23% and offered lead-free per-SC. The thickness of the absorber played an imperative role in optimizing the performance of the device.216 Larger recombination rates at interfaces and electrode contacts also hinder the performance of the per-SCs. Few atoms thick layers of TMDCs can overcome these challenges due to the collective motion of the charge carriers. Another ETL layer was developed with WS2 in the per-SC by the spray pyrolysis method on the ITO substrate by Malek and colleagues. The PCE was 18.21%, which gained quick draining of the photoelectrons, rapid charge transfer at the interfaces, and reduction of both bulk and interfacial recombination. The performance of the device depends on the thickness of the WS2 layer and showed an excellent stability but the obtained efficiency was less than the theoretically estimated value.217
6.4. MoTe2 and WSe2 in per-SCs
Molybdenum telluride, a compound that consists of molybdenum and telluride, is a member of TMDCs family. It can be easily crystallized into 2-D sheets and thinned down to transparent and flexible monolayers. Among all the reported TMDCs, MoTe2 is the least light sensitive and has the potential to be useful in per-SCs. Tungsten diselenide (WSe2) is an inorganic crystalline compound, which adopts a hexagonal structure. WSe2 is a very stable compound and a member of the TMDCs family. As far as the applicability of per-SCs in extended devices or other circuits is concerned, very few publications have yet been reported. Significant attention is required in this area of per-SCs applicability for more comprehensive analysis. In this regard, Jeong et al. integrated a realistic self-powered circuit using photovoltaic cells as well as few nanometer thin MoTe2 field effect transistor (FET). The n-channel few nm thin MoTe2 FET was synthesized to operate the glass substrate at a low voltage and connected to a per-SC on another glass. Two possible operation modes (self-powered current and photosensor) of this approach have been observed. Under visible light illumination, the per-SCs in this circuit play as the role of a voltage source, providing enough current to turn on the light emitting diodes.218 Apart from looking for replacements of PEDOT:PSS, researchers are also searching for the further modification of this HTL by functionalization, which can significantly improve the stability and charge transfer property. Choi et al. implemented WSe2 on PEDOT:PSS for enhancing the performance of per-SCs. WSe2 incorporation in PEDOT:PSS improved charge transport at the electrode interface and the photoactive layer as well as favored the growth of the perovskite crystal (Fig. 14). Consequently, an improvement in the performance of the solar cell having WSe2-mediated PEDOT:PSS has shown a PCE of 16.3%.219

Chalcogen vacancies limit the applications of TMDCs for wide area applications as these vacancies compromise the photoconductive properties. In order to minimize these vacancies, novel techniques are required for the effective performance of per-SCs. Lu et al. reported 2-D photodetector per-SC based on a bilayer structure, which consisted of CH3NH3PbI3 organolead halide structure with the WSe2 monolayer. The high performance of the designed per-SC was achieved by perovskite functionalization and the laser healing of WSe2. After this modification, the output of device was reported to be three times better as compared to the pristine device.220 These have been some significant studies that have been reported (to the best of our knowledge) on carbon- and TMDCs-based 2D-LMs in per-SCs to this date.
The fabrication of 2D-LMs having controlled sub-nanometre thickness from the non-layered structures presents significant challenges. Though the mechanical and physical chemical deposition methods are mostly used for non-layered structures, these techniques have multiple disadvantages in the applications. Recently, liquid-metal-based synthesis have emerged as an effective approach to fabricate 2D-LMs with good thickness control and better quality.221–224 An effective technique to fabricate 2D perovskites is to exchange cations in the perovskite nanocrystals with long-chained alkyl groups. This is done using long organic molecular chains, which hinders the interaction of the layered per-SCs using long organic molecular chains.225 Here, self-assembly between the organic chains and metal halides is compelled by the hydrogen bonding, coordination, and van der Waals forces produced upon mixing. The length of the chains is crucial as it drives the reorganization to form the 2D structures. Liquid metal methods that use organic alkyl ammonia molecules as the long alkyl chain source are mostly used for the synthesis of per-SCs with different morphologies.226 Nanoplatelets and nanosheets of different materials are also used for the fabrication of the 2D per-solar cells due to their low cost and simplicity. The morphology and size of 2D per-SCs can be modified by controlling the mass ratio and surfactant of the organic cations. As compared to the traditional synthesis method, liquid metal synthesis does not apply to damaging or corrosive liquids and there is no need to maintain high pressures, which reduces the cost and simplifies the systematic components. Liquid metal technology possesses great advantages as it is capable of producing 100 nanostructured materials. The results of Al2O3, In2O3, Fe3O4, and ZnO analysis produced by the liquid metal synthesis show wide scope of their application for the fabrication of ceramics, thermal insulation, semiconductor sensors, catalysts, and sorbents.227
In 2015, 2D per-SC nanoplatelets synthesized by a liquid metal synthesis were firstly described by Tisdale and colleagues. The 2D perovskite nanoplatelets were prepared with octylammonium bromide as the long-chain ligand. 2D nanoplatelets of octylammonium bromide with varying thicknesses were attained by the slight modification of the preparation technique.228 In 2019, Wu et al. demonstrated stable and efficient perovskite devices prepared by liquid metal synthesis techniques. They used dimethylformamide as a solvent and liquid-zirconium acetate as the additive. This design shows optimized film quality with lower defect states as compared to the reference device. The PCE of prepared device was reported to be 20.9% with optimum dopant concentration, which maintains 98% of its initial performance even after 1700 minutes testing under a xenon lamp. Overall, this study exhibits efficient passivation of the defects and the effects of crystal growth in the per-SCs.229 Producing liquid metal colloids having tailored dimensions is of great technical significance in the field of nanoelectronics but there is a challenge for the generation of super nanoliquid metals. Yu et al. obtained ternary nanoalloys using laser irradiation in the liquids from a solid target. They studied the role of these super nanometal crystals on mediating the electrons’ perovskite films grain boundaries. The embedding of the supernano liquid metals in the per-SCs films leads to the realization of efficient cesium-based per-SCs, which displays an output of 21.32%.230
A printing procedure for the production of per-SCs shows encouraging application in photovoltaics because of its low cost and eco-friendly fabrication. Zhang et al. used liquid metal (Galinstan) as an interface modifier with the carbon electrode. Based on the high conductivity and fluidity at room temperature, it is noticed that liquid metals are superior for the improvement of hole extraction and are reserved at the interface between carbon and ZrO2 for the enhancement of the contact property. Similarly, the resistance for carrier transmission was decreased at the perovskite interface. As the optimized content, triple mesoscopic per-SCs delivers a PCE of 13.51%, which involves 26% increase as compared to the ones without liquid metals.231 Solution-based metal halide per-SCs have gained huge attraction in solar energy because of the low temperature and high absorption fabrication. Boopathi et al. demonstrated the droplet process of spin coating of lead halide and spray coating of methylammonium iodide for the fabrication of the lead iodide perovskite film. An airbrush gun was used for controlling the volume to attain a uniform, continuous, and stoichiometric perovskite film. The device delivered 11.66% PCE with reproducible JSC, FC, and VOC values.232
Apart from the abovementioned 2D-LMS, 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have also been utilized in various functional layers of per-SCs in the past few years. A detailed discussion upon their effective applications in per-SCs has been summarized in the following section.
7. 2D COFs and MOFs in per-SCs
2D COFs and MOFs have recently acquired great attention due to their outstanding properties such as high surface area, porosity, tuneable electronic properties, excellent thermal stability, structural versatility, and relatively low-cost synthesis.233 These features make them suitable for light harvesting applications. More importantly, both frameworks have been implemented in every functional part of the per-SCs, including HTL, ETL, and active material.
Covalent organic nanosheets (CONs) are highly desirable materials, which have been recently reported by Park et al. as an interlayer in a photovoltaic device for the effective alignment of the energy levels between other components. This work described that different monomers may be used to resolve the challenges in the achievement of some target-HTL opto-electronic properties in the per-SCs. In contrast to prior usages of HTL layers such as PEDOT:PSS, the rough surfaces of CONs were used to crystallize the photoactive layer surface and to transfer the charges toward the electrodes. Moreover, this study contributed to understanding the physical contribution of every per-SC component, which would be vital for shifting the ultimate research endeavors toward commercially practicable technologies.234 Mohamed et al. prepared two types of COFs, bicarbazole coupled with 4,4′,4′′,4′′′-(ethane-1,1,2,2-tetrayl)tetranilino (Car-ETTA) and 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)pyrene (TFPPy-ETTA). Both frameworks unveiled that the greater surface area and higher crystalline nature facilitated the transfer of charge across the associated interface and improved the PCE from 17.4% to 19.8%.235
In per-SCs, MOF materials have been utilized as an additive for ETL, HTL, interlayer, as well as perovskite/MOF hybrids. They are potential candidates to fabricate per-SCs with high thermal stability and efficiency. Recently, 2D MOFs are being directly utilized in various functional parts of per-SCs to enhance their performance. Chang et al. reported that a significant improvement in the crystallinity and morphology of perovskite was attained by the addition of Zr-based 2D porphyrin MOF (MOF-525) as an additive. The porous MOF-525 nanocrystals were introduced at the bottom of the MOF/perovskite composite film, which served as a scaffold to let perovskite crystallization happen inside.236 To increase the electron transfer between the interface of TiO2 and the perovskite, Chung et al. introduced a 2D MOF ZIF-8 layer. It not only quickened the excited electrons but also enhanced the absorption at above ∼350 nm, which significantly increased the PCE from 9.6% to 12.4%.237 Later, Ryu et al. manufactured the nanocrystalline Ti-based MOF (nTi-MOF) to be employed as an efficient ETL in per-SC. The electronic character of nTi-MOF was appropriate for the transfer of electrons produced in the perovskite layer upon irradiation. Thus, the introduction of PCBM into nTi-MOF ETLs enhanced the conductivity of the film and suppressed the direct connection between the substrates and the perovskite (Fig. 15). The durability was retained at about ∼700 bending cycles, revealing a PCE of 15.4%.238 An updated method was adopted by Zhang et al. to increase the electronic extraction and transport by utilizing 2D MOF-derived ZnO as an ETL. As a result, the interface area increased between the MOF-derived ZnO and per-SC, which gave a carrier extraction efficiency of 18.1%.239

The magnified picture shows electron/hole transfer from the perovskite toward interlayers, nTi-MOF/PCBM and spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. Reprinted with permission from American Chemical Society.238 
Another TiO2-based MOF was reported by Zhao et al. for the superior transportation of the electron and showed a PCE of 13.4%.240 Recently, Ji et al. manufactured a champion device using polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) and tellurophene-based 2D MOF with the perovskite to realize the non-destructive passivation of TiO2. After this modification, the crystallinity and morphology of the perovskite film were significantly optimized, the trap sites in the TiO2 layer were condensed, and the transfer of electrons in the device was boosted, thus finally accomplishing efficient and stable MAPbI3 per-SCs with an efficiency of 22.22%.241
To extend the application of MOF, Li et al. incorporated a 2D MOF [In0.5K(3-qlc)Cl1.5(H2O)0.5]2n, (In10) in spiro-OMeTAD. The inclusion of In10 oxidized spiro-OMeTAD into spiro-OMeTAD+ and strengthened the conductivity of HTL, which thus favored the transport of charge as well as suppressed charge recombination. This modified per-SC achieved a PCE of 17%.242 Huang et al. used 2-D lead (Pb)-based MOF and composited it with the spiro-OMeTAD layer. With the haloing effect, the composited film showed upshifted energy levels, smoother surface, and higher hydrophobicity, as compared to the bare spiro-OMeTAD layer. When the composite layer was utilized as the HTL in the per-SC, the cell revealed a higher PCE (13.17%) and moisture-resistant feather.243 Zhou et al. introduced an MOF-derived 2D graphitic N-rich porous carbon (NPC) as an additive for HTL and verified that the incorporation of NPC can efficiently enhance the properties of HTL, supporting the extraction and migration of holes, and passivated recombination. These favorable features exhibited a satisfactory PCE of 18.5%.107 Zhang et al. constructed a bi-functional layer by introducing (Me2NH2)+-encapsulated indium-based anionic 2D MOF (FJU-17) into the hole transport material. The FJU-17 passivated the cation vacancies by discharging the (Me2NH2)+ ion, whereas its anionic framework was able to sustain positively charged oxidized HTM to boost the mobility of the holes. As a result, per-SCs exhibited better performance with a PCE enhancement from 18.32% to 20.34%.244 Almost an equivalent PCE was achieved by Zhou et al., which presented a facile method to improve the efficiency and stability of the per-SCs by introducing perovskite with indium-based 2D MOF [In12O(OH)16(H2O)5(btc)6]n.245 Recently, the role of three different supramolecular compounds of zirconium(IV), indium(III), and zinc(II) with the proton transfer compound in the perovskite solution and their effect on the performance of the device was investigated. The MOF serves as an additive that helps to form a better layer of perovskite and the PCE increased from 2.9% to 5.6% (∼91% improvement) after introducing Zn metal–organic compound as an additive in per-SCs.246
8. Interface chemistry of 2D-LMS
It has been recognized that 2D-LMS offer tuneable heterointerfaces among dissimilar 2D layers, greater exciton mobilities, quick mass transport, efficient excitonic separation, greater surface area, low consumption of power, and efficient tailoring of the properties for potential applications. However, inadequate knowledge of heterointerface chemistry, particularly when unlike atoms are involved, restricts the desirable tuning and utilizing these designs in numerous applications.247,248 Some of the most common heterointerfaces formed by 2D-LMS have been discussed to give a better understanding to young researchers as well.
The van der Waals (vdW) 2D heterostructures are raised by vdW forces such as instantaneous dipole-induced-dipole, dipole-induced-dipole, as well as dipole–dipole interactions because of the interaction between the edge planes.249,250 The vdW 2D heterostructures create high anisotropy between out-of-plane and in-plane directions, and there are no requirements of matching precise processing and lattice compatibility.251–253 Actually, the mismatch of the lattices or difference in the rotating angle of the 2D heterostructures creates Moire’ patterns that provide assistance in tailoring the electronic and structural features of 2D-LMs.254,255 Nonetheless, to fabricate stable 2D vdW heterostructures, the mismatching of the lattice must be less than 5% (without any instability). In addition, large mismatch creates dislocations at the heterointerfaces, which are favorable for ionic movement but at the same time, they can hinder the electronic properties of 2D heterostructures.256
To understand the process of improving or introducing new properties in per-SCs, the comprehensive knowledge of physics behind the heterointerface must be known. For example, the coupling of the interface between two different layers produces band alignment and tailored work function, as proposed by Anderson (heterointerface of semiconductor–semiconductor, S–S) or Schottky–Mott (heterointerface of metal–semiconductor, M–S) rules.257–259 Exploring the heterointerface electronic band structures (S–S and M–S) is very important to discover the changes that take place at the heterointerfaces. The S–S heterointerfaces band alignments are divided into 3 categories: type-I straddling gap (Fig. 16a), type-II staggered gap (Fig. 16b), and type-III broken gap (Fig. 16c).260 In the straddling gap, the VB and CB band of material S2 are present in between the material S1 bands, which leads to the accumulation of h+ and e− and transport toward the VB and CB of material S2.261 The quick recombination of charge carriers in type-I shows the ability of luminous applications (e.g., light-emitting diodes).262 In the staggered gap, the material S1's CB and VB are higher as compared to their corresponding bands. Here, h+ accumulation is toward material S1 and the tendency of transfer of e− is toward material S2.263 In type-II configuration, due to different work functions, the modulation of transition energy and the charge separation at the heterointerface permit extended time for interlayer optical excitons, making it an excellent option for e−/h+ separator and optoelectronic devices.264,265 The straddling gap and staggered gap heterointerfaces also suggest the opportunity to enhance the redox potential of the active sites even at zero bias. In broken gap, the VB and CB of S1 are higher than the CB of S2 and do not possess the zone of spatial charge as well.260 Owing to semi-metallic response at the heterointerface, the transfer of the electrons and holes in the layers of type-III 2D heterostructures produces a sturdy electric field, which make them an excellent candidate for photovoltaic cells.266 Thus, by designing the heterointerface carefully, based on the band alignment, new materials can be prepared for multiple applications. Furthermore, combining different semiconductors or adding different additives at a heterointerface creates a p–n junction, as shown in Fig. 16d, having an induced potential difference at the interface, even when there is no external bias present.260 Moreover, the M–S heterointerfaces are fashioned among n- or p-type semiconductors, semi-metals and metals, where e− flows and electronic interaction is affected by the Schottky effect in the heterointerfaces.267,268 A change in the electron density as well as in the Fermi level occur due to e− flow, which enhances the M–S heterointerface chemical reactivity (Fig. 16e and f).269,270

2D-LMS form electronic coupling and tune the e− transfer at the heterointerfaces by a suitable combination of different materials.260,271 Similarly, the strength of coupling at the heterointerfaces can affect the charge transfer excitons dynamics and offer PL features to 2D-LMS. Interestingly, PL characteristics as well as exciton dynamics can be further modified by introducing dielectric layers at the heterointerface.247 The adsorption energies can be tuned with vdW interactions at the heterointerface, which decreases the diffusion potential of the ions, permitting multilayer ions adsorption at very low expansion for the cycling stability.249 The weak vdW connections of the basal planes offer dynamically stabilized 2D heterostructures having changeable interlayer spacing for quick ion dispersion, even for Na+ and K+ ions having larger ionic radius and polarized ions such as Mg2+.272,273 These properties can be modified for per-SCs in the presence of various functional groups and through the stacking order of the distinct layers. In addition to band modulation, managing the values of the interlayer distance also lift the e− and ionic transfer, leading to enhanced electrochemical properties of the per-SCs.253,274 The greater interlayer spacing offers direct penetration of the electrolyte at the heterointerface; therefore, charges only need to diffuse through a few angstroms (Å) distance.275 This separation may be further modified in 2D heterostructures and varying spacing values are attained in contrast to bare 2D-LMs, which can help in realizing more advanced per-SCs.247 In summary, vdW 2D heterostructures offer great opportunity for selecting suitable material combinations for yielding interface-induced desirable chemical as well as physical features. The engineering of 2D heterointerface revealed that 2D heterostructures exhibit superior performance in per-SCs in contrast to the individual counterparts. Moreover, there are some restrictions that strongly suggest the construction of 2D heterointerfaces with strong chemical bonds and fast charge transport mechanism to get more stable structures for per-SCs.
The demand of highly stable and tuneable characteristics of the heterointerfaces for improved performance of the per-SCs gave an idea for a novel type of 2D heterostructures that are covalently bonded. The covalent interactions can take place with the help of a linker or directly between two different materials such as EDC and Sonogashira couplings for growing a stabilized structure. These connections strongly hold dissimilar materials together under severe circumstances and also provide straight pathways between dissimilar materials for the ultrafast movement of charges utilizing covalent bonds.276 Usually, there are no dangling bonds present in the 2D-LMS or they do not possess clean interfaces; hence, they need linkers to grow covalently bonded 2D heterostructures. Moreover, covalent heterostructures with linker support need not fulfil the requirement of lattice matching; therefore, they offer huge flexibility in selecting a combination of different materials for assembling the 2D heterostructures. These amendments may increase the performance of the per-SCs and energy storage devices as well.247 In addition, cross-linking also generates planarity, which plays its role in efficient charge transfer in 2-D heterostructures owing to orbital overlapping.277 The covalent linkages assist in enhancing charge transfer between the heterointerfaces and provide a larger surface area for increased photochemical reactions in per-SCs.278 In addition, simply tuning the movement of the charges and functionalization of the 2D-LMs to build covalently bonded 2D heterostructures generates defects that can further modify their properties and ultimately improve the performance of solar cells.
9. Summary and future outlooks
Remarkable progress in only few years have significantly enabled per-SCs to approach the standards of other functional silicon-based photovoltaics. However, some challenges still prevail regarding the long-term stability of these perovskite devices, which hinder their commercialization and upscaling. Stable and inexpensive materials need to be explored for the enhancement of the efficiency and stability of per-SCs. In this regard, 2D-LMs have recently emerged as a competitive class of materials that can open potential pathways toward the sustainable future of SC technology. In this review, we have summarized the various applications of different 2D-LMs in per-SCs. Owing to their tuneable properties and structures, these 2D-LMs can be effectively employed in all the functional layers of the per-SCs to boost the overall performance. Apart from a significant reduction in the net cost, 2D-LMS also offer homogeneous films with well-defined interfaces that can be engineered effectively. Regardless of such overwhelming advantages, further efforts still need to be made for promoting their applications in per-SCs.
The correlation between the synthetic procedures and materials performance need to be addressed more vigorously. The fast nucleation rates involved in the one-step synthesis methods result in poor crystallization of the active layers while the slow nucleation rates in two-step fabrication routes generate relatively large crystals with poor performance. There is an ample need to further explore these synthetic techniques to achieve simultaneously fast and well-ordered nucleation. In addition to that, we have noticed that spin coating is the most adopted technique to deposit 2D-LMs films on various substrates. Although this technique offers several advantages of low cost, easy availability, and convenience, the layers deposited by this method do not fully cover the underlying layers. The incomplete coverage results in the generation of voids in large quantities and the performance of the device is heavily compromised. One solution can be to increase the number of layers deposited on the substrates but this will cause roughness and poor transparency of the films, consequently increasing the series resistance in the devices. Hence, developing more efficient deposition procedures to introduce 2D-LMs in per-SCs is of great importance.
Apart from the improved efficiencies in per-SCs, 2D-LMs have drastically boosted the stability of these devices as well. Further research in coming years will definitely address this significant issue of device stability by employing 2D-LMs in per-SCs. Efforts are being made to effectively functionalize these 2D materials with appropriate compounds to boost their hydrophobic nature and thermal stability. The hetero-doping of various 2D-LMs such as TMDCs- and MXenes-based HTLS with proper functionalization can prove to be highly effective in this regard. Encapsulating the device with hydrophobic HTLs and the direct introduction of hydrophobic elements in the device structure can significantly improve the stability against moist conditions.
Carbon-based nanomaterials, especially 2D-LMs, have been extensively explored for their applications in SC technology in the past few years because of their extensive stability and cost effectiveness. Moreover, their hydrophobic nature (water repellent) has significantly improved the stability of devices in moist environments, which is extremely important. However, we still believe that more studies are needed on the combined effect of humidity, light, and high temperature on the stability of C-LMs-based photovoltaic devices. Although C-LMs seem to have reached a level of saturation in their applicability in SC technology, we expect that more reports will be published on their improved applications in third generation per-SCs in the near future as well. Furthermore, newly developed GR-derivatives such as GY and GDY have emerged as promising candidates to replace GR, GO, and RGO in all the functional layers of per-SCs. They present the homogeneous distribution of pores, great flexibility, and unique electronic behavior in contrast to other GR derivatives. We believe that the further exploration of these materials will prove to be highly productive in pushing the PCE of per-SCs beyond 25%.
Furthermore, an alternate for C-LMs-based SCs that have emerged quite recently is a new class of materials named as TMDCs, which have shown extraordinary potential as a replacement of C-LMs in the SC technology. TMDCs have shown high catalytic, absorptive, and stable properties and are relatively inexpensive as well. This has intrigued many researchers to develop modern and cost-effective synthetic approaches to fabricate highly effective and stable TMDCs. Micromechanical cleavage synthesis that offers nanosheets of high quality is one of the examples but it is not much suitable for large or commercial scale fabrication. Other synthetic methods including CVD, electrochemical exfoliation, and liquid exfoliation have been reported with reliable results as well. The ultrasonic spray pyrolysis technique has shown significant effects on the performance of the fabricated TMDCs in per-SCs. Furthermore, the charge transfer properties of the TMDCs such as MoS2 can be effectively enhanced by functionalizing with PAS. Furthermore, compositing TMDCs with organic HTLS such as PCBM, P3HT, and PEDOT:PSS has proven to be an effective approach to boost their PV performance in per-SCs. Moreover, studies have revealed that utilizing 1T-rich phases of TMDCs including MoS2 and WS2 as HTLs, result in higher PCEs as compared to other phases. TMDCs-based ETLs in per-SCs have shown promising results as well since MoS2, MoSe2, and WS2 offer swift vertical charge transport and uniform layers with lesser dangling bonds. In addition, these 2D-LMs have been composited with various metal oxides such as ZnO and TiO2 to enhance their electron extraction abilities in per-SCs. In order to improve the stability of per-SCs, these 2D TMDCs have also been used as the buffer layers between the functional parts of the SC to prevent device degradation. Some recently emerged TMDCs-based 2D-LMS such as MoTe2, WSe2, and PtSe2 can prove to be potential candidates for improved charge transport behaviors and they should be further explored in various parts of per-SCs. Nevertheless, we believe that there is plenty of scope for exploring these 2D-LMs in order to further enhance the stability and efficiency of per-SCs.
Apart from the traditional 2D-LMs utilized in per-SCs, 2D MOFs and COFs have gained significant attention in the recent years. High PCEs of up to 20% have already been reported owing to the unique properties of these novel 2D structures. With proper synthesis and tuning, 2D MOFs and COFs could effectively replace costly materials and help in realizing cost effective and flexible per-SCs with improved efficiencies and stabilities. We expect to see more in-depth research reports on their use in per-SCs in the near future.
Since an abundant amount of work has been reported on carbon-based materials in the recent years, we have focused more on TMDCs and their applications in per-SCs. Various applications of 2D C-LMs and TMDCs-based LMs in all functional layers of per-SCs have been briefly discussed for reader's convenience. Although a number of works has been reported on the use of TMDCs–LMs in organic, dye-sensitized, and silicon-based SCs, only limited studies have been reported on their application in per-SCs. Furthermore, we have found no significant work on the use of MoS2-based electrodes in per-SCs and we expect to see informative reports on their use as counter electrodes in the near future. As far as C-LMs are concerned, we believe that there is still room to develop C-LMs-based CE with lesser resistance to improve the PCE of per-SCs. Moreover, frequent studies on the upscaling and commercialization of C-LMS-based per-SCs is encouraging researchers to look for more adequate synthetic approaches and compact results are expected in the coming years.
In conclusion, our review will help and encourage researchers to further explore 2D-LMs based on carbon and TMDCs to improve the stability and performance of these promising third generation in the future. It will provide researchers with compact and resourceful information on the abovementioned materials and their application in various functional parts of per-SCs. We believe that 2D-LMs are a promising pathway for sustainable solar-based energy production to meet our ever-growing demands.
