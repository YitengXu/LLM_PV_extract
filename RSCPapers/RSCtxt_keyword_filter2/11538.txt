    , Accepted 3rd July 2013First published on 5th July 2013AbstractThe circle chain embracing D–π–A dyes have been demonstrated as a promising type of sensitizer for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). To further develop this type of organic dye for DSCs and discover the heuristic points on energy level matching, we introduced various donor moieties (carbazole, indoline and dimethoxytriphenylamine) into a D–π–A system bearing a circle chain embracing a π-spacer and cyanoacrylic acid as an acceptor, resulting in three new organic dyes LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6, respectively. Among these dyes, the energy levels of the molecular orbitals in carbazole dye LJ-4 match best with the conduction band of TiO2 and the redox potential of the redox species. DSCs employing the sensitizer LJ-4 and the iodine redox electrolyte exhibit a high power conversion efficiency of 9.20%, measured under the 100 mW cm−2, simulated AM1.5 sunlight. This work highlights the importance of energy level matching in the further molecular design of a circle chain embracing D–π–A dyes.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), a type of innovative photovoltaic device with an operating principle resembling the natural photosynthetic process, are considered to be the next generation of photovoltaics due to their potential applications in cost-efficient renewable energy, as well as in the production of electronics. Since the pioneering report in 1991,1 unremitting research effort has been devoted to this type of device, resulting in significant progress, in molecular engineering,2 investigation of the mechanism,3 and the recorded efficiencies continue to increase.4 In order to avoid the use of noble metals and having to face the environmental issues that follow, metal-free organic D–π–A dyes have emerged, and DSCs based on organic dyes have yielded competitive conversion efficiencies up to 9%.5 Achieving higher efficiencies, which involves the improvement of open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current, is required for practical application. However, such improvements have been considered as the most important and challenging subject in the development of organic sensitizers.6
In order to overcome the common issues involving aggravated intermolecular interactions and charge recombination, which deteriorate photocurrent generation and decrease photovoltage in DSCs based on organic D–π–A dyes,7 the introduction of steric hindrance on the dye molecule has been demonstrated as an effective strategy in molecular design.2c,8 Currently, two styles of substituent are adopted for steric hindrance in organic D–π–A dyes. One is the flexible bulky groups (alkyl chains, etc.) side linked on the donor part and/or π-conjugated backbone,2c,8a,c and another is the rigid circle chain surrounding the π-spacer.9 The former has been discussed to be effective in suppressing the intermolecular interaction and charge recombination during the past decade, resulting in successful development of various dye structures with high efficiency.5e,f,h,8 On the other hand, the circle chain surrounding the dye molecule not only suppresses intermolecular interactions and charge recombination efficiently, but also immobilizes the conjugated backbone in a planar configuration, hence extending the absorption spectra for efficient light harvesting. However, only LJ-3, is an example of a dye bearing a circle chain embracing π-spacer that has been recently developed with a conversion efficiency of 8.34% recently.9 Many fundamental issues need to be investigated for further development of this promising kind of circle chain embracing D–π–A sensitizers for DSCs. The most urgent current issue that needs to be addressed is the energy level matching for efficient electron injection and dye regeneration,10 which is significant for the rational molecular design of this new type of organic dye.
In this context, we introduced various donor moieties (carbazole, indoline and dimethoxytriphenylamine) into the D–π–A system bearing a circle chain embracing π-spacer and cyanoacrylic acid as an acceptor, resulting in three new organic dyes LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6 (Scheme 1), respectively. Essentially, these three new dyes were designed based on the following considerations: (1) further expanding the absorption spectra by introducing stronger electron donating parts for light harvesting; (2) tuning the energy levels of dye molecular orbitals and suggesting suitable driving forces for efficient electron injection and dye regeneration; (3) investigating the influence of the electron donating ability of various donor parts (indoline > dimethoxytriphenylamine > triphenylamine > carbazole) on the photovoltaic performance of DSCs based on circle chain embracing D–π–A dyes. The synthesis, spectra, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the dyes LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6 have been investigated, and dye LJ-3 (Scheme 1) is also presented for comparative analysis.

Results and discussion
Molecular design and synthesis
The preparation of three new circle chain embracing D–π–A dyes LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6 was achieved via bromination, Suzuki coupling and Knoevenagel condensation reactions in a moderate yield by the rational synthetic routes depicted in Scheme 1. Bromination of the circle chain embracing bithiophene 1 by NBS produced the resulting compound 2,11 which was then coupled with 5-formylthiophene-2-boronic acid to yield aldehyde 3,9 a common intermediate for the three new dyes. Suzuki coupling between aldehyde 3 and the corresponding borate reagents gave the dye precursors 4, 5 and 6, which were converted to dyes LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6 as purple solids via the Knoevenagel condensation, respectively. The desired dyes were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, as well as mass spectrometry. The purities of the circle chain embracing D–π–A dyes LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6 were characterized by HPLC analysis (Fig. S6–S8, ESI†).
UV-visible absorption spectra
The absorption spectra of the circle chain embracing D–π–A dyes LJ-3, LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6 in dichloromethane are shown in Fig. 1, and the data is summarized in Table 1. Being similar to dye LJ-3, the three new dyes LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6 exhibit two distinct absorption bands: one absorption band is in the UV region (360–430 nm) corresponding to the π–π* electron transitions of the conjugated molecules, as well as the overlapping n–π* electron transitions; and the other is in the visible region (500–600 nm) that can be assigned to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donating unit to the cyanoacrylic acid anchoring moiety. The maxima absorption peaks (λmax) of the dyes vary: indoline dye LJ-5 (570 nm) > dimethoxytriphenylamine dye LJ-6 (556 nm) > triphenylamine dye LJ-3 (551 nm) ≈ carbazole dye LJ-4 (550 nm), which could be explained by the strength of the electron donating ability of the donor group in each dye.12 Due to the relatively stronger electron donating ability of the indoline moiety, the ICT transitions absorption band in indoline dye LJ-5 is redshifted ∼20 nm relative to those of the carbazole dye LJ-4 and dimethoxytriphenylamine dye LJ-6, and with enhancement of molar extinction coefficient (ε). Circle chain embracing D–π–A dyes LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6 exhibit similar emission in CH2Cl2 solution but different Stokes shifts (Fig. S1, ESI†). Among these three new dyes, the carbazole dye LJ-4 exhibits the largest Stokes shift, which indicates significant structural reorganization of the dye molecule upon photoexcitation.13

The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of these dyes adsorbed on TiO2 films are shown in the inset in Fig. 1. The λmax for the dye-loaded TiO2 films are also listed in Table 1. After being adsorbed on the TiO2 film, LJ-3, LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6 show fine absorption peaks, similar to those in solution, suggesting that the steric hindrance of the insulating outer ring suppresses the intermolecular interactions effectively. The maximum absorption of these dyes anchored on the TiO2 film exhibits a hypochromatic shift of approximately 50 nm in comparison with that in solution. Such a blue shift could be assigned to the solvent effect and/or deprotonation of the carboxylic acid in the anchoring process.14 As compared to the analogue dye MK-2 containing four thiophene units linked long alkyl chains,2c,15 carbazole dye LJ-4 exhibits obvious red-shift both in solution and on TiO2 film, as well as higher ε under the same conditions (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†), even though dye LJ-4 only possesses three thiophene units. The results further indicate that employing a circle chain to fix the conjugated backbone was an efficient way to improve the light harvesting efficiency.
Electrochemical properties and energy levels
The electrochemical properties of the circle chain embracing D–π–A dyes LJ-3, LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6 were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in CH2Cl2 containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAHFP) as a supporting electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 2a, all these dyes exhibit two reversible oxidative waves. The different electron–donor moieties in LJ-3, LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6 influence their first oxidation potentials, respectively. The HOMO levels corresponding to the first oxidation potentials (vs. NHE) increase in the order of indoline dye LJ-5 (0.72 V) < dimethoxytriphenylamine dye LJ-6 (0.76 V) < triphenylamine LJ-3 (0.81 V) < carbazole dye LJ-4 (0.94 V), which was associated with the electron-donating ability of indoline > dimethoxytriphenylamine > triphenylamine > carbazole. They are all more positive than the Nernst potential of I−/I3− redox couple (0.4 V vs. NHE), ensuring regeneration of the oxidized dyes by I− after electron injection, with the driving force of 0.41 V, 0.54 V, 0.32 V and 0.36 V for LJ-3, LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6, respectively (Fig. 2b). The excited state redox potentials of these three dyes (−0.98 to −1.21 V vs. NHE) are sufficiently more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), ensuring sufficient driving force (0.48–0.71 V) for electron injection from the excited dyes to the conduction band of TiO2.

DFT calculations
To gain further insight into the molecular structure and frontier molecular orbitals of these new dyes, the geometries of dyes LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6 were optimized by density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G** level. Fig. S4 (ESI†) displays the relative energies and electron distributions of the HOMOs and LUMOs of these dyes. The HOMOs are mainly delocalized from the donor parts to the oligothiophene π-spacer, whereas the LUMOs show localized electron distributions through the cyanoacrylic acid and its adjacent π-spacer. Hence, both orbitals provide sufficient overlap between the donor and acceptor to guarantee a fast charge transfer transition. Therefore, excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO should lead to efficient photoinduced electron transfer from the donor group to the TiO2 film via the terminal cyanoacrylic acid. The optimized ground-state geometries and corresponding dihedral angles between each plane are shown in Fig. S5.† The circle chain embracing π-spacers in these three new dyes perform similar planar configuration with a dihedral angle below 1° between the corresponding thiophene units, which will facilitate the ICT transition, as suggested by their excellent absorption in visible region described above. The geometry results indicate that π-conjugations in this type of circle chain embracing D–π–A dyes are not altered by their donor moieties, which is convenient for molecular tailoring.
Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic characteristics of the DSCs based on these dyes under AM1.5G condition (100 mW cm−2) have been investigated,16 employing a solution of 0.6 M 1-propyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile as the electrolyte. The onset wavelength of the IPCE spectra shift towards the red region was in the order LJ-4 ≈ LJ-3 < LJ-6 < LJ-5 cells (Fig. 3), in accordance with the absorption spectra observed for the dye-loaded TiO2 films. Comparing with the maximum IPCE value (83%) observed in the range of 400–600 nm for the DSCs based on triphenylamine dye LJ-3, the maximum value of IPCE for carbazole dye LJ-4 increases to 88%, whereas those for indoline dye LJ-5 and dimethoxytriphenylamine dye LJ-6 decrease to 77% and 81%, respectively. Considering the IPCE results together with the energy levels of these four circle chain embracing D–π–A dyes, the IPCE values vary in the order of LJ-5-based cells (77%) < LJ-6-based cells (81%) < LJ-3-based cells (83%) < LJ-4-based cells (88%), which is consistent with the driving force for the regeneration of the oxidized dye in the trend of indoline dye LJ-5 (0.32 V) < dimethoxytriphenylamine dye LJ-6 (0.36 V) < triphenylamine dye LJ-3 (0.41 V) < carbazole dye LJ-4 (0.54 V) (Fig. 2b). The results indicate that a negative shift of the ground-state oxidization potential might dominate the slower regeneration of the oxidized state of dyes LJ-5 and LJ-6 by the I− in the redox electrolyte. Among these four circle chain embracing D–π–A dyes, carbazole dye LJ-4 possesses the lowest driving force (0.48 V) for electron injection, but the DSCs based on dye LJ-4 gave the highest IPCE, indicating that a driving force of 0.48 V is sufficient for electron injection from the excited dyes to the conduction band of TiO2. As a result, among these four dyes, the energy levels of carbazole dye LJ-4 match best with the conduction band of TiO2 and the redox potential of the redox species for efficient electron injection and dye regeneration.
 Fig. 3  IPCE spectra of DSCs based on dyes LJ-3, LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6. 
We plotted current–voltage curves and calculated the photovoltaic properties of the LJ-3, LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6 cells under the same conditions (Fig. 4 and Table 2, respectively). The short-circuit currents (JSC) vary in the order of LJ-3-based cells (15.03 mA cm−2) < LJ-6-based cells (15.67 mA cm−2) ≈ LJ-5-based cells (15.68 mA cm−2) < LJ-4-based cells (16.34 mA cm−2). The slightly larger JSC of the DSCs based on LJ-5 and LJ-6, in comparison with that of DSCs based on LJ-3, demonstrates the beneficial influence of the red-shifted absorption spectra of LJ-5 and LJ-6 on TiO2 film and the broadening of the IPCE spectra of the LJ-5 cells and LJ-6 cells. The high JSC observed for the LJ-4 cells is attributed to its high IPCE value in the range of 400–600 nm. The open-circuit voltages (VOC) of the DSCs based on circle chain embracing D–π–A dyes LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6 were 0.747 V, 0.710 V and 0.732 V, respectively. The VOC values of all these cells are comparable to those of alkylated dyes, such as MK-2 (∼0.73 V).2c,15 This implies that the circle chain surrounding the dye backbone is effective in suppressing charge recombination between the injected electron in TiO2 and I3− in electrolyte. As a result, DSCs based on the three new circle chain embracing D–π–A dyes LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ LJ-6 show overall conversion efficiencies of 9.20%, 7.42% and 8.29%, respectively.

CEM and IMVS characterization
The VOC is related to the conduction band position of TiO2 and the charge recombination rate in DSCs.17 In order to understand the difference of the VOC observed for the DSCs based on the circle chain embracing D–π–A dyes LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6, the relative conduction band positions and electron lifetimes in the DSCs based on the corresponding sensitizers were investigated. Firstly, we measured the relative conduction band position of TiO2 through a charge extraction method (CEM) reported by Frank et al.18 As shown in Fig. 5, the DSCs based on circle chain embracing D–π–A dyes LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6 exhibit an approximately linear increase in VOC as a function of the logarithm of electron density. Under the same condition, the CEM plots for DSCs based on these three dyes almost overlap, indicating that DSCs based on LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6 share the similar conduction band position. The results suggest that the adjustment of donor parts in this type of organic sensitizer has less influence on the shift of the conduction band of TiO2. Therefore, the VOC difference of DSCs based on LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6 would be caused by their various charge recombination rates, which were confirmed by the measurement of electron lifetimes (τe) in the conduction band of TiO2 by means of intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS). As shown in Fig. 6, at a fixed voltage, the τe values of the DSCs based on these three dyes vary in the order of LJ-5 < LJ-6 < LJ-4, suggesting that the higher dye-loading amount (Table 2) results in a denser dye layer formed on the TiO2 surface, which may be effective in the suppression of charge recombination between I3− and the injected electron in TiO2. The various dye loading amounts observed for the circle chain embracing D–π–A dyes LJ-3, LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6 may be caused by their different solubility and/or sizes of donor moieties. The different solubility is associated with the different polarity of dye molecules resulting from the varying donating abilities of donor moieties.

EIS characterization
To obtain further insight into the important interfacial charge transfer processes in DSCs based on circle chain embracing D–π–A dyes LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in the dark under a forward bias of −0.65 V with a frequency range of 10−1 Hz to 106 Hz. Generally, three semicircles are observed in EIS Nyquist plots (Fig. 7). The small and large semicircles located at the high- and middle-frequency regions, which are attributed to the redox reaction resistance at the platinum counter electrode, and the electron transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (Rrec), respectively.19 Another small semicircle located at the low-frequency region corresponding to the Warburg diffusion process resistance of I−/I3− in the electrolyte often overlap with the middle-frequency large semicircle, probably due to the low viscosity of the solvents used in our electrolytes, and the shorter length for I− ion diffusion as only the thin spacer was used.20 For the same counter electrode and electrolyte, a similar diameter semicircle was obtained at the low frequency region. At the middle frequency region, the semicircle diameter is responsible for the charge recombination, which is associated with the structure of the sensitizer and interfacial engineering. The Rrec values for the DSCs based on LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6 are 40 Ω cm2, 23 Ω cm2 and 31 Ω cm2, respectively. Thus it can be concluded that the surface blocking effect of these circle chain embracing D–π–A dyes decreases in the order of LJ-4 > LJ-6 > LJ-5, as suggested by their dye-loading amount on TiO2 film. The trend is in accordance with the decreasing sequence of the VOC of the DSCs.

Conclusion
In summary, we successfully developed three new D–π–A dyes LJ-4, LJ-5 and LJ-6 bearing circle chain embracing oligothiophene as a π-spacer and cyanoacrylic acid as the acceptor moieties for high-efficiency DSCs. DSCs employing the sensitizer LJ-4 and the iodine redox electrolyte exhibit a good power conversion efficiency of 9.20% measured under 100 mW cm−2, simulated AM1.5 sunlight, while DSCs based on indoline dye LJ-5 and dimethoxytriphenylamine dye LJ-6 show a slightly lower efficiency of 7.42% and 8.29%, respectively, due to their less positive ground-state oxidization potentials resulting in slower regeneration of the oxidized state of LJ-5 and LJ-6 by the I− in the redox electrolyte. The dissimilarity of the cells’ photovoltages is scrutinized by evaluating the titania conduction band and the variation of interfacial charge recombination kinetics. Among these three dyes, the energy levels of carbazole dye LJ-4 match best with the conduction band of TiO2 and the redox potential of the redox species for efficient electron injection and dye regeneration. The presented results further demonstrate that employing a circle chain embracing π-spacer is a promising strategy to construct efficient organic sensitizers for DSCs. Our work will attract the increasing attention of researchers in the same field, and provide enlightenment for further molecular design of this type of organic dye.

Cell fabrication and characterization
The photoanode (thickness 19 μm; area 0.25 cm2) of the DSC was a double-layered TiO2 film containing a transparent layer 14 μm thick with titania particles (∼20 nm) and a scattering layer 6 μm thick (400 nm nanoparticles). The double-layered film was heated to 520 °C, sintered for 1 hour and then cooled to ca. 80 °C and treated with 0.1 M HCl aqueous. After the HCl treatment, the films were washed, dried and then immersed in 3 × 10−4 M acetonitrile–tert-butyl alcohol (1/1, v/v) solution of the sensitizers for 40 h. Afterwards, the dye-loaded TiO2 film and a platinum coated conducting glass were assembled into a sandwich type of DSC and sealed by heating the Surlyn spacer (40 mm thick). An electrolyte was injected into the spacer from the counter electrode side through a pre-drilled hole, and then the hole was sealed with a Bynel sheet and a thin-glass-slide cover by heating. The electrolyte was from a commercial source and composed of 0.6 M dimethylpropylimidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI and 0.5 M TBP in acetonitrile. The adsorption amount of dyes on the surface of TiO2 films, that were prepared under the same conditions as those fabricated into cells, was estimated as follows: TiO2 films sensitized with dyes were immersed into 0.05 M NaOH in THF–H2O (1/1, v/v) for desorption of the dyes. The amount of desorbed dye was evaluated by their corresponding absorbance spectra. Four pieces of TiO2 film for one cell were tested and an average value was adopted.
The I–V characteristics were determined by using a black metal mask with an aperture area of 0.2304 cm−2 under standard AM 1.5 sunlight, 100 mW cm−2 (WXS-155S-10: Wacom Denso Co. Japan). Monochromatic IPCE spectra were measured with a monochromatic incident light of 1 × 1016 photons per cm2 under 100 mW cm−2 in director current mode (CEP-2000BX, Bunko-Keiki). The IMVS were measured with a potentiostat (Solartron1287) equipped with a frequency response analyzer (Solartron1255B) at an open-circuit condition based on a monochromatic illumination (420 nm) controlled by a Labview system to obtain the photovoltaic response induced by the modulated light. The modulated light was driven with a 10% AC perturbation current superimposed on a DC current in a frequency ranging from 10−1 to 106 Hz. The CEM was performed with the same monochromatic light source. The solar cell was illuminated at an open-circuit condition for 5 s to attain a steady state and then the light source was switched off when the device simultaneously switched to a short-circuit condition to extract the charges generated at that light intensity. The EIS spectra were measured with an impedance analyzer (Solartron Analytical, 1255B) connected with a potentiostat (Solartron Analytical, 1287) under illumination using a solar simulator (WXS-155S-10: Wacom Denso Co. Japan).
