    , Accepted 15th November 2018First published on 16th November 2018AbstractAmong solution-processed photovoltaic materials, lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dots (QDs) possess a highly tunable bandgap and strong infrared absorption, while metal halide perovskites show extraordinary external quantum efficiency (EQE) in the visible region, which offers the opportunity to construct an ideal tandem cell of PbS QDs/perovskite. However, it still remains a huge challenge to integrate fragile perovskite films into a monolithic tandem structure. We have for the first time addressed the challenge of preparing stable and efficient tandem solar cells combining PbS colloidal QDs with emerging MAPbI3 perovskites by all-solution-processing. A perfectly superimposed open circuit voltage and an optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.03% have been achieved, which is the highest reported PCE for any PbS QD based tandem solar cell. And we believe this efficiency will be further improved by using perovskites with wider bandgaps to provide more complementary absorption. In addition, the introduction of a PbS subcell can effectively eliminate the hysteresis-effect in metal-halide perovskites, and result in high UV stability and exceptional storage stability under a dry environment without encapsulation. Therefore, we revealed that the synergetic use of QDs and perovskite materials in tandem structures can extend the range of device photo response and simultaneously deliver excellent device performance as well as improved stability. Moreover, our work provided an important starting point for future advances in efficient QDs/perovskite tandem solar cells with more complementary absorption.
The significant progress of solution-processed next-generation photovoltaics shows great promise in flexible, lightweight, semi-transparent, and large-area energy-conversion applications.1,2 With the exploration of novel functional materials and the development of fabrication techniques, the solution-processed photovoltaic devices have achieved rapid advances in power conversion efficiency (PCE), with a certified efficiency over 12% for solar cells based on organic conjugated materials and inorganic nanocrystals.3–6 Meanwhile, organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved unprecedentedly rapid progress in the past 5 years, and the record PCE is now approaching 23%, placing them at the forefront of solution-processed photovoltaic devices.7,8
There generally exist two unavoidable energy losses in single-junction solar cells, namely, the thermalization of high energy photons and transmittance of low energy photons, which greatly restrict the improvement of device performance.9,10 The industrial and scientific community adopted a tandem configuration formed by a series of sub-cells with decreasing bandgaps connected through a recombination layer (RL) to minimize these energy losses and thus enhance device efficiency.11,12 Note that most of the organic conjugated materials or emerging organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites suffer from the inherent disadvantage of lacking a broad absorption range (bandgap (Eg) ≈ 1.5–2.0 eV), which limits the use of the full solar spectrum, and requires the use of thick films for photo harvesting.13–15 In the past 10 years, researchers have extensively studied tandem device structures using various combinations of photoactive materials to achieve complementary absorption. Tandem solar cells based on organic/organic, organic/nanocrystal, organic/perovskite, Si/perovskite, and perovskite/perovskite sub-cells have been successfully demonstrated.14–21 Among all the photovoltaic materials, metal halide perovskites have shown extraordinary power conversion efficiency in the visible region, while the capture of near-infrared (near-IR) photons is not as efficient due to their limited bandgap tunability.22 In contrast, chalcogenide colloidal quantum dots (QDs) like lead sulfide (PbS) can exhibit a highly tunable bandgap from 0.5 eV to 2.0 eV, offering strong IR absorption to construct ideal tandem structures with perovskites.23–25 In addition, the state-of-the-art efficiency of PbS QD and metal halide perovskite solar cells is over 12% and 22%, respectively,7,26 indicating great potential for the building of efficient PbS/perovskite tandem solar cells. Indeed, a theoretical efficiency of 43% was calculated very recently for tandem cells with bandgap combinations of 1.55 (perovskite) and 1.0 eV (PbS QDs) under AM 1.5G illumination, and a power conversion efficiency of 29.7% is possible by combining state-of-the-art perovskites and QD solar cells.22 However, so far, only one tandem device based on PbS QDs and perovskites with an extremely low efficiency of ∼1% has been reported during the preparation of this manuscript,22 likely due to the vulnerable perovskite film and the lack of solution-processable RLs to efficiently connect the sub-cells. Herein, we demonstrated efficient solution-processed monolithic tandem solar cells using PbS QDs in the front cell and CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite in the rear cell. We achieved a solution-processed RL composed of pH-neutral PEDOT and a SnO2 layer to connect the sub-cells with minimum voltage losses. The fabrication process of both sub-cells was deliberately modified compared to that of the corresponding single-junction cells to well preserve the fragile perovskite layer in the rear cell. As a result, the champion PCE of the optimized PbS QDs/perovskite tandem solar cell reached 11.03%, well surpassing that of the PbS QD single-junction cell. And we believe this efficiency will be further improved by using perovskites with wider bandgaps to provide more complementary absorption. Quite interestingly, the Voc of the tandem cell is 1.66 V, perfectly matching the sum of that of the PbS (0.55 V) and perovskite (1.11 V) sub-cells, indicating that our new n-PEDOT/SnO2 interfacial layer provides an ideal recombination zone for the holes and electrons extracted from PbS and perovskite subcells, and may be applied to other tandem cells to further enhance their efficiency. More importantly, the tandem cells show stable performance after long-time storage under a dry environment and exhibit excellent stability against UV exposure.
As shown in Fig. 1a, the whole tandem structure is ITO/zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs)/PbS QDs/n-PEDOT/SnO2 NPs/MAPbI3 perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/MoO3/Ag. For the PbS QD front cell, a tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) treated PbS QD layer is considered as the charge-generation layer and a 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) treated PbS QD layer as the hole-extraction layer. Low-temperature processed SnO2 serves as an electron extraction material for perovskite solar cells, and exhibits a favorable conduction band and higher electron mobility.27Fig. 1b depicts the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the optimized QDs/perovskite tandem cell, which clearly shows each of the corresponding layers. The optimal thickness of each constituent layer is measured to be 100 nm (ZnO), 110 nm (PbS-TBAI + PbS-EDT), 15 nm (n-PEDOT), 15 nm (SnO2), 250 nm (MAPbI3), and 160 nm (spiro-OMeTAD). Fig. 1c shows the corresponding energy level diagram. To successfully build a monolithic PbS/perovskite tandem architecture, three key conditions have to be accomplished: (a) the harsh ligand-exchange process for PbS QDs has to be avoided for the perovskite layer to minimize the harm from processing solvents and ligands; (b) a solution-processed RL is desired to connect two subcells with minimum resistance and serves as a solid solvent barrier; (c) a low-temperature one-step MAPbI3 perovskite deposition protocol is required to simplify the processing procedures and prevent possible degradation induced by thermal annealing.22,28 To fulfill these conditions, the PbS and perovskite subcells are preferably designed as the front cell and rear cell, respectively. On the one hand, the solid PbS QDs can endure the subsequent deposition processing of the perovskite layer; on the other hand, the vulnerable perovskite will not be damaged by the ligand-exchange and thermal annealing process required for the PbS front cell. Then the low-temperature solution-processed RL of n(pH-neutral)-PEDOT/SnO2 NPs is fabricated. Finally, annealing-free MAPbI3 is deposited in one-step. Note that the fabrication protocols of both subcells are rationally modified from those of the corresponding single-junction cells to ensure the current balance and monolithic integration of the tandem structure, with the details described below.

First, the PbS subcells with a structure of ITO/ZnO/PbS-TBAI/PbS-EDT/Au were fabricated. At first we chose PbS QDs with the first excitonic peak at ∼855 nm, which has been previously reported as the optimal absorption edge for PbS QD single-junction solar cells (Fig. S1†).24 However, compared to the single-junction cell, the PbS front cell has to be modified accordingly to allow the transmission of more light into the rear cell. Since the charges are mainly generated in the PbS-TBAI layer, the thickness of the charge-extraction PbS-EDT layer can be further reduced to decrease the unnecessary absorption of the front cell. The use of a thinner PbS-EDT layer will reduce the subcell Voc and FF but increase the Jsc. We speculate that a thinner PbS-EDT layer will reduce the internal field and consequently increase interfacial recombination. However, thinner PbS-EDT can let more sunlight enter into the perovskite for improved photon harvesting. Fortunately, a prolonged annealing time under ambient conditions can recover the PbS subcell photovoltaic parameters (Tables S1 and S2†). Meanwhile, the fabrication protocols of the perovskite rear cell also have to be optimized to achieve successful monolithic integration of the tandem structure. The conventional annealing temperature (>100 °C) of a perovskite is too high for the PbS QD subcells. More importantly, during annealing, the residual solvent and thioalcohol ligand in the PbS front cell may diffuse into the rear cell and have a detrimental effect on the perovskite layer. Thus the processing of the perovskite rear cell has to be annealing-free. Under this condition, we then compared the one-step deposition of the MAPbI3 perovskite layer (Fig. S2 and S3†) with the popular two-step solution processing (Table S3†). The one-step annealing-free approach achieves significantly higher performance in both the subcell and tandem cell, as show in Fig. S4.†
Considering the huge difference in the active materials, device architecture, operation mechanism, and fabrication processing between the perovskite and QD subcells, the design of an ideal recombination layer is critical for successfully building the resultant tandem solar cells. The RL should be physically robust to protect the underlying layers from the solution processing of the upper layers. In addition, it should align the quasi-Fermi level of both holes and electrons, resulting in efficient recombination and minimum resistance. Previous studies on organic–organic tandem solar cells have reported a well-functioning RL composed of n-PEDOT and ZnO NPs.29,30 However, the performance of perovskite solar cells using ZnO as the electron extraction layer is significantly lower than that based on TiO2 and SnO2,31 in which SnO2 possesses low-temperature solution processing, a higher electron mobility of 240 cm2 (V s)−1 and a favorable conduction band at around −4.20 eV (Fig. S5†) matching that of the metal halide perovskites.27 As shown in Fig. 1c, n-PEDOT/SnO2 provides an ideal recombination zone for the holes and electrons extracted from the PbS and perovskite subcells. Therefore, in our study, a solution-processed RL of n-PEDOT/SnO2 was facilely prepared for the first time with a modified protocol to effectively connect the perovskite and QD subcells. The optimal thickness of the RL in our tandem device is about 30 nm, with a 15 nm n-PEDOT and a 15 nm SnO2 layer. Note that PEDOT (Al 4083) and PEDOT (PH 1000) were also investigated, and n-PEDOT realized the highest summed voltage (Table S4†). Additionally, the use of pH-neutral PEDOT may help to avoid the corrosion of PbS QDs similar to that by the conventional acidic PEDOT. In order to improve the morphology and robustness of the RL, we further modified the fabrication procedures. The n-PEDOT was added with an appropriate amount of surfactant and water to obtain ideal wetting and optimal film thickness (Table S5†). Subsequently, n-PEDOT was thermally annealed under subtle conditions of 100 °C for 5 minutes to improve the film conductivity and in the meantime avoid the overheating damage to the PbS front cell (Table S6†). Additionally, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) was incorporated as a surfactant into the SnO2 nanoparticle solution to achieve improved nanoparticle dispersion, film morphology, and device performance (Table S7†). Fig. S6† depicts the atomic force microscopy (AFM) height and phase image of the SnO2 film processed with/without IPA. It is clear that the addition of IPA can lead to a slightly decreased root-mean-square (RMS) and increased grain sizes. These results indicate that both materials selection and sophisticated processing of the RL have a great influence on the resultant tandem cell performance.
In order to locate other ideal RL candidates for connecting PbS QDs/perovskite subcells, we also extensively compared the well-functional RLs reported in the previous literature. As shown in Table S8,† a large selection of RLs including MoO3/Ag/ZnO NPs, MoO3/Ag/SnO2, Au/ZnO NPs, Au/SnO2, Au/Nb2O5, ITO/SnO2, ITO/Nb2O5, ITO/Au/SnO2, Au/n-PEDOT/SnO2, n-PEDOT/Au/SnO2, and n-PEDOT/Nb2O5 has been carefully investigated together with n-PEDOT/SnO2.32–35 Among all the candidates, the solution-processed n-PEDOT/SnO2 RL has proven to be the simplest and most efficient one, with the voltage of the tandem cell matching perfectly with the sum of the voltages of the two subcells.
It is critical to achieve short-circuit current balance between the front and rear subcells. Therefore, we systematically adjusted the thickness of the front and the rear cell until the optimal device performance was obtained. The thickness of the PbS-TBAI active layer was altered in the range from 60 nm to 150 nm while fixing the thickness of the perovskite layer at 300 nm. As shown in Fig. 2a and Table S9,† the Voc of tandem cells is relatively stable, and the FF steadily increases, while the Jsc drastically decreases when the PbS-TBAI film thickness is higher than 90 nm. As a result, the PCE changes similarly to the Jsc and a maximum efficiency is achieved when the thickness of the PbS sub-cell reaches 90 nm. Consequently, we fixed the thickness of the PbS front cell at 90 nm and further adjusted the thickness of the rear perovskite active layer through changing the MAPbI3 precursor concentration (Fig. S7 and Table S10†). The optimal thickness of the rear cell was determined to be around 250 nm with a precursor content around 1.0 M.

Fig. 2b displays the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the tandem solar cells with various RLs and the corresponding single-junction reference subcells; the detailed performance parameters are summarized in Table 1 and S8.† We can see that the Voc of the optimal tandem cell (1.66 V) is equal to the sum of that of the two sub-cells (0.55 V and 1.11 V), indicating the perfect stacking of the PbS and perovskite subcells. Meanwhile, the FF (74.6%) of the tandem cell is even higher than the FF of the PbS (67.2%) and perovskite (69.5%) subcells. The enhanced FF suggests negligible connection resistance and improved carrier extraction from the subcells due to efficient recombination in RL. After carefully adjusting the subcell thickness, the optimal Jsc of the tandem device is 8.91 mA cm−2, resulting in a best PCE of 11.03%. This is the first demonstration of efficient QDs/perovskite tandem solar cells. And the PCE of 11.03% is also the highest value among all the PbS QD based tandem cells. With the same active-layer thickness for the optimal tandem cell, the PbS and perovskite subcells show a PCE of 4.78% and 13.59%, respectively. It should be noted that the PCE of the PbS subcell is significantly lower than that of state-of-the-art PbS single-junction cells (10–12%),36 since a thinner PbS film was used to allow the transmission of more light into the rear cell. Still, the performance of the tandem cell is limited by the relatively low current of 8.91 mA cm−2. As shown in Fig. S8,† the absorption edge of the perovskite subcell and PbS subcell is located at 800 nm and 1100 nm, respectively. Thus the low photocurrent is likely due to the significant absorption overlap between the two subcells. Fortunately, the incorporation of the PbS subcell in the tandem structure provides great flexibility in manipulating the light response of the subcells to achieve the desired current balance. We took advantage of the strong quantum confinement effect of PbS QDs to adjust the QD sizes and extend their excitonic peaks to 1038 nm and 1254 nm. The actual film absorption edge of the two PbS QDs with larger sizes is around 1200 nm and 1400 nm, which should provide complementary absorption with the perovskite subcell (Fig. S8 and S9†). As shown in Fig. 2c and Table 1, the tandem solar cell integrated with 1038 nm PbS QDs exhibits a similar PCE of 10.94%, together with a Voc of 1.57 V, a Jsc of 9.43 mA cm−2 and a FF of 73.8%. Likewise, a tandem solar cell integrated with 1254 nm PbS QDs shows a slightly decreased PCE of 9.93%, together with a Voc of 1.48 V, a Jsc of 9.39 mA cm−2 and a FF of 71.3% (device optimization is shown in Tables S11 and S12.† The FF histogram distribution is shown in Fig. S10†). Since PbS QDs with narrower bandgaps can effectively capture photons at longer wavelengths, we expect a larger Jsc in both the sub-cell and tandem cell. However, the Jsc in both devices is only slightly increased compared to the original value of 8.91 mA cm−2. Besides, we attribute the limited current improvement to the small PbS layer thickness. To maximize the infrared absorption, we should increase the thickness of the PbS film in the front cell, which, however, would block more visible light at the same time and reduce the number of absorbed photons in the perovskite rear cell, resulting in an unsatisfactory Jsc value. Thus in order to realize the full potential of perovskite/PbS QD tandem cells, it would be ideal to put a thick PbS layer in the rear cell to capture more infrared photons. Unfortunately, there remain big obstacles in the monolithic integration of this perovskite/PbS tandem architecture in current times. As shown in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra in Fig. 2d, the optimal PbS subcell and perovskite subcell show photo-responses in the range of 300–1100 nm and 300–800 nm, respectively. The perovskite rear cell is measured with glass/ZnO/PbS-TBAI/PbS-EDT used as the filter,37 and the integrated Jsc is relatively lower, likely due to the reflection loss caused by the extra glass substrate in the filter (Fig. S9†). The superposition of the EQE of the two subcells gives an overall estimate of the incident photon-to-current efficiency of the tandem solar cells,38,39 showing a broad photo-response range from 300 to 1100 nm. As mentioned above, the relatively low EQE value in the infrared region is due to the limited PbS layer thickness.

The optimal thickness of our subcells can be further confirmed by theoretical simulation, as shown in Fig. 3. The optical simulation was performed by adopting a previously reported approach.40 The thickness and related optical parameters of each layer in the tandem structure, required for simulation, were carefully measured and displayed in Fig. S11.† In Fig. 3, it can be clearly found that the optimal thickness for achieving the highest simulated Jsc is around 90 nm and 250 nm for the PbS front cell and perovskite rear cell, respectively. Although with a thicker perovskite layer of around 500 nm, we can also achieve an ideal Jsc according to the simulation results, the performance of the solar cell will be affected by the limited charge transport in the thick film, likely leading to more recombination losses and a reduced fill factor. Therefore, the thickness of around 250 nm is a more practical value for the perovskite rear cell. In short, the simulated active layer thickness in the subcells is in good agreement with our experimental results, indicating the success in the design and stacking of the PbS QDs/perovskite tandem structure with an n-PEDOT/SnO2 RL.

The major bottlenecks that hamper the commercialization progress of perovskite solar cells are determined by the instability of these hybrid materials, including the hysteresis effect and degradation under environmental stress.41–45 In contrast, state-of-the-art PbS QD solar cells based on ITO/ZnO/PbS-TBAI/PbS-EDT/Au architecture show no J–V hysteresis and show high stability under ambient conditions.24 Thus the combinative use of QDs/perovskite materials may have a profound influence on their device stability. In order to explore the potential advantages of the QDs/perovskite tandem structure, we further investigated the hysteresis effect and stability of our devices. As shown in Fig. 4a and Table S13,† we independently conduct forward and reverse J–V scans on the optimal tandem cell and PbS and perovskite subcells under AM 1.5G illumination. The perovskite solar cells show some hysteresis, with a slightly lower FF in the forward scan direction, while we found that the tandem devices are consistently hysteresis-free, similar to the PbS QD subcell. We hypothesize that the n-PEDOT/SnO2 RL can efficiently balance the hole and electron extraction process and reduce the charge accumulation induced by ion migration, which leads to the hysteresis-free QDs/perovskite tandem device. Meanwhile, we investigated the stability of QDs/perovskite tandem solar cells under a dry environment (inert atmosphere) and under UV illumination. We measured the PCE evolution of the optimal tandem cell as a function of aging time in a N2 filled glovebox without encapsulation. The whole measurements were performed at regular intervals over the course of ca. 20 days. As shown in Fig. 4b, the Voc and Jsc of the tandem cell remain relatively stable with both parameters exhibiting 96% of the initial value after 20 days' storage, while the FF shows a slight increase compared to the initial value. As a result, the PCE retains 93% of the initial performance. The high storage stability indicates that the design of our PbS/perovskite tandem structure has the potential to meet the requirement for practical application. On the other hand, perovskite solar cells are known to be degraded under UV illumination,46,47 and recently several attempts have been made to address the UV instability issue.48 The PbS QDs in the front cell absorb the UV photons very strongly, and may be used as a well functional UV-filter for the perovskite rear cell. Herein, we measured the UV stability of the PbS QDs and perovskite subcell as well as the tandem cell, with the results shown in Fig. 4c and Table S14.† As expected, no apparent performance deterioration of the PbS subcell is observed after 2.5 h UV radiation. The tandem cell also shows strong UV stability under the protection of the PbS front cell. In contrast, the performance of the perovskite subcell exhibits noticeable degradation after 2.5 h UV exposure, even with the use of an SnO2 ETL, which induces less photocatalytic degradation of perovskite in comparison with conventional TiO2. All together, we have shown that the QDs/perovskite tandem structure can produce a hysteresis-free and highly stable device performance under a dry environment. In addition, due to the strong UV absorption of the PbS front cell and the use of SnO2, the PbS QDs/perovskite tandem structure exhibits excellent UV stability.

Finally, it is worth commenting on the high-performance of the PbS QDs/perovskite tandem solar cells. We compared our results to those of other tandem cells based on PbS QDs, including a PbS/PbS tandem solar cell, PbS/CdTe tandem solar cell, and PbS/OPV hybrid tandem solar cell (Fig. 5).18,20,22,33,37,49–55 We noticed that most PbS QD based tandem solar cells show an efficiency lower than 8%. Only recently, we reported a PbS/PbS tandem solar cell with a PCE approaching 9%.33 And a few PbS/OPV hybrid tandem cells with complementary absorptions show PCEs slightly over 9%. In contrast, we resolved the serious challenge to monolithically integrate a PbS subcell with an extremely vulnerable perovskite. We for the first time reported an efficient PbS QDs/perovskite tandem cell with a PCE exceeding 11%, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest value for all QD based tandem solar cells. We believe higher device performance can be achieved for a more challenging tandem structure of perovskite (front cell)/PbS (rear cell) to fully realize the PbS advantage in infrared absorption.

Conclusions
In summary, through developing an aqueous-solution processed recombination layer of n-PEDOT/SnO2, we for the first time reported the preparation of stable and efficient tandem solar cells combining the emerging MAPbI3 perovskite with PbS colloidal QDs. By carefully adjusting the thickness of both subcells, a perfectly superposed Voc and an optimal PCE of 11.03% have been achieved, which is the highest reported PCE for QD based tandem solar cells. Unfortunately, the performance of our PbS/perovskite tandem cell is less efficient compared to the perovskite single-junction cell. However, we need to emphasize that this is the first report of a solution-processed two-terminal PbS/perovskite tandem cell. And the efficient recombination layer of n-PEDOT/SnO2 can produce a high Voc that perfectly matches the sum of that of the PbS (0.55 V) and perovskite (1.11 V) sub-cells, which will be extremely helpful for designing future solution-processed tandem solar cells. In addition, we found that the introduction of a PbS subcell can not only enhance the infrared absorption, but also effectively eliminate the hysteresis-effect in metal-halide perovskites. The PbS QDs/perovskite tandem device exhibits high UV stability and exceptional storage stability under a dry environment without encapsulation. Therefore, we revealed that the synergetic use of QDs and perovskite materials in a tandem structure can extend the range of device photo response and simultaneously deliver excellent device performance as well as improved stability. Moreover, our work will provide insight into the future design and processing of efficient QDs/perovskite tandem solar cells with more complementary absorption.
