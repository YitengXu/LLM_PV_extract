1. Introduction
The continuous increase in fossil-fuel-based energy consumption has caused a global environmental problem, while the development of clean and renewable energy resources is an effective approach to solve the energy supply issue in future.1–3 Solar energy is the largest and almost untapped energy source for earth.4–7 In particular, organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted increasing attention due to their unique advantages, including lightweight, mechanical flexibility, ease of fabrication and abundant raw materials compared to conventional solar cells.8,9
Among the vast library of OSCs, the widely investigated solar cells consist of a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure in which a polymeric or molecular donor is mixed with a fullerene derivative as an electron acceptor.7,8,10 Both donor and acceptor are blended together to form a bicontinuous interpenetrating system with large interfacial areas for efficient exciton dissociation. Nowadays, the BHJ structure has become the standard architecture to characterize organic solar cell materials.11,12 With that, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of BHJ solar cells has exceeded 10% in single-junction cells.13,14 In principle, in order to improve the PCE of single-junction cells, their open circuit voltage (Voc), short current circuit (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) should be enhanced. However, there is a tradeoff between the Voc and Jsc since both of them are limited by the energy levels of donors and acceptors. Thus, it is challenging to further enhance these single-junction cells due to insufficient photon harvesting of active layers with their relatively narrow absorption window. The organic materials in active layer only absorb photons whose energies are equal to or higher than their bandgap energies.7,15 Thus, a multi-junction architecture, namely, tandem solar cells, has been developed to achieve broader absorption and higher PCE.16,17 Tandem OSCs are composed of vertically piling multiple single-junction solar cells that are physically connected by an interfacial layer with a broader absorption band. The multiple subcells can be imperative to possess various absorbers capturing photons from visible light to the near-infra-red (NIR) region.17 Therefore, tandem solar cells can obviously decrease thermalization loss of photonic energy by their multiple subcells with complementary absorption bands, harvesting high and low energy photons in each subcell. Unfortunately, the fabrication of tandem OCSs is still challenging because it requires designing and optimizing each subcell to match the short circuit current from two subcells. In addition, the process to fabricate tandem OSCs is extremely complicated, which may limit research progress and industrialization prospect.16
In the past several years, researchers have demonstrated that organic ternary solar cells may be one of the promising candidates to achieve high efficiency since they contain the major merits of both single BHJ solar cells and tandem solar cells.18,19 Compared with binary OSCs, ternary systems present several advantages:20–23 (a) the third component in ternary systems can enhance photon harvesting of active layers through complementary absorption of donor:acceptor. (b) It also provides an enhanced efficient charge transfer and transport pathways, thereby providing a potentially effective approach to obtain high Jsc and thus high PCE performance. (c) The morphology of active layers may be improved with the third component to achieve appropriate phase separation by intermolecular interactions. (d) Ternary systems can also maintain simplicity of single active-layer fabrication conditions. (e) The same optimizing strategies of BHJ solar cells, such as adding additives, tuning the energy levels, adjusting the ratio of donors and acceptors, controlling the morphology etc., can be employed to further improve Voc, Jsc, and FF individually or simultaneously, thereby increasing the efficiency.21,23 To date, due to new developments in donor:acceptor materials and device fabrication techniques, ternary OSCs have rapidly developed as a new horizon in this field,20,21 and their PCEs have exceeded 10%.24,25
To date, several excellent reviews have summarized early work on ternary blend solar cells from different aspects.18–23 In this review, we intended to present the recent progress in organic ternary OSCs since 2015. The third additive composed of inorganic semiconductors such as quantum dots, nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes/graphene derivatives are not included in the scope of this review. We will begin with presenting the general rules of designing ternary OSCs. Furthermore, we will present a comprehensive review of the progress on different ternary systems including the D1:D2:A system and D:A1:A2 system. Finally, we will conclude with the summary and prospects on organic ternary solar cells.
2. Fundamental design rules for ternary blend OSCs
In general, ternary solar cells contain three components in the active layers: the dominant donor:acceptor (D:A) and the third component. Based on the functionality of the third component, ternary solar cells have been classified into three categories (Fig. 1a) the charge-transfer mechanism. The cascade-like energy levels or ternary system can facilitate charge separation and charge transfer at the host donor:acceptor interface due to the bridging effect to reduce the energy lose.26,27 Therefore, the third component functionalizes as a charge relay between the D:A materials. (b) The energy-transfer mechanism. Either a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) or a Dexter energy transfer occurred between the third component and the host donor:acceptor materials. The emission spectrum of the third component should show substantial overlapping with the absorption spectrum of the other materials. (c) The parallel-like or alloy model. The third component works as an individual hole/electron-transport channel or the third component and the host donor or acceptor materials electronically coupled into a new charge transfer state. Typically, there is no strict limitation to the energy level and bandgap for the third component as long as the driving force between the donor and acceptor is sufficient for exciton dissociation. Photoluminescence (PL) or transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) measurements are the most popular and convenient tools to study charge transfer and energy transfer as well as the parallel-like model between different materials. However, in reality, it is still common that these mechanisms are intertwined, namely, different processes occur in the same ternary solar cell. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement is useful to study the shared HOMO28 or LUMO29,30 of the donor alloy or the acceptor alloy. At the same time, using crystalline small molecules to form the donor alloy with conjugated polymers can facilitate face-on orientation crystallization of polymers which can enhance the hole mobility.31
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the mechanism in ternary solar cells: (a) charge-transfer mechanism, (b) energy-transfer mechanism and (c) parallel-like or alloy model. The arrows indicate the possible charge transfer and transport pathway. 
Although all three mechanisms are not precisely determined by the energy levels (HOMO and LUMO) and bandgap of the third component compared to the D:A system, the energy levels, as instinct properties of organic semiconductors, always play a significant role in interpreting the functionality of the third component in ternary solar cells. Organic ternary solar cells can be classified into two categories based on the energy levels of the third component: two donors:one acceptor (D1:D2:A) and one donor:two acceptors (D:A2:A1). In this paper, we will discuss the fundamental design rules for ternary blend OSCs in terms of these two donors:one acceptor (D1:D2:A) and one donor:two acceptors (D:A2:A1).
3. D1:D2:A
Donor materials in organic ternary solar cells have been widely studies during the past few years. In the early stage of the development of ternary OSCs, most studies were based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT, Fig. 2) as the host donor material, while PTBx and their derivatives (Fig. 4) have become the most popular ones recently. Besides, other high performance small molecules or polymers were also exploited as host donor materials. Hence this section is divided into three categories based on the composition of host donor materials: P3HT based systems, PTBx based systems, and other donor based systems.

3.1 P3HT based ternary systems
P3HT shows a strong absorption in the visible region from 400 to 600 nm but almost no absorption in other regions. As a result, the PCE of binary solar cells based on a blend of P3HT is limited to 5–6%, even though the external quantum efficiency (EQE) is as high as 80%.32,33 Many third components with photon absorption not only in the visible region but also in the near-IR region were incorporated into P3HT-based solar cells to improve light harvesting in the early studies of ternary OSCs.34–38
Small molecules have been used as the third component because they exhibit several advantages, including well-defined structures, ease of purification, and high-molecular precision. An et al.39 found that SMPV1 (A1 in Fig. 2), as the second electron donor, exhibited cascaded HOMO and LUMO energy levels between P3HT and PC71BM, which can energetically harvest more photons in the longer wavelength region. Voc increased due to the lower HOMO energy level by incorporating SMPV1, and Jsc and FF also enhanced upon forming better charge transport channels through the cascade-like energy level structure as well as suitable phase separation of donor:acceptor materials. The champion efficient of 4.06% was obtained on the basis of OSC devices with a 5 wt% SMPV1 doping ratio in the host donor, corresponding to 21.2% improvement compared with 3.35% PCE of binary solar cells. Another small molecule, p-DTS(FBTTH2)2 (A2 in Fig. 2), was reported by Hao et al. as a guest donor for P3HT:PC71BM systems.40 PL measurement suggested that the additives are preferably located at the P3HT:PC71BM interfaces, facilitating an efficient FRET and charge transfer process. Interestingly, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) data clearly showed that the guest donor benefits the vertical phase separation in the active layer, leading to an improvement in the exciton dissociation and charge extraction. As a result, 24% enhancement in the PCE of the ternary OSC was obtained compared to conventional binary OSCs due to the broad absorption spectrum of the active layer. A series of Zn-porphyrin and Zn-benzoporphyrin derivatives with phenyl, thiophenyl or bithiophenyl substitutes were explored by Thamyongkit and co-workers.41 Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements showed that all molecules possess relatively high energy levels, which can be used as electron donors in binary blends with PCBM as the acceptor, yielding low PCEs (less than 0.4%). However, the molecules can be used as efficient additives in P3HT:PCBM blends. As a result, Zn-TTBP (A3 in Fig. 2) based ternary solar cells exhibited the best performance among ternary solar cells with the maximum PCE of 4.3%. Conjugated polymers (CPs), particularly low bandgap polymers, can also be utilized as the third component in P3HT based ternary systems, because the complementary absorption band can strongly enhance the photon harvesting in the long wavelength range. Ito et al.42 used a low bandgap conjugated polymer PSBTB (Fig. 2, A4) as the third component in P3HT:PCBM systems. The A4 exhibits a strong absorption in the range from 650 nm to 800 nm, which was considered as an excellent complementary donor component to harvest more photons in the longer wavelength region for P3HT-based solar cells. Therefore, the ternary device showed almost full visible region absorption ranging from 400 to 800 nm, which is desirable for broad-band light harvesting in ternary OSCs. Two different P3HT materials with a region-regularity of >98% and 85% were employed to investigate the impact of P3HT crystallization on the photovoltaic effect in organic ternary systems. It was observed that higher crystalline P3HT with large crystalline domains would improve charge transport in ternary composites (Fig. 3). The low-bandgap polymer A4 between the crystalline P3HT domains and PCBM domains may effectively collect excitons from P3HT by energy transfer because of the large spectral overlap between the P3HT fluorescence and the A4 absorption. Both Jsc and FF were improved at a weight ratio of P3HT:A4:PCBM = 0.4:0.6:1, and hence the PCE reached 5.6%. As a result, a broad bandgap crystalline polymer and a low-bandgap amorphous polymer may be a suitable combination for highly efficient ternary OSCs.

Tang et al.43 reported another D–A structural polymer (PBDT-BTzQx-C12, A5 in Fig. 2) as a complementary absorber in P3HT:PC71BM ternary systems. When 2 wt% PBDT-BTzQx-C12 was incorporated into the ternary blend, the PCE of the ternary solar cells slightly increased from 3.18% to 3.54% in comparison to P3HT:PC71BM binary systems due to an extended absorption and cascaded energy levels formed in P3HT:PBDT-BTzQx-C12:PC71BM systems. The authors also developed a series of ultralow-bandgap polymers (1.03–1.10 eV) with absorption spectra beyond the near-infrared region (NIR).44 All polymers showed a low performance with a best PCE of 0.43% in binary OSCs. However, they can be used as additives into P3HT:PC71BM binary systems. For example, doping of 9 wt% PBDTT-TQxP (A6 in Fig. 2) led to a highest PCE of 3.58% for the resultant ternary solar cells, corresponding to ∼22% improvement in comparison to 2.93% PCE of P3HT:PC71BM binary blends. Thompson et al. carried out theoretical studies on the relationship between the miscibility of polymers in ternary systems and the efficiency of the devices based on P3HTT-DPP-10%:P3HT75-co-EHT25:PC61BM and P3HTT-DPP-10%:PCDTBT:PC61BM systems.45–48 The Flory–Huggins interaction parameter was introduced to quantify the interactions between the polymers in ternary systems. Furthermore, they presented a series of semicrystalline polymers (A7–A10 in Fig. 2).49 The DPP-based polymers exhibit a broad absorption (into the near-infrared region) complementary to the other P3HT-based random copolymers, which were used as the third component in ternary systems. Flory–Huggins interaction parameters were further narrowed down to be less than 0.167 for materials to exhibit tunable Voc in ternary solar cells. In that case, surface energy plays a critical role in the formation of organic alloys and can supersede the influence of crystallinity, the random copolymer effect, and HOMO/LUMO energy levels.
Thus, both small molecules and conjugated polymers can be employed as the third component for P3HT based OSCs, which may enhance the light absorption, tune the surface energy, and optimize the morphology, resulting in improved photovoltaic performances (Table 1).

3.2 PTBx based systems
PTB7 and its derivatives, referring to benzodithiophene (BDT) moieties connecting with fused thienothiophene (TT) rings, are widely used as donors in both binary and ternary OSCs. In 2009, Yu et al. first reported BDT-TT conjugated polymers,50 which started the great progress of the PTB family. Many efforts have been made to optimize structures of both the BDT moiety and TT moiety, resulting in a series of excellent donor polymers with different energy levels in the PTB family.51–54 To date, the efficiency of PTB polymer based OSCs has reached over 10%.
Ternary systems provided a great opportunity of achieving high PCE for PTBx-based conjugated polymers. Most systems presented here possess cascade-like energy levels which are beneficial for charge transport (Fig. 1a), while some exceptions with a broad bandgap to sensitize at short wavelengths will be summarized at the end of this part.
Incorporation of small molecules may improve the pathway for charge transport of ternary blend films due to their high crystallinity. Very recently, Wei et al.55 demonstrated highly efficient PBDTTT-C:PC71BM based OSCs with a PCE of 8.58% by incorporating a conjugated small-molecule (BDT-3T-CNCOO, B1 in Fig. 4) as the third component. The B1 with a strong absorption at 570 nm and 710 nm compensates for the light absorption of PBDTTT-C-T at short wavelengths, and the cascade-like energy levels of the ternary system may facilitate charge transfer at the donor:acceptor interface. In addition, the high crystallinity of small molecules B1 may drive the polymer PBDTTT-C-T to self-assemble to a fibrous structure in their ternary blend films. Resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) measurements show that hierarchical phase separation is composed of tunable BDT-3T-CNCOO:PC71BM domain size and pure PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM domains in the ternary blend films, which may balance the charge separation and charge transport in ternary devices. Similar to B1 structures, another highly crystalline small molecule (DCA3TBDTP, B2 in Fig. 4) based on 2D benzodithiophene was report by Yang and co-worker,56 which provides important guidelines to fabricate ternary solar cell devices by layer-by-layer methods. An obvious small molecule packing peak has been observed in the ternary blend thin film in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum. It is of interest that the B2 molecules are able to penetrate into the active layer of the ternary devices, enhancing the exciton dissociation and charge extraction process due to the crystalline domain of small molecules. Thus, a high PCE of 8.76% was obtained with a large Jsc of 17.24 mA cm−2. Another highly crystalline conjugated small molecule, 7,7′-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)-benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) (p-DTS(FBTTh2)2) (B3 in Fig. 4), exhibited an high PCE of 8.2% with a thick film of 130 nm in binary systems.57–59 When it has been added into a PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend film, the two miscible donors B3 and PTB7-Th form an alloy in the ternary blend.31 GIWAXS measurement showed that a highly crystalline and face-on preferential orientation of polymeric molecules was obtained due to the formation of an alloy structure (Fig. 5). In addition, the presence of B3 promotes the PTB7-Th rich phase, which enhances charge separation and transport and reduces charge recombination. The ternary OSC increased to 10.5% by adding a 15% weight ratio of crystalline conjugated molecules.

Russell and coworkers24 presented a PTB7-Th based ternary system through incorporating a small molecule DPPEZnP-THE (B4 in Fig. 4) with a low energy bandgap and long wavelength absorption in the near-IR region. As a result, the ternary blend film exhibits a broad absorption beyond 900 nm, enhancing the light absorption. Thus, ternary devices with an architecture of ITO/ZnO/PTB7:B4:PC71BM/MoO3/Al showed high PCEs up to 9.58%. To further reduce the charge recombination at the interface between the electrode and active layer, a new kind of photoconductive cathode interlayer (ZnO:PBI-H) was used for ternary devices, resulting in a PCE up to 11.03%.
High mobility molecules, such as TIPS-pentacene60 and rubrene61 (B5 and B6 in Fig. 4), were also incorporated into PTB7:PCBM devices to improve charge transport by Yu et al. The unique behavior of these high hole-mobility molecules is ascribed to their high crystallinities, which may help to localize the molecules at the interface of the blend systems. The addition of a small amount of TIPS-pentacene led to an increase in the PCE values of the PTB7:PCBM:B5 based ternary devices from 6.67% to 8.09%. Impedance spectroscopy measurement indicated that the incorporation of B5 increased the average lifetime of holes which was beneficial for hole transport in ternary blend films and hole collection at the anode. Similar improvements in P3HT:PCBM and PDPP3T:PCBM systems were obtained, indicating that the incorporation of B5 is a practicable method to improve the PCE of ternary OSCs. Simultaneously, an efficient fluorescent small molecule, rubrene, was utilized as the third component to facilitate charge transfer efficiency due to suitable energy cascade alignment. It was found that rubrene molecules favor to locate at the interface between PTB7 and PCBM, which facilitated charge separation of excitons. Thus, the short circuit current and fill factor were simultaneously enhanced, leading to a 21.7% improvement in PCE from 6.60% to 8.03%.
Besides small molecules, conjugated polymers can also be the used as guest donor materials in ternary OSCs. PSDT-TS1 (B7, in Fig. 4) and PTB7 having a similar bandgap and complementary absorption spectra were designated to fabricate efficient ternary organic solar cells with PC71BM as the acceptor.62 It was found that both B7 and PTB7 could be considered as a host or guest donor in their system. Through varying the weight ratio of donors, the optimal PCE (7.91%) of ternary OSCs was achieved, while the PCEs of PTB7:PC71BM blend and B7:PC71BM blend are 6.08% and 6.97%, respectively. The parallel-linkage structure was proposed because the two donors have similar chemical structures and excellent miscibility with PC71BM, and a bicontinuous interpenetrating network may be maintained in the ternary active layers.
Taylor et al.63 demonstrated P3HT and PTB7 blends as donors and PC71BM as an electron acceptor in ternary OSCs. An optimum PCE of 8.2% was obtained for the ternary OSCs with a 5 wt% P3HT doping ratio in the donor blend. A comparison of optical properties suggests that P3HT and PTB7 are complementary (Fig. 6), and FRET can occur between the two donors because optical, electronic, and spatial conditions of the polymer blend were suitable. The photodynamics of the blend films probed by time-resolved spectroscopy as well as transient absorption measurement demonstrated that P3HT is effective in transferring energy non-radiatively by inducing excitons and prolonging their overall lifetime in PTB7. Moreover, it was found that solvent vapor annealing by CHCl3 can optimize the morphology, thus increasing the charge transport, reducing interfacial recombination, and boosting the PCE to 8.7%.

Researchers paid a lot of attention to lowering the HOMOs of D:A copolymer blends through incorporating polymers with intermediate bandgaps as the third component into the dominating PTBx:PCBM systems because they may show relatively high Voc. PCDTBT (B8 in Fig. 4) with the absorption spectra in the region from 300 nm to 600 nm was used as the complementary material for the binary dominating system of PTBx:PCBM.64–68 The absorption band between 300 nm and 600 nm (peaks were at 400 nm and 570 nm) was ascribed to the presence of B8, since PTBx showed little absorption in this region. The first successful example of these systems was reported by Chand et al.64 The absorption band of PTB7 strongly overlaps with the emission band of B8 (680 nm). This suggested that B8 could transfer its energy to PTB7 in the overlap region by FRET (Fig. 7). The efficiency of optimized ternary OSCs reached 8.9% compared to 6.2% and 6.8% of B8:PC71BM and PTB7:PC71BM, respectively. Chand also investigated the relationship between the trap density and hole mobility in the same system by means of current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics at various temperatures.65 The measurement demonstrated that the hole mobility of the two-polymer blend thin film is 9.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is much higher than that of the single donor thin film. This can be attributed to the suppressed trap density in the PTB7:B8 blend film. They also found that shallow traps are located at a discrete energy level above the valence band edge. Therefore, the free carrier concentration is sufficient to fill all the traps in the ternary blend system. Xu and Tsang et al.66 studied the solvent effects on the same ternary system with PTB7:B8:PC71BM as the active layer. Through device engineering with different solvents, the optimum device shows a PCE of 7.81%, with a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 15.4 mA cm−2 and a FF of 66.7%.

In addition to fullerene acceptors, non-fullerene acceptors can also be used in PTBx:B8 systems. Ito et al.67 reported an all polymer ternary device with N2200 (B9 in Fig. 4) as an acceptor. The polymeric acceptor had suitable energy levels that can form a cascade energy heterojunction with PTBx:B8 systems. Therefore, excitons from B8 can be transported directly to both host donor (PTB7) and acceptor (B9) through long range FRET, leading to an increase in Jsc. Consequently, a PCE of 6.7% was obtained with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) over 60% in both the visible and near-infrared regions in the ternary blend film. Han et al.68 also investigated a PTBx:B8:B9 ternary system. Morphology studies demonstrated that the intermolecular interaction between PTB7-Th and B8 reduced the aggregation of PTB7-Th, thus decreasing domain sizes and enlarging interfacial areas. As a result, an optimum PCE of 5.11% was obtained with 15% B8 donor doping, almost 20% higher than that of control devices. Very recently, Li et al.69 initiated the study of highly crystalline polymer polythiophene derivative PBDD-ff4T (B10 in Fig. 4) as the third component in PTB7-Th:B9 blend films.
B10 showed a moderate bandgap and deep LUMO and HOMO energy levels, which is favorable for forming a smooth energy gradient between PTB7-Th and B9. Surface and bulk morphology studies (Fig. 8) exhibited that highly crystalline polymer PBDD-ff4T can obviously induce the crystallization of PTB7-Th because B10 can be fully embedded in PTB7-Th with a small amount doping (less than 30%). The ternary OSCs without any extra treatments exhibited an optimized PCE of 7.2% with 10 wt% B10.

Recently, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based copolymers have been incorporated into PTBx:PCBM based solar cells to improve light harvesting. Poly[2,5-bis(alkyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione-alt-dithienylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene] (PDPP-DTT, B11 in Fig. 4) and poly[2,5-bis(alkyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione-alt-5,50-di(thiophene-2-yl)-2,20-(E)-2-(2-(thiophen-2-yl)vinyl)thiophene] (PDVT-10, B12 in Fig. 4) are excellent semiconductors with hole mobilities more than 10 cm2 V−1 s−1.70–72 Yan et al.73 provided important guidelines to design efficient multi-donor OSCs. They added these two excellent polymers (B11 and B12) into PTB7:PCBM and PTB7-Th:PCBM systems. Although only a small amount of B11 (1 wt%) was added, the high mobility of B11 improved charge-carrier transport in the ternary blend films, leading to a remarkable increase of the PCE of PTB7:PC71BM-based OSCs from 7.58% to 8.33%. However, B12 is a better choice for PTB7-Th:PC71BM based OSCs. The average PCE increased from 8.75% to 10.08% with an addition of 0.5 wt%. Yang and co-workers also reported a series of donor polymers with different absorption bands and energy levels.74 Host donors such as P3HT, PTB7, PBDTTT-C, and two DPP-based polymers (B13 and B14 in Fig. 4) with distinct physical and chemical properties were blended together. It was found that the compatibility, namely, the molecular orientation and crystallinity of different blend donors, had tremendous influence on morphological traps and charge recombination. As a result, the blended donors of PTB7 and B14 with structural compatibility showed the best ternary OSC performance with a PCE of 8.7%. This example suggested that molecular ordering may be retained in compatible donor polymers, while the molecular stacking preferences and domain size would be disturbed in incompatible polymers, serving as morphological traps and recombination centers.
Conjugated polymers with broad bandgaps were employed for PTBx based ternary solar cells to extend the light absorption of the active layer since PTBx polymers possess relative small bandgaps. A broad bandgap polymer poly-3-oxothieno[3,4-d]isothiazole-1,1-dioxide/benzodithiophene (PID2, B15 in Fig. 4) was used as the third component for PTB7:PC71BM ternary solar cells by Yu et al.75,76 The compound B15 showed a strong absorption from 400 nm to 650 nm (Fig. 9), resulting in the absorption enhancement at short wavelengths in blend films. Not surprisingly, PBT7:PC71BM with 10% B15 content afforded a PCE of 8.22% after optimization of the morphology of the blend films,75 and an efficient ternary OSC with a PCE of 9.2% was obtained with incorporation of 20% B15 into a PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend film.76

PDBT-T1 (B16 in Fig. 4) is another broad bandgap polymer with a high PCE of 9.74% in binary solar cell systems.77 Later, Sun and co-workers used this polymer as a complementary material for a PTB7-Th:PC71BM matrix for harvesting more photons in the short wavelength range.78 The incorporation of B16 improved the crystallinity and the face-on orientation due to its highly crystalline nature. The device with a 20% B16 content in the ternary blend showed a high PCE of 10.2% due to the synergistic effects of enhanced light absorption and charge transport, improved charge generation, and optimal morphology.
Ameri et al. reported a Si-bridged polymer (Si-PCPDTBT, A4 in Fig. 2) as the third component to improve the performance of PTB7:PCBM based OSCs.17 Interestingly, A4 showed a higher LUMO energy levels than PTB7 that allowed the transfer of charges from the host donor polymer to the highly ordered guest polymer. With this design rule, the ternary solar cells showed an extremely high FF of 77%, indicating that the recombination limitations of PTB7:PC71BM can be prevailed. Finally, a high PCE of 8.6% was obtained for the optimized ternary solar cells.
Obviously, various small molecules and conjugated polymers have been used as the guest components for PTB7 based OSCs to improve their photovoltaic performances due to different mechanisms, including facilitating the charge transport through forming cascade energy levels, absorbing complementary light with broad bandgap polymers, and tuning morphology with highly crystalline materials.
3.3 Other D1:D2:A ternary systems
In addition to P3HT and PTBx polymers, many highly efficient polymers and small molecules have been developed for ternary systems. Chu et al.79 used a DPP-based small molecule (SMD, C1 in Fig. 10) and a benzodithiophene-based molecule (BDT6T, C2 in Fig. 10) as donor blends and PCBM as an acceptor for ternary solar cells. The complementary absorption of BDT6T and C1 enhanced the light absorption and increased the Jsc of ternary solar cells. Furthermore, addition of BDT6T strengthened the crystallization of C1 in the active layer and improved the morphology. As a result, the PCE of the optimized devices reached 6.3%, which is 37% higher than that of the binary system. Two thiophene-based small molecules (C3 and C4 in Fig. 10) have been reported by Deng and colleagues.28 The two compatible donors may form an alloy state due to their similar molecular structures, which can simultaneously have the advantages of the two small molecules. Upon optimization, ternary OSC devices showed a PCE of 10.16%, much higher than that of each binary system.
 Fig. 10  Chemical structures of representative organic materials used in ternary solar cells. 
Highly crystalline thiophene-based small molecules were also employed as the third components for polymer:PCBM binary OSCs. Wei et al. reported a novel small molecule (BDT-3T-CNCOO, C6 in Fig. 10) for polymeric binary systems.80 The three materials in blend films showed a cascade-like energy level that can reduce the charge transfer barrier by decreasing the recombination of photo-generated holes and electrons. The ternary thin film demonstrated an enhanced absorption compared to C6-based binary systems in the short wavelength range and a stronger absorption than polymer-based binary systems in the long wavelength range, resulting in a higher EQE in the ternary system. In addition, appropriate crystallinity and domain size were realized due to the synergistic effect of small molecules and polymers. Finally, the optimized ternary OSCs delivered a PCE of 8.40%, with a Voc of 0.969 V, a Jsc of 12.17 mA cm−2, and a FF of 71.23% at a 40% content of small molecules. Another small molecule SMPV1 (A1) was also introduced as the third component for polymer solar cells because of its broad bandgap and short wavelength absorption relative to Si-PCPDTBT (A4).81 The complementary absorption of the small molecule and polymer boosted photon harvesting in the visible light range in the active layer (Fig. 11). Effective energy transfer from A1 to A4 and balanced charge carrier transport of the ternary active layer lead to an excellent efficiency of 5.73%, much higher than that of the binary system (4.89%). Upon solvent vapor annealing with CHCl3, the champion PCE further increased to 6.44%.

Besides thiophene-based small molecules, squaraine-based small molecules were also widely used as both host and guest donor materials in ternary OSCs. Taylor et al.82 reported ternary solar devices based on two different squaraine donors, an asymmetrical squaraine (ASSQ, 2,4-bis-[(N,N-diisobutylamino)-2,6-dihydroxyphenyl]-4-(4-diphenyliminio)squaraine, C7 in Fig. 10) and a symmetrical squaraine (DIB-SQ, 2,4-bis-4-[(N,N-diisobutylamino)-2,6-dihydroxyphenyl]squaraine, C8 in Fig. 10). FRET can easily occur due to a severe overlap between the emission of C7 and the absorption of C8 at 690 nm, and the efficiency of energy transfer can reach as high as 85% at optimal blending. Thus, ternary blend OSCs generally performed better than devices based on one squaraine dye. When the C7 were replaced by thiophene-based small molecules (SMPV1, A1 in Fig. 2), the PCE can be further improved to 7.40%.83 A synergetic effect on the phase separation, crystallinity and charge carrier mobility of active layers supported the PCE improvement in ternary OSCs when 10 wt% C8 was doped in an A1:PC71BM binary system.
Squaraine-based small molecules were used as the third component for high performance polymer solar cells due to their intense absorption in the long wavelength region. Zhang84 and co-workers reported a new ternary system with a ladder type polymer (PIDTDTQx, C9 in Fig. 10) as the host donor and C8 as the additive. C8 can enhance the photon harvesting in the range from 650 nm to 720 nm and the charge transfer between C9 and C8 is dynamically favorable, which is beneficial to exciton dissociation. As a result, the ternary OSCs with a 9 wt% C8 doping ratio in donors showed a champion PCE of 6.49%, 18.6% improvement compared to that of C9:PC71BM based binary OSCs. Furthermore, C8 was employed as the third component for low bandgap polymer Si-PCPDTBT (A4) based organic solar cells.85 The PCE of ternary OSCs increased from 5.52% to 6.18% by doping 3 wt% C8, which was attributed to the enhancement of photon harvesting and exciton utilization efficiency.
Ternary blends composed of two DPP-based absorbers with complementary absorptions can provide an opportunity of enhancing the short-circuit current. Jo et al.86 presented a DPP-based polymer (PTDPP2T, C10 in Fig. 10) and small molecule ((TDPP)2Ph, C11 in Fig. 10) as donors and PC71BM as an acceptor for ternary solar cells. Jsc showed an obvious increase in the ternary blend solar cells, which was mainly attributed to additional absorption of C11 in the range of 550–700 nm. Interestingly, the ternary blend with 10 wt% C11 exhibited a well-developed morphology with narrow-sized fibrils (Fig. 12), indicating that the film morphology and the compatibility of the ternary blend are importance factors to achieve high-performance ternary solar cells.

Ladder-type polymers have been developed for not only binary BHJ devices but also ternary systems. By tuning the conjugated unit through introducing heteroatoms, together with combining different electron withdrawing acceptor units, both the energy levels and physicochemical properties of ladder-type polymers can be finely tailored.87 Zhou et al. reported a series of ladder-type polymers with different energy levels for ternary OSCs.88 When different ladder polymers with distinct absorption bands were blended together, they can enable effective manipulation of light harvesting and tune the amorphous nature of the ladder-type polymers. Consequently, the PCE of ternary OSCs based on PIDTT-DFBT-TT (C12):PIDSe-DFBT (C13):PC71BM at a blending ratio of 0.5:0.5:3 reached 8.09%. Ameri et al. reported a 6% efficiency of ternary OSCs with Si-PCPDTBT (A4) as a dominating donor and indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene, 2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline (PIDTTQ, C9) as the third component.89 It should be noted that the ternary devices showed a negative effect under 1 sun conditions with an overall efficiency of 3.6% due to a diminished Voc (0.64 V) and FF (52%), which was ascribed to their deleterious morphology. Further study showed that a strong sensitization effect combined with reduced charge recombination at low light levels can effectively overcome the morphological limitations. Therefore, the ternary OSCs delivered a PCE of 6.1% at 0.01 sun, evidently surpassing the best PCE of the C9:PC71BM binary blend.
Two-donor systems based on the same polymeric backbone but different side chains or substituted groups attracted great attention since the similar conjugated structures may improve the structural compatibility and minimize the morphological disruption of the binary blend solar cells. Kim et al.90 demonstrated high-performance ternary blend OSCs by adding PPDT2CNBT (C15 in Fig. 10) into PPDT2FBT (C14 in Fig. 10):PC71BM binary blends. The two polymers C14 and C15 possess the same backbone but different substituent groups as shown in Fig. 10. These two polymers had complementary absorption bands. Even though the two donor polymers showed a cascade energy level and similar backbones, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) indicated that the two polymers are not electronically homogeneous and function as discrete light harvesting species. Therefore, charge carrier transport in the ternary OSCs followed parallel-like behavior. Optimized ternary blend devices achieved a PCE of 9.5%, via simultaneous improvements in the Jsc and Voc without any loss in the fill factor. Side-chain engineering strategies were also introduced into ternary solar cells. Huang et al.91 presented a novel conjugated polymeric additive PBTA-Py (C17 in Fig. 10) with a benzodithiophene-alt-benzo[1,2,3]triazole backbone and a polar pyridyl side-chain-terminal group. Contact angle experiments demonstrated that the C17 films exhibited higher surface energy than the pristine film of PBTA-BO (C16 in Fig. 10), resulting in better miscibility of C17 and PC71BM. Therefore, the charge transfer between the electron donating polymer and PC71BM can be further enhanced because of the weak supramolecular interactions between the N-atom in the pyridine unit and the PC71BM. The PCE was obviously enhanced from 4.96% to 6.48% by virtue of the improved current density. Thereafter, the pyridyl side-chain-terminal group was replaced by a more polar terminal group, pentafluorothiophenyl (PBTA-FPh, C18) by the same group.92 The new polymer showed a similar bandgap but deeper HOMO/LUMO energy levels in comparison to C17. The thin film exhibited a percolated network with fibrous features upon doping with only 0.02% of the polar additive. Thus, the PCE of the ternary solar cells was further improved to 7.91%. Choi et al.93 also reported two isoindigo-based copolymers with bithiophen-2-yl-ethene (IIDT) (C19 in Fig. 10) and biselenophen-2-yl-ethane (IIDS) (C20 in Fig. 10) as the structurally similar donor moieties. The morphology of the active layer was improved due to the good miscibility between two polymers in the ternary blend system. As a result, the ternary OSCs showed an enhanced PCE of 5.13% with a high short circuit current of 13.23 mA cm−2.
4. D:A2:A1
In the past two years, a large number of highly efficient acceptor materials have been developed including fullerene derivatives and non-fullerene materials. These electron-accepting materials can also be used as the third component in ternary OSCs. Most of these molecules had different LUMO and HOMO levels from host acceptors, resulting in a cascade energy heterojunction with the donor and acceptor.
Fullerene derivatives with different chemical modifications have be widely used as the third component for high performance ternary solar cells. Replacing PCBM with fullerene alloys is a new strategy to enhance the efficiency of OSCs. Indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA), used extensively as the third component in ternary solar cells, increased the Voc and decreased the energy loss of charge transfer because of its higher LUMO energy than that of PCBM. Chu et al.94 illustrated a high performance ternary system with a multithiophene-based molecule (BDT6T, C2 in Fig. 10) as the donor and two different fullerenes (PCBM and ICBA) as acceptors. Voc significantly increased due to the higher mixed LUMO energy level by incorporating ICBA and Jsc could also increase by forming better charge transport channels through the cascade energy levels as well as suitable phase separation of donor:acceptor materials. The optimum PCE of ternary devices reached 6.36% with incorporation of 15% ICBA relative to PC71BM. Krebs et al.95 also fabricated ternary devices with PCBM and ICBA as acceptors and P3HT as a donor. Cross-polarization magic-angle spinning solid-state NMR measurement demonstrated that the mixed fullerenes formed an alloy and the system exhibited pseudo-binary phase behavior in the ternary blends. A PCE of 2.37% was achieved under optimized conditions, higher than the PCEs of both P3HT:PC61BM blend and P3HT:ICBA blend. Hou and co-workers96 have demonstrated efficient ternary OSCs featuring ICBA as the cascade acceptor in PTB7:PC71BM blends. High-boiling solvent 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) was also added into a binary chlorobenzene (CB)/1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) solvent mixture to form a ternary solvent system, which provided a new pathway for charge transfer from the PTB7 polymer to the PC71BM:ICBA alloy. An encouraging PCE of 7.65% was achieved for this ternary blend, which was the highest value ever reported for an ITO-free inverted polymer solar cell. Zhan et al. employed five different classical donor polymers (PTB7, PBDTTT-C, PTB7-Th, PDBT-T1, and PThBDTP) to fabricate OSC devices in order to study the generality of the alloy acceptor ICBA:PC71BM.30 The LUMO energy level of alloy acceptors (15% ICBA and 85% PC71BM) was −3.85 eV, which was located between those of ICBA (−3.71 eV) and PC71BM (−3.88 eV). After device optimization, the PCEs of all five ternary blends with the alloy acceptor were enhanced by a factor of 12–14% in comparison to those with single acceptors. Most importantly, after heating at 130 °C for 120 min, all five ternary devices with the alloy acceptors showed much better stability than PC71BM-based binary OSCs. As a result, PTB7-Th based solar cells show the best performance with a PCE of 10.5%. Thus, the alloy acceptor exhibited excellent generality, high efficiency, and good stability, which can be alternative to PCBM. Bis-adduct of PCBM (bis-PCBM) was another excellent acceptor with high LUMO energy levels and amorphous nature, which can be also used as a third component for P3HT:PCBM based OSCs.97 The mixed phase of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):fullerene can be tuned upon varying the ratio of two fullerenes (PC71BM and bis-PC71BM) due to their different miscibility with P3HT. A PCE of 2.70% was achieved after optimizing the ratio of two fullerene-based acceptors. Various non-fullerene acceptor materials have been developed for OSCs and their PCEs have been rapidly improved to be comparable to those of fullerene-based OSCs. Combining non-fullerene acceptors and fullerene derivatives together for ternary OSC devices may be a promising strategy to achieve high performance OSCs. Hou et al.25 demonstrated PBDB-T:IT-M (D1 in Fig. 13) based ternary OSCs with a record high PCE of 12.2% by introducing bis-PC71BM as the third component. Bis-PC71BM showed a complementary optical absorption in the short wavelength region from 380 to 550 nm. Moreover, the addition of bis-PC71BM into a binary BHJ blend did not affect its phase separation morphology, which was more effective for the diffusion of excitons at the PBDB-T:bis-PC71BM and PBDB-T:D1 blend interface. Bo98 and co-worker reported another example of PC71BM as the third component for non-fullerene binary systems. Herein, PC71BM was used to preserve the good electron-transport ability in ternary blends. While the non-fullerene acceptor, indacenodithieno[3,2-b]-thiophene endcapped with 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene) malononitrile groups (ITIC, D3 in Fig. 13), could extend the light absorption, forming the cascade-like energy level alignment among these three materials, which was beneficial for charge transfer. Consequently, by means of synergistically combining the merits of PC71BM and ITIC, a maximum PCE of 10.4% for ternary OSCs was achieved (Table 2).

Our group29 presented a novel non-fullerene small molecule, TPE-4PDI (D4 in Fig. 4), as the third component to tune carrier generation, transportation and collection in PTB7-Th:PC71BM blends. D4 showed a high efficiency in charge dissociation and transportation, and the ternary OSC exhibits a high PCE of 10.4%, with a Voc of 0.79 V, a Jsc of 18.9 mA cm−2, and a FF of 74.7% upon 3% TPE-4PDI doping. Further studies showed that the Voc had a nearly linear dependence on the ratio of TPE-4PDI acceptors, which demonstrated that the total electron density of states of unit mass is a significant parameter influencing the Voc of ternary systems. This discovery may be an important guideline of designing novel acceptors to tune the photovoltaic performances. Yang et al.99 reported an n-type polymer P(NDI2OD-T2) (D5 in Fig. 13) to simultaneously improve the performance of OSCs based on PTB7 and PTB7-Th polymers. A high PCE of 10.1% was obtained with a small amount (0.8 wt%) of high molecular weight D5 in PTB7:PC71BM systems. And the optimized PTB7-Th:PC71BM device with the same amount polymer additive further achieved a notable PCE of 11.6%, together with enhanced thermal stability. Most importantly, a high PCE of 5.66% for ITO-free flexible PET substrate-based OSCs was achieved, which facilitated the practical application of photovoltaic technologies.
Non-fullerene ternary blend OSCs were developed with a semiconducting conjugated copolymer (PDBT-T1) as the donor and two different non-fullerene (ITIC-Th, D6 and SdiPBI-Se, D7 in Fig. 13) acceptors.100 The three materials show different absorption spectroscopic bands covering the entire visible spectrum (Fig. 14). Morphology studies demonstrated that SdiPBI-Se and ITIC-Th were miscible, with reduced crystallinity while maintaining good transport features. As a result, the champion solar cell shows a high PCE of 10.3%, with a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 15.40 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 71.3%.

Recently, McCulloch and coworkers101 reported that high-performance ternary blends through addition of a strongly absorbing small molecule acceptor D8 into a P3HT:D9 blend increases the device efficiency up to 7.7% without any solvent additives. Another ternary blend based on PBDTTT-EFT:D8:D9 also leads to solar cells with an efficiency of 11.0%, which was the highest efficiency for non-fullerene ternary solar cells. The improvement is attributed to changes in the microstructure and improved light harvesting across the visible region.
Near-IR dye molecules have also been introduced into ternary OSCs. Ito et al.102 presented a class of silicon phthalocyanine derivatives (SiPc) (Fig. 15) with two different axial ligands for P3HT:PCBM solar cells. Three ternary blends of P3HT, PCBM, and SiPc dyes showed cascade-like energy levels in both HOMO and LUMO (PCBM < SiPc dyes < P3HT) with offset energies of >0.2 eV, which are sufficient for the exciton separation (Fig. 15). The asymmetrical heterostructured SiPcBz6 suits for the selective loading at the interface with high dye concentrations and hence can enhance the PCE performance by ≈30% compared with binary blends. Another porphyrin zinc-based low bandgap small molecule 5,15-bis(2,5-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-3,6-di-thienyl-2-yl-2,5-dihydro-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione-50-yl-ethynyl)-10,20-bis(4-octyloxy-phenyl)-porphyrin zinc (DPPEZnP-O, D10 in Fig. 13) was incorporated into PTB7 and PC71BM solar cells.103 The D8 molecule showed an intense absorption in the long wavelength range (from 650 nm to 910 nm) compared to the absorption of PTB7. Therefore, the better spectroscopic response of the ternary blends can harvest more photons in the visible and the near infrared region to generate more carriers in the ternary layers. By optimizing the ratio of DPPEZnP-O, a PCE of 8.39% was achieved with a Jsc of 17.22 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.72 V and a FF of 67.65% for the ternary blends.

Zhan et al.104 presented a series of electron transporting materials, Bphen, BCP and TPBI (D11–D13 in Fig. 13), as the third component to fabricate ternary blend OSCs. The XPS data demonstrated that Bphen spontaneously accumulates onto the ITO surface prior to PTB7:PC71BM during spin coating, thereby forming a thin buffer interface between the active layer and the cathode due to H-bonding between N atoms in pyridine and hydroxyl groups on the ITO surface. The buffer layer separates the photoactive layer from the cathode, and thereby reduces charge recombination. As a result, the device showed a PCE of 5.35%, much higher than that of the device with PTB7:PC71BM (3.43%).
5. Conclusions
In summary, organic ternary solar cells provide an important strategy to improve the efficiency and ease the device fabrication because they contain the major advantages of both single binary solar cells and tandem solar cells. The PCE values of ternary OSCs have reached as high as 12%, showing great potential for achieving high performance and realizing industrialization production. The third component may be involved in different physical processes, such as light absorption and exciton generation, exciton diffusion and dissociation, and charge transport and collection. Therefore, the third component can be used as a guest donor or acceptor with multiple functionalities. (1) Broaden and strengthen the light absorption. The third component with complementary light absorption of the dominating donor or acceptor materials can enhance the absorption of the active layer, resulting in an increase of Jsc. (2) Increase the charge transfer and charge transport in the active layer. The cascade-like energy level alignment has shown unique effects on charge transfer and charge transport, which has been demonstrated by many groups based on both D1:D2:A and D:A2:A1 systems. In addition, high mobility materials with high crystallinity are beneficial for charge transport in the ternary blends. (3) Facilitate the charge collection and reduce charge recombination at the electrodes. The third component, as a hole or electron buffer layer, can partially separate the donor and the acceptor layer, thereby reducing charge recombination.105 (4) Improve the film morphology. The third component may show a suitable miscibility with both host donor and acceptor which can improve the morphology of the active layer. Moreover, some doping materials can suppress the aggregation of fullerene derivatives, thus improving the stability of the devices.30
In order to develop ternary solar cells to achieve high performance and commercially available products, some fundamental issues still need to be further clarified. (a) Design and synthesize novel materials, especially acceptor materials, with high absorption coefficient and mobility. The success of ternary devices mostly focused on the combination of two donors and PCBM, while ternary systems with non-fullerene acceptors still lagged due to the limitation of high-performance acceptor materials. (b) Rationally tune the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the third component. In general, the cascade energy level can be beneficial for charge transfer in the ternary systems. (c) High-mobility dopants with high crystallinity may increase charge transport efficiency. (d) Employ some supper-molecular techniques to improve the morphology of the active layers. In general, the suitable phase separation can promote both the Jsc and Voc. (e) Improve the stability of the device. The third component can be used to improve photochemical stability and morphology stability, which is as important as PCE for industrial mass production. All of these strategies can be employed to enhance the efficiencies of OSCs. The fast development of ternary OSCs will provide an attractive opportunity for energy conversion, given the merits of processing ease, mechanical flexibility, and lightweight.
