    , Accepted 15th October 2012First published on 29th October 2012AbstractWe report a simple, effective approach to modifying two kinds of D–A type polymers; copolymerization with thiophene containing tris(thienylenevinylene) (TTV) conjugated side chain. The resulting copolymers, TTV1 and TTV2, showed significant improvement (25% and 43%) of power conversion efficiency in comparison to the original polymers. The short-circuit current of TTV2 reached 22.6 mA cm−2 that is the highest record for organic photovoltaic devices to date. This design strategy opens up a new possibility to modify the existing D–A type photovoltaic polymers for better performance.

Broader context
The synthesis of donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating copolymers has been a successful approach for developing new materials for polymer solar cells (PSCs). However, designing materials by combining donors and acceptors is rapidly reaching its limits. Therefore, new strategies for improving photovoltaic performance are urgently required. Here we propose the introduction of a tris(thienylenevinylene) (TTV) conjugated side chain into D–A copolymers as a simple and effective alternative approach. Our approach significantly improved the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of two types of polymers over the whole absorption range, and increased the PSC power conversion efficiency by 25% and 43%. The short circuit current density of the devices, based on a near-infrared (NIR) responsive polymer, was 22.6 mA cm−2 under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5 illumination, which is the highest reported for PSCs. This approach could provide a new method for designing high-performance D–A photovoltaic polymers.

In the past decade, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention as a potential renewable energy source because they are cheap, lightweight, easy to produce, and can be used in large, flexible devices.1–6 A mixed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure, which consists of a conjugated polymer as an electron donor and a fullerene derivative as an electron acceptor, produces high power conversion efficiency (PCE) in PSCs.7 After poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)-based PSCs in the early days reached their limit of the performance due to the wide band gap of 1.9 eV and thus relatively a low short circuit current (JSC) of ∼10 mA cm−2,8,9 recent studies have focused on synthesizing novel semiconducting polymers with superior light absorption and charge separation. Alternating electron donor (D) and acceptor (A) building blocks in the polymer backbone is a promising strategy for designing photovoltaic polymers with improved absorption spectra. The properties of D–A type polymers can be fine-tuned by varying the electron-donating and -withdrawing characteristics of the D and A building blocks, respectively. Several D–A photovoltaic polymers have been synthesized, and the highest reported PCE is greater than 7–8%.10–14
Current D–A type photovoltaic polymer design strategies include (1) synthesizing novel building blocks or combinations of building blocks, (2) introducing π-spacers for D–π–A polymers,15 (3) optimizing the alkyl side chains to balance the crystallinity and solubility, and (4) introducing substituents, for example fluorine, to tune the energy levels.16 However, designing new materials by these methods is rapidly reaching its limits. Therefore, new effective strategies to modify the existent D–A type photovoltaic polymers for higher performance are urgent but challenging.
In this study, we adopt an alternative approach for designing D–A polymers by “doping” with a conjugated side chain. We synthesized a monomer of 2,5-dibromothiophene with a tris(thienylenevinylene) (TTV) side chain at the 3-position and introduced it into D–A type polymers by copolymerization with small ratios. Li et al. have previously attempted to introduce π-conjugated side chains into P3HT derivatives and have investigated the structure–property relationship in PSCs. However, the PCEs remained relatively low.17,18
To investigate the effect of the conjugated side chain on the properties of D–A type photovoltaic polymers, two D–A photovoltaic polymers, P1 and P2, were used as the base materials (Scheme 1). P1 is a alternating copolymer of benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD). P1 has a medium band gap of ∼1.8 eV and a relatively high PCE in BHJ PSCs.19–22P2 is a copolymer of dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP)23,24 and pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP) with thiophene as a π-spacer. It has a very narrow band gap of ∼1.1 eV.25 Some of the TPD (P1) or DPP (P2) units were replaced with thiophene containing TTV units to give the corresponding copolymers, denoted as TTV1 and TTV2, respectively.
 Scheme 1  The chemical structures of the two D–A polymers (P1 and P2) and the corresponding polymers with the conjugated side chain (TTV1 and TTV2). 

P1 and P2 were synthesized via Pd(PPh3)4-catalyzed Stille coupling between the bisstannyl compound corresponding to the electron-rich building block (BDT or DTP) and the dibromo derivative of the electron-deficient segment (TPD or DTDPP) (Scheme S1†). TTV1 and TTV2 were synthesized in a similar manner, besides a 1:4 mixture of dibromothiophene with the TTV side chain and the electron-deficient unit (TPD or DTDPP) was used. All four polymers were soluble in CHCl3, but only partially soluble in chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) at room temperature. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) was between 18.2 × 103 and 28.3 × 103, and the polydispersity index (PDI) was between 1.54 and 2.04 for the four polymers.
The absorption spectra of the four polymers are compared to investigate the effect of the introduction of TTV side chain on their electronic properties. As shown in Fig. 1 for the films, in both pairs of polymers, the absorption edge in the long wavelength regions did not change after the introduction of the TTV side chains, indicating that the polymer band gaps were not affected (∼1.8 eV for P1 and TTV1 and ∼1.1 eV for P2 and TTV2). There were slight improvements in absorptions at 400–500 nm, which could be attributed to the absorption of the TTV side chains (see Fig. S1† for the absorption of the TTV monomer unit). The unchanged absorption edges upon the introduction of TTV were also observed for the solutions in CHCl3 in both pairs of polymers (see Fig. S1†), although the difference of the absorption peaks in the shorter wavelength was more significant between TTV1 and P1. This is probably because the bulky conjugated side chain disrupted the planar conformation of TTV1 in the solution.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the D–A polymers was performed to investigate the effect of the conjugated side chain on the energy levels. The HOMO energy levels were calculated based on the onset values of oxidation: −5.39 eV for P1, −5.39 eV for TTV1, −4.90 eV for P2 and −4.86 eV for TTV2 respectively (Fig. S2†). The LUMO energy levels of the four polymers were estimated as −3.59 eV, −3.57 eV, −3.63 eV and −3.56 eV respectively. These results indicate that introducing the TTV side chains has no obvious effects on the energy levels of the frontier orbitals in the polymers. This is consistent with the absorption spectra.
The BHJ PSCs were fabricated with P1, TTV1, P2, and TTV2. The device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC70BM/Ca/Al. When CHCl3 was used as a solvent, all four polymers exhibited poor photovoltaic performance with PCEs of 1.67–1.99% (see Table S1†). The morphology of the blend films observed by an atomic force microscope (AFM) showed large granular domains over 100 nm in size, suggesting that the interface between the polymers and PC70BM was poor (Fig. 2). The coarse phase separation of these blend films at least partially explains the low JSC and PCE.

It has been reported that 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO)26,27 or DCB additives28,29 can improve the film quality of BHJ films and thus enhance the photovoltaic performance. We optimized the type and amount of additive for the four polymers; the J–V curves of the best BHJ devices under AM1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 3. The open circuit voltage (VOC), JSC, fill factor (FF) and PCE data are summarized in Table 1. The AFM images of the blend films of the four combinations (Fig. 2) showed that the uniformity of the films was better on this scale. This may be because of the good solubility of PC70BM in the high boiling point additives (DIO or DCB) and the improvement in the miscibility of the polymer and PC70BM. The PCE of the devices was significantly enhanced by the additives. The PSCs based on P1:PC70BM fabricated from CHCl3 with 3% DIO had a VOC of 0.80 V, JSC of 10.12 mA cm−2, FF of 0.63, and PCE of 5.14%. These data are comparable with the photovoltaic results reported for P1:PC70BM (PCE of 4.1–5.5%).19–22 With the TTV side chain, the TTV1:PC70BM device had a VOC of 0.78 V, JSC of 12.20 mA cm−2, FF of 0.68, and PCE of 6.46%. JSC and FF showed significant improvements, which contributed to the 25% increase in the PCE compared with that of the P1:PC70BM devices. A 43% improvement in the PCE was observed for the TTV2:PC70BM device compared with the P2:PC70BM device. In particular, JSC increased from 17.55 mA cm−2 to 22.65 mA cm−2 after the TTV side chains were introduced, which is the highest JSC reported for a PSC to date. The PCE of the TTV2:PC70BM devices reached 5%, which is also a large improvement for ultralow band gap polymers with absorption spectra extending to a wavelength of 1 μm.30

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) plots of the four best devices under monochromatic light are shown in Fig. 4. The introduction of TTV side chains improved the EQE in the TTV absorption region (400–500 nm) and over the whole polymer absorption region. The TTV1:PC70BM systems showed a similar spectrum with a higher EQE at 400–650 nm. The highest EQE was 70%, which was much higher than that of the P1:PC70BM blend (∼55%). The improvement in EQE over the whole absorption region was also observed for the TTV2:PC70BM system compared with the P2:PC70BM system. Because the absorption spectrum of TTV2 was broad and better matched to the solar spectrum, the improvement in JSC under simulated AM1.5 illumination was greater than that of TTV1.
 Fig. 4  EQE curves of PSCs based on the four polymers. The normalized AM1.5 photon flux spectrum is also shown for comparison. 
The mismatch factor of the Xe-based AM1.5 solar simulator meant that there was an error in the JSC values, even though the light intensity was calibrated with a standard Si solar cell and an optical filter. The experimental JSC measured under simulated AM1.5 illumination and JSC calculated by integrating the EQE and the actual AM1.5 solar spectra were compared. The JSC values calculated from the EQE spectra were less than the measured JSC values by 3.3% (P1), 5.2% (TTV1), 12.6% (P2), and 9.6% (TTV2). This discrepancy could also be caused by device degradation during measurements in air, because calcium was used as the electrode. The larger errors for the latter two measurements could also arise from the larger spectral mismatch in the NIR region between the simulated and actual AM1.5 spectra.
Finally, we will discuss possible explanations for the improved EQE response. The UV-vis absorption spectra and CV measurements showed that the difference in the energy structures of the polymers with and without the TTV side chains was very small. There was little difference in the absorption intensity and the PSC spectra for P1:PC70BM and TTV1:PC70BM, and for P2:PC70BM and TTV2:PC70BM (Fig. S3†), indicating that the optical thickness of the devices did not explain the improvement. The AFM images of the BHJ films were similar for the four polymers (Fig. 3), which suggests that the mixing morphology was similar on this scale. However, morphological change in the mixed films on a molecular level cannot be excluded as a possible reason for the improvement in performance.
The substitution of the TTV side chains could also affect the charge mobility in BHJ films. The hole mobility of the four polymers was measured by using a field-effect transistor (FET) to investigate the effect of the TTV side chain. The typical transfer curves of FET devices are shown in Fig. S4† and the data are summarized in Table S2.† The highest mobility was estimated as 4.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P1, 8.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TTV1, 4.6 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P2, and 1.7 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TTV2. The mobility of TTV1 was one order of magnitude higher than that of P1, although TTV2 showed a slightly lower mobility compared to P2. The FET mobility may not be directly related to the charge transport process in PSCs, because the charge transport is different; the effect of introducing the TTV side chains into P1 and P2 was small and not consistent, which suggests that the charge mobility was not the main reason for the improvement. This is also consistent with the fact that the major difference in the photovoltaic performance was caused by the improvement in JSC, not FF. Therefore, we could speculate that the introduction of the TTV side chain improves the charge separation efficiency at the polymer–PC70BM interface. The presence of the conjugated π-system may enhance the coupling between the photoexcited state of the polymer and the charge separated state, assuming that the TTV side chains exist at the polymer–fullerene interface (Fig. 5). Of course, the complexity of the BHJ structures in PSCs and the difficulty in analyzing the polymer–fullerene interface31 mean that the role of the conjugated side chain requires further investigation.
 Fig. 5  Schematic diagram of the BHJ structure with TTV2:PC70BM. Conjugated side chains placed at the TTV2–PC70BM interface are hypothesized to improve the charge separation efficiency. 
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the introduction of a TTV conjugated side chain is a simple, effective method for improving the photovoltaic performance of the two D–A copolymers. Due to the higher EQE values in the broad wavelength range of 300–1100 nm, the short-circuit current of TTV2 reached 22.6 mA cm−2 that is the highest record for organic photovoltaic devices to date. This approach could provide a new general method for designing high-performance D–A photovoltaic polymers.
