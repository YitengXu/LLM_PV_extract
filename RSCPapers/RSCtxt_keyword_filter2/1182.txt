    , Accepted 16th September 2021First published on 16th September 2021AbstractIn recent times the perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have emerged as the most preeminent candidates among renewable technologies, yet the instability of PVSCs under ambient conditions has hindered their progress towards commercialization. Herein, a multifunctional passivation additive, 5-fluoropyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione (FPD), widely used as a cancer drug, was incorporated into the perovskite-based photoactive layer to enhance its photovoltaic efficiency along with its ambient stability. When this biologically active cancer drug molecule was utilized as a passivation additive, significant improvement was achieved in all the photovoltaic parameters, which collectively contributed to the enhancement of photovoltaic efficiency. The efficiency of PVSCs was elevated up to 20.22% for the FPD-passivated devices from 15.10% for the pristine device without any passivation. Furthermore, the incorporation of FPD also improved the long term durability of PVSCs by suppressing defects and enhancing the hydrophobicity of the perovskite surface. The FPD-passivated device maintained the PCE up to 89% in comparison to 27% for the pristine devices when PVSCs were exposed to a relative humidity of 45 ± 5% for 1000 h. This unique approach has elucidated the impact of passivation, which significantly enhanced the efficiency and long term stability to widen the possibility of practical applications.
Introduction
Hybrid perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have demonstrated immense potential as a preferable renewable technology for the forthcoming generation due to their incredible optoelectronic properties, e.g. wide absorption with high absorptivity, bandgap tunability, higher carrier mobility, longer charge carrier diffusion etc.1–4 The extensive research on PVSCs in the last decade has levitated the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3% to 25% for single junction PVSCs at laboratory scale, which is comparable with standard c-Si-based photovoltaic technology.5 However, among different perovskite materials, polycrystalline methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) films often possess electronic and grain boundary (GB) defects that can substantially reduce the PVSCs performance. These defects majorly originate from the presence of under-coordinated ions (MA+, Pb2+, and I−) in the perovskite thin film.6 Moreover, these varied kinds of defects at the GB and surface of the perovskite film stimulate rapid moisture penetration and ion migration in the perovskite layer, instigating the faster deterioration of the perovskite lattice structure resulting in ambient instability of PVSCs. Hence, it is truly essential to proficiently mitigate the defects and improve the quality of the thin films with better surface coverage, uniform grain distribution, and suitable stoichiometry.7,8 To diminish the diverse kinds of defects at the surfaces and GBs of perovskite films, various techniques were implemented in PVSCs like molecular passivation,9–11 device engineering,12 compositional tuning, etc.13–16 Among these techniques, the molecular passivation of perovskite films has emerged as the most explored method in recent times. Molecular passivation induces various interactions with uncoordinated species in perovskite films, which can annihilate the defects in the perovskite lattice significantly.17,18 The fluorine containing passivation additives were also utilized, which can enhance the hydrophobicity of the perovskite surface along with suppressing the defects in the perovskite film.19,20 The fluorine atom can decrease the ion migrations in the perovskite layer by hydrogen bond formation with a MA+ ion, which can reduce the structural instability of the photoactive layer.21–23 Although, various methods were utilized to minimize the defects in PVSCs, it is always vital to utilize a suitable additive with multifunctional groups, which can efficaciously diminish the diverse defects in the perovskite photoactive layer. In recent times, the application of multifunctional additives to elevate the efficiency and long term durability of PVSCs by modulating the perovskite crystallization process and enhancing the hydrophobicity of the perovskite photoactive layer have been widely explored.9,10,24,25
Herein, a multifunctional cancer drug molecule, 5-fluoropyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione (FPD), was used to suppress the broad range of defects and modulate the microstructure of the perovskite film.26 The immense therapeutic value of FPD stimulated extensive research globally.27 This fluorinated additive containing two carbonyl groups and two amine groups in its aromatic structure can interact with the lead–iodide (Pb–I) framework to significantly suppress the defects in the perovskite surface, yet its use remains unexplored in photovoltaics. Subsequently, FPD-passivated inverted PVSCs achieved enhanced short circuit current (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF), contributing collectively to a PCE >20% increase, which is substantially higher than the pristine device (15.10%). The presence of a fluorine atom contributed to enhancing the hydrophobicity of the perovskite thin film, which significantly restricted the moisture penetration into the perovskite layer under ambient conditions. The defect suppression and enhancement of hydrophobicity in the passivated perovskite film remarkably improved the ambient stability of the PVSCs. When the devices were exposed to relative humidity of 45 ± 5% for 1000 h, the passivated device retained efficiency of up to 89% of its initial PCE, compared to 27% of the non-passivated devices. This can be attributed to the efficient passivation by multifunctional FPD to suppress defects and enhance the hydrophobicity of the perovskite surface.
Results and discussion
In Fig. 1a, the fabrication steps of perovskite films are depicted. To analyse the impact of molecular passivation, various concentrations of FPD were incorporated into precursor solution (PbI2 + MAI) to understand the combined effect of the multifunctional nature of this additive on PVSCs. The precursor solution was deposited on a NiOx-coated FTO substrate by the anti-solvent dripping method. The details of the fabrication steps are illustrated in the ESI† file. Density functional theory (DFT) was utilized to gain insight about the electronic charge distribution and structural features of the FPD molecule. The molecular structure, side view of the optimized structure and electrostatic potential (ESP) of FPD are presented in Fig. 1b–d, respectively. In the ESP profile of planar FPD, the carbonyl groups appeared as the most electron-rich functional groups in the FPD molecule, which made it suitable to strongly interact with Pb2+ ions. The fluorine atom and amine moieties can also be involved in various non-covalent interactions with under-coordinated ions in the perovskite layer. To confirm the interactions between FPD and the perovskite, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed (Fig. 1e). A considerable shift in νCO band of FPD was observed from 1652 cm−1 (for only FPD) to 1640 cm−1 (for FPD + MAPbI3) due to the strong interaction between the lone pairs of the carboxylic acid groups of FPD and Pb2+ ions of the perovskite crystal. A schematic of plausible interactions between FPD and the perovskite crystal lattice is also presented in Fig. 1f. The device architecture of PVSCs is displayed in Fig. 2a. Consequently, PVSCs were fabricated utilizing the inverted architecture of FTO/NiOx/MAPBI3/PC61BM/rhodamine 101/silver. Energy band diagrams of constituent layers in the PVSCs are presented as Fig. S1 (ESI†). Fig. 2b displays the current density versus voltage (J–V) plots of pristine and passivated PVSCs with various concentrations of FPD. The photovoltaic parameters for PVSCs are summarized in Table 1. The PCE of 15.10% was achieved for the pristine device with JSC of 21.32 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.006 V and FF of 70.4%. As the concentration of FPD was increased gradually up to 3 mg ml−1, the photovoltaic parameters were improved and collectively they levitated the PCE up to 20.22% with JSC of 23.97 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.086 V and FF of 77.7%. However, for FPD concentrations above 3 mg ml−1, the JSC and FF decreased significantly resulting in overall inferior photovoltaic performance, which can be attributed to the uncontrolled aggregation and poor conductive nature of the additive within the photoactive layer. In Fig. 2c, a histogram is displayed representing the reproducibility and enhancement in performance of the passivated device, compared to the pristine counterpart. For better understanding of the FPD concentration-dependent reproducibility of the photovoltaic parameters, box charts are included as Fig. 3a–d, which indicate the relatively better reproducibility of the photovoltaic parameters for 3 mg ml−1 FPD-based PVSCs. Fig. 2d presents J–V curves for forward and reverse scans of FPD-passivated and pristine devices and the corresponding photovoltaic data are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). To evaluate the extent of hysteresis in PVSCs, the hysteresis index (HI) was assessed using the previously reported equation.28,29 (1)

The FPD passivated device had very similar J–V characteristic curves for both forward and reverse scans exhibiting lower hysteresis, compared to the non-passivated device. The FPD passivated device displayed lower HI of 1.38% in comparison to 9.07% of the pristine device. This substantial improvement in HI can be attributed to the reduction of traps states through passivation, which diminished the charge carrier accumulation at the interface.30 Furthermore, the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the FPD-passivated and pristine devices were assessed and the FPD-passivated device displayed enhanced EQE, compared to the pristine counterpart (Fig. 2e). The integrated JSC values were calculated from the EQE profiles, which were found to be well matched with the values presented in J–V analysis for both passivated and pristine devices. To further evaluate the photo-responsive nature of FPD passivated PVSCs, steady-state current measurements were analysed at maximum power point (Fig. 2f). Both FPD-passivated and pristine PVSCs demonstrated steady photo response over 500 s. The passivated device displayed an enhanced PCE of 19.65%, compared to 14.72% of the pristine device. To further analyse the impact of passivation on the absorption profile, UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded for perovskite thin films that were passivated by various concentrations of FPD (Fig. 4a). As the FPD concentration was increased gradually, the intensities of the absorption spectra of the perovskite films were enhanced. However, as the FPD concentration reached beyond 3 mg ml−1, a marginal decrease in absorption intensity was observed. The initial enhancement of absorption intensity after optimal FPD incorporation can be correlated with the improved quality of perovskite films where all films had comparable film thicknesses. It is also evident from the J–V profiles of the passivated PVSCs that the enhancement of the absorption intensity assisted in efficient photon harvesting. To elucidate the passivation effect on the crystalline nature of perovskite films, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was analysed for thin films that were passivated with various concentrations of FPD (Fig. 4b). All the perovskite films displayed polycrystalline nature with peaks at 14.11°, 28.47°, and 31.84° for (110), (220) and (310) perovskite planes, respectively. The peak intensities for (110), (220) and (310) perovskite planes increased for FPD-passivated films but as the concentration reached beyond 3 mg ml−1, a slight decline was observed in peak intensity. To get a better insight into the passivation effect on surface morphology, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was employed (Fig. 4c). As the additive concentration was increased, the grain size and uniformity in grain distribution were improved gradually. This morphological modulation by FPD can be attributed to the perovskite–additive interaction during the crystallization process. However, as the FPD concentration reached beyond 3 mg ml−1, the grain size and uniformity were reduced. This morphological change for higher additive concentration can be attributed to the uncontrolled overcrowding of FPD, which interfered with the perovskite crystal growth. The morphological dependence on FPD concentration can be correlated to the trend of photovoltaic performance of PVSCs, where a sharp decline in efficiency was recorded for the device with higher additive concentration (>3 mg ml−).

Consequently, to analyse the trap passivation mechanism, a few experimental studies were carried out for pristine and FPD-passivated devices. Initially, Urbach energy (EU) was estimated from the band edge of the perovskite absorbance profile for the thin films. EU is correlated with the defect density in the band edge region, which can be measured by utilizing the well-explored equation,31,32 (2)where, α presents the absorption coefficient, α0 is a constant and E (= hν) is the photonic energy. Fig. 5a depicts the ln(α) versus photon energy profiles. EU was calculated to be 52.8 meV for the pristine film utilizing the slope of the plot, which significantly reduced to 45.1 meV after passivation. The decline of EU indicates that the FPD incorporation into the perovskite significantly diminished the defect density and energetic disorders in the band edge region. To further elucidate the trap passivation mechanism, steady state photoluminescence (PL) was also investigated for pristine and FPD-based perovskite films (Fig. 5b). The intensity of PL was elevated substantially for the FPD-based film, compared to that of the pristine film. The peak maximum at 765 nm for the FPD-modified perovskite film was blue-shifted by 5 nm, compared to the peak maximum of the pristine film at 770 nm. This suggests that the passivation resulted in substantial reduction of trap density, which also minimized the non-radiative recombination in the photoactive layer.10 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also studied for better understanding of the interfacial charge carrier kinetics and the recombination properties of PVSCs. The Nyquist plots of the pristine and FPD-passivated devices were investigated at a bias of 0.75 V under dark conditions (Fig. 5c). Varied parameters like series resistance (Rs), recombination resistance (Rrec) and capacitance (C) were determined for the passivated and pristine devices from the fitted graphs utilizing the equivalent circuit presented in the inset. The estimated value of Rs was reduced for the FPD-passivated device, compared to that for the pristine counterpart. This indicates that the FPD incorporation into the perovskite layer significantly lowered the contact resistance at the interface. Moreover, the magnitude of Rrec was found to be higher for the FPD-passivated device in comparison to that for the pristine one. This can be correlated to the lesser extent of recombination in the FPD-based device, which facilitated smooth charge movement in PVSCs. The magnitude of C implies the amount of charge storage at the defects of the perovskite photoactive layer. The estimated lower values of C for the passivated devices, compared to those for the pristine counterpart validated the effective passivation capability of FPD to diminish the various kinds of defects in the perovskite layer. EIS measurements were also carried out at various voltages to attain better understanding about the extent of trap passivation (Fig. S2, ESI†). Rrec at various voltages (0.65 V to 0.90 V) for the passivated and pristine devices were linearly fitted, which depicts an inverse relation between Rrec and applied voltage. Rrec of the passivated device is considerably higher, compared to the pristine one at different applied voltages (Fig. 5d). This indicates the efficacious passivation of traps, which significantly reduced the charge carrier recombination. The lower charge carrier recombination resulted in enhanced photovoltaic parameters (JSC and VOC) for the passivated PVSCs. Linear fitted semi log curves of capacitance at various voltages are also shown for both pristine and FPD-based devices (Fig. 5e). For passivated PVSCs, C was found to be lower compared to that of the pristine one, which signifies that the passivation effectively mitigated the charge carrier accumulation at the traps. The trap density of states (t-DOS) was also analysed from C versus applied voltage plots and the FPD-based device depicted substantially lower magnitude of t-DOS than the pristine one, which suggests about the lesser amount of charge carrier recombination in the passivated PVSCs (Fig. 5f).10 To further elucidate the recombination mechanism of charge carriers, dark J–V was measured for the pristine and FPD-based PVSCs, which revealed that the reverse saturation current in the pristine PVSC was reduced after FPD incorporation (Fig. S3, ESI†). This indicates the lesser extent of recombination and better transport of charge carriers. Fig. 6a displays the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) profiles for the pristine and FPD-passivated devices, where Jph = Jlight − Jdark and Jlight and Jdark present the current densities under light and dark conditions, respectively. Veff = V0 − V, where V and V0 present the applied bias and the bias at which Jph = 0, respectively.33–35Jph values for the pristine and passivated devices gradually increased at lower Veff and reached up to the saturated photocurrent (Jsat) at higher Veff. FPD incorporation enhanced the Jsat, which is generally proportional to generation rate (Gmax). The relatively higher Jsat for the passivated device indicates the better photon absorbance, which further validates the enhanced absorbance profile of the passivated perovskite film. This also can be correlated to the JSC enhancement for the FPD-passivated PVSCs compared to the pristine counterpart. Moreover, at lower Veff region, a relatively sharper rise in Jph–Veff plot was observed for the pristine and FPD-based PVSCs. At a certain Veff, the Jph/Jsat ratio is directly correlated to the transport and collection of charge carriers.36 The effect of FPD passivation is very evident in trap suppression, which significantly assisted smoother charge carrier transport in the PVSCs. To gain better insight about the mechanism behind the VOC enhancement, capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were performed. Mott–Schottky profiles are presented in Fig. 6b for the pristine and passivated PVSCs. The capacitance, C, of the depletion layer can be presented as a dependent function of the applied bias (V) as (3)where ε0 presents the vacuum permittivity, ε is the relative dielectric constant, A is the device area (0.12 cm2), Vbi is the built-in potential and N is the residual charge density.37Vbi can be determined from the intercept of the X-axis of the straight line in the curve.38 The FPD-passivated device displayed an enhanced built-in potential (Vbi) of 1.04 V compared to the pristine one with 0.96 V. The higher Vbi for the passivated device signifies the presence of a dominant electric field that can facilitate smoother transport of charge carriers through the interface, which also validates the enhanced VOC (1.086 V) for the passivated device. The residual charge density (N) was estimated from the slope value of the linearly fitted Mott–Schottky graph. The N value was found to be 3.2 × 1016 cm−3 for the FPD passivated device compared to 4.1 × 1016 cm−3 for the pristine photovoltaic device. The lower N value for the modified device signifies that the passivation minimized the charge carrier recombination and accumulation at the interface. To further study the recombination kinetics of charge carriers, light intensity-dependent VOC and JSC were analysed. VOC can be directly correlated to splitting of the quasi-Fermi levels of charge carriers where the quasi Fermi level is determined by the free electron and hole densities.39 The equation between VOC and light intensity (I) is (4)where, n presents the ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T represents the temperature.31 In the light intensity-dependent VOC profile, the magnitude of n will be close to unity for the devices with much fewer traps. The slope deviation of kT/q from unity signifies the dominance of trap-assisted monomolecular Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination.31 As shown in Fig. 6c, the FPD-based device displayed a lowered value of ideality factor (1.33) compared to the pristine device (1.81), which indicates the dominant bimolecular recombination in the passivated device. Contrarily, the dominance of trap-assisted SRH recombination was evident in the pristine device. Fig. 6d displays the light intensity versus JSC profiles, where the FPD-based device depicts a higher slope of 0.94 compared to the pristine counterpart with 0.85, suggesting less trap-assisted non-radiative recombination with the FPD-passivated PVSCs. Light-dependent VOC and JSC profiles indicate that the extent of trap-assisted recombination in the pristine device is really high, which was significantly reduced by the FPD incorporation in the perovskite layer. For the comparative analysis of surface hydrophobicity of the pristine and FPD-passivated perovskite films, contact angles were measured (Fig. S4, ESI†). The pristine and FPD-modified surfaces showed the contact angles of 37.4° and 74.7°, respectively. The FPD incorporation improved the hydrophobicity of the perovskite surface significantly, which can resist the moisture penetration during exposure to ambient conditions. This can be further validated by XRD study of the perovskite films after exposure to ambient conditions (RH 45 ± 5%) for 1000 h (Fig. 7a). Though the FPD-modified film displayed an almost similar XRD pattern after ambient exposure, for the pristine film, an intense peak of PbI2 phase at 12.7° appeared. To understand the passivation effect on the long term durability of PVSCs, the passivated and pristine devices were exposed to ambient conditions with RH 45 ± 5%. For the pristine device, a sharp decrease was observed in all the photovoltaic parameters (JSC, VOC and FF) resulting in steep reduction of PCE under ambient conditions and it retained only 27% of its PCE after 1000 h (Fig. 7b). This decline can be attributed to the presence of PbI2 phase in the pristine film and rapid deterioration of the perovskite crystal structure after prolonged ambient exposure.

Contrarily, the FPD-passivated PVSC showed almost stable photovoltaic performance and maintained 89% of its initial efficiency, which validates the passivation capability of the FPD molecule. A comparison of this FPD-based perovskite passivation work with the recent literature is tabulated in Table S2 (ESI†) emphasizing the significantly improved overall PVSC performance and operational stability under ambient conditions.
Conclusions
In summary, we have illustrated the impact of incorporating the multifunctional additive molecule FPD in the perovskite photoactive layer, which substantially regulated the opto-electronic properties and surface morphology and diminished defects in the perovskite lattice structure. The PCE of 15.10% for the pristine device was significantly improved up to 20.22% (JSC of 23.97 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.086 V and FF of 77.7%) for the FPD-passivated PVSC. The traps and the defect density in the perovskite active layer were considerably suppressed due to the strong interaction between the functional groups of FPD and the perovskite crystal lattice. Moreover, the long term durability was improved significantly for the passivated PVSCs and they retained high efficiency even under high humid conditions for longer periods in comparison to the non-passivated device. This FPD-passivation approach was thus confirmed to be an efficacious method to enhance the PCE along with the long term stability of PVSCs to withstand unfavourable humid conditions.
