    , Accepted 4th December 2017First published on 11th December 2017AbstractCation disorder which arises from the size and chemical environment similarity of Cu and Zn is the limiting factor in Cu2ZnSnSxSe4−x (CZTSSe) performance. Cation substitution is one effective way to solve this issue, however, the most commonly reported substitutes, Ag and Cd, are not ideal as they detract from the earth-abundant and non-toxic motivation of CZTSSe. Mn is a promising candidate in comparison with other candidates (e.g. Fe, Ni or Co), because of its oxidation state stability and larger ionic size mismatch with Cu. In this study, Cu2MnxZn1−xSn(S,Se)4 (CMZTSSe) thin film solar cells were prepared by chemical spray pyrolysis and a subsequent selenization process. We study the influence of Mn substitution on the morphological, structural, optical, electrical and device properties. A distinct phase transformation from CZTSSe kesterite to C(M,Z)TSSe stannite is observed at 20% Mn substitution. A high amount of Mn substitution (x ≥ 0.6) is shown to increase the carrier density significantly which introduces more defects and non-radiative carrier recombination as shown by quenched photoluminescence intensity. Consequently, reduction in device performance is observed for these samples. The highest power conversion efficiency is achieved at x ≈ 0.05 with η = 7.59%, Voc = 0.43 V, Jsc = 28.9 mA cm−2 and FF = 61.03%. The improved open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) are attributed to the improved shunt resistance and carrier transport due to low defect density especially at the CdS/CMZTSSe interface. Finally, based on our electrical characterization, a few suggestions to improve the efficiency are proposed.
I. Introduction
Cu2ZnSnSxSe4−x (CZTSSe) has made significant progress in the past few years as an earth-abundant alternative material for thin film solar cells.2–12 In comparison with its binary and ternary analogues (CdTe and CIS), the quaternary structure of CZTSSe improves the band gap and chemical property tunability due to its increased structural degrees of freedom.13 Nevertheless, the record efficiency of CZTSSe is 12.6%,6,7 much lower than the Shockley Quiesser limit for CZTSSe of 32.8%.3 Many studies indicate that the performance gap in CZTSSe is mainly due to the significantly low open-circuit voltage (Voc).7,14–17 The Voc deficit, expressed as Eg/qVoc (where Eg is the band gap and q is the elementary charge), of the record efficiency CZTSSe cell is around ∼0.6 eV.7 Reported studies pinpoint intrinsic point defects and band tailing as the main culprits for the large Voc deficit.16,18–20 The complexity of a multi-element quaternary compound facilitates disorder and crystallographic defect formation such as anti-site, vacancy and interstitial defects in the system. In particular, Cu and Zn anti-site defects are ubiquitous in the CZTSSe system due to the similar ionic radius and chemical properties of both elements.21,22 This conclusion is substantiated by the finding of low defect formation energy based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.23
Various process optimization methods which are deployed in other PV materials, for example, surface and grain boundary passivation,17,24 light management to reduce optical losses,11 anti-reflection coating,25 and improving the bulk CZTS absorber quality18,26,27 have been attempted to engineer the defects and improve the performance. However, the intrinsic defect problem still exists in the bulk absorber. For instance, the Cu–Zn anti-site is still naturally formed through high quality single crystal fabrication.28 Random distribution of Cu and Zn atoms in the lattice which creates cation disorder is unavoidable by process optimization alone.28 Recently, isoelectronic cation substitution studies have been reported as one way to reduce cation disorder in CZTSSe, such as substitution of Cd for Zn,29 Ba for Zn,30,31 Ag for Cu,32,33 and Sn with Ge.34,35 The cation substitutions with larger ionic size mismatch between cations present an approach to inherently discourage cation disorder, thus leading to fewer defects. In fact, performance improvements, specifically in Voc, were already observed from partial cation substitution in these reports. A reduction in deep defects was concluded based on both experimental (e.g. better carrier lifetime and sharper absorption edge) and theoretical (e.g. higher energy defect formation in DFT calculations) calculations. For Cd and Ag substitution, Cu–Zn anti-sites appear to be reduced, while for Ge substitution, deep defects related to Sn were reduced. Besides performance improvements, grain enlargement, crystal structure changes and band gap tunability are also observed from these cation substitution studies.
However, Cd, Ag and Ge are not the most ideal substitutes for improving CZTSSe. Research interest in CZTS has been motivated to address the toxicity and scarcity of constituent elements in CdTe and CIGS. There are other potentially better substitutes which satisfy the octet rule, such as Fe, Mn, Ni, and Co, to replace Zn. These cations are more abundant and environmentally friendly than previously explored candidates. Cation substitution studies involving alloying from pure-Zn to pure-substitute cations should be done on these candidates. Among these candidates, Mn is the most promising cation to replace Zn. The electron configuration of Mn is the most stable at oxidation state +2, because of the nature of half-filled 3d5-orbitals. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, 3d5-orbitals in Mn will have the five valence electrons fill the five d-orbitals with parallel spin. This state has intrinsic stability in comparison with the partially filled orbital in Fe, Ni or Co.36 Furthermore, if the size mismatch indeed improves cation order, Mn is the best candidate because the Mn2+ (0.80 Å) ionic size mismatch in 4-fold coordination with Cu+ (0.74 Å) is the largest compared to Zn2+ (0.74 Å), Fe2+ (0.77 Å), Co2+ (0.72 Å), and Ni2+ (0.69 Å).37 Lastly, Prabhakar et al. noted a photovoltaic response for Cu2MnSnS4 and Cu2MnSn(S,Se)4 unlike with Fe, Ni and Co.38,39 Thus in this report, we fabricate CuMnxZn1−xSn(S,Se)4 (CMZTSSe) by using a low cost spray-pyrolysis technique40 and study the role of Mn alloying into the CZTSSe absorber in the solar cell performance. We present our findings on the role of Mn substitution in the structure, morphology, electrical and optical properties of the CZTSSe thin film to support our observations on the photovoltaic performance. We also provide in-depth device analysis on our “champion” CMZTSSe cells which were achieved at 5% substitution. This initial positive improvement means that future process optimization can be deployed on Mn substitution to further enhance its power conversion efficiency.
II. Experimental
CMZTSSe thin film preparation
The precursor solution was made by dissolving copper chloride dihydrate (CuCl2·2H2O, 37.5 mM), manganese(II) chloride tetrahydrate/zinc chloride (MnCl2·4H2O/ZnCl2, 27.5 mM), tin chloride dihydrate (SnCl2·2H2O, 22.5 mM) and thiourea (CH4N2S, 0.4 M) into 80 ml D.I. water. All precursors were purchased from Sigma Aldrich with a purity of 99.99%. Varying the overall stoichiometric ratio which results in Cu-poor (Cu/(Zn + Mn + Sn) = 0.75) and MnxZn1−x-rich (MnxZn1−x/Sn = 1.2) composition is a common technique to decrease Cu–Zn anti-site defects. An excess amount of thiourea was added above the stoichiometric ratio to compensate for the sulfur loss during the spray pyrolysis process as high temperature vaporizes sulfur quickly. Dilute HCl (0.1 mol) was added to adjust the pH value to 2. The precursor solution was sprayed onto Mo that is placed on a hotplate at 450 °C temperature, at a rate of 1.6 ml min−1 by using N2 as a carrier gas at a pressure of 20 psi. After this, the as-deposited CMZTS was selenized at 560 °C for 30 minutes in a two-zone tube furnace to obtain CMZTSSe thin films.
Fabrication
Subsequently chemical bath deposition (CBD) of the CdS buffer layer was performed at 80 °C for 8 minutes. Following this, 50 nm i-ZnO followed by ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) window layers were sputtered on the top of CdS. After this the samples were manually scribed to make grids with each square having an area of 0.16 cm2 (active area of 0.15 cm2). Finally, Ag paste was put on the top to act as an electrode for charge collection.
Characterization and analysis
The XRD data, Raman spectra, surface, and cross-sectional morphology of the thin films were obtained using a Bruker D8 Advance, Renishaw inVia Raman system using 532 nm excitation wavelength and FESEM (JEOL, JSM-7600F). Current density–voltage (J–V) curves for solar cells were obtained using a Xe-based light source solar simulator (VS-0852 and KEITHLEY 2612A) to provide simulated 1 sun AM 1.5G illumination which was calibrated with a standard Si reference cell. The EQE was measured using a PVE300 (Bentham) IPCE Instrument equipped with a xenon/quartz halogen light source and calibrated with Si/Ge reference detectors. The capacitance–voltage (C–V) and DLCP measurements were performed using an IBM-PVX system and an HP 4192 impedance analyzer. Photoluminescence measurements were performed at room temperature using a 15 kHz pulsed 532 nm laser, a monochromator, and an InGaAs photomultiplier tube detector. Hall measurements were performed by mechanically exfoliating the absorber and using a rotating parallel dipole line AC Hall system that generates a pure harmonic, unidirectional and strong magnetic field followed by lock-in detection of the Hall signal.41,42 XPS measurements were carried out using a VG ESCALAB 2201-XL instrument under a base pressure of <5 × 10−10 mbar and equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα (1486.7 eV) X-ray source and a He I discharge lamp (21.2 eV) UV source.
III. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD results of Cu2MnxZn1−xSn(S,Se)4 thin films for x = 0 to x = 1. These samples exhibit dominant (112) plane diffraction peaks which indicate a tetragonal structure. All of the observed peaks correspond to the planes from CZTS (JCPDS #26-0575), CMTS (JCPDS #51-0757), CZTSe (JCPDS #26-0868), CMTSe (JCPDS #26-0542), Mo and MoSe2.43 Except for Mo and MoSe2 peaks, the peak positions are not exactly matched with the database due to (Mn,Zn) and (S,Se) alloying. From x = 0 to x = 1, a peak shift to lower angles is observed especially at (112) peaks from 2θ = 26.95° to 2θ = 27.25° (Fig. S1†). This shift is attributed to the replacement of Zn and S with larger size elements, Mn and Se, respectively. Partial replacement with large atomic radius elements increases the lattice parameter and spacing values of the structure, thus decreasing the angle of diffraction.25 The XRD patterns of CZTSSe and CMTSSe show distinct signatures of kesterite for CZTSSe and stannite for CMTSSe due to the splitting of (204) and (312) peaks. In addition, an abrupt peak shift is observed from x = 0.2 to x = 0.4 suggesting a possible mixed phase composition in between the phase transformation. To determine the effect of Mn substitution on lattice parameters, Rietveld refinement analysis was conducted on thin film samples at x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.0 (Fig. S2†) using FullProf software. An increase in the lattice parameter is observed for both the a-axis and c-axis as Mn substitutes Zn in the system. The lattice parameter increases from a = 5.658 Å (CZTSSe) to a = 5.736 Å (CMTSSe), and it increases from c = 11.259 Å (CZTSSe) to c = 11.345 Å (CMTSSe). Similar to the abrupt shift shown in Fig. 1(a), an abrupt increase in the lattice parameter is also observed at x = 0.2 to x = 0.4. This observation might be related to the solid solubility limit of Mn in the CZTSSe structure which is at 20%. According to the Home–Rutherford theory,44 for elements to have a complete substitutional solid solution, the atomic size difference must be less than 14–15%. For Mn (1.61 Å) and Zn (1.42 Å), their atomic size difference is near that limit at ∼13.4%. Thus, it is possible that Mn can only dissolve within CZTSSe structures up until around 20% and it forms mixed phases of CMTSSe and CZTSSe at 0.2 < x < 0.8. Despite limitations in Rietveld refinement on thin film samples, the analysis still seems to indicate that CZTSSe is kesterite, CMTSSe is stannite, and when 0.2 < x < 0.8, there is a possibility of having mixed phases. To further analyze the phase purity, Raman spectroscopy was conducted on these samples.

Fig. 1(b) depicts the Raman study to understand the phase purity of these samples. In addition, curve fitting using the Gaussian method was carried out in their respective ratio (Fig. S3†) to find hidden peaks. From x = 0 to x = 1, four main peaks are observed; three main peaks at around 174 (B mode), 198 (A mode) and 236 cm−1 (B mode) correspond to the Raman peaks of CZTSe45 or CMTSe,46 meanwhile the peaks around 330 cm−1 (A mode) correspond to CZTS47 or CMTS.46 Raman spectra are usually dominated by the A symmetry mode which is sensitive to the vibration of anion atoms,48 meanwhile the B symmetry mode in CZTS is sensitive to the Cu/Zn and Cu/Sn atomic plane movements.49 Consequently, chemical ratio variation among these elements will alter the peak profiles which are apparent in this set of samples. The main peaks are shifted to lower wavenumbers which indicates Mn substitution as observed similarly in the literature for Cu2MnxZn1−xSnS4.50 In addition, several hidden peaks are also observed from the fitted Raman curve. Shoulder peaks around 200 cm−1 belong to the SnS phase which is a volatile compound commonly formed during high temperature annealing.51 In addition, secondary peaks around 235 cm−1 at x = 0 and x ≥ 0.8 are indications of secondary phases such as ZnSe and MnSe.52 The appearance of both phases is attributed to the Zn and Mn rich condition at x = 0 and x ≥ 0.8 respectively. There are no definitive markers of ZnSe and MnSe observed via Raman or XRD in the remaining CMZTSe sample.

Fig. 2(a–h) show the cross-section SEM images of Cu2MnxZn1−xSn(S,Se)4 thin films after the selenization process. The average thickness of the films is 1000 nm which can still be optimized to be equivalent to that of the best performing CZTSSe (2000 nm).25 The average grain size of these films ranges from 400 nm to 1000 nm as also observed from plan view SEM images (Fig. S4†). Generally, the films are compact and dense, however some voids are visible at x = 0.2 and 0.4 in conjunction with small grains. At composition x = 0.05, the grain size is the largest and extends throughout the film thickness. This composition also results in the best device performance as fewer grain boundaries are usually associated with better charge transport. In the Mo/MoSe2 layers, various thicknesses are observed for different compositions due to different growth of MoSe2 layers during selenization. Thick Mo/MoSe2 is notable at x = 1, which indicates preferable MoSe2 growth. The appearance of a thin layer of MoSe2 is common even in high efficiency CZTSSe solar cells.7 Even though most of the studies conclude that having MoSe2 is detrimental, some studies argue on its benefit at the interface, especially for band alignment.53 However, having too thick a MoSe2 layer as seen at x = 1 is certainly unfavorable as concluded by Jianjun Li et al.54

Table 1 shows the elemental composition from Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) studies from the surface of the absorber layer after selenization. The measurements were taken from several batches and from different regions of the samples, and thus we present the median results and the standard deviation for a better representation of the elemental composition. EDS results confirm the incorporation of Mn into the system after selenization as shown by Mn/(Mn + Zn) values which are close to the ratio used in the precursor. In addition, Cu-poor and Zn/Mn-rich precursor conditions are maintained throughout all ratios. Notable variations occur at x = 0.2 and 0.4, which show higher standard deviations for sulphur and selenium compared to the other ratios. These variations are possibly related to the smaller grain and voids observed in the SEM images of these samples. Selenium incorporation into the system induces grain growth, and thus less selenium in the system reduces the grain growth. In addition, the larger standard deviation may be the result of phase transformation observed from the XRD. The alteration of the structure may affect selenium incorporation during the selenization process.

Fig. 3(a) shows the effect of Mn alloying on its optical properties. Band-gaps are obtained from the Tauc plot (Fig. S5†) in UV-vis measurements. From the Tauc plot, bandgap bowing is observed as Mn replaces Zn in the system. When Mn increases, the band gap increases first from 1.11 eV (CZTSSe) to 1.2 eV (CM0.2Z0.8TSSe) and then decreases to 1.03 eV (CMTSSe). Bowing effects or nonlinearity dependence in the band gap has been observed before in alloying semiconductor compounds.55–58 This phenomenon can be related to the changes in the electronic structure of the system. In CZTS and CZTSSe, group I (Cu) 3d-state and group VI (S/Se) 3p-state antibonding is responsible for the upper valence band formation, while group IV (Sn) 5s-state and group VI (S/Se) 3s3p-state hybridization is responsible for the bottom conduction band formation.59 Meanwhile, in CMTS and CMTSSe, the upper valence band is mainly formed by Cu 3d-states and group VI (S/Se) with small contribution from Cu and Mn 5d-state hybridization, and the bottom conduction band is mainly formed by Mn 5d-states and group VI (S/Se) 3p-states.60 The main difference is the contribution of Mn in the I2–II–IV–VI4 electronic structure compared to Zn. The increase in the band gap might be due to small amounts of Mn in the system weakening the hybridization between Sn and S/Se in the conduction band. The small amounts of Mn may not be able to hybridize with S/Se to replace Sn as the primary cation which is responsible for the conduction band formation. As the Mn amount increases, the hybridization between Mn and S/Se becomes more dominant and thus stronger hybridization results in a band gap decrease at x > 0.2. Furthermore, the larger cation radius of Mn also contributes to the smaller band gap of CMTSSe compared to CZTSSe similarly to Cd substitution.61
 Fig. 3  (a) Photoluminescence (PL) spectra (normalized) as a function of the energy level (eV) and band gap (eV) as a function of Mn/(Mn + Zn) for Cu2MnxZn1−xSn(S,Se)4. (b) Plot of the bandgap and photoluminescence (PL) peaks and the energy difference between them marked with red stars as a function of Mn/(Mn + Zn). 
PL measurements were performed at room temperature on a bare absorber surface of samples with significant atmospheric exposure. Due to the age of the samples, they were etched for 3 minutes in KCN prior to PL measurements which was found to increase the PL intensity. Sample exposure and aging are generally expected to reduce PL intensity, but generally do not change the PL peak position. PL responses are only observed in samples with x = 0 to x = 0.6, while above this ratio the signals are quenched. The PL peak position follows the band gap trend except for the drop at x = 0.1. The quenched PL signal at x > 0.6 and the PL intensity decay as the Mn content increases suggest high non-radiative recombination and lower carrier lifetime at higher Mn content. Non-radiative recombination can occur due to the abundance of defects in the band gap, which leads to a lower carrier lifetime.62 The existence of a high concentration of defects near the band edges can also result in band tailing effects. Both increasing defect density in the band gap and band-tailing contribute to the Voc deficit which is observed in CZTSSe.7 The difference of the PL peak position and band gap energy level is one metric of the bulk absorber quality and band tailing. High quality samples with minimal band-tails exhibit PL at the bandgap energy.63 From Fig. 3(b), it is observed that at 5% Mn, there is a slight reduction in the gap between PL and the bandgap energy, i.e. 40 meV to 30 meV which suggests an improvement in absorber quality and possible reduction in band-tailing. However, from 10% until 60% Mn, the gap between PL and bandgap energy is found to increase slightly compared to pure-CZTSSe which suggests that additional defects form within the band gap of the high Mn content samples. Another metric is the Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) which correlates with the potential fluctuation near the electronic transition.16 In Fig. 3(a), the FWHM from x = 0 to x = 0.1 shows negligible changes in the FWHM and at x ≥ 0.2, the FWHM decrease may indicate small energy fluctuations. However, since the Eg – PL peak is larger than the difference in the FWHM, the band tailing level position is still deeper than that of the best sample of x = 0.05. Further analysis is required to fully understand this phenomenon.

Fig. 4 shows the electrical transport characteristics of CMZTSSe as a function of the Mn/(Mn + Zn) ratio. The majority carrier concentration and mobility are measured using AC Hall measurements using a rotating parallel dipole line magnet system.42 This technique is necessary to extract small Hall voltages with a low signal to noise ratio due to low mobility (μ < 1 cm2 V−1 s−1). We observe a significant increase in carrier concentration as a function of Mn content in this sample set. There is a small drop in carrier concentration and small increase in hole mobility at 5% Mn, which leads to an improvement in the carrier transport. The carrier concentration and mobility values for CZTSSe are consistent with previous findings on high efficiency CZTSSe.7,64 Similar to CMTSSe, a high carrier concentration is also observed in CMTS.38 This high carrier concentration may indicate a high number of defects in the system. This high carrier concentration may also explain the quenched result in PL for high Mn content samples. The changes in the elemental composition especially higher Cu/(Zn + Mn + Sn) ratios for high Mn content samples may partly contribute to the increase in carrier concentration as these changes can affect the defect concentration such as copper vacancies (VCu) or anti-site defects (CuZn or CuMn). However, this does not fully explain the phenomenon. One possible reason for the increase in carrier concentration is due to the properties of elemental Mn. Elemental Mn has a half-filled 3d5 orbital in comparison with Zn which has a fully filled 3d10 orbital. Even though Mn is stable at the Mn2+ state due to parallel single electron spin filling of all 3d orbitals, there is a possibility of forming other oxidation states, such as Mn4+ or Mn7+. According to crystal field theory, the tetrahedral system splits the d-orbitals into two sets of energy levels (t2g and Eg).65 The splitting in the energy levels may facilitate the formation of other oxidation states by letting some electrons to leave some of the orbitals. Moreover, as the oxidation state increases, the cation radius will decrease,66 and the smaller cation radius of Mn will result in an ease of anti-site formation between Cu–Mn as observed between Cu–Zn. An indication of Mn oxidation state evolution is shown in the XPS result (Fig. S6†) for CMTS which shows shoulder peaks around Mn 2p peaks. These shoulder peaks indicate various chemical environments surrounding Mn which is a sign of various oxidation states. Consequently, the evolution of Mn2+ into higher oxidation states contributes more free hole carriers in the system.

To further understand the effect of Mn substitution in solar cells, solar cell devices (Mo/CMZTSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Ag-paste) were fabricated and measured. Fig. 5 shows the efficiency (η), fill factor (FF), short-circuit current (Jsc), and open-circuit voltage (Voc) values as a function of Mn content. The data show the average from three batches of experiments with 16 cells per batch to provide statistical consistency. As the Mn content varies, the efficiency changes in a non-linear manner. The best performing cell is achieved with 5% Mn substitution of Zn. There is an increase in efficiency from pure CZTSSe. Generally, Voc improvement by 45 mV from CZTSSe and fill factor improvement are the main contributing factors for the overall efficiency improvement. Assuming all other processes and layers are consistent, this result indicates that there is an improvement in terms of material properties. SEM images show thicker and bigger grains for 5% Mn substitution. A small increment in the band gap, lower carrier concentration and higher carrier mobility compared to pure CZTSSe are the main contributors of this improvement.

When the Mn content exceeds >5%, a reduction of device performance is observed. This reduction is attributed to significant Jsc and FF reduction. These reductions could be attributed to two reasons. Firstly, low charge collection due to increasing non-radiative recombination is observed from PL. Secondly, the high carrier concentration (∼1017–1018 cm−3) at higher Mn content (x > 0.4) leads to a lower carrier lifetime. An absorber with high carrier concentration tends to have high shunt conductance (Gsh) and forms a narrow depletion width with a buffer layer which leads to low charge collection. A shunted profile is indeed observed for CMTSSe with a high Gsh and ideality factor (Fig. S7†). The shunted curve under the dark conditions shows the high shunt conductance problem in the absorber. This shunted result is also consistent with experimental observations in PL, EQE and IV.
We have therefore shown that the power conversion efficiency of CZTSSe is improved when 5% of Mn substitutes Zn. Next, to strategize for further efficiency improvement, we compare the ‘champion’ CMZTSSe with the control CZTSSe device. The J–V characteristics of the “champion” CMZTSSe device (Mn/(Mn + Zn) ≈ 5%) with a power conversion efficiency of 7.6% and CZTSSe with an efficiency of 6.5% are shown in Fig. 6(a). Their device parameters together with their diode model parameters are tabulated in Table 2. The diode model parameters are the ideality factor η1, reverse saturation current J01, series resistance (Rs) and shunt conductance (Gsh). These parameters are extracted using the Lambert-W curve-fitting method.67 As a reference, the “control” CZTSSe in this study has exceeded the best reported chemical spray-pyrolyzed CZTSSe which has an efficiency of 5.74%.68 The champion device fill factor (FF) of ≈61% is still relatively low which is very likely due to the voltage dependent collection problem. The high diode ideality factor of 1.9 is also typical in the solar cell with strong recombination losses and is higher than the ideality factor of the world record CZTSSe device (η1 ∼ 1.45).7 However, compared to the pure-CZTSSe in this sample set, FF and Voc have shown the most improvement. FF improvement is mainly due to the decrease in shunt conductance which could be a result of increased grain size and improvement in bulk absorber quality. Capacitance–voltage (CV) and drive level capacitance profiling (DLCP) measurements were carried out on both samples. The results in Fig. 6(b) provide information on the charge density as a function of depletion width (x) at different voltage biases. Here the charge density includes bulk carrier density (free carrier density and the defect density), defect traps in the space charge region and interfacial defects. DLCP is considered a better measurement for bulk carrier density because it is only sensitive to bulk carrier density and defect traps in the space charge region compared to C–V which is also sensitive to interfacial defects.69 Thus, the apparent difference between these two charge density values is associated with interfacial defects. From DLCP measurements, the depletion width (xd) can be determined by measuring capacitance at zero bias, followed by using the ε0εA/C formula, where C is the measured capacitance, A is the device area, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity and ε is the dielectric constant for the absorber.70 The depletion width (xd) at zero bias for CM0.05Z0.95TSSe is higher than that of CZTSSe (i.e. ≈340 nm vs. 290 nm, respectively). In addition, a reduction in the overall charge density for the champion device is also observed. It should be noted that a wider depletion region is usually associated with better charge separation between the electron–hole pairs generated in the bulk of the devices. These findings are consistent with the improvements in Voc and FF. Furthermore, the bulk carrier density at the deep bulk (measured at high negative bias) for the champion device, ρ ≈ 1 × 1014 cm−3 is comparable and consistent with carrier concentration from Hall measurement data, ρ ≈ 2 × 1014 cm−3 (Fig. 5). We have also performed External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) measurements of these two cells. Slight charge collection improvement can be observed in the short wavelength range for the CMZTSSe device – consistent with lower interface charge density found in the DLCP/CV study. Unfortunately, the charge collection in CMZTSSe is slightly lower at longer wavelengths compared to the CZTSSe resulting in a similar Jsc value between the two cells. Even though the CMZTSSe has a slightly higher depletion width, its thickness is also higher than that of CZTSSe. This increases the collection path and probability of recombination and reduces the charge collection at longer wavelengths.

Another characteristic of the champion CMZTSSe is investigated by a temperature dependent current–voltage study (IVT). The Vocvs. temperature (T) plot is shown in Fig. 6(c). The Voc, efficiency, Jsc and fill factor versus temperature are also plotted for x = 0 and x = 0.05 (Fig. S8†). The measurement is done on an aged sample and thus the efficiency has dropped. From Vocvs. temperature characteristics, we observe that the extrapolated Voc intercepts at 0 K correspond to the activation energy (EA) of the dominant recombination mechanism ≈1.05 eV for x = 0.05 and ≈1.00 eV for x = 0. The activation energy for x = 0.05 is still lower than the band gap (EA < Eg) which suggests that the recombination mechanism may still be dominated by interface recombination.71 In contrast when the space charge recombination is dominant the activation energy value is equal to the band gap.72 From Fig. S8,† as we lower the temperature, the efficiency increases and then drops at ∼200 K for x = 0.05, while for the control sample at x = 0 the efficiency drops at ∼225 K. The drop is mainly due to the collapse in Jsc and FF, as fewer carriers are being generated and transported. This phenomenon is commonly observed due to the increase in series resistance associated with carrier freeze-out at low temperature.64 From this IVT study, a noteworthy characteristic of CM0.05Z0.95TSSe is shown by the lower Δ(Eg − EA) value, ∼0.07 eV, in comparison with that of the control sample, ∼0.11 eV and comparable with that of the record CZTSSe cell, ∼0.1 eV.7 The improvement is mainly due to less interface recombination at the CdS/CMZTSSe interface as shown by higher charge collection at lower wavelengths in Fig. 6(d). This result is also consistent with the finding from the difference between CV and DLCP values at zero bias that shows lower interface defect density for CMZTSSe.
Moving forward, this positive result of CMZTSSe could be better harnessed when the absorber quality is comparable with that of the record CZTSSe cell.7Jsc, Voc and fill factor values are still relatively low and need to be improved. Since the J01 and η1 values are high, reducing the recombination losses should be an area of focus. High recombination is evident from the low collection at longer wavelengths in Fig. 6(d) as well as the relatively low PL intensity which suggests short lifetimes. The interfacial MoSe2 layer which exists between Mo and the absorber needs to be controlled. It has been reported that a thick MoSe2 interfacial layer reduces device performance.73 Optimization of the deposition and selenization conditions could be done to control the interface. The high series resistance (Rs) could be reduced by eliminating the secondary phases which exist in the film. Optimization of the fabrication parameters, such as precursor ratios and deposition conditions, could be done to ensure a pure phase. Furthermore, increasing the thickness of the film to the optimal thickness (∼1–2 μm) could improve the Jsc value. Lastly, further improvement of the buffer and transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layers may also enhance the overall device performance.
IV. Conclusion
In summary, CMxZ1−xTSSe solar cells (with 0 < x < 1) prepared by the spray pyrolysis method have been presented. Using the spray pyrolysis method, the ratio between Mn and Zn after selenization is still maintained similar to the precursor ratio. The substitution of Zn with Mn in CZTSSe thin films is shown to induce structural transformation at x = 0.2 which is largely attributed to the difference in the atomic radius. The Mn atom is unable to completely dissolve in the CZTSSe structure at x > 0.2, and thus alters the structure from CZTSSe kesterite to C(M,Z)TSSe stannite, and at x > 0.8 the structure becomes CMTSSe stannite. The variation of the Mn content is also found to change the charge density, mobility and carrier lifetime in CMZTSSe. High Mn contents (x ≥ 0.6) increase the carrier density and decrease the carrier lifetime due to higher defects and non-radiative recombination. Solar cell devices with the Mo/CMxZ1−xTSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Ag-paste structure for x = 0.0–1.0 were successfully fabricated and measured. The best photovoltaic device is obtained with the sample with x = 0.05 with improvements in the depletion width, Voc, and fill factor. The improved open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) are attributed to the improved shunt resistance and carrier transport due to lower defect density especially at the CdS/CMZTSSe interface. However, when the Mn content is more than 5% (x > 0.05), the efficiency was reduced due to the significant increase of carrier density. Nevertheless, this first experimental study on Mn alloying into CZTSSe shows positive intrinsic and device improvement. Improvements in device performance may be achieved by optimizing interfaces, phase purity, thickness, buffer and TCO layers.
