    , Accepted 13th February 2023First published on 13th February 2023AbstractUsing multiple donor polymers is a simple means to broaden the absorption range of organic solar cells (OSCs). Yet, achieving improved photovoltaic and mechanical properties in OSCs based on dual polymers has not met with success so far. Here, we address this challenge by introducing a low-cost and 2D semi-paracrystalline conjugated polymer PTQ10 as the second polymer donor to the benchmark PM6:N3 blend. Both improved photovoltaic and mechanical performances were realized in the optimized PM6:PTQ10:N3-based OSCs at a polymer blend ratio of 4:1. The influence of the second polymer on the mechanical and photovoltaic properties of the ternary blend system was examined via grazing-incidence X-ray scattering and thin-film mechanical measurements, offering an in-depth understanding of the inner relationships between the film structure and mechanical properties in such ternary blend systems. Crucially, we were able to predict the composition dependence of the elastic modulus via a theoretical model for these ternary blend films based on dual-donor polymers. This work provides a new guide for fabricating highly efficient and stretchable solar cells from multiple polymer blends.
1 Introduction
Solar energy is one of the most abundant resources on earth. Solar cells that utilize organic and polymeric materials for solar energy conversion represent promising clean-energy technology.1–7 Up to now, many strategies have been developed to improve the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). As ternary OSCs reduce the fabrication complexity of the tandem structure and the production cost, the ternary mixing strategy has received growing attention and is considered to be the most effective strategy to overcome the drawbacks of the binary blend of polymer and organic small molecule components.8–17 Taking the high-efficiency PM6 and N3 binary system18 as an example, several research groups19–25 applied the ternary mixing strategy to produce improved performance and even record-high efficiency OSCs in the last few years. In a previous study, Peng et al.20 brought a common fullerene acceptor as the third component to modulate the mechanical, morphological, and photovoltaic properties of the PM6:N3 blend. By incorporating a small amount of fullerene acceptor as the third component in the PM6:N3 system, both efficiency and ductility were maximized. The combined use of a fullerene acceptor and a nonfullerene acceptor helped improve the molecular order, orientational texture, and mesoscale phase separation of the PM6:N3 system, and slightly improved the ductility of the OSC device.
Presently, the most commonly used and best-performance active layers in ternary OSCs generally combine a donor polymer with two small molecule acceptors.26–28 For example, a remarkably high power conversion efficiency (PCE) value of over 19% was recently recorded with the use of two Y-series acceptors.29 In sharp contrast, OSCs based on dual donor polymers and a small molecule acceptor are far behind. To date, only a limited number of ternary OSCs from a two-donor polymer blend30–37 have delivered better performances over their respective binary blends. This difficulty is mainly due to the challenge of controlling the rather complex morphology38 of polymer entanglements and realizing favorable mixed domains for efficient charge separation and transport. The scarcity of suitable donor polymers also poses a challenge to find a perfect match in terms of energy level, absorption spectra, hole mobility, and morphology. Very recently, Yan et al.34 greatly promoted the key operating parameters in these ternary OSC devices by blending two low-cost polymer donors with a small molecule acceptor. Benefitting from the delicate control of polymer packing and phase separation, the device PCE is enhanced, while the mechanical stretchability was unknown. Liu et al.37 employed the polymer donor D18 as the third component in the binary blend system. The addition of D18 promoted the formation of a refined double-fibril network morphology, which facilitated exciton diffusion and charge carrier transport, and thus achieved a significant improvement in efficiency (19.6%). Yet, the mechanical properties of this top-efficiency ternary blend were still unknown. At present, there is a scarcity of systematic research on the influence of the second polymer donor on the mechanical properties of the blend system and a lack of understanding of the inner relationship between the film microstructure and mechanical properties of such ternary blend systems.
Building upon the excellent starting point of the high-efficiency PM6:N3 binary blend, herein we focused on less explored, yet promising ternary OSCs featuring dual donor polymers (see Fig. 1a). Concretely, a low-cost conjugated polymer poly[(thiophene)-alt-(6,7-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyloxy)quinoxaline)] (PTQ10),39 classified as a molecular 2D semi-paracrystalline polymer, was introduced to optimize the mechanical and photovoltaic properties of the best-in-class photovoltaic blend PM6:N3. By gradually modulating the relative weight ratio of the two donors, the composition dependence of two key mechanical parameters (elastic modulus and crack-onset strain) of these ternary blend active layers was mapped out by a series of thin-film mechanical characterization studies. We have successfully produced both improved photovoltaic and mechanical performances in the optimized PM6:PTQ10:N3-based OSCs at a polymer blend ratio of 4:1. As far as we know, this ternary system is one of the few cases that have achieved improvements in both efficiency and mechanical stretchability in ternary OSCs, and dual donor polymer ternary OSCs in particular. With the help of meticulous X-ray scattering and microscopy analysis, these decisively enhanced performances were ascribed to the ordered molecular packing and moderate domain spacing. The correlations between microstructure, film ductility, and device performance were further revealed. Satisfyingly, the composition dependence of the elastic moduli can be predicted via a theoretical model for these ternary blend films based on dual-donor polymers. Our first realization of modulus prediction and improved performance in these previously poorly explored ternary systems provides a nice reference for the research of many other ternary systems and also plays a guiding role in future mechanical research on a pool of organic multicomponent systems.40

2 Results and discussion
2.1 Physical properties of neat materials
The introduction of a polymer with better molecular order is expected to offer some benefits for optimizing the morphology and performance of highly brittle polymer:nonfullerene small molecule blends. As can be seen from Fig. S1 and S2,†PTQ10, PM6, and N3 have the characteristics of complementary absorption spectra, energy level matching, etc. As for molecular order, a recent study40 identified PM6 as a highly amorphous polymer and PTQ10 as a 2D semi-paracrystalline polymer. Herein we comparatively examined the molecular packing and order of these two donor polymers via GIWAXS (Fig. 1b) at beamline 1W1A of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). The 1D profiles of the GIWAXS patterns were extracted (Fig. 1c) and the detailed structural parameters via multi-peak fitting are shown in Tables S1 and S2.† As depicted in Fig. 1b and c, the molecular order of PTQ10 is higher compared with that of PM6. To gain a quantitative understanding, the azimuthal distribution of (010) diffraction peaks of the two donor polymers was analyzed to obtain the pole figures, and the rDoC was determined (Fig. 1d and e). The rDoC of PTQ10 is approximately 20% more than that of PM6, which also verifies the better molecular order of PTQ10 (see Table S3†). Besides, PTQ10 has greater mechanical stretchability than PM6 (Fig. 1f), as evidenced by the crack-onset-strain (COS) data from the film-on-elastomer (FOE) method (Fig. S3 and Table S4†). Motivated by the molecular order and COS results, we adopt PTQ10 as a second donor polymer to the PM6:N3 blend. In the following sections, the morphological, mechanical, and photovoltaic properties of the ternary system with two donor polymers will be studied in detail.
2.2 Molecular packing and phase separation
Next, the impact of the introduction of PTQ10 and the changes in the microstructure were analyzed. First, as shown in Fig. 2a, the corresponding surface morphology of the blend systems was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). It can be clearly found that the blend films with different blend proportions all showed smooth fiber surface features.41 No obvious aggregates were formed, indicating the absence of large phase segregation between donor polymers and the small molecule acceptor. With the addition of PTQ10, the root-mean-square surface roughness (Rq) of the blend films decreased gradually (from 1.02 nm to 0.85 nm), which implies that the addition of a second donor polymer PTQ10 further regulates the aggregation ability42 of molecules in the blend system.

The histogram of the rDoC values of (f) (100) lamellar stacking peaks and (h) (010) π–π stacking peaks of the three blend films. 
To further quantitatively describe the feature size of the phase separation in the blend films, we plotted the power spectral density (PSD) curves through the fast Fourier transform analysis of the AFM phase images,43,44 which are shown in Fig. 2b. No new characteristic peaks emerge in all the blend films, indicating that the addition of PTQ10 does not promote the formation of additional domains. With the increase in the proportion of PTQ10, the corresponding domain size increases first and then decreases (see Table S5†), and it reaches a moderate value (29.8 nm) when the proportion of PTQ10 in the donor polymers is 20 wt%. The addition of a small amount of PTQ10 (20 wt%) can slightly change the phase separation of the film.
Then, we performed GIWAXS characterization studies on PM6:N3, PTQ10:N3, and the 20 wt% PTQ10-containing ternary system (Fig. 2c), which can further clarify the influence of the introduction of PTQ10 on the molecular stacking and crystallinity45–47 of the blend system. The corresponding OOP and IP profiles are shown in Fig. 2d, and the corresponding parameters are recorded in Tables S6–S8.† In the PM6:N3 binary blend system, the (010) diffraction peak related to PM6 (q = ∼1.7 Å−1) has a coherence length (CL) value of 20.9 Å, while the (010) diffraction peak of N3 is at q = ∼1.8 Å−1 and the corresponding CL value is 23.3 Å. With the addition of 20 wt% PTQ10, the CL value corresponding to the (010) diffraction peak of PM6 (q = ∼1.69 Å−1) increases to 28.1 Å. As the peak positions of PTQ10 and N3 are too close (the corresponding peak positions of PTQ10 and N3 are ∼1.79 and ∼1.81 Å−1, respectively), peak deconvolution cannot be conducted effectively. The CL value of the corresponding π–π stacking peak (q = ∼1.8 Å−1) of PTQ10 and N3 is 27.3 Å, which is also larger than that (22.7 Å) of the π–π stacking peak of the PTQ10:N3 blend system located at q = 1.79 Å−1. Therefore, with the addition of PTQ10, the molecular packing of the blend system becomes more ordered.
Next, to quantify and further confirm the influence of the addition of PTQ10 on the crystallinity and molecular orientation of the corresponding system, we carried out the pole figure and the rDoC analyses for different diffraction peaks. We plotted the pole figures of (010) π–π stacking peaks and (100) lamellar stacking peaks (Fig. 2e and g), respectively. By integrating the diffraction intensities of all angles (ω) in the range of 0° to 90° to calculate the rDoC values of different blend films (Fig. 2f and h), we found that the (010) π–π stacking peaks and (100) lamellar stacking peaks of blend films show the same trend. The rDoC value reaches the highest value in the ternary blend system (see Table S9†), indicating that the ternary film has a more ordered molecular stacking with the addition of 20 wt% PTQ10. This likely facilitates the transport of charges, thus contributing to the improvement of JSC.48,49
2.3 Photovoltaic and mechanical properties
We investigated the device performance by characterizing the OSC devices with a conventional architecture (Fig. 3a), where ITO/PEDOT:PSS was used for hole collection and PNDIT-F3N/Ag was employed for collecting electrons. The mass ratio of polymer donors (PM6 and PTQ10) and the nonfullerene acceptor (N3) was kept constant at 1:1.2. As shown in Fig. 3b and Table 1, the device efficiency slightly increased to 16.9% when an appropriate amount (20 wt%) of PTQ10 was added to the blend system. Compared with the binary systems, the ternary blend possessed better short-circuit current density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF).

To figure out the reasons for the improved photovoltaic performance of the device, we analyzed the photocurrent density (Jph) and the effective voltage (Veff), and then studied the exciton dissociation process (Fig. 3c). The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) is the ratio of Jph/Jsat. Jsat stands for the saturation current density, and Jph is the difference between the current density in the dark and under light. Veff is the difference between the voltage at zero Jph and the applied voltage. All blend systems have Pdiss values well above 90%, and saturation of Jph can be achieved at low Veff, indicating that charge separation in different systems is efficient. At the same time, we found that the exciton dissociation probability of the ternary system increased to a high extent (98.1%) after the addition of 20 wt% PTQ10, indicating that the addition of PTQ10 has a positive effect on exciton dissociation and plays a promoting role in the realization of higher current.
In addition to the photovoltaic performance, we compared the mechanical performance of various blend films by FOE and peak force quantitative nanomechanical mapping (PFQNM) methods. Interestingly, the device efficiency and mechanical stretchability both reach the maximum values when the content of PTQ10 is 20 wt% (see Table 2). As shown in Fig. 3e and S5,† the ternary system gave rise to the best COS of ∼10% when the weight content of PTQ10 reaches 20%. At the same time, the elastic modulus of the ternary blend film is measured, and the elastic modulus is gradually reduced with the addition of PTQ10 (Fig. 3f and S6†). As shown by the FOE data, the ternary blend film with 20 wt% PTQ10 possesses a COS value of 9.5 ± 0.9% and an elastic modulus of 1.13 ± 0.12 GPa. In a previous study,19 we tried to introduce a common fullerene acceptor PC71BM as the third component to regulate the mechanical properties of the PM6:N3 mixture, and achieved an improved mechanical property of 9.3 ± 0.9%. In the present study, the introduction of a second polymer donor has obtained a COS value comparable to the results in prior work. In addition to the FOE tests, we measured the elastic moduli of all blend films through the PFQNM method. The corresponding PFQNM modulus images of different blend films are shown in Fig. 3d. Their average elastic moduli gradually decreased from 2.01 GPa to 1.62 GPa. Although the elastic moduli measured by the PFQNM method are different from those measured by FOE, the elastic moduli measured by both methods show the same change trend, i.e., the elastic modulus gradually decreases with increasing PTQ10 content. This can be understood by the fact that the elastic modulus of the third component PTQ10 is much lower (see Fig. 1f, S4, and S7†).

2.4 Prediction of mechanical parameters
Understanding the mechanical properties is key to flexible/wearable solar cells. The modulus prediction of neat films50 and binary blend films51–53 has been nicely demonstrated. Yet, the prediction of mechanical properties of ternary blend films is much more complicated, and prior efforts have met with only limited success.22 Particularly, the theoretical understanding of new ternary blends based on dual donor polymers has not been achieved thus far. Herein, we attempted to fill this gap by applying the knowledge of classic polymer mechanics.
For the simplest mechanical models for the three component systems, the parallel and series models of elastic modulus are described as follows: Eu = E1Φ1 + E2Φ2 + E3Φ3(1) (2)
As shown in Fig. 4, our data points follow neither the series model nor the parallel model. More complicated models are thus needed. We noted that the equivalent box model (EBM) was used to predict the elastic modulus of multicomponent polymer systems.22,54–58 This motivated us to understand the ternary OSC systems with the EBM. As shown in Fig. S8,† the EBM is generally a mixed form of series and parallel models. As a consequence, the model curve of the EBM is located between the parallel and series model curves. The EBM for predicting the elastic modulus can be expressed by using the following equation: Ec = EpΦp + EsΦs(3)
 Fig. 4  (a) The 3D surface diagram and (b) its yz direction view of the three mechanical models and experimental data (obtained from the FOE measurements) of PM6:PTQ10:N3 blend films. 3D surface diagrams represent various model expectations. 
Based on eqn (1)–(3), e EBM of elastic modulus for the three components can be expressed as: (4)where Ei and Φi represent the elastic modulus and corresponding volume fraction of each component, respectively. Based on the moduli data of neat films and one modulus data for a ternary blend, we assumed that 60% of each component is in the parallel branch. According to the elastic modulus of the three neat films measured by the FOE method, the modulus of each blend system measured by FOE is in good agreement with the predicted data via the EBM. Therefore, the EBM is a feasible model for predicting the modulus of the dual donor blend system PM6:PTQ10:N3, which can predict the modulus of the blend system through the elastic modulus of the pure films. Though some imperfections exist and assumptions are made, the fits are good enough to predict the modulus. At the same time, this prediction also provides some ideas for the theoretical explanation of the new ternary blend based on dual donor polymers.
2.5 Structure–property correlations
In previous studies, materials such as acceptors20,22 and thermoplastic elastomers21 have been explored, but there are still few studies on the use of an additional polymer donor as the third component. In addition, the properties remain poorly examined for dual-donor polymer-based ternary OSCs. In this study, PTQ10 was introduced as the third component to explore the structure–property relationships in these seldomly studied ternary OSCs. When PTQ10 is 20 wt% in the donor component, the ternary system achieves the best photovoltaic performance (∼17%) and the highest crack-onset strain (∼10%). As the third component, PTQ10 can effectively promote the improvement of photovoltaic and mechanical properties of the blend systems. The relationships between the morphological characteristics of the blend system, photovoltaic properties, and mechanical properties have motivated our interest. Next, we will try to connect these three to construct a more instructive picture by drawing Fig. 5, a schematic diagram to describe the blend morphology of the films with different components and their influences on tensile properties.
 Fig. 5  Schematic summary of the effect of the second donor polymer on the blend morphology and tensile properties of the original films and the respective stretched films: the (a and b) PM6:N3 blend film; (c and d) ternary PM6:PTQ10:N3 blend film containing 20 wt% PTQ10 in the donor component; (e and f) PTQ10:N3 blend film. 
Based on our GIWAXS and AFM characterization studies, the molecular order change induced by the addition of PTQ10 is the main reason for the performance improvement. As a polymer donor, PTQ10 has a simpler structure and a greater molecular order compared with PM6. The addition of a small amount (20 wt%) of PTQ10 increases the probability of π–π stacking between molecules and chain entanglements.35 In the stretching process, more energy is dissipated in the process of untangling the chain59,60 and breaking π–π stacking.20 At the same time, as π–π stacking has greater advantages in the charge transport process than lamellar stacking, the more ordered molecular arrangement and higher π–π stacking intensity in the ternary system are advantageous to improving the photovoltaic performance of the device.61–65 With the addition of PTQ10, the crystallinity in the blend system gradually increases as the polymer PTQ10 has a stronger molecular order. The increase of π–π stacking order results in the improvement of film stretchability. We stress that 20 wt% might not be the optimum weight composition of a second polymer donor for other ternary blends based on dual-donor polymers, due to the differences in molecular size and miscibility. The gained knowledge might be also applicable to organic photodetectors66 employing dual donor polymers.
3 Conclusions
In this work, a 2D semi-paracrystalline polymer PTQ10 was employed as a morphological modulator to realize improved efficiency and mechanical stretchability in OSCs. To the best of our knowledge, this ternary system is one of the few cases that have achieved improvements in both efficiency and mechanical stretchability in ternary OSCs, and dual donor ternary OSCs in particular. We thoroughly investigated mechanical and photovoltaic properties in a ternary blend of a nonfullerene acceptor N3 and a polymeric mixture of PM6 and PTQ10. The variation of the polymer blend ratio allowed us to tune the active layer morphology continuously. The photovoltaic performance, surface morphology, phase separation, molecular order, and mechanical parameters of the ternary blend films and their composition dependence were systematically characterized. We found that the addition of the third component PTQ10 with an appropriate content (20 wt%) can create a more ordered molecular arrangement and higher π–π stacking intensity, thereby achieving effective improvement of both photovoltaic efficiency and crack-onset strain. It was also found that the elastic modulus decreased monotonically with the increase in the PTQ10 content.
More importantly, we successfully proved that a mechanical model EBM can effectively capture the change in elastic modulus of these rarely explored ternary OSCs. That is, the elastic modulus of the ternary blend system can be feasibly predicted by simply inputting the modulus data of the neat films. This work provides a good reference for the research on a dual donor ternary system, which is scarcely studied, and also provides some new inspiration for future research on ternary solar cells. Meanwhile, as N3 is a newly emerging nonfullerene small molecule acceptor that belongs to the best-known Y6 family, our mechanical predictions and mechanical–morphology relationships might be expanded to a large pool of systems based on dual donor polymers and Y-series acceptors. Other kinds of organic optoelectronic blends, for instance, ternary all-polymer blends,67–69 might also benefit from this facile strategy.
