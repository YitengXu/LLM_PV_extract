    , Accepted 24th February 2014First published on 25th February 2014AbstractPolyaniline (PANI) was grafted onto multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) in order to increase the number of reactive groups on the MWCNT. The PANI was subsequently doped with 4-mercaptobenzoic acid providing coordinating sites to adsorb a quantitative amount of quantum dots (QDs). Treating such a modified MWCNT in a suspension of QDs, a MWCNT-based composite was obtained and employed as an electrode in a solar cell. The composite was denoted as MWCNT@PANI-SH@QDs, and the solar cell studied in this paper was denoted as a QDs sensitized solar cell (QDSSC). It was found that excited electrons from the QDs were effectively transferred to MWCNT with minimal energy loss via phonon formation and photon recombination. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of the QDSSC reached 3.76% under AM 1.5 illumination.
1. Introduction
As their power conversion efficiency may exceed the Shockley and Queisser limit,1,2 quantum dots (QDs)3,4 sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs)5–7 have attracted enormous attention from both engineers and scientists over the past decade. So far, a major challenge for improving the performance of QDSSC has been focused on inhibiting electronic recombination.8–10 One dimensional nanotubes have been extensively utilized as a bridge to provide an electronic pathway from QDs to the electrode, e.g. TiO2,11,12 ZnO,13,14 and Si nanotubes.15,16 In particular, due to their large surface area, high conductivity, high aspect ratio, and chemical stability, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have arisen as a superior candidate over other nanotubes.17–19 However, the chemically inert surface of CNTs has restricted the attachment of QDs,20,21 and the efficiency of transferring electrons has hardly been enhanced.22,23 For this reason, strengthening the interaction between CNTs and QDs is a prerequisite for fabricating QDSSCs with higher power conversion efficiencies.24,25
The most promising method for the attachment of QDs onto CNTs seems to be chemical functionalization.26,27 When a moiety with a conjugated electron cloud (P–π or π–π)28,29 and functional groups (–NH2, –COOH or –SH)30,31 is anchored onto the surface of CNTs, a bridge between the CNTs and QDs is generated.32,33 As a result, CNTs were sensitized by QDs and could be used as a solar cell electrode to achieve a higher power conversion efficiency.34,35 Dirk M. Guldi36 synthesised QDs and CNT hybrids using pyrene as a covalent bridge. Under AM 1.5 illumination, a short circuit current of 0.22 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 0.1 V, a fill factor of 20.4%, and an efficiency of 0.0044% were observed. Punit Kohli37 reported that a thiol derivative of perylene could act as a molecular linker and significantly increase the adhesion between QDs and CNTs. The resulting composites showed a 2–4 fold increase in their photoconductivity when exposed to AM 1.5 solar-simulated light.
In this article, 4-mercaptobenzoic acid-doped conductive polyaniline (PANI-SH) was chosen as an absorbent for QDs, which were covalently bonded onto the surface of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). As each repeat unit of PANI-SH provides a coordinating site for QDs, a sufficient quantity of QDs could be stably attached to form a composite, i.e., MWCNT bearing QDs connected via PANI-SH, which is denoted throughout as MWCNT@PANI-SH@QDs. It was expected that, with such a structure, excited electrons could be readily transferred from QDs to the MWCNT and a higher power conversion efficiency could be obtained.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) (purity ≥ 95%, diameter 10–30 nm and length 0.5–500 μm) were provided from Shenzhen Nanotech Port. Cadmium oxide (CdO), selenium (Se), P-phenylenediamine (PPD), 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and oleic acid were purchased from Vas Chemicals Co., China. 1-Octadecene (90%) and tri-n-octylphosphine (90%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar, USA. N-Methyl pyrrolidone (NMP, 99%) was purchased from Beijing YILI Fine Chemical Co. Dimethylbenzene (DMB, 99%), acetone (99.5%), ethanol (99.7%), chloroform, acetonitrile, methanol, 1,4-dioxane, nitric acid (HNO3, 70%), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98%) and HCl (36.0%) were purchased from the Beijing Chemical Factory. Sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS, 99%), ammonium persulfate (APS, 98.5%), aniline (≥99.5%), I2 (99.8%), lithium iodide (LiI) and lithium perchlorate (LiClO4) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.
2.2. Preparation of polyaniline-grafted MWCNT
As illustrated in Fig. 1, pristine MWCNT (1 g) were dispersed in a concentrated acid mixture (H2SO4 20 ml and HNO3 20 ml) over 30 min. The resulting suspension was heated and refluxed at 140 °C for 40 min. The acid-treated MWCNT were filtrated and washed with deionized water five times, then once with ethanol and dried in a vacuum.38
 Fig. 1  Schematic showing the preparation of MWCNT@PANI-SH. 
The acid-treated MWCNT (0.06 g) were dispersed in 1,4-dioxane (20 ml) using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. PPD (3 g) was added to the solution with mechanical stirring and the mixture was heated at a constant temperature (80 °C) for 5 h. The PPD-grafted MWCNT (PPD-g-MWCNT) were washed with ethanol three times.
The polyaniline-grafted MWCNT were synthesized in a series emulsion reactions. Firstly, DMB (20 ml) was dispersed in deionized water (60 ml) using SDBS (2 g) as a surfactant and an emulsion was obtained after vigorous stirring for 30 min. Secondly, PPD-g-MWCNT (0.072 g) was dispersed in the DMB phase using ultrasonic vibration for 30 min. Subsequently, liquid aniline monomer (0.4 g) was added to the emulsion with mechanical stirring at low temperature (3 ± 1 °C), which dissolved in the DMB phase. A 20 ml solution of 0.95 g APS, 0.8 ml HCl, and 0.6 g PTSA in deionized water was then added dropwise to the emulsion with vigorous stirring to initiate the polymerization of the aniline. The terminal PPD groups on the MWCNT also participated in the polymerization of aniline resulting in polyaniline grafting onto the surface of the MWCNT. The reaction was continued for 12 h at 3 ± 1 °C. The polymerization was terminated by pouring the reaction mixture into acetone, and a dark green precipitate was obtained, which is denoted as MWCNT@PANI. Finally, the product was filtrated and repeatedly rinsed with ethanol, 1 M HCl solution, DMF, and NMP.39,40
2.3. Doping of MWCNT@PANI with 4-mercaptobenzoic acid
The green powder, MWCNT@PANI (0.06 g), was dispersed in N-methyl pyrrolidone (20 ml) using ultrasonic vibration for 30 min. Subsequently, 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (1.8 g) was introduced and the mixture was mechanically stirred for 12 h at room temperature. The MWCNT@PANI was became doped with 4-mercaptobenzoic acid. As shown in Fig. 1, each dopant had an –SH group at its end. Finally, the product was rinsed three times with ethanol to remove any un-reacted 4-mercaptobenzoic acid. The doped MWCNT@PANI is denoted as MWCNT@PANI-SH.
2.4. Preparation of CdS coated CdSe quantum dots
A mixture of CdO (25 mg), oleic acid (2.670 g), and 1-octadecene (9.864 g) was heated at 260 °C with vigorous stirring until the solution became a transparent liquid. A selenium solution (TBP-Se, 1.0 ml, 0.125 M) was introduced into the transparent liquid at 260 °C. The reaction between selenium and CdO lasted for 20 s and the system was cooled by pouring the mixture into cold ethanol. The obtained CdSe QDs were purified using standard procedures. The purified CdSe QDs were dispersed in a fresh batch of the transparent liquid mentioned above, into which a sulfide solution (TBP-S, 2.0 ml, 0.125 M) was introduced, and the system was then heated from 120 to 260 °C over 10 min and left for a designated time.41 The CdSe QDs in the system were coated with a layer of CdS forming core–shell QDs, denoted as CdS@CdSe, which were then cooled by dispersing them into a mixture of CHCl3 and CH3OH (vol. ratio = 1:1) at (0–5 °C). The formed QDs were retrieved through high-speed centrifugation.42
2.5. Adsorption of CdS@CdSe onto MWCNT@PANI-SH
As illustrated in Fig. 2, MWCNT@PANI-SH (0.08 g) was dispersed in THF (10 ml). Into this solution a specific amount of CdS@CdSe QDs was added and the mixture was vigorously stirred for 10 h at room temperature. The product was filtrated and rinsed five times with ethanol. Due to coordination between the QDs and –SH groups, a quantitative amount of QDs was decorated onto MWCNT@PANI-SH, this composite is denoted as MWCNT@PANI-SH@QDs.

2.6. Preparation of a quantum dot sensitized solar cell
MWCNT@PANI-SH@QDs (0.01 g) was dispersed in THF (10 ml). This solution (0.15 g) was dropped onto FTO glass substrates and spun at 2000 rpm for 1 min. The process was repeated for the designated number of times in order to obtain the required thickness.43 Pt-coated FTO glass was used as the counter electrode. The electrolyte was composed of 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4 in an acetonitrile solution.44,45 A structural schematic and energy band diagram of the fabricated solar cell are presented in Fig. 3. Electrons were transmitted from QDs to MWCNT through the P–π electron cloud of PANI, and then collected by FTO from MWCNT, leading the generation of a photocurrent.30,36,46–49

2.7 Characterization
Raman spectroscopy (JY, HR800, wavelength 532 nm) was used to test the surface structure of MWCNT. Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (Nicolet-Nexus 670 FT-IR) testing was carried out using pellet samples with KBr. Energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) was conducted using a Hitachi-S4700 scanning electron microscope. Wide-angle X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku D/Max 2400, Japan) patterns were recorded using nickel-filtered Cu-Ka radiation and the scattering angle (2θ) ranged from 20 to 80° at 2° per minute. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, JEOL JEM-3010 electron microscope) was used to observe the micro morphology of QDs and MWCNT@PANI-SH@QDs. Fluorescence microscopy images were obtained using an Olympus IX80 optical microscope. Fluorescence spectra were recorded using a F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Absorption spectra were monitored with a CINTRA 20 UV spectrophotometer. Samples of QDs and MWCNT@PANI-SH@QDs were both dispersed in THF. The thickness of the MWCNT@PANI-SH@QDs film was tested using scanning electron microscopy (JEOL 7800F) and a thickness gauge (CH-1-S/ST). Photographs were taken using a digital camera. The photovoltaic performances of the devices were measured using a solar simulator (Model 69907, Oriel) and a Keithley Source Meter (2420) under AM 1.5 illumination.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Preparation of MWCNT@PANI-SH
The FT-IR spectrum of acid-oxidized MWCNT is shown in Fig. 4a with the stretching vibration peak of CO in the –COOH groups at 1711 cm−1. When PPD was covalently attached, the FT-IR spectrum for PPD-g-MWCNT shown in Fig. 4b was obtained, in which the vibrations of benzene (3060 cm−1) as well as the N–C (1638 cm−1) and CO (1566 cm−1) stretching vibrations of an amide are observed. As PPD participated in the polymerization of aniline,50 PANI was grafted onto the MWCNT. Thereby, in the FT-IR spectrum of MWCNT@PANI, C–N–C stretching vibration at 1299 cm−1 was observed, as shown in Fig. 4c. After covalently bonding to PANI, a P–π conjugated structure was constructed on the surface of MWCNT. In addition, –SH groups participated in further reaction and were modified onto MWCNT through 4-mercaptobenzoic acid doped into the repeating PANI units.51 As such, the FT-IR spectrum of MWCNT@PANI-SH has a stretching vibration for CH2–S bonds at 2673 cm−1, as shown in Fig. 4d.

In contrast to MWCNT, the XRD pattern of MWCNT@PANI exhibited the (011) and (020) crystal planes of PANI at 8.4 and 19.5°, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5.52 In addition, the covalent bonds between PANI and MWCNT were proven using Raman spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 6. The G-band of PPD-g-MWCNT was blue-shifted from 1571 to 1575 cm−1.53 In MWCNT@PANI, the G-band was further blue-shifted to 1580 cm−1, and peaks for the CN and C–H bonds in PANI were also observed at 1500 and 1120 cm−1, respectively.54

The EDS curve also indicated the successful modification of MWCNT with PPD due to the emergence of elemental N (Fig. 7b). After the grafting of PANI, the concentration of element N increased to 7.96 wt% (Fig. 7c). It was calculated that the repeating unit of PANI accounted for about 0.5 × 10−2 mol g−1 in MWCNT@PANI. In addition, because the molar ratio between elemental N and S was 4.72:1 in MWCNT@PANI-SH (Fig. 7d), it was determined that there were about every five repeating units of PANI were doped with a molecule of 4-mercaptobenzoic acid.

3.2 Preparation of MWCNT@PANI-SH@QDs
TEM images of QDs are presented in Fig. 8. It was found that the diameter of the CdSe core was 2.4 ± 0.2 nm. As the capping time was increased to 10, 20, 30 and 40 min, the diameter of the synthesized CdS@CdSe QDs was increased to 3.1 ± 0.2, 3.4 ± 0.2, 3.7 ± 0.2 and 4.0 ± 0.2 nm, respectively. Thereby, the shell thicknesses were about 0.35, 0.5, 0.65 and 0.8 nm, respectively.

As shown in Fig. 9, the light emitted by the synthesized CdS@CdSe QDs also exhibited a red-shift from 541 to 661 nm with the increasing diameter from 3.1 ± 0.2 to 3.4 ± 0.2, then 3.7 ± 0.2 and 4.0 ± 0.2 nm. In addition, the CdS@CdSe QDs with the red light emission were used as a template to synthesize MWCNT@PANI-SH@QDs in the following work.

As shown in Fig. 10, it was found that the CdS@CdSe QDs were decorated onto MWCNT@PANI-SH. The Cd:Se:S elemental weight ratio in the CdS@CdSe QDs was determined to be about 10:5:3 using EDS testing. The saturated concentration of CdS@CdSe in MWCNT@PANI-SH@QDs was calculated to be about 18 ± 0.2 wt%.

As shown in Fig. 11a, for the CdS@CdSe QDs, visible light started to be absorbed at around 650 nm. Although the first absorption peak should be exhibited at 450 nm, the peak was not evident. This phenomenon of CdS@CdSe QDs has been previously reported. L. J. An et al. found that the first absorption peak of QDs with core–shell structures was not evident.55 When a photon is absorbed, an electron in CdS@CdSe is transferred into the excited state. Light energy is stored as electrical energy. A shown in Fig. 11b, this excited electron can relax to the ground state emitting red light (for CdS@CdSe) or be quenched and transfer into the conduction band of MWCNT after CdS@CdSe is grafted onto MWCNT@PANI-SH.56

3.3 Properties of the quantum dot sensitized solar cell
The properties of a QDSSC based on a MWCNT@PANI-SH@QDs electrode were investigated. As shown in Fig. 12 and 13, the thicknesses of the MWCNT@PANI-SH@QDs (the concentration of CdS@CdSe in the composites was controlled to be 15 ± 0.2 wt%) films were controlled to be about 8 ± 0.5, 12 ± 0.5 and 16 ± 0.5 μm. It was found that Jsc increased with the increase in the thickness from 8 ± 0.5 to 12 ± 0.5 μm. This increase of Jsc was mainly caused by the increasing amount of MWCNT@PANI-SH@QDs giving greater optical absorption. However, when the film thickness was further increased to 16 ± 0.5 μm, the electron transport paths become longer than the diffusion length of the electrons, leading to increased recombination between the electrons and holes. As a result, Jsc decreased. This increased recombination also led to a decrease of both Voc, from 0.63 to 0.58 V, and the fill factor, from 47.88 to 36.36.5,57 Therefore, the most suitable thickness of the MWCNT@PANI-SH@QDs film on the electrode was 12 ± 0.5 μm and the highest power conversion efficiency reached was 2.58%.

Subsequently, the concentration of CdS@CdSe was controlled at 12 ± 0.2, 15 ± 0.2 and 18 ± 0.2 wt% in MWCNT@PANI-SH@QDs composites. These were then applied in QDSSCs of 12 ± 0.5 μm. As shown in Fig. 14 and 15, the enhancement of Jsc from 6.82 to 8.89 mA cm−2 was also the result of greater optical absorption.5 Moreover, because of the coordination between the CdS@CdSe QDs and –SH groups, it became easier for MWCNT@PANI-SH to connect each other with an increased concentration of CdS@CdSe. This connection decreased the volume resistivity of MWCNT@PANI-SH@QDs, and finally decreased the series resistance from 10.4 (12 ± 0.2 wt% sample) to 6.7 Ω cm2 (18 ± 0.2 wt% sample). The decreased series resistance was deduced to be the main reason for the fill factor increase for the 18 wt% sample.18,57 Hence, the highest power conversion efficiency achieved was 3.76% when CdS@CdSe was 18 ± 0.2 wt% in the composites.

After the modification of the –SH groups, PANI acted as a P–π conjugated linker between QDs and MWCNT. In MWCNT@PANI-SH@QDs, the –SH group constituted a coordinating site for QDs in the repeating PANI units. This incorporation of –SH groups significantly increased the adhesion between QDs and MWCNT via bonding between the QDs and –SH groups in MWCNT@PANI. Thus, excited electrons were more effectively transferred from the QDs to MWCNT with minimal energy loss due to phonon forming and photon recombination.36 As a result, the efficiency of the QDSSC with a MWCNT@PANI-SH@QDs electrode (3.76%) was not only higher than the mixture of MWCNT and QDs (0.41%), but also much higher than the mixture of MWCNT@PANI and QDs (0.69%).
4. Conclusion
MWCNT were modified with PANI and functionalized with –SH groups by doping with 4-mercaptobenzoic acid. MWCNT@PANI-SH quantitatively adsorbed QDs through coordination. As a result, the saturated concentration of QDs achieved was 18 ± 0.2 wt% in the MWCNT@PANI-SH@QDs composites. In addition, the power conversion efficiency of QDSSC increased from 0.41 to 3.76% under AM 1.5 illumination, when the thickness of the MWCNT@PANI-SH@QDs electrode film was 12 ± 0.5 μm and the concentration of CdS@CdSe in MWCNT@PANI-SH@QDs was 18 ± 0.2 wt%.
