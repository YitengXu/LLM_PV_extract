    , Accepted 10th February 2014First published on 10th February 2014AbstractWe have prepared pyramidally textured ZnO (PT-ZnO) films with a high light-scattering effect using a simple low temperature (75 °C) solution process that involved no annealing and vacuum processes. The PT-ZnO films, which were composed of dense ZnO columnar grains with a (101)-faceted pyramidal tip, were formed directly on a TCO substrate by electrodeposition. The electrodeposition was performed within 10 min from Zn(NO3)2 aqueous solutions that contained NaCl; during deposition, a two-step electrolytic current was applied to separately control the nucleation density and grain size of ZnO grains. Light-scattering effects from the pyramid structure were examined by measuring haze values in the visible region and comparing the results with those from planar and nanorod structures. The PT-ZnO films showed a haze value of ∼52%, which is 3.7 and 2.2 times higher than those of planar and nanorod ZnO films, respectively. On the basis of total transmittance and haze, the optimal thickness of the pyramidal textures was determined to be 0.7–1.2 μm. Theoretical simulation of light scattering on the PT-ZnO was performed using a simple geometric model which indicated that the refraction angle, path length and intensity of transmitted light vary significantly depending on the outer refractive index of ZnO. The light-trapping effect derived from the PT-ZnO was demonstrated by fabricating ZnO/Cu2O thin-film solar cells. The Cu2O solar cell using the PT-ZnO showed efficient light absorption, achieving a 1.3 times higher short circuit current density than that using the planar ZnO.
1 Introduction
Hexagonal wurtzite zinc oxide (ZnO) is an n-type semiconductor with a wide bandgap energy of 3.3 eV, a high electron mobility of ∼200 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the single crystal state,1 and a large exciton binding energy of 59 meV, affording transparent conductivity and room-temperature UV emission. These unique characteristics make ZnO a very attractive material especially in the field of thin-film solar cells2–4 and UV-emitting diodes,5–10 where crystalline ZnO is mainly employed in a film form. In general, the surface morphology of crystalline films, including the atomic arrangement and geometry, is determined by the preferred growth orientation and exposed crystal planes. Since various properties, such as the interfacial states, optical properties and catalytic activities, depend on the surface structure, controlling the preferred growth orientation and exposed crystal planes is a key to improve the device performance.
In fact, employing controlled micro-/nano-structures is an effective strategy for managing photons. Light-trapping and light-scattering behaviours in these structures have been investigated intensively.11–14 The pyramidal texture shown in Fig. 1f is one of the most important surface structures for photon management in solar cell and LED applications. For example, commercial crystalline Si solar cells achieve efficient light absorption using a regular inverted pyramidal texture, composed of the {111} facet, formed by anisotropic etching,15 and the efficiency of light emission of GaN- and GaAs-based LEDs can also be improved by adopting a textured surface.16–19 Recently, many efforts have been made to fabricate textured ZnO and introduce it into thin-film Si solar cell20–29 and LED30–32 technologies. The textured ZnO films have mainly been fabricated by a two-step process; deposition of a planar ZnO film by sputtering and subsequent wet chemical etching using an HCl solution. However, the ZnO surface after chemical etching develops a crater-like structure and has no regular facets. Hongsingthong et al.27 reported another two-step process to fabricate ZnO textures, where ZnO was deposited on reactive-ion-etched glass substrates using metal–organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). The surface roughness increased with glass etching time, exhibiting high light-scattering behaviour, where the texture composed of cauliflower-like ZnO.

The direct formation of well-faceted pyramidal ZnO on transparent substrates is, therefore, still a challenge. A feasible strategy for the formation of a faceted pyramidal structure is the utilization of the (101) plane in the hexagonal lattice. As shown in Fig. 1a, while the angle between the (100) and basal (001) planes is 90°, that between the (101) and basal (001) planes is 62°. Thus, the (100) and (001) planes can form a hexagonal cylindrical structure (Fig. 1b),33 and the (101) and (001) planes can form a hexagonal pyramidal structure (Fig. 1c), where the tip angle between the two ridge lines is 64°.34 In general, the exposed planes in the crystal growth process depend on both kinetic and thermodynamic factors, leading to a variety of structural morphologies. Inherent columnar growth of ZnO with the hexagonal cylindrical structure is mainly due to the difference in surface energies of the (001), (100) and (101) planes. Since the polar (001) and (101) planes have a larger surface energy than the non-polar (100) plane, ZnO grows with a large exposed (100) plane so as to minimize the total surface energy. Therefore, ZnO with a hexagonal pyramidal structure composed of only the (101) and (001) planes (Fig. 1c) has been prepared under peculiar conditions. Xie et al.34 reported that well-faceted pyramidal ZnO micro-particles could be synthesized in ionic liquids (a mixture of oleic acid and ethylenediamine) containing zinc acetate at 286 °C for 1 h. Also, Liu et al.35 reported that ZnOx pyramidal islands are obtained on Si(111) substrates by RF magnetron sputtering using a mixed gas of 20% H2 and 80% Ar at 400 °C for 30 min.
In this study, we adopted an alternative approach to readily form a pyramidal texture, where a hexagonal cylinder with a pyramidal tip (Fig. 1d) is utilized. If one can grow dense films composed of pointed cylinder grains so as to remove the sidewall, as shown in Fig. 1e, the film surface is equivalent to the (101)-faceted pyramidal texture. We used electrodeposition to grow structurally controlled ZnO on a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) substrate. This is a powerful technique to grow relatively large crystal grains with regular polyhedral faces resulting from mild growth conditions in aqueous solutions (<90 °C and ambient pressure), and it also offers a low-cost and scalable process. In 1996, Izaki et al.36 and Lincot et al.37 reported electrodeposition of ZnO using Zn(NO3)2 and ZnCl2 aqueous solutions, respectively. Although thereafter a variety of structures including epitaxial films,38–42 nanowires,43–45 nanorods,46–48 nano cauliflowers49,50 and nano plates51 have been prepared on conductive substrates, there are no reports on dense (101)-faceted ZnO films, to the best of our knowledge. Here, we show that (101)-faceted pyramidally textured ZnO (PT-ZnO) can be directly grown on a TCO substrate from aqueous solutions in 350–550 s at 75 °C, which shows haze values as high as 52%. To understand the light-scattering behaviour of the PT-ZnO, theoretical simulation is presented as a function of the refractive index of media outside ZnO. We also demonstrate the application of the PT-ZnO to Cu2O thin-film solar cells, where efficient light absorption derived from the pyramidal structure is achieved.
2 Results and discussion
2.1 Preparation and characterization of pyramidally textured ZnO

Fig. 2a shows a ZnO nanorod array electrodeposited on an F-doped SnO2 coated glass (FTO) substrate from an aqueous solution (75 °C) containing 15 mM (M = mol L−1) Zn(NO3)2 at an applied cathodic current density of 0.4 mA cm−2 and a total electric charge of 0.9 C cm−2. A plausible deposition mechanism has been proposed, as follows:52NO3− + H2O + 2e− → NO2− + 2OH−Zn2+ + 2OH− → Zn(OH)2Zn(OH)2 → ZnO + H2OThe reduction of nitrate ions because of cathodic current leads to an increase in the pH in the vicinity of the FTO substrate, which induces the deposition of amorphous Zn(OH)2 on FTO. Crystalline ZnO is subsequently formed by dehydration. The nucleation density and diameter of ZnO grains are mainly affected by both the current density and concentration of Zn(NO3)2.47,53 The shape of the obtained ZnO nanorods (100–200 nm in diameter and ∼1.2 μm in length) corresponds to the “hexagonal cylinder” (Fig. 1b) composed of the (100) sidewall and basal (001) planes. Interestingly, a ZnO nanorod array with a pointed tip (200–300 nm in diameter and ∼1.2 μm in length, Fig. 2b), corresponding to the “hexagonal cylinder with a pyramidal tip” (Fig. 1d), was obtained under the same deposition conditions except for adding an equimolar amount of NaCl to the electrolyte. As shown in the inset of Fig. 2b, the tip angle between the two ridge lines is 64°, indicating that the pyramidal tip is composed of the (101) planes. It should be noted that the addition of other chloride compounds such as KCl and NH4Cl to a Zn(NO3)2 solution resulted in a similar ZnO nanorod with a pyramidal tip. These results indicate that Cl− ions play an important role in the change of the exposed tip plane from (001) to (101).

The effect of Cl− ions (0.1 M KCl) on the morphology of ZnO electrodeposited from Zn(NO3)2 solutions (1–100 mM) has been investigated in detail by Pradhan and Leung,51 where wall-, disk-, spike- and pillar-like structures were obtained on ITO substrates. Results in the literature indicate that Cl− has two main effects on the ZnO morphology: (i) the formation of zinc hydroxychloride, Zn5(OH)8Cl2·H2O, which was detected in the wall-, disk- and spike-like structures and (ii) the adsorption of Cl− on the polar ZnO planes. Also in this study, plate-like structures were observed along with a ZnO nanorod array when the concentration of Cl− was increased from 15 to 30 mM, while plate-like structures and zinc hydroxychloride were not detected in the pointed ZnO nanorod array shown in Fig. 2b. Therefore, the stabilization of the polar (101) ZnO plane by adsorbed Cl− is a possible reason for the change in the tip shape.
To achieve the formation of the “dense hexagonal cylinder with a pyramidal tip” morphology (Fig. 1e) by closing the gaps between the ZnO nanorods in Fig. 2b, there are two simple approaches: increasing the nanorod density or diameter. Indeed, both are possible by increasing the applied current density. When a high current density of 2.0 mA cm−2 was applied instead of 0.4 mA cm−2 from the beginning of electrodeposition, the ZnO nucleation increased approximately 2.5 times, resulting in a dense nanorod array with a diameter of ∼250 nm (see Fig. S1†). On the other hand, when the high current density was applied after the initial nucleation at a low current density of 0.4 mA cm−2 for 10 s, lateral growth facilitated while the nanorod density remained unchanged, resulting in a dense nanorod array with a relatively large average diameter of 300–450 nm. Fig. 3 depicts a dense ZnO nanorod array (∼0.9 μm in thickness) obtained using two-step electrodeposition where the second current density of 2.0 mA cm−2 was applied for 450 s (total electric charge = 0.9 C cm−2). As shown in Fig. 3, a pyramidally textured ZnO (PT-ZnO) film corresponding to Fig. 1e is consequently formed homogeneously on the FTO substrate. The structural and electrical properties of the PT-ZnO film were evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and in-plane resistivity measurements, respectively. The XRD measurements confirmed that the PT-ZnO film has the hexagonal wurtzite structure with a high degree of 〈001〉 preferred growth orientation (see Fig. S2†). The in-plane resistivity measurements using the van der Pauw method were performed on the PT-ZnO film, which was embedded in insulating epoxy resin to form a pellet, revealing that the in-plane resistivity was approximately 100 Ω cm.53,54

The light-scattering effect derived from a pyramidal structure was evaluated by haze measurements at 380–780 nm using a UV-vis spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. For comparison, in addition to a bare FTO substrate, two different ZnO samples with a planar structure (∼0.9 μm in thickness, Fig. 4c) and a nanorod structure (∼100 nm in diameter and ∼0.6 μm in length, Fig. 4d) were also prepared by electrodeposition. Haze is defined as the ratio of diffuse transmittance TD to total optical transmittance TT, and higher haze values mean that the scattered component is larger than the vertical one.29Fig. 4a and b show transmittance (TT and TD) and haze spectra for the four samples, respectively. Optical values obtained from these spectra are summarized in Table 1. The FTO and planar ZnO samples had a similar spectral shape, exhibiting averaged values of TT ≈ 80%, TD ≈ 11% and haze = 13–14%. This result is attributed to similar optical properties in the visible region and surface roughness of ZnO and FTO: an ∼20% decrease in TT is mainly due to the reflectance loss at the air/glass and oxides/air interfaces. The ZnO nanorod sample showed a light scattering effect at shorter wavelengths (<600 nm) with averaged values of TT = 79%, TD = 18% and haze = 23%. On the other hand, TT, TD and haze spectra of the PT-ZnO sample were dramatically different from those of the other three samples and were lower by 9–15%, higher by 18–27% and higher by 17–50% than those of the planar ZnO, respectively, exhibiting averaged values of TT = 70%, TD = 36% and haze = 52% (which is 3.7 times higher than that of the planar ZnO).

To understand the growth process and find out the optimal thickness of the PT-ZnO, ZnO was electrodeposited by varying the deposition time of the second step (applied current density = 2.0 mA cm−2) from 0 to 650 s while maintaining the same conditions of the first step (0.4 mA cm−2, 10 s). Fig. 5a shows a FESEM image of ZnO after 10 s deposition at a current density of 0.4 mA cm−2 (second-step time = 0 s), where columnar grains (∼50 nm in diameter and length) with a pointed tip had already grown sparsely. As shown in Fig. 5b (second-step time = 60 s), the diameter of ZnO grains increases when increasing the applied current density to 2.0 mA cm−2 while the number of grains remains unchanged. This result indicates that the initial nucleation is within a few seconds and the number of grains is almost fixed at that point. It should also be noted that the shape of the ZnO grains is controlled by the Cl− ions from the initial stage. As the deposition time increased (Fig. 5c and d), ZnO grains grew both in the vertical and lateral directions while maintaining the pointed tip, and the gaps between the ZnO grains disappeared at around 350 s (Fig. 5e). Subsequently, the vertical growth was dominant, and the thickness at a deposition time of 650 s reached ∼1.3 μm (Fig. 5f and g). The ZnO thickness as a function of deposition time is plotted in Fig. 5h, indicating that the thickness increased linearly throughout electrodeposition.

Fig. 6 shows TT and TD spectra of the PT-ZnO films corresponding to the FESEM images in Fig. 3 and 5c–g, where the averaged haze values as a function of the deposition time are also depicted. The haze value increased from 40.2 to 52.6% when increasing the deposition time up to 350 s and then slightly decreased as the deposition time increased further. The lower haze values at 150 and 250 s are due to the existence of gaps between the ZnO grains as seen in the high TT and low TD spectra, and then the TT decreased gradually as a consequence of increasing the film thickness. Thus, on the basis of total transmittance and haze, the optimal second-deposition time was determined to be 350–550 s.

2.2 Theoretical simulation of light scattering behaviour of pyramidal ZnO
Using the simple geometric model shown in Fig. 7a, the light-scattering effect of a (101)-faceted ZnO pyramidal tip was theoretically estimated as a function of the outer refractive index (nb) of ZnO. When one considers incident light (I0) vertical to the basal (001) plane, the incident angle at the pyramidal ZnO/outside interface equals 62°, the angle between (101) and (001) planes. The angle (θ1) between the basal plane and first-order transmitted light (T1) was calculated from the following eqn (1) and (2), where eqn (1) represents the Snell's law and only the real part of the refractive index was considered for simplicity. For the refractive index (na) of ZnO, a typical value of 2.0 was used. It is known that the refractive index of ZnO is almost constant in the visible region. (1) θ1 = θb + 28°(2)where θa and θb are incident and refraction angles at the ZnO (101) plane, respectively. The physical length of the light path (l1) for T1 can be expressed using an arbitrary vertical component (d) and θ1: (3)

The intensity of the first-order reflected light (R1) and T1 was calculated on the basis of the Fresnel eqn (4) and (5) and eqn (6) and (7), (4) (5) (6) T1 = 1 − R1,(7)where RS and RP are the intensities of s- and p-polarized light, respectively, and only the real part of the refractive index was considered for simplicity. The reflected light (R1) travels inside ZnO and is refracted at the opposite (101) plane with an incident angle of 6°. The angle (θ2) between the basal plane and second-order transmitted light (T2), the corresponding length of the light path l2 and the relative intensity of T2 to I0 were calculated in a similar manner, as shown above using eqn (8) instead of eqn (7): T2 = R1 − R2.(8)
The calculated values are plotted in Fig. 7b–d as a function of nb (1.0 ≤ nb ≤ 5.0). As shown in Fig. 7b, θ1 reaches 118° at nb ≈ 1.77, and total internal reflection (TIR) occurs for nb < 1.77. θ1 equals 90° at nb = 2.0, and decreases gradually to ∼50° with increasing nb. In contrast, θ2 varies within a relatively narrow range from 40° to 30°. Fig. 7c shows the variation of the length of the light path (l1,2) normalized with the vertical component (d), l1,2/d, which is equal to 1/sinθ1,2. Naturally, smaller angles of θ give a larger light path length, resulting in the range of 1.0 ≤ l1/d ≤ 1.3 and 1.6 ≤ l2/d ≤ 2.0, where both represent the maximum values at nb = 5.0. The variation of T1, T2, R2 and Ttotal (Ttotal = T1 + T2) is presented in Fig. 7d. For nb < 1.77, T2 is the only transmission component and T1 becomes the main component for 1.77 < nb, resulting in Ttotal in the range 89 ≤ Ttotal ≤ 100%. Note that the contribution from R2 in the third-order transmission component is negligible especially for nb < 1.53, where TIR occurs at the ZnO/outside interface.
For comparison, the variation of transmitted light (T3) in a planar ZnO film was also calculated and plotted in Fig. 7e, where only the first-order transmitted light was considered since the subsequent transmission component was negligible. T3 varies as 82 ≤ T3 ≤ 100%. On comparing Ttotal to T3, although there is a little difference for nb ≤ 2.0, the Ttotal values are higher than T3 values with increasing nb, reaching a maximum difference of approximately 14% at nb = 5.0. To express the light-scattering effect, the value of Tl/d was considered, and the variation of (T1l1/d + T2l2/d) for the pyramidal ZnO and T3l3/d for the planar ZnO is plotted in Fig. 7g. Interestingly, one can see a significant difference in transmitted light between the pyramidal ZnO and planar ZnO when considering a normalized light path length, l/d. While the variation of T3l3/d is the same as T3 (Fig. 7e) because l3/d = 1, (T1l1/d + T2l2/d) is entirely different from Ttotal (Fig. 7d) and shows an N-shaped curve having a maximum of 175% at nb ≈ 1.76 and a minimum of 100% at nb = 2.0. Such a remarkable increase in Tl/d is expected to enhance the light-absorption efficiency, i.e., the light-trapping effect, in solar cell applications. For example, in thin-film ZnO/absorber solar cells, assuming that a light absorber has a refractive index of nb = 4.0, the thickness of the absorber can be decreased up to approximately 67% by using the pyramidal ZnO (Tl/d = 132%) rather than the planar ZnO (Tl/d = 89%) to absorb the same amount of light. Although calculations including the extinction coefficient are essential for more accurate analysis of this value, the decrease in the absorber thickness provides efficient carrier transport and saves material.
Since the haze measurements shown in Fig. 4 were performed in ambient air, nb corresponds to ∼1.0. According to the simulation, TIR occurs on the first-order refraction in the pyramidal ZnO under this condition, and Ttotal is ∼89%, which is almost the same as that for the planar ZnO. However, the experimental TT of the PT-ZnO is lower by ∼11% on average than that of the planar ZnO (Table 1). A possible explanation for this is due to overlapped pyramidal tips seen in the FESEM images (Fig. 3). The fractional second-order transmitted light (T2) can be interrupted by an overlapped neighbouring tip as shown in Fig. 8a, where 78% of T2 is lost. This effect, however, is eliminated for 1.8 ≤ nb because T1, which has larger angles of θ1 (∼50° ≤ θ1), becomes the main transmission component and TIR occurs on the neighbouring tip surface for 2.2 ≤ nb (Fig. 8b). This implies that TT of the PT-ZnO increases for 1.8 ≤ nb.

2.3 Application of pyramidally textured ZnO to Cu2O solar cells
To confirm the light-trapping effect of PT-ZnO, ZnO/Cu2O thin-film solar cells were fabricated by the electrodeposition of Cu2O on ZnO/FTO samples and subsequent thermal evaporation of the Au electrode. Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) has received a great deal of attention as a non-toxic and low-cost light-absorption material, and the solution-processable combination with ZnO has been extensively studied as an all-oxide solar cell.55–60 In most thin-film solar cells, thinner and thicker absorbers are desirable from efficient carrier collection/transport and sufficient light absorption perspectives, respectively. This conflicting relationship is a serious problem, particularly in the case of Cu2O solar cells because electrodeposited Cu2O is highly resistive (∼5 × 104 Ω cm).61 This electrical property is a main reason for still a low level power conversion efficiency (PCE) for the solution-processed ZnO/Cu2O solar cells (PCE < 1.5%), and many efforts have been made to improve the PCE. For instance, ZnO nanowire arrays have been incorporated into Cu2O solar cells as a superior electron transporter, which is expected to help carrier collection/transport in a thicker Cu2O absorber.58,59 Nanowire structures resulted in an increase in the short circuit current density (JSC) by efficient carrier collection/transport compared with a planar ZnO while the open circuit voltage (VOC) decreased because of the insufficient thickness of Cu2O deposited into the nanorod gaps to form a depletion layer.60 On the other hand, the high-haze PT-ZnO prepared in this study is expected to help light absorption allowing a thinner Cu2O absorber.

Fig. 9a and b show the cross-sectional FESEM images of the ZnO/Cu2O solar cell incorporating PT- and planar ZnO films, respectively; the second-step deposition time for the PT-ZnO is 450 s. In both cells, the electrodeposited Cu2O absorber is a 1.3–1.5 μm thick dense film that fits well in the shape of the ZnO surface. Note that this thickness is approximately half that of the Cu2O layers (∼3 μm thickness) typically used in reported planar-type ZnO/Cu2O solar cells.55,60 The relatively large observed crystal grains and dense covering on the fine structure are the characteristics of electrodeposition.

The photovoltaic characteristics of the ZnO/Cu2O solar cells under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) are summarized in Fig. 10a–d, where three measured datasets (open circles) and their averaged values (closed circles) are plotted. Fig. 10a shows that the averaged short circuit current density (JSC) of the pyramidally textured solar cell is 4.1 mA cm−2, which is 1.3 times higher than that of the planar solar cell and is comparable to the reported JSC for the 3 μm thick planar ZnO/Cu2O solar cells,55,60 proving that pyramidally textured ZnO has a superior light-trapping effect. As Cu2O has a bandgap energy of ∼2.1 eV, photocurrents are generated by light less than ∼590 nm in wavelength.62,63 The refractive index of Cu2O (nCu2O) films at the wavelength range of 400–590 nm varies from 2.8 to 3.4 and has a peak at ∼500 nm.64,65 According to the theoretical simulation shown in Fig. 7g, the value of Tl/d for the pyramidal structure is 1.2–1.3 times higher than that of the planar structure, which is consistent with the observed increase in JSC. Thus, a significant difference in JSC between pyramidally textured and planar solar cells is observed while there are a few differences in VOC (0.33–0.34 V) and fill factor (FF, 0.46–0.47) (Fig. 10b and c). This indicates that the pyramidally textured structure has little negative effect on the formation of built-in potential and the series resistance, unlike the case of nanowire structures.60 Consequently, the averaged power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the pyramidally textured solar cell is also 1.3 times higher than that of the planar solar cell. Furthermore, PT-ZnO films prepared with different second-step deposition times (350−550 s), which have haze values of ∼52% (Fig. 6), also exhibited almost the same photovoltaic performance as those for 450 s-PT-ZnO.

The closed circles represent the average of 3 measured datasets shown by the open circles. (e) J–V curves (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) and (f) IPCE spectra for the ZnO/Cu2O solar cells with the best PCE. The inset indicates the increase in IPCE. 
The J–V curves shown in Fig. 10e correspond to those in Fig. 10d that show the highest PCE value among the three datasets. The PT- and planar solar cells show JSC values of 4.15 and 3.08 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.34 and 0.34 V, an FF of 0.47 and 0.47 and a PCE of 0.67 and 0.49%, respectively. Fig. 10f shows IPCE spectra for the ZnO/Cu2O solar cells corresponding to Fig. 10e. Photocurrent is generated at wavelengths less than ∼600 nm, which is equivalent to the Cu2O band edge and has a broad peak at 380–470 nm. Over the measured wavelengths, IPCE for the PT-solar cell is enhanced compared to that of the planar solar cell. The inset of Fig. 10f shows the increase in IPCE, where the background is increased linearly with decreasing wavelength, and a peak appears at 485 nm. The background profile is probably because of the haze profile shown in Fig. 4b, where the difference in haze (%) between the PT- and planar ZnO films increases linearly by 20% with decreasing wavelength from 620 to 380 nm. The peak at 485 nm could be attributed to the wavelength dependence of nCu2O. As previously mentioned, nCu2O has a peak at ∼500 nm,64,65 and the difference in Tl/d between the pyramidal and planar structures increases with increasing outer refractive index (Fig. 7g).
3 Experimental
3.1 Electrodeposition of ZnO
Aqueous solutions for the electrodeposition of ZnO were prepared using reagent-grade chemicals and deionized water purified by a Milli-RX 12 Plus system. All ZnO samples were electrodeposited by applying a cathodic current through aqueous solutions at 75 °C with a programmable galvanostat (Hokuto Denko HABF-5001) using FTO (Asahi glass, 10 Ω per sq) as the substrate (working electrode) and a Zn bar as the counter electrode. Pyramidally textured ZnO was electrodeposited in two steps from a 15 mM Zn(NO3)2·6H2O–15 mM NaCl aqueous solution at an initial current density of 0.4 mA cm−2 for 10 s followed by a second current density of 2.0 mA cm−2 for 450 s (total electrical charge = 0.9 C cm−2). Planar ZnO was electrodeposited from a 0.1 M Zn(NO3)2·6H2O aqueous solution at a current density of 1.0 mA cm−2 for 800 s (total electrical charge = 0.8 C cm−2). ZnO nanorod arrays were electrodeposited from a 0.5 mM Zn(NO3)2·6H2O aqueous solution at a current density of 0.4 mA cm−2 for 2500 s (total electrical charge = 1.0 C cm−2).
3.2 Characterization of ZnO
Structural and morphological characterizations were performed with an X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (Rigaku RINT2500) and a field-emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM6700F), respectively. Haze values (Haze (%) = TD/TT) were evaluated by UV-vis spectroscopy (measuring wavelength range = 380–780 nm, JASCO V560) with an integrating sphere. The resistivity of ZnO was evaluated with a Hall effect measurement system (Toyo Technica, Resitest8310) using the van der Pauw method at room temperature. Samples for the Hall effect measurements were prepared according to the literature;53,54 briefly, a ZnO film on FTO was transferred to an epoxy resin pellet (Agilent Technologies Torr seal, >1013 Ω cm).
3.3 Preparation and characterization of ZnO/Cu2O solar cells
Cu2O was electrodeposited galvanostatically (1.0 mA cm−2) on ZnO/FTO samples from a 0.4 M Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O–3.0 M lactic acid aqueous solution (pH = 13.0) at 40 °C. Au was thermally evaporated on the Cu2O layer as an electrode. J–V curves were recorded under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) using a class AAA solar simulator (Bunkoukeiki, OTENTO-SUN II) calibrated with a Si photo diode. IPCE spectra (300–1150 nm) were obtained using an IPCE measurement system (Bunkoukeiki, SM-250) calibrated with a Si photo diode.
4 Conclusions
In this study, well-faceted ZnO textures with a pyramidal structure were directly formed on FTO substrates at 75 °C using a two-step electrodeposition process from Zn(NO3)2 aqueous solutions that contained NaCl. During formation of the pyramidal structure, Cl− played an important role in changing the exposed crystal planes of ZnO nanorods from (001) to (101). In the two-step electrodeposition process, the applied current density was changed from 0.4 to 2.0 mA cm−2 in 10 s; this enabled control of the ZnO nucleation separately from the grain size and produced a dense ZnO film with a relatively large grain diameter. The obtained PT-ZnO film exhibited a high haze value (in the visible light range) of ∼52%, based on light-scattering effects at the pyramidal planes. This averaged haze value was 3.7 and 2.2 times higher than those of ZnO films with planar and nanorod structures, respectively. For balancing high transparency with high haze, the optimal thickness of the PT-ZnO film was determined to be 0.7–1.2 μm.
Theoretical simulation of light scattering on the pyramidal ZnO was performed using a simple geometry model. The variation of the refraction angle, path length (l/d) and intensity of transmitted light (T) was calculated as a function of the outer refractive index (nb) of ZnO, revealing that these values changed dramatically depending on nb, especially at around nb = 1.77 (TIR occurs at the ZnO/outside interface for nb < 1.77). To express the light-scattering effect, the value of Tl/d was considered, and it was found that the pyramidal ZnO exhibited higher Tl/d values (100 ≤ Tl/d ≤ 175%) over the visible region. On the basis of simulation, overlapped neighbouring tips in the PT-ZnO film were suggested as a possible reason for the decrease in total transmittance in ambient air (nb ≈ 1.0), and an improvement was expected for 1.8 ≤ nb.
The light-trapping effect derived from the PT-ZnO was confirmed by fabricating ZnO/Cu2O thin-film solar cells. The PT-solar cell exhibited a 1.3 times higher averaged JSC and a few differences in VOC and FF compared to a planar solar cell, permitting a 1.3 times higher averaged PCE. IPCE for the PT-solar cell was enhanced over the measured wavelengths compared to that of the planar solar cell. Explanations for the observed increase in JSC and IPCE were successfully given using the calculated value of Tl/d. Thus, we have demonstrated that PT-ZnO films can be formed readily on a TCO substrate using low-temperature solution processes, and can improve thin-film solar cells by a superior light-trapping effect.
