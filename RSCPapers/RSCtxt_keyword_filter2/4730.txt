    , Accepted 9th September 2019First published on 10th September 2019AbstractIn this work, a nonacyclic carbazole-cored electron-rich central building block called CZTT and its derivative non-fullerene acceptors (CZTT-IC and CZTT-4F) are designed and synthesized. CZTT-4F with fluorinated acceptor end groups shows significantly down-shifted energy levels and a narrower bandgap as well as a smaller dipole moment in the ground state in comparison to the counterpart CZTT-IC. In the blend films, blends of both the fluorinated donor and acceptor (PM6:CZTT-4F) reveal relatively lower miscibility resulting in a better donor/acceptor interpenetrating network with higher domain purity for efficient charge transport. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the PM6:CZTT-4F blend exhibited a highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.07% with enhanced thermal and light soaking stability. To the best of our knowledge, this performance is among the best for carbazole-based OSCs in the literature. The results reveal that the nonacyclic CZTT core is a promising building block for constructing efficient non-fullerene acceptors. More importantly, the relatively lower miscibility within the fluorinated CZTT-based blend film is demonstrated to greatly improve the stability of OSCs.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted significant attention as a promising renewable energy technology due to their prominent advantages, such as solution-processability, low cost, flexibility and semi-transparency.1–4 In the past two decades, research on the BHJ blend active layers for OSCs has principally focused on electron-donor materials (conjugated polymers or small molecules) and fullerene-based electron-acceptors (e.g., PC61BM and PC71BM).5 Fullerene-based OSCs have achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 12% in tandem devices.6 However, in view of the intrinsic drawbacks of fullerene derivatives, including limited tunability of frontier orbital energy levels, morphological instability and weak absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions,7,8 further improvement in the photovoltaic performance of fullerene-based OSCs has stagnated for a period of time. To address these problems, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have been studied extensively, especially acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structured fused-ring molecules.9,10 And the state-of-the-art non-fullerene OSCs have pushed the PCEs to over 16% within a short time.11–14 Non-fullerene OSCs exhibit unprecedented potential for enabling high photovoltaic performance and practical commercial application.
Fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) feature an electron-donating fused ring with suitable side chains as the central building block and two compact strong electron-withdrawing groups as terminals, which result in strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) characteristics and ensure efficient electron transport simultaneously. The molecular engineering approaches for efficient FREAs mainly concentrate on the modulation of the π-conjugated aromatic cores,15–18 π-spacer,19–22 terminal groups,23–26 and solubilizing side-chain substituents.27–29 Among these, the development of the central building block plays an important role in manipulating the optoelectronic properties and intermolecular interaction of FREAs, thus impacting their photovoltaic performance. The development of novel high-efficiency NFAs with easily accessible and low-cost aromatic cores is still highly desired.
Besides, the stability, such as thermal and light soaking stability, should also be considered for the commercialization of OSCs.30 Due to the intrinsic bulk-heterojunction construction, OSCs often show poor thermal stability and severe degradation under illumination.31,32 Several groups have reported the thermal stabilities of non-fullerene OSCs (Table S10 in the ESI†). For instance, PBDB-T:ITIC based devices showed a PCE of 10.8% after thermal annealing at 100 °C for 250 h, retaining over 95% of the initial value.33 The PTZ1:IDIC devices also demonstrated desirable thermal stability, and the unencapsulated device could retain 81% of its initial PCE after thermal annealing for 10 h at 100 °C in air.34 Li and co-workers35 reported a PCE of 6.3% with >90% efficiency retention over 300 h of illumination of single-component OSCs. However, for practical application, the stability for efficient OSCs is still insufficient and should be taken seriously.
Carbazole-based derivatives have been widely employed as p-type semiconductors for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),36–38 organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs),39,40 and dye sensitized solar cells,41,42 due to their pronounced thermal stability and unique optoelectronic properties. As a cheap starting material, 9H-carbazole can be easily functionalized at the 3-, 6- or 9-position to covalently bond to other molecules. The nitrogen atom can be easily substituted with a wide variety of functional groups to tune the optoelectronic properties and solubility. Due to these superiorities, carbazole-based NFAs have aroused much attention. Lim et al.43 developed three carbazole-cored NFAs using different electron-withdrawing end groups, whose blends with poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) as a donor delivered a highest PCE of 2.56% for OSCs. The low PCE is attributed to the narrow absorption of both P3HT and these acceptors. To absorb more photons, carbazole-based NFAs with near-infrared absorption have been designed through enhancing the electron-donating ability of the central core or/and the electron-withdrawing ability of terminal groups. Sun and co-workers44 reported an electron-rich unit, dithienocyclopentacarbazole (DTCC), to afford a NFA called DTCC-IC with a bandgap of 1.59 eV, which enhanced the PCE of OSCs to 6%. A more electron-rich unit, dithienopicenocarbazole (DTPC), was explored by Jen et al.45 The device based on PTB7-Th:DTCP-DFIC showed a high PCE of 10.21% and an extremely low energy loss of 0.45 eV. In association with side chain engineering, such as modifying the nitrogen atom with alkyl chains of different lengths and the aliphatic side chains on bridge carbon, carbazole-based OSCs have delivered a high PCE of 11.18%.46 Generally, efficient carbazole-based NFAs are rare since it is very challenging to fine-tune the morphology and miscibility of the active layers containing carbazole NFAs.
In this work, a ladder-type nonacyclic carbazole-based building block (CZTT) has been designed and synthesized as an electron-rich central building block. Herein, the CZTT unit possesses an extended π-conjugation compared to the reported DTCC unit, which can improve the electron-donating capacity, favor the formation of an effective interchain π–π overlap and enhance intermolecular charge transport. Two relevant NFAs, namely CZTT-IC and CZTT-4F, end-capped with 3-(dicyanomethylidene)indan-1-one (IC) or fluorinated IC have been constructed and systematically characterized (Fig. 1a). Compared with CZTT-IC, the fluorinated NFA (CZTT-4F) shows enhanced intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) and stronger intermolecular interactions, resulting in a redshifted (∼40 nm) absorption with down-shifted highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (Fig. 1b and c). To reveal the photovoltaic potential of these acceptors, two wide-bandgap polymers PBDB-T47 and PM6 (ref. 48) were selected as donors. The OSCs based on PM6:CZTT-4F exhibited an impressive PCE of 12.07% with a high short-circuit current density (JSC) of 19.73 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 65.06%, and an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.94 V. These values are among the highest for carbazole-based devices in the literature (Table S13 and Fig. S27 in the ESI†). In addition, the PM6:CZTT-4F-based device showed an enhanced thermal and light soaking stability compared with other devices, and retained 90.1% of its initial PCE after 100 h of thermal annealing at 85 °C and 78.7% after 100 h of continuous illumination, respectively. The result demonstrates that the decreased miscibility within the fluorinated PM6:CZTT-4F blend film compared to the other one could assist in the formation of a relatively well-mixed donor/acceptor interpenetrating network with higher domain purity for improving charge transport and thermal stability.

Results and discussion
The synthetic route to CZTT-IC and CZTT-4F is shown in Scheme 1. Two starting materials, 9-(2-ethylhexyl)-2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9H-carbazole and ethyl 2-chloro-5-(triisopropylsilyl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-3-carboxylate, were prepared by following the reported procedures.49–51 The key intermediate compound 4 (CZTT) was constructed via a three-step procedure, i.e., Suzuki coupling, Friedel–Crafts intramolecular cyclization and detriisopropylsilane protection.52,53 The derivative compound 5 was synthesized in 79.2% yield as an orange yellow solid by treating CZTT with phosphorus oxychloride (POCl3) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) under reflux. Finally, the Knoevenagel condensation reaction of compound 5 with the non-fluorinated and fluorinated IC end-capping groups afforded CZTT-IC and CZTT-4F in 73.0% and 72.5% yield, respectively.54 The detailed synthetic procedures and characterization including 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 19F NMR and mass spectra are provided in the ESI (Fig. S1–S17†). CZTT-IC and CZTT-4F have good solubility in common solvents, such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB). And both acceptors show good thermal stability, indicated by a decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight-loss temperature) of 364 °C and 352 °C, respectively (Fig. S18a†).

The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of CZTT-IC and CZTT-4F are shown in Fig. 1b. From dilute chloroform solution to thin film, CZTT-IC showed a maximum absorption peak redshifted from 684 to 700 nm, while for CZTT-4F the redshift was from 706 to 737 nm, indicating the presence of strong intermolecular interactions among CZTT-based NFA molecules in the solid state. However, in dilute chloroform solution, CZTT-IC shows a larger extinction coefficient (Fig. S18b†) of 2.20 × 105 M−1 cm−1 than CZTT-4F (2.14 × 105 M−1 cm−1) at their maximum absorption peaks. The film absorption of CZTT-IC and CZTT-4F exhibits a strong and broader absorption range from 550 to 800 nm. The absorption onset is located at 793 and 836 nm, corresponding to an optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.56 and 1.48 eV for CZTT-IC and CZTT-4F, respectively. The detailed optical data are summarized in Table 1. Two commercial polymer donors, PBDB-T and PM6, show complementary absorption with both acceptors (Fig. 1b), which is beneficial for harvesting sufficient photos for the devices.

Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted to evaluate the electrochemical properties of NFAs, and the results are shown in Fig. S18c.† According to the oxidation and reduction onsets, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels were determined to be −5.54/−3.97 eV for CZTT-IC and −5.61/−4.11 eV for CZTT-4F. Compared to CZTT, the dramatically down-shifted energy levels of CZTT-4F result from the enhanced electron-withdrawing ability of the fluorinated end-capping group. The variation trend from theoretical calculation (Fig. S19†) is consistent with our experimental results that CZTT-4F has a narrower bandgap and down-shifted HOMO and LUMO energy levels. To further evaluate the influence of the electron-deficient F atom on the strength of intramolecular interaction, the theoretical calculation of intramolecular dipole moment on the whole molecular model was utilized in the ground state. Astonishingly, both CTZZ-based NFAs have dipole moments due to the asymmetric electron density distribution (Fig. S19†). And the results indicate that non-fluorinated CZTT-IC has a larger dipole moment of 6.4420 debye than fluorinated CZTT-4F (2.2173 debye). This variation tendency of the influence of the electron-deficient F atom has also been reported in several asymmetric acceptor molecules.55,56
To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the CZTT-based NFAs, solution-processed OSCs were fabricated with the inverted device structure indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. Wide bandgap polymer donors PBDB-T and PM6 were used to match CZTT-IC and CZTT-4F because of the complementary absorption and appropriate energy levels. The optimized processing conditions, such as D/A weight ratio, solvent additive and thermal annealing temperature, were carefully screened to achieve the best device performance for each blend (Fig. S22–S25 and Tables S2–S9†). The detailed device fabrication conditions and optimization processes are illustrated in the ESI.† As presented in Fig. 2a, for the CZTT-IC acceptor, the device blended with PBDB-T delivered a PCE of 9.87% with a VOC of 0.97 V, JSC of 17.26 mA cm−2 and FF of 58.97% while the PM6:CZTT-IC blended device only achieved a PCE of 7.02% with a high VOC of about 1.07 V (Table 2). Compared with CZTT-IC, the CZTT-4F-based devices exhibited much higher JSC due to the redshifted absorption and efficient charge transport. As a result, the optimal PBDB-T:CZTT-4F device achieved a PCE of 9.81% with a VOC of 0.88 V, JSC of 19.06 mA cm−2 and FF of 58.47%. The device based on PM6:CZTT-4F showed a highest PCE of 12.07% with a VOC of 0.94 V, JSC of 19.73 mA cm−2 and a FF of 65.06%. The remarkably enhanced PCE of the fluorinated PM6:CZTT-4F based device is mainly attributed to significantly improved JSC and FF values. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 12.07% for carbazole-based OSCs is among the highest reported values in the literature (Fig. S27 and Table S13†).

The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of each optimized device are shown in Fig. 2b. The PM6:CZTT-IC based device exhibits a much lower EQE response in the 300–800 nm range, which may be due to the close HOMO energy levels between PM6 and CZTT-IC, resulting in inefficient charge transport and dissociation. For the CZTT-4F based devices, the PM6:CZTT-4F based device showed a small red-shift photoresponse range compared with PBDB-T:CZTT-4F. The absorption of the blend film has the same variation trend as that show in Fig. S18d,† which could be caused by the higher domain purity induced in the PM6:CZTT-4F film. The JSC values calculated from the EQE curves are 16.43, 12.24, 18.63 and 19.15 mA cm−2 for the PBDB-T:CZTT-IC, PM6:CZTT-IC, PBDB-T:CZTT-4F and PM6:CZTT-4F based devices, respectively, which are within 5% mismatch with the JSC values obtained from the corresponding J–V measurements.
The charge transport properties of the blended films were measured by the SCLC method, where the device structure ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINO/Al was used for electron mobility (Fig. S20a†) and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag for hole mobility (Fig. S20b†). The PM6:CZTT-4F blend film exhibited higher and more balanced hole and electron mobilities (μh = 1.68 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 1.88 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, and μe/μh = 1.12), compared with those of the optimized PBDB-T:CZTT-IC film (μh = 6.48 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 8.55 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and μe/μh = 1.32), PM6:CZTT-IC film (μh = 1.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 2.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and μe/μh = 2.39), and PBDB-T:CZTT-4F film (μh = 4.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 6.67 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and μe/μh = 1.54) (Table S1†). The higher and more balanced μe/μh values can facilitate charge extraction and reduce charge recombination, which is helpful for achieving higher JSC and FF values of the PM6:CZTT-4F based devices.
To study the exciton dissociation and charge extraction properties of the corresponding devices, the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) of the OSCs was also measured. Jph was calculated from Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff was estimated from Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage.57 As presented in Fig. 2c, when Veff approaches 2 V, all of the devices except the PM6:CZTT-IC based device have reached the saturation current density (Jsat), suggesting that insufficient charge extraction occurs in the PM6:CZTT-IC device. The Jph/Jsat ratios under short-circuit conditions were calculated to assist further evaluation of the exciton dissociation probability. At a Veff of 2 V, the Jph/Jsat values were found to be 90.27%, 87.30%, 90.61% and 94.31% for the PBDB-T:CZTT-IC, PM6:CZTT-IC, PBDB-T:CZTT-4F and PM6:CZTT-4F based devices, respectively. The results demonstrate that the PM6:CZTT-4F based device featured the most efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction relative to other devices, leading to the highest FF.58
To further explore the charge recombination kinetics of the OSCs, the relationship between the JSC values and the light intensity (Plight) was investigated (Fig. 2d). Quantitatively, JSC shows a power-law dependence on Plight for OSCs (JSC ∝ Plightα), where α approaching 1 indicates negligible bimolecular recombination.59 As shown in Fig. 2d, the α values were calculated to be 0.978, 0.968, 0.971 and 0.992 for the devices based on PBDB-T:CZTT-IC, PM6:CZTT-IC, PBDB-T:CZTT-4F and PM6:CZTT-4F, respectively. The results indicated that the bimolecular recombination was efficiently suppressed in the PM6:CZTT-4F blend device, thus contributing to the highest FF. The trap-assisted recombination losses were further studied. The variations of VOC as a function of Plight were modeled using the equation VOC ∝ lnPlight. Fig. S21 (ESI†) shows the Plight dependence of VOC, which is a linear relationship with a slope of kT/q. When the slope of VOCversus lnPlight is greater than kT/q, it means that the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination is involved.60,61 For the PBDB-T:CZTT-IC, PM6:CZTT-IC, PBDB-T:CZTT-4F and PM6:CZTT-4F based OSCs, the slope values are 1.125 kT/q, 1.407 kT/q, 1.268 kT/q and 1.098 kT/q, respectively, which indicates that severe SRH recombination occurred in the PM6:CZTT-IC based device.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements (Fig. 3) were performed to investigate the morphology of the blend films. As shown in Fig. 3a–d, the PBDB-T:CZTT-IC, PM6:CZTT-IC and PBDB-T:CZTT-4F blended films exhibited very similar phase images with root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of 1.66, 2.69 and 2.59 nm, presenting strong miscibility with small domain sizes, while a larger and more finely dispersed phase separation is observed in the PM6:CZTT-4F-based blend film with a RMS roughness value of 1.84 nm. Furthermore, as presented in Fig. 3i–l, the PM6:CZTT-4F blend film possessed a finer structure with suitable phase separation, while PBDB-T:CZTT-IC, PM6:CZTT-IC and PBDB-T:CZTT-4F blend films showed relatively smaller domain size.62 This result indicated that the fluorinated CZTT-4F blended with fluorinated polymer (PM6) promoted the formation of a suitable domain size and phase separation of the BHJ active layer. The well-developed interpenetrating network of the PM6:CZTT-4F based blend film affords abundant continuous percolating paths for efficient charge transport and collection, thereby leading to higher JSC and FF values for the corresponding OSCs.

In order to explore the miscibility between the donor and acceptor in the four blends, the contact angles and surface tensions (Fig. 4 and Table 3) were measured for all four pristine materials.63,64 The different surface tension between the donor and acceptor could induce a vertical concentration gradient in the geometry of BHJ active layer.63 The water contact angle (WCA) is determined to be 101.6°, 105.9°, 96.6° and 96.0° for PBDB-T, PM6, CZTT-IC and CZTT-4F, respectively. From the contact angle data, the surface tensions (γ) calculated using the Wu model65 are shown in Table 3. The result indicated that the donor (PBDB-T or PM6) showed lower surface tension relative to the NFA (CZTT-IC or CZTT-4F). The same trend can be observed for glycerol contact angles. To further compare the miscibility of the four blends, we used the following formula: , which γdonor is the surface tension of PBDB-T or PM6, γacceptor is the surface tension of CZTT-IC or CZTT-4F, and χ is the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter of the two blends.66 Miscibility/χ-function relations have been investigated for OSCs in the literature.67–69 The high χ is a prerequisite for high domain purity. A good miscibility results in the development of excessively impure domains, which increases bimolecular recombination. In contrast, a poor miscibility could lead to strong self-aggregation, and thereby reduced device performance.70 A suitable miscibility is also important for efficient OSCs. As presented in Table 3, the χ parameters of the PBDB-T:CZTT-IC, PM6:CZTT-IC, PBDB-T:CZTT-4F and PM6:CZTT-4F are 2.362 × 10−3, 3.744 × 10−3, 7.844 × 10−2 and 8.408 × 10−2, respectively. It is found that the χ parameter of the PM6:CZTT-4F is much higher than that of the other films, indicating that higher domain purity could be induced in the PM6:CZTT-4F blend film. For the CZTT-based blend films, the relatively lower miscibility could assist in the formation of a more favorable morphology for efficient charge transport. Herein, we further investigated the thermal stability and light soaking stability of the corresponding devices. As shown in Tables S11 and S12 and Fig. S26,† the PM6:CZTT-4F-based device showed an enhanced thermal stability, retaining 90.1% of its initial PCE after 100 h of thermal annealing at 85 °C, while the PBDB-T:CZTT-IC, PM6:CZTT-IC and PBDB-T:CZTT-4F devices only preserved 67.4%, 74.4% and 69.1% of their initial efficiencies, respectively. In addition, the OSCs based on PM6:CZTT-4F also exhibited an improved light soaking stability, and retained 78.7% of their initial PCE after 100 h of light aging, while the PBDB-T:CZTT-IC, PM6:CZTT-IC and PBDB-T:CZTT-4F devices only preserved 56.6%, 59.9% and 62.2% of their initial efficiencies, respectively. The result indicated that the fluorinated PM6:CZTT-4F blend film with relatively lower miscibility can improve the stability.

Conclusions
In summary, two carbazole-based NFAs, CZTT-IC and CZTT-4F, have been designed and synthesized by developing a nonacyclic CZTT electron-rich building block and introducing nonfluorinated and fluorinated IC end-capping groups. Compared to CZTT-IC, fluorinated CZTT-4F exhibited significantly down-shifted molecular energy levels and a red-shifted absorption spectrum with a smaller dipole moment in the ground state. By employing non-fluorinated and fluorinated polymer donors (PBDB-T and PM6), the decreased miscibility within PM6:CZTT-4F relative to other films could assist in the formation of a relatively well-mixed donor/acceptor interpenetrating network with higher domain purity for efficient charge transport. OSCs based on PM6:CZTT-4F exhibited a highest PCE of 12.07% with enhanced thermal and light soaking stability compared with other CZTT-based devices. The efficiency of 12.07% is among the highest efficiencies reported for carbazole-based OSCs in the literature. This work not only reveals that the nonacyclic CZTT is a promising building block for high performance non-fullerene acceptors, but also demonstrates that the relatively lower miscibility within the fluorinated CZTT-based blend film could greatly improve the stability of OSCs.
Experimental section
Materials and characterization
All commercially available chemical reagents were obtained and used directly without further purification. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were distilled from sodium before use, and 1,2-dichloroethane was dried with calcium hydride. Polymer donors PBDB-T and PM6 were purchased from Solarmer Materials, Inc. Compound 1, triisopropyl(thieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl)silane, was synthesized according to the literature procedures.45

1H, 13C, and 19F NMR spectra were measured in CDCl3 solvent on a Bruker AVANCE III 500 MHz instrument with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. Mass spectra were measured on a Bruker Daltonics Biflex III MALDI-TOF Analyzer in the MALDI mode. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra were recorded using an Evolution 220 instrument (Thermo Fisher). Electrochemical measurements were carried out using a computer-controlled three-electrode CHI760E workstation in tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) solutions in acetonitrile, where glassy carbon coated with CZTT-IC and CZTT-4F films was used as the working electrode, a Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode and platinum wire as the auxiliary electrode. Ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was used as the internal standard (the energy level of Fc/Fc+ is −4.8 eV under vacuum), and the formal potential of Fc/Fc+ was measured to be 0.35 V vs. the Ag/AgCl electrode. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed using a TGA/SDTA851E instrument (Mettler Toledo) under flowing nitrogen gas at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1.
Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) basis set were performed utilizing Gaussian 09 to evaluate molecular conformations, energy levels and dipole moments. Particularly, n-hexyl and 2-ethylhexyl groups were replaced by methyl to shorten computational time.
Device fabrication
The inverted device structure was indium tin oxide (ITO)/zinc oxide (ZnO)/active layer/MoO3/Ag. Pre-patterned ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by sequential sonication in soap deionized water, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol with 15 min for each step. The ITO substrates were then dried by using high purity nitrogen gas and treated with oxygen plasma for 90 seconds to improve their work function and transparency. The sol–gel ZnO was spin-coated on the substrates and annealed at 200 °C for 1 hour in air. The non-fullerene acceptor (CZTT-IC, CZTT-4F) and PBDB-T (or PM6) were dissolved in chlorobenzene, and then the mixture was stirred to obtain a blend solution with a concentration of 10 mg ml−1 (for the polymer), with 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (0.5% by volume) as an additive. The solution was stirred for 10 hours at room temperature and then spin-coated on the surface of the ZnO layer in a glovebox with a high-purity nitrogen-based atmosphere, and the optimal film of the active layer is ca. 100 nm. The active layer was then thermally annealed for 10 min at different temperatures. The MoO3 (8 nm) and Ag (100 nm) layers were successively deposited by thermal evaporation.
Device measurements
Current density–voltage (J–V) measurements of the solar cells were performed in the glovebox with a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 using an Oriel 300 W Solar Simulator and calibrated by using a silicon photodiode with a protective KG5 filter. The typical active area is 3.97 mm2 as defined by a metal mask with an aperture. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were obtained using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd.). The light intensity at each wavelength was also calibrated using a standard single crystal Si photovoltaic cell. The film thicknesses were measured using a Bruker DektakXT stylus profiling system.
Electron-only devices with the structure ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINO/Al and hole-only devices with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag were used to evaluate charge mobility using the SCLC model. The charge mobility can be determined based on the Mott–Gurney equation with the Poole–Frenkel correction:  where εr is the dielectric constant of organic materials, ε0 is the free space permittivity, L is the thickness of the active layer, μ0 is the charge carrier mobility, and V is the applied voltage.
Stability test
The thermal stability test was conducted at 85 °C in the N2 glovebox. The light soaking stability test was performed under continuous illumination using the white LED lamps in the glovebox.
