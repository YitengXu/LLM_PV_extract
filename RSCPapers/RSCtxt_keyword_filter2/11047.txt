    , Accepted 5th September 2014First published on 5th September 2014AbstractA novel triangular-spiral conjugation molecule of TPA(DPP–PN)3 using triphenylamine (TPA) as the donor core, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as the acceptor arm and phenanthrene (PN) as the planar arene terminal, as well as its counterpart of TPA–3DPP without the PN terminal, were prepared. Their UV-vis absorption, electrochemistry and thermal stability, as well as hole mobility were investigated. Significantly red-shifted UV-vis absorption profiles were observed for TPA(DPP–PN)3 instead of TPA–3DPP in solution and solid state. A hole mobility of 1.67 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained for the TPA(DPP–PN)3/PC71BM blended film, which is 2.1 times higher than that of the TPA–3DPP/PC71BM blended film. Furthermore, the TPA(DPP–PN)3/PC71BM-based organic solar cells presented better photovoltaic property with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 3.67%, which is 1.9 times higher than that of TPA–3DPP/PC71BM-based devices. The results confirm that appending planar PN terminals to TPA–3DPP with a triangular-spiral shape is an efficient approach to improve the photovoltaic performance of its resulting molecules.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are considered to be a promising technology in the world's energy strategy due to their outstanding advantages such as low cost, easy fabrication, light weight, and compatibility with flexible substrates.1–5 Over the past few decades, most research efforts have been focused on solution-processed bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) using a blend of p-type polymers and n-type soluble fullerene derivatives as the photoactive layer. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 9% was demonstrated in PSCs.6–10 Recently, another branch of the OSCs, solution-processable small molecule organic solar cells (SM-OSCs) have gained considerable attention because of their simple purification, defined molecular weight, and superior batch-to-batch reproducibility.6,11–15 A PCE of over 8% was obtained in SM-OSCs, which is still lower than that in PSCs.8,16 Therefore, it remains a great challenge for us to develop new high-performance solution-processable small organic molecules and their SM-OSCs.
Among the developed small molecular donor materials, most of them are built by some electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A) units, and they exhibit a lower band-gap owing to an increasing double-bond character among the D and A units.17–20 Furthermore, hybridization of the energy levels between the D and A units can decrease the highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO) energy levels, which leads to an unusually small HOMO–LUMO energy separation.21 Thus, the linear and star-shaped molecules with a D–A framework can act as light harvesting antennae and easily acquire enhanced photo-physical properties by tuning their molecular structures.22
As is well known, triphenylamines (TPA) and/or diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units have been widely used to construct D–A polymers and small molecules in OSCs, because TPA has good electron-donating and hole-transporting abilities,23–31 whereas DPP has strong light absorption and photochemical stability.32 As a result, some low band-gap molecules with the DPP unit were obtained, and these exhibited good photovoltaic performance in BHJ OSCs.33–39 Successful examples were reported for polymers with a PCE of 8.0% (ref. 36) and for small molecules with a PCE of 5.79% (ref. 38) in the devices. In order to completely utilize their advantages, both TPA and DPP units were recently employed to construct the low band-gap molecules due to the strong intramolecular D–A interaction. For example, Shi and Zhan reported some star-shaped D–A small molecules with a TPA core, three DPP arms and different substituted phenyl end-groups.40–43 The photovoltaic properties of these star-shaped molecules were observed to be improved by introducing different end-groups onto the DPP moiety. A maximum PCE of 2.13% was obtained in these OSCs without the addition of DIO.
As planar arenes have a favorable end-to-end π–π interaction, which can improve the charge transport and interconnectivity,44–46 some planar arenes such as pyrene and phenanthrene were used as end groups to construct linear-shaped D–A small molecules. The planarity of these end-groups was demonstrated to significantly affect the device performances of their resulting small molecules. Considering that C2–phenanthrene has a greater degree of conjugation than C2–naphthalene and substituted benzene (phenyl, fluoro-phenyl and alkyl-phenyl) and can form smaller degree of planarity with other aromatic units than C9–anthracene, as shown in our previous work, we developed a type of the linear-shaped small molecules with π-stacking planar phenanthrene terminals.47 The star-shaped small molecules have presented good solution-processability, high absorption coefficient, excellent purity and dispersibility.17,18 Therefore, in this study, in order to further study the influence of the star framework and planar terminals on the photophysical and photovoltaic properties, a new triangular-spiral small molecule of TPA(DPP–PN)3 has been designed and synthesized (Scheme 1), in which TPA, DPP and PN (phenanthrene) are used as the donor core, the acceptor arm and the end group, respectively. As expected, the TPA(DPP–PN)3 molecule, which is appended additional PN terminals, exhibited broader and stronger absorption than the TPA–3DPP counterpart without PN terminals. Furthermore, the TPA(DPP–PN)3-based devices demonstrated a better photovoltaic performance than the TPA–3DPP-based devices. A maximum PCE of 3.67% with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 8.95 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.80 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 51% was obtained in the TPA(DPP–PN)3/PC71BM based devices under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. The observed PCE, Jsc, and FF values are 1.9, 1.5 and 1.4 times higher than the corresponding values of the TPA–3DPP based cells, respectively. In comparison to the reported star-shaped small molecular analogues with different substituted phenyl end groups, the TPA(DPP–PN)3 molecule further displayed higher FF and PCE values in their OSCs.42 This work confirms that the photovoltaic performance of the triangular-spiral molecules can be improved by appending additional planar phenanthrene terminals.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
As shown in Scheme 2, the 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-2-(phenanthren-2-yl)-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (PN-BPin) and 2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3-(5-(phenanthren-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-6-(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (PN–DPP) were synthesized by a common Suzuki coupling reaction using PdCl2(dppf) or Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst with a high yield of over 80%. 3-(5-Bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-6-(5-(phenanthren-2-yl)-thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (PN–DPP–Br) was prepared by a direct substitution of PN-DPP with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in a solution of chloroform in a dark room. Tris(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)amine (TPA-3BPin) was synthesized by referring to the reported procedure.39 The detailed synthesis and characterization of TPA(DPP–PN)3 and TPA–3DPP are given in the experimental section. The molecular structures were characterized by 1H NMR, MALDI-TOF mass spectra and elemental analysis, which confirm the well-defined chemical structures.

Thermal property
The thermal properties of the TPA(DPP–PN)3 and TPA–3DPP molecules were investigated by thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) under N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The TGA curves are shown in Fig. 1, and the data are summarized in Table 1. Both the small molecules exhibit a good thermal stability. The thermal decomposition temperatures (Td) of 386 °C for TPA(DPP–PN)3 and 409 °C for TPA–3DPP are observed at a 5% weight-loss. This indicates that appending the planar PN terminals into TPA–3DPP has a decreasing effect on the thermal stability of the resulting molecules.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the TPA–3DPP and TPA(DPP–PN)3 films coated on a platinum electrode are shown in Fig. 2. The empirical equations of EHOMO = [−(Eox − 0.45) − 4.8] and ELUMO = [−(Ered − 0.45) − 4.8] eV are applied to estimate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels (EHOMO and ELUMO) by the onset of oxidation/reduction potentials (Eox/Ered), where 0.45 V is the potential of ferrocene vs. Ag/AgCl, and 4.8 eV is the energy level of Ag/AgCl with respect to the vacuum energy level. The resulting electrochemical data are summarized in Table 1. The redox waves are observed with an obviously decreasing Eox value from 0.86 to 0.62 V and a gradually increasing Ered value from −0.99 to −0.89 V for TPA(DPP–PN)3 instead of TPA–3DPP. This indicates that appending the planar PN terminals unit into TPA–3DPP can increase the reduction potential and decrease oxidation potential effectively. Compared to EHOMO/ELUMO values of −5.21/−3.66 eV for TPA–3DPP and −4.97/−3.46 eV for TPA(DPP–PN)3, a decreasing electrochemical band gap and an increasing HOMO energy level are observed for TPA(DPP–PN)3. It is noted that TPA(DPP–PN)3 exhibits the lowest band gap of 1.51 eV among TPA–3DPP and its analogues with different substituted phenyl end groups.41,42 Thus, we can speculate that TPA(DPP–PN)3 is a potential candidate for an electron donor material in OSCs.

Optical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of TPA(DPP–PN)3 and TPA–3DPP in CH2Cl2 solution and neat films are presented in Fig. 3a. The corresponding absorption data are listed in Table 2. In solution state, both compounds exhibit similar UV spectra with two absorption bands, among which the high-lying band of about 350 nm is assigned to the π–π* transitions of their conjugated backbones and another low-lying band of about 600 nm originates from the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions from the TPA to the DPP units. In solid state, TPA(DPP–PN)3 and TPA–3DPP show 30–40 nm red-shift absorption profiles in comparison to those in solution due to the enhanced intermolecular π–π stacking effect. Furthermore, the low-lying absorption peaks of TPA(DPP–PN)3 have about 40 nm bathochromic shift compared to those of TPA–3DPP in solution and film, respectively. The maximum molar absorption coefficient (ε) value of 1.97 × 105 M−1 cm−1 is obtained for TPA(DPP–PN)3, which is 1.35 times higher than that of TPA–3DPP. The increased absorption intensity of TPA(DPP–PN)3 is due to the enlarged π-system and planar conformation of the PN terminals. In order to further understand the effect of the PN terminals on absorption, some star-shaped analogues with the same TPA–3DPP framework and different terminals are listed in Table 2. A narrow optical band gap (Eoptg) of 1.60 eV is presented for TPA(DPP–PN)3, which is lower than the values (1.68–1.83 eV) for TAP–3DPP and some other star-shaped analogues with the same TPA–3DPP framework and different terminals.42 This indicates that TPA(DPP–PN)3 has better absorption properties and the lowest optical band gap.41,42 The introduction of the planar PN terminals into the star-shaped TPA–3DPP lowers the optical band gap for its resulting molecules. Fig. 3b shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the blend films between TPA(DPP–PN)3 (or TPA–3DPP) and PC71BM in an optimized ratio of 1:2.5 (w/w). More intense absorption is observed in the TPA(DPP–PN)3/PC71BM blend film. Therefore, TPA(DPP–PN)3 should exhibit better photovoltaic property than TPA–3DPP in OSCs.

Photovoltaic performances
The photovoltaic performances of the TPA(DPP–PN)3 and TPA–3DPP based OSCs were measured by the fabricated BHJ devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS(30 nm)/active layer (70 nm)/Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm). The active layer consists of a TPA(DPP–PN)3 (or TPA–3DPP) donor and a PC61BM (or PC71BM) acceptor. In order to optimize the ratios between donors and acceptors, the TPA(DPP–PN)3/PC61BM based devices in various ratios from 1:1 to 1:3 (w/w) were fabricated. Fig. S1† shows the resulting current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the TPA(DPP–PN)3/PC61BM based cells, and the corresponding photovoltaic data are summarized in Table S1 (see ESI†) under AM 1.5 G illumination. A maximum PCE of 3.07% with a Voc of 0.81 V, Jsc of 8.12 mA cm−2 and FF of 46.6% was obtained in the cells under an optimized ratio of 1:2.5 (w/w) between TPA(DPP–PN)3 and PC61BM. It is worthy to note here that PCE and FF values for TPA(DPP–PN)3/PC61BM based cells are higher than the corresponding levels of its analogues/PC61BM based cells.42 This indicates that appending planar PN terminals is a better approach than appending substituted phenyl terminals in the star-shaped small molecules to improve the photovoltaic performances of its resulting molecules. In order to further improve the device performance, we took PC71BM instead of PC61BM as an acceptor to fabricate new BHJ-OSCs. The typical J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 4 under illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2 and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 3. It is found that the TPA(DPP–PN)3/PC71BM based device presented the best photovoltaic performance with increasing PCE, Jsc and FF levels. A maximum PCE of 3.67% with Voc of 0.80 V, Jsc of 8.95 mA cm−2 and FF of 51% is obtained. To our knowledge, the PCE value here is the highest among the reported star-shaped small molecules with a TPA–DPP or TPA–3DPP framework in the single BHJ OSCs.40–42 In contrast, the TPA–3DPP/PC71BM-based device displayed a lower PCE of 1.91% with Voc of 0.91 V, Jsc of 5.85 mA cm−2 and FF of 36%. The significantly increased PCE and Jsc for the TPA(DPP–PN)3/PC71BM-based devices can be attributed to the enhanced absorption intensity of TPA(DPP–PN)3.

In order to further explain why TPA(DPP–PN)3-based devices exhibited better photovoltaic property, the surface morphology for the blend films, as well as the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and charge transport property for the devices, were measured. Fig. S2† shows the tapping-mode AFM images of the TPA–3DPP/PC71BM and TPA(DPP–PN)3/PC71BM blend films on glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate recorded by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (see ESI†). A surface roughness of 0.290 nm for TPA(DPP–PN)3 and 0.345 nm for TPA–3DPP are observed in their blend films. This indicates that the TPA(DPP–PN)3/PC71BM blend film has better surface morphology, which is in favour of increasing PCE and Jsc values. The isolated spherical domains with approximate sizes of 24–120 and 24–80 nm are estimated in the TPA–3DPP and TPA(DPP–PN)3/PC71BM blend films, respectively. These large strip domains for the TPA–3DPP/PC71BM blend film may be due to the molecular aggregation of TPA–3DPP in solid state.

Fig. 5 shows the EQE curves of the TPA(DPP–PN)3/PC71BM and TPA–3DPP/PC71BM based devices. Although both devices exhibit almost identical spectral response ranges from 300 nm to 700 nm, markedly different EQE values are observed. The maximum EQE of 51% at 600 nm for the TPA(DPP–PN)3/PC71BM based device is much higher than that (36% at 470 nm) for the TPA–3DPP/PC71BM based device. This increased EQE value for the TPA(DPP–PN)3/PC71BM device is attributed to the increased absorption intensity by appending π-stacking planar PN terminals into TPA(DPP–PN)3, which can make the photoactive layer adsorb more photons to improve Jsc. Based on the Jsc value of 9.05 mA cm−2 integrated from the EQE, it is found that the calculated Jsc value is consistent with the experimental value for the TPA(DPP–PN)3 based devices.

Fig. 6 shows the J–V characteristics of the hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/active layer (180 or 220 nm)/MoO3 (5 nm)/Ag (80 nm). Here, the active layer consists of TPA(DPP–PN)3 (or TPA–3DPP) and PC71BM. The hole mobilities of devices are calculated via a space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) model. A hole mobility of 1.67 × 10−4 and 7.92 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 is observed in the TPA(DPP–PN)3 and TPA–3DPP based devices, respectively. Obviously, the hole mobility of the TPA(DPP–PN)3/PC71BM based device is 2.1 times higher than that of the TPA–3DPP/PC71BM based device. The increased hole mobility is responsible for the improved FF value in the optimized TPA(DPP–PN)3/PC71BM device. Therefore, appending the planar PN units into the star-shaped molecular terminals can promote the photovoltaic property of its molecules in the organic solar cells.

Conclusions
In summary, a novel triangular-spiral small molecule of TPA(DPP–PN)3 was pre-pared with additional PN end-capped units on the basis of the TPA–3DPP counter-part. Its photovoltaic performance and the hole mobility of the TPA(DPP–PN)3 based devices are significantly improved owing to the attachment of the π-stacking planar PN terminals with the TPA–3DPP parent. The optimized TPA(DPP–PN)3/PC71BM based device presented a dramatically enhanced PCE of 3.67% with a Jsc of 8.95 mA cm−2 and FF of 51%, which is the highest among the star-shaped molecules with the same TPA–3DPP framework and different appending terminals. The results indicate that the structural modifications by appending planar PN terminals into the star-shaped TPA–3DPP parent could significantly enhance the device performances of its resulting molecules.
