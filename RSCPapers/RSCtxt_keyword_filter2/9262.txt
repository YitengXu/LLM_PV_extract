    , Accepted 5th March 2013First published on 5th March 2013AbstractA 54π-electron fullerene acceptor, bis-thieno-o-quinodimethane-methano[60]fullerene (bis-TOQMF), featuring a compact –CH2– addend and two thieno-o-quinodimethane addends, has been developed. Bis-TOQMF possesses good solubility and a high LUMO level of −3.40 eV. Polymer solar cells based on bis-TOQMF/P3HT show not only high Voc (0.94 V) but also good Jsc (8.09 mA cm−2) and FF (58%). The highest PCE of 4.56% has been achieved for 54π-electron fullerene solar cells to date. On the contrary, a 54π-electron analogue of bis-TOQMF, tris-thieno-o-quinodimethane-C60 (tris-TOQC), shows low performance. 1.02% PCE was obtained for tris-TOQC/P3HT solar cells, with high Voc (0.96 V) but much lower Jsc (2.85 mA cm−2) and FF (35%). Space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements indicate that the electron mobility of bis-TOQMF is 10 times higher than that of tris-TOQC. Bis-TOQMF/P3HT solar cells show higher thermal stability than PC61BM/P3HT solar cells.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention due to their light weight, mechanical flexibility, and solution processing.1 In the past few years, remarkable progress has been made in enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs owing to the success in materials development. The first achievement is using low-bandgap polymer donors to replace poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) to make a better match of the light absorption of the cells to solar spectrum, thus to improve the short circuit current (Jsc).2 The second one is using higher LUMO level fullerene acceptors to replace [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) to reduce the energy loss in charge separation and to increase the open circuit voltage (Voc).3 For both cases, over 7% PCEs have been reported. The second approach using high LUMO fullerenes is rather appealing because lifting fullerene LUMO can be easily realized by shrinking a fullerene π-conjugated system to develop fullerene multi-adducts.4 In this regard, a number of 56π-electron fullerene bis-adducts have been facilely prepared, which generally show LUMO levels 0.1–0.2 eV higher than those of the 58π-electron fullerene mono-adducts.5 Recent research demonstrated that fullerene bis-adducts are superior acceptor materials not only for P3HT-based solar cells but also for some D–A copolymer-based solar cells.5,6
The success of fullerene bis-adducts stimulates the search for fullerene acceptors with even higher LUMO levels, for example, the 54π-electron derivatives. The LUMO levels of 54π-electron fullerenes like tris-PC61BM, ICTA, OXCTA, and penta(organo)[60]fullerenes are 0.2–0.4 eV higher than those of the 58π fullerenes (Fig. 1).5d,7 However, application of these 54π fullerenes in PSCs was unsuccessful. Although up to 0.98 V Voc was obtained for solar cells based on these acceptors, Jsc and fill factor (FF) were very low, leading to unsatisfying PCEs. The best PCE achieved for 54π fullerenes to date is 2.63%, obtained from the OXCTA/P3HT solar cells.5d The low performance of 54π fullerene derivatives is caused by their low electron mobilities, which may not result from the increased energetic disorder from regio-isomerism but from the increased insulating side groups (chains) inhibiting the effective packing of fullerenes to form transport pathways for electrons.8 It was predicted that multi-adducts of fullerene with small and compact addends could be efficient acceptors; yet such acceptors have been less exploited.9 Recently, our group reported two highly efficient 56π acceptors, OQMF and TOQMF, based on methano[60]fullerene (C60CH2).10 The smallest –CH2– group can effectively lift the fullerene LUMO without disrupting fullerene packing, leading to simultaneously improved Voc, Jsc, and FF of the devices compared with those of PC61BM-based cells. Based on this discovery, we expected that the higher adducts of methano[60]fullerenes, 54π methano[60]fullerenes, might also be efficient materials, rendering the solar cells with not only higher Voc but also good PCEs. Here, we report the synthesis of a 54π methano[60]fullerene derivative, bis-thieno-o-quinodimethane-methano[60]fullerene (bis-TOQMF), based on two-fold Diels–Alder derivatization of C60CH2, and a 54π fullerene tris-adduct, tris-thieno-o-quinodimethane-C60 (tris-TOQC), for comparison (Fig. 1). Although only one thieno-o-quinodimethane side group was replaced by a –CH2– group, bis-TOQMF showed significantly higher performance than tris-TOQC in PSCs. Bis-TOQMF afforded a PCE of 4.56%, which is the highest efficiency ever reported for a 54π fullerene acceptor, while 1.02% PCE was obtained for tris-TOQC under the same conditions. The outstanding performance of bis-TOQMF compared with other 54π fullerenes resulted from higher Jsc and FF of its devices. Space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements indicate that the electron mobility of bis-TOQMF is 10 times higher than that of tris-TOQC.

Results and discussion
Bis-TOQMF and tris-TOQC were synthesized through addition of the in situ generated thieno-o-quinodimethane diene to C60CH2 and C60, respectively.5i,10 The experimental details can be found in ESI.† The new fullerene derivatives were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and high resolution ESI mass spectra (Fig. S1–S5†). The materials' properties were investigated by UV-Vis, cyclic voltammetry (CV), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) methods. The absorption spectra of bis-TOQMF and tris-TOQC in chloroform and films are shown in Fig. S6.† The optical bandgaps estimated from the absorption edges in chloroform are 1.80 eV and 1.81 eV for bis-TOQMF and tris-TOQC, respectively (Table 1). The film absorption spectra indicate that bis-TOQMF has higher absorbance than tris-TOQC does in the solid state. The first half-wave reduction potentials (ERed11/2) for bis-TOQMF and tris-TOQC show significant negative shifts compared with that of PC61BM (Fig. S7†). The LUMO levels of bis-TOQMF and tris-TOQC estimated from the empirical equation, LUMO = −(ERed11/2 + 4.8) eV,11 are −3.40 eV and −3.33 eV, respectively, which are 0.28 eV and 0.35 eV higher than that of PC61BM (−3.68 eV) (Tables 1 and S1†). The LUMO level lift-ups caused by π-electron reduction are similar to those of other 54π fullerenes.7 High LUMO levels of bis-TOQMF and tris-TOQC are expected to provide high Voc for solar cells. The decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) for bis-TOQMF and tris-TOQC are 207 °C and 221 °C, respectively (Fig. S8†). DSC curves for bis-TOQMF and tris-TOQC show no phase transition during either heating or cooling processes, suggesting their amorphous feature (Fig. S9†).12 Both bis-TOQMF and tris-TOQC show high solubility in common organic solvents. For example, the solubilities of bis-TOQMF and tris-TOQC in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) were determined to be 75 mg mL−1 and 125 mg mL−1, respectively.13

PSCs with a typical structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/fullerene:P3HT/Ca/Al were fabricated to evaluate the performance of bis-TOQMF and tris-TOQC. First, we optimized D/A ratio, film thickness, and annealing temperature for the devices based on a P3HT/bis-TOQMF blend (Fig. S10–S12†). Then, we evaluated additive effects on device performance. Performance parameters for these solar cells are listed in Table 2. During the first stage of device optimization, we found that bis-TOQMF solar cells with a D/A ratio of 1:0.6 (w/w), an active layer thickness of 100 nm, with annealing at 130 °C for 10 min afforded the best results, with a high Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 6.91 mA cm−2, a FF of 53%, and a PCE of 3.55%. Under the same conditions, however, tris-TOQC solar cells afforded a much lower PCE of 1.12%, with a similar Voc of 0.91 V, but a low Jsc of 3.60 mA cm−2 and a low FF of 34%. Solvent additives can dramatically influence the performance of the solar cells based on fullerene bis-adducts.3d We tried to improve the device performance by adding additives such as α-chloronaphthalene (α-CN) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). The addition of 3 vol% α-CN into the blend solution dramatically improved the performance of bis-TOQMF devices. The PCE increased from 3.55% to 4.56%, benefiting from the improved Jsc (8.09 mA cm−2) and FF (58%). In contrast, a DIO additive has negative effects on device performance, leading to simultaneously decreased Voc, Jsc, and FF, and a diminished PCE of 2.56%. The effects of additives on tris-TOQC devices are small. For both α-CN and DIO cases, the PCEs show slight decrease, from 1.12% to 1.02% and 0.86%, respectively. J–V curves for bis-TOQMF and tris-TOQC solar cells using α-CN as an additive are shown in Fig. 2. Additives affect device performance by changing the morphology of the active layer.14 We studied the additive-induced morphology changes for bis-TOQMF/P3HT and tris-TOQC/P3HT blend films by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. S13 and S14†). RMS roughnesses for bis-TOQMF/P3HT blend films without additives, with α-CN, and with DIO are 0.70 nm, 2.06 nm, and 4.24 nm, respectively. TEM images indicate that the blend films without additives and with α-CN show similar uniform morphology. Large domains with sizes of a few hundred nanometers exist in the blend film with DIO. This unfavorable morphology should account for the low performance of the solar cells using a DIO additive. The moderately increased roughness of the films with α-CN might result from the increased crystallinity of P3HT induced by the additive.3d,15 The increased P3HT crystallinity and no over-aggregation in the films led to better performance of bis-TOQMF solar cells with α-CN. AFM and TEM images for tris-TOQC/P3HT blend films with α-CN or DIO show similar features as those of bis-TOQMF/P3HT blend films.

sc and FF for bis-TOQMF solar cells reach the highest values for 54π-fullerene-based devices, indicating that bis-TOQMF has superior electron mobility compared with other 54π fullerenes. We investigated the charge carrier mobilities of bis-TOQMF/P3HT and tris-TOQC/P3HT blends by the SCLC method. Fig. 3 shows J–V curves of the electron-only devices in the dark. By fitting J–V curves in the SCLC mode, electron mobilities for bis-TOQMF and tris-TOQC devices were calculated to be 1.68 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.52 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The electron mobility of bis-TOQMF is 10 times higher than that of tris-TOQC, which agrees with our speculation. The only structural difference between bis-TOQMF and tris-TOQC is that one thieno-o-quinodimethane switches to –CH2–. SCLC results indicate that the smallest –CH2– group can improve the electron mobility of fullerene multi-adducts probably by favoring their packing, suggesting that using small and compact groups to modify fullerene is a promising approach for creating efficient acceptor materials. Hole mobilities for both devices are similar, ∼2.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S16†). The unbalanced charge carrier transport (μh/μe = 158, Table S2†) in tris-TOQC solar cells should account for its low FF.5d

We studied the performance changes for bis-TOQMF/P3HT cells and PC61BM/P3HT reference cells under heating at 130 °C for 45 h in an inert atmosphere. It was observed that bis-TOQMF/P3HT solar cells show higher thermal stability than PC61BM/P3HT cells (Fig. 4). After thermal treatment, the PCE of PC61BM cells decreased from 4.38% to 0.61%, while that of bis-TOQMF cells showed a relatively small decrease, from 4.47% to 3.66% (Fig. S17†). The decrease of PCE for both cases resulted from the decrease in Jsc and FF. Optical microscopy indicates that the bis-TOQMF/P3HT blend film remained uniform after being heated at 130 °C for 45 h (Fig. 5a). The multi-addition and the bulky structure of bis-TOQMF inhibit the molecules to aggregate to form large domains. In sharp contrast, μm-scale PC61BM crystals appeared in PC61BM/P3HT blend films after the thermal treatment (Fig. 5b and S18†). Similar phenomena were observed previously.5f,9c,16

Conclusions
A novel 54π-electron fullerene acceptor, bis-TOQMF, featuring a high LUMO level and a compact –CH2– addend has been developed and applied in PSCs. Unlike other reported 54π fullerene acceptors, bis-TOQMF afforded solar cells with not only high Voc (0.94 V) but also good Jsc and FF, leading to the highest PCE (4.56%) for PSCs based on 54π fullerene and P3HT. The high performance of bis-TOQMF originates from its high electron mobility, which is probably due to the good packing of the molecules favored by the smallest –CH2– group. Our results suggest that using small and compact addends to modify fullerene is a promising approach to obtain highly efficient acceptor materials. More efforts on developing high performance fullerene acceptors are currently ongoing in our lab.
Experimental
Solar cell fabrication and characterization
A patterned ITO glass with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1 was ultrasonically cleaned using detergent, distilled water, acetone, and isopropanol sequentially and then given UV–ozone treatment. A 30 nm thick poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios™ P VP Al 4083) layer was formed on ITO substrates by spin coating an aqueous dispersion (4000 rpm for 30 s) onto the ITO glass. PEDOT:PSS coated substrates were dried at 140 °C for 10 min. A P3HT/fullerene blend in ODCB (24 mg mL−1) without or with 3 vol% additives (α-CN, DIO) was spin-coated (1200 rpm for 60 s) onto a PEDOT:PSS layer. Then, the films were annealed at 130 °C for 10 min. The thicknesses of the active layers (90–100 nm) were measured by KLA Tencor D-120 profilometer. Finally, Ca (∼10 nm) and Al (∼100 nm) were thermally evaporated under a shadow mask (pressure: ca. 10−4 Pa). The effective area for the devices is 4 mm2. J–V curves were measured on a computerized Keithley 2420 SourceMeter. Device characterization was done in air under 97 mW cm−2 irradiation (calibrated with a NREL certified standard silicon cell (4 cm2)) from a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Newport Oriel Solar Simulator, Model 91159A). AFM was carried out on a Dimension 3100 microscope (Veeco). TEM was performed on a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 electron microscope operated at 200 kV. Optical microscopy images were obtained by using a DM4000 microscope (Leica).
Electron mobility measurement
The structure of electron-only devices is Al/active layer/Ca/Al.17 Al (∼80 nm) was first evaporated onto a glass substrate. A P3HT/fullerene blend in ODCB with 3 vol% α-CN was spin-coated onto Al films. The films were annealed at 130 °C for 10 min. Finally, Ca (∼5 nm) and Al (∼100 nm) were thermally evaporated under a shadow mask (pressure: ca. 10−4 Pa). J–V curves were measured on a computerized Keithley 2420 SourceMeter in the dark.
Hole mobility measurement
The structure of hole-only devices is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al.18 A 30 nm thick PEDOT:PSS layer was formed on ITO substrates by spin coating an aqueous dispersion (4000 rpm for 30 s) onto an ITO glass. PEDOT:PSS coated substrates were dried at 140 °C for 10 min. A P3HT/fullerene blend in ODCB with 3 vol% α-CN was spin-coated onto a PEDOT:PSS layer. The films were annealed at 130 °C for 10 min. Finally, MoO3 (∼6 nm) and Al (∼100 nm) were successively evaporated onto the active layer under a shadow mask (pressure: ca. 10−4 Pa). J–V curves were measured on a computerized Keithley 2420 SourceMeter in the dark.
