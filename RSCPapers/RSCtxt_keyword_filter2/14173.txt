    , Accepted 20th April 2015First published on 21st April 2015AbstractTwo narrow-bandgap extended π-conjugated D2–Aw–D1–As–D1–Aw–D2 type small molecules (DPPBIT and DPPBIT4F) based on diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives as the stronger acceptor core coupled with indacenodithiophene, benzothiadiazole or difluorobenzothiadiazole are designed and synthesized for application as donor materials in solution-processed small-molecule organic solar cells. The impacts of installation of four fluorine atoms to the two weaker acceptor units (benzothiadiazole) on the photophysical properties, the HOMO/LUMO energy level, charge carrier mobilities and the morphologies of blend films, and their photovoltaic properties are investigated. DPPBIT and DPPBIT4F exhibit similar broad and intense optical absorption covering the range from 300 to 900 nm and relatively low-lying HOMO energy levels. These two materials display significantly different photovoltaic performances. Compared with the best PCE of 2.7% for the blend films of DPPBIT and PC71BM, the BHJ-OSC devices based on DPPBIT4F and PC71BM exhibit the best PCE of 5.4% and very-high FF of 0.69 upon CH2Cl2 vapor annealing for 30 s, which is one of the best reported photovoltaic performances based on DPP-core small molecules in single-junction BHJ solar cells. Exposure to CH2Cl2 vapor allows for a re-organization of the blend films, which increases the intensity and vibrational feature of absorption and dramatically improves the balance of charge carrier mobility and PCE.
Introduction
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) based on bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) device structures with narrow band gap π-conjugated molecules as donors and fullerene derivatives as acceptors have attracted considerable attention in recent years as a promising renewable energy resource because of their advantages such as light weight, flexibility, and low cost.1 The development of device architectures using donor/acceptor materials has led to record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of ca. 10% for soluble π-conjugated polymers in single-junction solar cells.2 However, the polydispersity of polymers affects the reproducibility of the synthesis, purification, and electronic properties of the final active materials. Over the past few years, solution-processed narrow-bandgap small-molecules have gained increasing interest because of their simple purification, monodisperse and well-defined structures, absence of end-group contaminants, and superior batch-to-batch reproducible performance compared to polymer counterparts.3 Moreover, another advantage of small molecules is that they provide more reliable analyses of structure–properties–device performance relationships and disclose the key to the design of high performance photovoltaic materials. Therefore, the performance of solution processed BHJ-OSCs based on small-molecules has dramatically increased over the past few years, which is approaching the best performance of polymer solar cells.4 Despite the best performance and high potential benefits, the typical building blocks for high performance (PCEs > 7%) small-molecule donor materials are still rather limited and countable, such as the dithienosilole (DTS) core unit by Bazan and Heeger's groups, benzodithiophene (BDT) core units by Chen and Yang et al., and porphyrin core units by Peng et al.5 To enrich the pool of high performance small-molecule donor materials, the most straightforward and effective approaches are new molecular design, optimization of the film morphology and device engineering to understand in-depth the design principle of such donor materials.
To absorb the solar spectrum efficiently, these donor molecules are typically composed of multiple high optical density chromophores with push–pull characteristics. Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), a typical strong acceptor chromophore with a high molar extinction coefficient, has been investigated in small molecular organic solar cells.6 Most of their HOMOs are relatively high resulting in a lower open circuit voltage (Voc) of solar cells. By the attachment of weaker aromatic donor units (phenyl, benzofuran, and pyrene) or electron-withdrawing units (ester group), the HOMO of these materials decreases, while the energy gap remains slightly wider.6 Therefore, high-efficiency solar cells obtained from DPP-based small molecules are really rare and the best PCE of small molecular organic solar cells based on DPP derivatives is still below 6%,6j,m which is much lower than the PCE obtained by the DTS or BDT core. Another major drawback of DPP-based small molecules in blends with fullerene derivatives is the moderate fill factor (FF), caused by the strong non-geminate recombination of DPP-based small molecules.6 Thus, further improvement of the PCE requires that both the Voc and the FF be enhanced without deteriorating the favourable optical properties and high internal quantum efficiencies of DPP-based small molecules. Meanwhile, a popular strategy to improve the PCE by non-covalent interaction is to attach fluorine atoms to the electron-deficient subunits of conjugated polymer molecules.7 Although the cause of the efficiency improvement varies noticeably depending upon the specific systems, it is generally accepted that monofluorinated or difluorinated benzothiadiazoles as stronger acceptor chromophores can tune the optical and electronic properties of conjugated polymer materials, such as the blue-shift of the absorption peak and decrease of the HOMO energy level in comparison with their fluorine-free analogues.8 Moreover, fluorine–sulfur or fluorine–hydrogen interactions often have a great influence on inter-and intramolecular interactions, which facilitate the formation of highly ordered solid-state structures and result in reduced charge recombination and higher device performance, relative to their fluorine-free analogues.8 It remains a difficult task to incorporate multiple fluorine substituents (n > 2) in a single small-molecule for highly efficient photovoltaic materials mainly due to the lower solubility of the target materials. Moreover, less attention has been paid to the impact of fluorine atoms on the weaker acceptor units in extended backbone structures having more than one acceptor units, particularly for the investigation of the influence on device performance by employing solvent annealing, thermal annealing or other post-treatments. These pioneering studies and challenge inspired us to synthesize new extended backbone structures with efficient light-harvesting ability and high carrier mobility by combining the existing merits of these two acceptor units (DPP as a stronger acceptor and benzothiadiazole as a weaker acceptor), which is essential to enhance the overall performance of solution-processed extended small-molecule solar cells based on DPP derivatives.
Hence, we first describe the rational design and synthesis of two extended π-conjugated small-molecules DPPBIT and DPPBIT4F based on a very similar extended molecular skeleton D2–Aw–D1–As–D1–Aw–D2. As shown in Chart 1, the two extended π-conjugated molecules have a DPP-based core as the central stronger acceptor unit (As), two indacenodithiophene (IDT)-based π-conjugated bridges as the donor (D1), two benzothiadiazole or difluorobenzothiadiazole as the second and weaker acceptor (Aw), and two n-hexyl-substituted bithiophenes as the terminal groups (D2). Although the photophysical properties of these materials were dominated by the molecular backbone and stronger acceptor core, we are curious to investigate the impact of fluorine atoms on the weaker acceptor unit in the extended backbone structures. Therefore, we focus our studies on evaluating the effect of installing two fluorine atoms on the weaker acceptor (Aw) benzothiadiazole on the bulk properties, such as the light-harvesting ability, the molecular HOMO/LUMO energy levels, charge carrier mobility, the morphologies of blend films, and photovoltaic performance of these materials as donor materials. Both materials exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents such as CHCl3, THF, and toluene owing to the eight 2-ethylhexyls and four hexyls, thus they can be readily solution-processed and form excellent smooth films by spin-coating. In combination with using PC71BM as the acceptor, we discovered a striking difference in the photovoltaic behavior of the fluorinated materials and fluorine-free materials. The BHJ-OSC devices based on DPPBIT4F, that incorporates four fluorine atoms, exhibited PCE of 5.4%, with a high Voc of 0.74 V, short circuit current density (Jsc) of 10.5 mA cm−2 and very-high FF of 0.69 upon annealing by CH2Cl2 for 30 s without using any additives. We observed 9 times increase of PCE in comparison with that before solvent vapor annealing, and it is particularly noteworthy that the initial performance as well as the very-high FF is one of the best reported PCEs based on DPP-core small molecules in single-junction BHJ solar cells. Surprisingly, the device based on non-fluorinated DPPBIT and PC71BM gave much lower PCEs (2.7% of best results without solvent vapor annealing) and the PCE was reduced to 1.8% upon annealing by CH2Cl2 for 30 s, respectively. As mentioned previously, prediction of the bulk behavior of such materials as a function of chromophore connectivity is in the infant stage, thus it is still difficult to answer the question of how to design a compound that would achieve high performance. The results herein provide a facile strategy to understand the impact of multiple fluorine atoms when attached to the weaker units of an extended conjugated D2–Aw–D1–As–D1–Aw–D2 framework. The reason for such an impact is therefore of intense research interest and is investigated thoroughly in this study.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and thermal properties
The synthetic routes to these extended small molecules are shown in Scheme 1. Treatment of 1 (ref. 9) with n-BuLi followed by tributyltin chloride (1.0 eq.) facilely gave the monotin reagent 2 as a light-yellow oil that was directly used in the next step without any further purification. 4 was prepared through the Stille coupling reactions between 2 and monobromide intermediate 3 (ref. 10) using a Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tolyl)3 catalytic system. Then 4 was lithiated by LDA followed by quenching with trimethyltin chloride to afford the monotin reagent 5. Similarly, fluorinated intermediate 8 was obtained by a reaction sequence of Stille coupling reactions between another monobromide 6 (ref. 10) and monotin 2 and then treatment with LDA–Me3SnCl in 46% overall yield. Finally, DPPBIT and DPPBIT4F were obtained through a two-fold Stille coupling reaction between dibromide 9 and monotin 5 and 8, respectively, as dark solids in 76% and 81% isolated yields, respectively. All compounds were purified by silica gel column chromatography, and their structures and purity were verified by 1H and 13C NMR, elemental analysis, and ESI/MALDI-TOF MS. The thermal properties of these extended small molecules were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S1†). Under a N2 atmosphere, the onset temperature with 5% weight-loss was about 408 °C for DPPBIT and 410 °C for DPPBIT4F, which indicates that the thermal stability of these molecules is adequate for application in organic solar cells (Fig. 1).

Optical properties
To investigate the relationship between the molecular structure and the photophysical properties, the absorption spectra of these extended small-molecules both in diluted chloroform solutions and in thin films obtained by spin-coating are recorded in Fig. 2. Both molecules showed two distinct absorption bands (Band I: 350–450 nm; Band II: 450–900 nm) in solution and in the solid state due to the π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the two molecular donor and two acceptor units. Both compounds have structured vibrational absorption peaks in the Band II region, which agrees well with their shape-persistent conjugated backbones. Very interestingly, although the spectral profile of DPPBIT4F is nearly identical to that of the nonfluorinated DPPBIT in solution, introduction of four fluorine atoms in DPPBIT4F led to a slight blue-shift by ca. 2 nm, 5 nm, and 3 nm at three λmax peaks (0–0 and 0–1 vibrational peaks in the Band II region and λmax peak in the Band I region) in comparison with DPPBIT, respectively. In addition, both compounds show different oscillator strengths of vibrational absorption peaks in the Band II region. For example, compared with DPPBIT, the obvious shoulder features in the range of 500–600 nm with a higher molar extinction coefficient are shown in the spectra of DPPBIT4F, which might be attributed to the increase in molecular rigidity and planarity through the fluorine–sulfur or fluorine–hydrogen interactions between benzothiadiazole and IDT units.11 In contrast, the absorption spectra of these extended small molecules in thin films are obviously red-shifted and increase the relative intensity of their 0–0 vibrational peak. Compared to the main absorption maximum peaks (λmax) at about 700 nm in solution, both DPPBIT and DPPBIT4F display a red-shift of ca. 26 nm in the thin films. Moreover, DPPBIT4F still exhibits a slight blue-shift (ca. 3 nm) of the λmax peak at about 700 nm in comparison with DPPBIT in the thin film. Such features are attributed to a more planar conjugated backbone and more ordered structure in the solid state. Therefore a higher π-electron delocalization through the whole molecular backbone and enhanced interchromophore interactions are expected, which would be beneficial to a higher hole mobility. From the onset of absorption in thin films, the optical band gap of the solid state was estimated to be 1.60 eV for DPPBIT and 1.61 eV for DPPBIT4F, as listed in Table 1. This indicates that the introduction of four fluorine atoms on the weaker acceptor unit (benzothiadiazole) in DPP-based extended linear small molecules does not obviously affect the band gap.

Electrochemical properties
In order to investigate the relationship between the chemical structures and the electrochemical properties of the desired materials, cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments for the two materials as thin films were conducted. The CV curves showed one quasi-reversible p-doping process and n-doping process (Fig. 3). After introducing fluorine atoms, the reductive doping processes of DPPBIT4F appeared to be slightly more reversible than those of DPPBIT. The HOMO and LUMO levels were −5.22 eV/−3.26 eV for DPPBIT and −5.23 eV/−3.27 eV for DPPBIT4F, according to the following equation: EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.80) (eV) and ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.80) (eV). DPPBIT4F showed slightly deeper HOMO levels (ΔE = 0.03 eV) relative to DPPBIT due to the electron withdrawing nature of the four fluorine groups on the two weaker acceptor units (benzothiadiazole). In contrast, changes in LUMO energy levels on fluorine substitution are less notable because the LUMOs are mostly localized on the stronger electron-deficient cores (DPP) of the extended compounds, which results in a slight increase of the band gap of DPPBIT4F. The electrochemical band gaps (Eg(cv)) are slightly larger than the corresponding optical band gaps (Eg(opt)) because the compounds investigated in the electrochemical experiments were in the form of free ions whereas they were in a neutral state in optical experiments. Such a slight decrease of the HOMO energy level for DPPBIT4F may be beneficial for its BHJ-OSCs performance (Table 2).

Photovoltaic properties
To demonstrate the potential of theextended small-molecules DPPBIT and DPPBIT4F as promising donor materials in organic solar cells, we fabricated BHJ-OSCs with a device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/small molecule donor:PC71BM/PFN/Al. The blend ratio significantly influenced the device performance. As an effective method for enhancement of PCE, solvent vapor annealing has been used in BHJ-OSCs to optimize the morphology of the active layer.12 Herein, the method was used in device optimization in combination with different D/A ratios (1:3, 1:2, 1:1.5, 1:1, 1:0.8, and 1:0.6 for DPPBIT4F, and 1:3, 1:2, 1:1, and 1:0.8 for DPPBIT). For solvent vapor annealing, the active layer was exposed to CH2Cl2 for 30 s, without the need for incorporation of additives. The optimized thicknesses of the active layers were determined to be 80–100 nm. Table 3 summarizes the device performance for the two materials before and after solvent vapor annealing, such as Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE of the devices under 1 sun illumination. As expected, all of the devices based on our two small-molecules exhibited a high Voc (0.74–0.85 V) due to the relatively lower-lying HOMO energy levels of donor materials, although Voc slightly decreased after solvent vapor annealing under the same D/A ratio.13 It is worthy to mention that the reduction in Voc after solvent vapor annealing is very common in solution-processed small-molecule organic solar cells,12 which will be discussed later.

Before the solvent vapor annealing method was employed for the two materials, the best PCE was 2.7% for DPPBIT and 2.0% for DPPBIT4F with PC71BM at a 1:3 ratio. This indicates that the device performance was not very different for the two materials. After the solvent vapor annealing method was employed, for DPPBIT/PC71BM (1:3 and 1:2) based devices, the photovoltaic performance was reduced to 1.8% and 1.7% upon annealing by CH2Cl2 for 30 s, respectively. Moreover, DPPBIT with a 1:1 ratio of PC71BM slightly improved in efficiency after solvent vapor annealing with CH2Cl2. Surprisingly, DPPBIT4F blends with PC71BM dramatically improved the PCE due to the significant enhancement of Jsc and FF as a result of exposure to CH2Cl2 vapor. For example, the optimal performance was obtained when the weight ratio of DPPBIT4F/PC71BM was 1:1, which resulted in a Jsc = 10.5 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.74 V, FF = 0.69, and PCE = 5.4%.
In order to further improve the photovoltaic performance of DPPBIT4F when the weight ratio of DPPBIT4F/PC71BM was 1:1, thermal annealing at 80 °C for 10 min with the addition of the additive diiodooctane (DIO) was employed in the device optimization in combination with solvent vapor annealing. Surprisingly, after DPPBIT4F was solely treated by thermal annealing at 80 °C for 10 min, the PCE remained at about 0.6%. When the thermal annealing active layer was exposed to CH2Cl2 vapor for 30 s, the PCE also sharply improved to 5.3%, with a Jsc = 11.0 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.73 V, and FF = 0.66. However, when 0.4% DIO was added into the solvent, the PCE dramatically decreased to 0.3%. It seems that solvent vapor annealing is a more efficient method for our materials to improve the PCE than thermal annealing and use of additives. Solvent vapor annealing resulted in about 9 times increase of PCE, over 4 times increase of Jsc, over 2 times increase of FF, and a slight drop of Voc in comparison with the method in which solvent vapor annealing was not employed, and it is particularly noteworthy that the initial performance as well as the very-high FF is one of the best reported PCEs based on DPP-core small molecules in the literature.
Considering the fact that DPPBIT and DPPBIT4F are similar with only a structural variation with or without the four fluorine groups, the large difference in the photovoltaic performance due to the introduction of F atoms is amazing. The high PCE of DPPBIT4F based OSCs by post-treatment further proved that the introduction of fluorine atoms to molecules is a valid design strategy for high performance OSCs. Moreover, as shown in Table 3, the device performance of DPPBIT is better than that of DPPBIT4F under thermal annealing and addition of additives or without the solvent vapor annealing for the two materials. However, after solvent vapor annealing, the device performance of DPPBIT4F is much better than that of DPPBIT. With higher ratios of DPPBIT4F in the blends using PC71BM (from 1:3 to 1:0.6), a bigger difference in the performance (1.8 times to 16.5 times) was observed for DPPBIT4F with or without solvent vapor annealing. It seems that solvent vapor annealing has a critical positive impact on DPPBIT4F with multiple fluorine substitution in OPV applications in comparison with DPPBIT, by probably facilitating the formation of a highly ordered solid-state structure and thus resulting in higher device performance after solvent vapor annealing as discussed below.12

Fig. 4 shows the current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the best device from DPPBIT4F:PC71BM (1:1) and DPPBITPC71BM (1:3) before and after solvent vapor annealing. For comparison, the best J–V characteristics of devices with different ratios are also shown (see Fig. S1†). The substantial Jsc improvement (7.4 mA cm−2vs. 10.5 mA cm−2) upon the change of the blend ratio of DPPBIT4F and PCBM from 1:3 to 1:1 both treated by solvent vapor annealing can be partially attributed to the stronger optical absorption coverage in the whole visible region, which can be clearly seen from Fig. 5. Indeed, the blend film with a 1:1 ratio of DPPBIT4F/PC71BM showed an obvious enhancement in the absorption spectra in the range of 450–800 nm when compared with the film from the 1:3 blends.

 Fig. 5  Absorption spectra of DPPBIT4FPC71BM (1:1, 1:2, and 1:3, w/w) blend films with or without CH2Cl2 vapor annealing. 
To determine the origin of the observed photovoltaic performance differences between DPPBIT and DPPBIT4F as well as the effect of solvent vapor annealing on the active layer, we carried out more detailed investigation on absorption properties, external quantum efficiency (EQE), charge mobility, and morphology of the blend films by atomic force microscopy (AFM) to draw the structure–property relationship.
As shown in Fig. 5, in comparison with the absorption spectra of the as-cast blend film of DPPBIT4F with PC71BM (1:1 to 1:3), the spectra of the film with CH2Cl2 vapor annealing show well-defined features across the entire visible spectrum. For example, there are more obvious 0–0 and 0–1 vibrational shoulder peaks and the overall absorption intensity in the range of 450–800 nm obviously increased, particularly for the 1:1 and 1:2 ratios, which is related to the enhanced π–π stacking and interaction of molecules due to the increase in molecular planarity between difluorinated benzothiadiazole and IDT units. Such enhanced absorption features result in improved Jsc from 2.5 mA cm−2 to 10.5 mA cm−2 for blend films with a 1:1 ratio of DPPBIT4FPC71BM after CH2Cl2 vapor annealing. In contrast, as shown in Fig. S3,† in comparison with the absorption spectra of the as-cast blend film of DPPBIT with PC71BM (1:1 to 1:3), the spectra of the film on CH2Cl2 vapor annealing exhibited only a slight increase of the absorption intensity, but displayed a very similar absorption profile.
To further understand the device performance, the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) spectra of these devices were measured and are shown in Fig. 6. All the EQE spectra covered a broad wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm for all the devices based on DPPBIT and DPPBIT4F. It is apparent that exposure to CH2Cl2 vapor leads to increased EQE in the entire photoactive region for DPPBIT4F-based devices, which is consistent with the increase in Jsc. For example, the maximum EQE value is 15% at 400 nm and 48% at 410 nm for devices based on the DPPBIT4FPC71BM (1:1) blend without and with solvent vapor annealing treatment, respectively, which indicates that the photoelectron conversion process is more efficient after solvent vapor annealing. Moreover, the blend film with a 1:1 ratio of DPPBIT4F/PC71BM showed an obvious enhancement in the EQE profile, particularly for the range of 600–800 nm when compared with the film from the 1:3 blend both after solvent treatment (see Fig. S4†). These results are consistent with the trend of the above UV-vis absorption results. However, although the shape and intensity of the absorption spectra remained unaffected by the CH2Cl2 vapor annealing for blend films with DPPBIT/PC71BM, the intensity of EQE spectra obviously decreased in the entire photoactive region for the blend film with a 1:3 ratio of DPPBIT/PC71BM under CH2Cl2 vapor annealing. The calculated Jsc values obtained by integration of the EQE data for these devices showed 2–5% mismatch compared with the Jsc value from the J–V curve.

It is well known that film morphology plays a key role in the charge separation and charge transfer for organic thin film solar cells. To investigate the causes for the enhanced OSC performances of DPPBIT4F, the film morphologies were measured using tapping mode AFM (Fig. 7). The samples were prepared by spin-coating the donor: PC71BM blend in the same way as the photoactive layers for the solar cell devices. Without solvent annealing, large parts of the film surface were smooth and featureless with a root-mean-square roughness (Rrms) of about 0.4–0.5 nm, indicating that all of the donor materials have a good miscibility with PC71BM. After solvent vapor annealing, the blend films were more phase-separated and displayed larger surface aggregates. The roughness of the film surface increased after solvent vapor annealing from 0.44 nm to 0.70 nm for the blend with a 1:1 ratio of DPPBIT4F/PC71BM and from 0.53 nm to 0.74 nm for the blend with a 1:3 ratio of DPPBIT/PC71BM, as a result of the enhanced intermolecular interactions among the small molecular donors in the active layer, as indicated by the optical properties of the blend films, which was in good agreement with the previous literature.14 Obviously, the solvent vapor annealing provided a driving force to increase the domain of donor/acceptor and get much better ordered film morphology of the active layer in the nanoscale, which is preferable for improving the charge transport properties upon solvent treatment as discussed below.

To verify the positive effect of solvent vapor annealing on charge transport and understand the relationship between the charge carrier transport properties and structure of these two extended small molecule blends with PC71BM, the charge carrier mobilities were determined from space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements in the actual device before and after the solvent vapor annealing procedure. The structures of hole only and electron only devices are ITO/PEDOT/donor material: PC71BM/MoO3/Al and ITO/ZnO/PFN/donor material: PC71BM/Ca/Al, respectively. Table 4 displays the hole and electron mobilities determined from the SCLC measurements and Fig. S5† displays J–V characteristics of the hole-only and electron-only devices as obtained in the dark. The hole mobility for the device fabricated from DPPBIT or DPPBIT4F was enhanced after CH2Cl2 vapor annealing for 30 s, which is consistent with the increase of Rrms in the AFM image. For example, for devices without CH2Cl2 vapor annealing based on a 1:1 ratio of DPPBIT4F/PC71BM and 1:3 ratio of DPPBIT/PC71BM, the hole mobilities were 2.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. After CH2Cl2 vapor annealing for 30 s, the hole mobility increased to 9.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which corresponds to a higher than three times enhancement. Although the electron mobility for the most original device is higher than the corresponding hole mobility, the electron mobility slightly decreased after CH2Cl2 vapor annealing for 30 s. As mentioned above, the μe/μh ratio is 0.7 for the device based on a 1:1 ratio of DPPBIT4F/PC71BM and 4.5 for the device based on a 1:3 ratio of DPPBIT/PC71BM after CH2Cl2 vapor annealing for 30 s, which dramatically decreased in comparison with the corresponding μe/μh ratio before the solvent treatment (4.2 for DPPBIT4F and 31 for DPPBIT). These results (higher and much balanced carrier mobility) suggest that CH2Cl2 vapor annealing is beneficial to the higher FF compared to original devices. Indeed, after solvent vapor annealing, the device based on DPPBIT4F or DPPBIT/PC71BM can exhibit improved FF, particularly DPPBIT4F with a very high FF (up to 71%) due to the much more balanced hole and electron mobilities in comparison with the device based on DPPBIT/PC71BM. The more balanced and higher mobility contributes to higher Jsc and FF because the accumulated charges and recombination processes are reduced by the increase in the carrier mobility and enhanced charge collection efficiency.15 On the other side, the more balanced hole and electron mobility and favourable charge extraction can lead to a depleted steady carrier density in the active layer,12b,13b,16 thus will result in a concomitant lower quasi-Fermi levels for electron and hole transport and reduction in Voc.

Conclusions
In this study, two DPP core-based extended conjugated D2–Aw–D1–As–D1–Aw–D2 type small molecules, DPPBIT and DPPBIT4F have been designed and synthesized as donors for BHJ-OSCs. The installation of four fluorine atoms to the two weaker acceptors (benzothiadiazole) of DPPBIT4F does not show obvious influence on the optical and electrochemical properties of DPPBIT4F compared with those of the fluorine-free DPPBIT. However, compared with the best PCE of 2.7% for DPPBIT and PC71BM, the BHJ-OSC devices based on DPPBIT4F and PC71BM exhibited the best PCE of 5.4% and a very-high FF of 0.69 for the device upon annealing by CH2Cl2 for 30 s but without using any additives, which is among one of the best reported photovoltaic performances based on DPP-core small molecules in single-junction BHJ solar cells, particularly for a very-high FF (up to 71% for some devices). These amazing results have revealed how large impacts on the photovoltaic performances can be achieved by installation of four fluorine atoms to weaker acceptor units as well as solvent vapor annealing. Exposure to CH2Cl2 vapor allows for a re-organization of the blend, which increased the intensity and vibrational feature of absorption, improved the balance of charge carrier mobility and PCE. Throughout this study, one may understand the importance of attachment of fluorine atoms on the weaker acceptor units in extended conjugated structures in the photovoltaic performance of materials. Moreover, the larger performance difference between these two compounds provides a valid design strategy for high performance optoelectronic materials.
Experimental section
Materials and characterization
All air and water sensitive reactions were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was dried over Na–benzophenone ketyl and freshly distilled prior to use. The other materials were commercial grade and used as received. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was conducted on flexible sheets precoated with SiO2 and the separated products were visualized by UV light. Column chromatography was conducted using SiO2 (300 mesh) from Fisher Scientific. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ARX-400 (400 MHz) or ARX-500 (500 MHz) spectrometer, using CDCl3, except where mentioned. All chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm). 1H NMR chemical shifts were referenced to TMS (0 ppm), and 13C NMR chemical shifts were referenced to CDCl3 (77.23 ppm). MALDI-TOF-MS was recorded on a Bruker BIFLEX III mass spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out on a TA Instrument Q600 analyzer. Elemental analyses were performed using a German Vario EL III elemental analyzer. Absorption spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 750 UV-vis spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a BASI Epsilon workstation. A glassy carbon electrode was used as the working electrode and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. Films were drop-cast on the glassy carbon working electrode from THF at a concentration of 5 mg mL−1. Measurements were carried out at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in CH3CN containing 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6 as the supporting electrolyte. All potentials were recorded versus an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and calibrated with the redox couple of Fc/Fc+ under the same experimental conditions.
BHJ-OSC fabrication, characterization and measurement
Device preparation and characterization were carried out in clean room conditions with protection from dust and moisture. The fabrication of BHJ-OSCs followed the procedures described in our previous paper.17 The values of power conversion efficiency were determined from J–V characteristics measured by a Keithley 2400 source-measurement unit under AM 1.5G illumination from a solar simulator (Oriel model 91192). Masks made from laser beam cutting technology with a well-defined area of 16.0 mm2 were attached to define the effective area for accurate measurement. Solar simulator illumination intensity was determined using a monocrystal silicon reference cell (Hamamatsu S1133, with a KG-5 visible color filter) calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The active layer was spin-coated from blend chloroform solutions with a weight ratio of DPPBIT or DPPBIT4F and PC71BM at 1:1 (or other ratios) and then were placed in a glass Petri dish containing 1 mL CH2Cl2 for 30 s for solvent vapor annealing. The film morphology was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Veeco MultiMode V) operating in tapping mode. EQE values of the encapsulated devices were measured by using an integrated system (Enlitech, Taiwan, China) and a lock-in amplifier with a current preamplifier under short-circuit conditions. The devices were illuminated by monochromatic light from a 75 W xenon lamp. The light intensity was determined by using a calibrated silicon photodiode.

To a solution of 1 (1.06 g, 1.49 mmol) in anhydrous THF was added dropwise a hexane solution of n-butyllithium (0.65 mL, 1.50 mmol) in a N2 atmosphere at −78 °C. The reaction mixture was stirred at this temperature for 1 h. Tributyltin chloride (0.41 mL, 1.50 mmol) was added dropwise into the mixture at −78 °C. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 10 h. The mixture solution was quenched with water, and extracted with chloroform.
