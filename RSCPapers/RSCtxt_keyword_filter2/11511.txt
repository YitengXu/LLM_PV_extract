    , Accepted 25th March 2022First published on 30th March 2022AbstractThe search for non-toxic and non-heavy metal absorbers for use is solar cells is attracting a lot of attention, and this research has led to the development of many non-toxic nanocrystal absorbers that have the capability to be integrated into cost-efficient, stable, and environmentally friendly solar cells. The ternary chalcogenide AgBiS2 exhibits unique properties, such as having a tunable bandgap, high absorption coefficient, and environmental stability, together with easy processability, and it has attracted the attention of the research community over the last few years. Although theoretical studies exposit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26% for these emerging nanocrystals, experimentally they have not been able to go beyond 9%, which has motivated researchers to explore these ternary chalcogenides. This review provides a detailed understanding of the intrinsic properties of AgBiS2, such as its structural, optical, and electronic band properties, and the device engineering strategies applied so far. The role and influence of various charge transport layers surrounding this absorber on device performance are also described and discussed scientifically. Finally, our conclusions and perspectives provide real insights into choosing appropriate techniques, methods, and charge transport materials to achieve and maximize the performance and power conversion efficiencies of these promising AgBiS2 devices.Akhil S.Akhil S. obtained his Bachelor's degree from the University of Calicut and completed his Masters in Physics from Bharathiar University in the year 2019 where he did research on polymer electrolyte based on iota carrageenan and sodium bromide for sodium ion batteries.

Introduction
Lead and heavy metals used in chalcogenide quantum dots are always a constraint for commercialization of their photovoltaic devices. Several bodies, such as the European Union's Directive on the Restriction of Hazardous Substances, are rigorously controlling heavy metals such as Cd, Hg and Pb in consumer products. Also, these materials are classified as a type-I carcinogen by the International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC),3 categorising them as materials having adverse impacts on the environment.6 A plethora of research is going on in the photovoltaic field to replace toxic heavy metal Pb in perovskite and quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs).8,9 The use of less toxic and eco-friendly quantum dots is an alternative and promising way to eliminate this concern. Generally, heavy metal-free QDs occur as binary compounds (InX, X = P, As, or Sb) or ternary compounds (ABX2, A = Ag or Cu, B = Bi, Sb or In, X = S or Se), wherein the bandgap of the latter can be tuned by altering their stoichiometry, among which silver bismuth sulfide nanocrystals (NCs) belong to the family of I–III–VI compounds and have recently been recognised as potential alternatives for hazardous chalcogenides. Heavy metal bismuth, which is termed as a “green heavy metal”,11 is a potential candidate to replace toxic heavy metals such as Pb and Cd in photosensitizers, thus lowering the environmental toxicity. Ternary compounds such as AgBiS2 containing Bi have recently been explored as eco-friendly materials. AgBiS2 was initially utilised as a counter electrode material12 in quantum dot solar cells, because of its excellent electrochemical properties. It was only after 2016 that extensive studies were undertaken to demonstrate the tremendous ability of this material to act as a photoabsorber in photovoltaic (PV) devices. The ideal low bandgap (1–1.32 eV) of AgBiS2 enables light absorption in both the visible and infrared region. Devices using these AgBiS2 NCs exposit a theoretical efficiency up to 26%.13 An experimental power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.1% (ref. 13) has been reported within a short span of time from the start of its research in 2013. The superior electric and absorption qualities, such as wide absorption range, high mobility and high absorption coefficient7,13 (with a narrow bandgap), exhibited by these NCs show the promise of tweaking the photovoltaic performance further, very soon. Also, the high dielectric constant of AgBiS2 (105)8 allows the screening of the coulombic attraction between the photogenerated electrons and holes, enabling enhanced charge separation9 and higher carrier lifetimes. The easy synthesis techniques utilized for these AgBiS2 NCs are another important factor driving AgBiS2 SC devices towards commercialization. These NCs can be easily synthesized via a solution process7 or SILAR (successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction)10 method and the low-cost requirements of the precursors and production make them viable for mass production. Very little research has been reported on these AgBiS2 NCs with regard to photogeneration, conduction, charge kinetics at the interfaces and charge recombination, and this is a major research gap that should be worked upon.

Fig. 1 depicts a steep rise in the number of publications over the last three years in the field of AgBiS2 solar cells (SCs). A detailed assessment of all these reports is necessary to allow the research community to comprehend the advancements and outcomes gained for these solar cells. General aspects of AgBiS2 have been summarised in different reviews with a lack of insight into its material characteristics and photovoltaic performance.9,14,15 This review provides a holistic approach, wherein detailed material characteristics and their effect on device performance are discussed in length. Also, this review provides insights into the enhancement of the material and device stability, towards attaining high performance eco-friendly solar cells, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first review on these AgBiS2 SCs. We believe that a review with the above knowledge will help give us a proper perspective to assess the figures of merit regarding the reliability of AgBiS2 NCs as solar cell absorbers and fill the research gaps in this area of photovoltaics.

Structural and electronic band properties
Of all the desirable parameters, a good photovoltaic absorber should have flexibility in tuning the bandgap, and this appears to be the most important factor that has made AgBiS2 NCs a very attractive candidate for photovoltaic devices. AgBiS2 ternary chalcogenides are found to be in hexagonal and cubic phases with indirect and direct bandgaps of (1.07 eV (ref. 2) and 0.8 eV (ref. 16)), respectively. The most promising and semiconducting hexagonal phase of AgBiS2, known as matildite, is known to exist even at lower temperatures (25–120 °C). Matildite displays a semiconducting nature with a structure in the Pm1 space group4,17,18 (Fig. 2a(i)) and possesses high stability. In contrast, cubic phase AgBiS2 (schapbachite) exhibits metallic behaviour with a face centered cubic structure4,17,18 in the Fmm space group (Fig. 2a(ii)), identical to that of the rock salt metallic structure.4 Schapbachite remains stable at higher temperatures and metastable at room temperature. Also, the cubic phase is reported to be generated even at lower temperatures, if its crystallite size can be engineered to less than 10 nm.19

First principle investigations on the photoactivity of matildite and schapbachite using intensive DFT (density functional theory) based on Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange co-relational studies explored the electronic structure of AgBiS2.4 The cationic and anionic distribution in these materials explained by Glatz in his X-ray and neutron diffraction studies20 exhibits a clear picture of Ag and Bi species being occupied at cation sites and S atoms at anion sites with a face-centered cubic structure (FCC). From Fig. 2a, one can find that the cations are clearly ordered in the schapbachite structure with AgS and BiS square parallel planes perpendicular to the [001] plane, unlike the Ag atoms being arranged along the [111] plane for matildite. Also, the different bond lengths exhibited by d(Ag–S) and d(Bi–S) in matildite (2.73 and 2.89 Å) and schapbachite (2.86 and 2.77 Å) strongly indicate the different nature of these two phases4 leading to different structural and electronic properties. One can see from Fig. 2b that excited electrons relax rapidly at the R, M and AK points leaving no bandgap, thus making schapbachite inadequate for photovoltaic applications. In contrast, matildite possesses a narrow indirect bandgap with the VBM (valence band maximum) near to the K to Γ line and the CBM (conduction band maximum) at point A. Also, DOS (density of state) studies conducted by Mehdaoui on these materials demonstrated the domination of the S-p state near the VBM and Bi-p state near the CBM. The state of Ag has a predominant role in determining the phase and structure as the presence of silver in Bi–S–Bi controls the DOS near EF (Fermi energy).2 Ag atoms in the schapbachite structure trouble the hybridised Bi and S-p bands, which reduces the electronic state from Bi and S-p in the bandgap region and this shifts the electronic state to a lower energy and the material exhibits metallic behaviour. The cationic disorder of these materials influences the physicochemical properties, particularly the bandgap, going from low temperature (hexagonal phase) to high temperature (metallic cubic phase). DFT studies conducted by Viñes et al. revealed a significant decrease in the bandgap of bulk AgBiS2 while thermalizing, on moving from the semiconducting state to the metallic state, attributed to cation-disorder.5 This phenomenon is due to the formation of Urbach tails, which are found in systems having significant impurities and disorders;21 here it is discerned to be because of point defects (low concentration vacancies). The photochemical response of AgBiS2 relies on cationic disorder, and studies have shown that this disorder can be thermally controlled. Fig. 2C shows the reduction in the bandgap of AgBiS2 with cationic disorder. Variation in temperature induces cationic disorder in AgBiS2, which leads to the formation of Urbach tails and triggers other metastable minima to achieve different cationic order. This effectively alters the bandgap and enables tunability in the photoactivity of AgBiS2, making it a favourable photovoltaic candidate. On moving from bulk to nanocrystals, the AgBiS2 nanocrystals exhibit a Ag/Bi ordered structure at room temperature, unlike the disordered structure in bulk AgBiS2. At higher temperatures, the Ag atom tends to shuttle between the vacant and interstitial sites leading to a thermodynamically stable disordered structure. Thus, Ag vacancies play a significant role in the formation of the defect structure in cubic AgBiS2. These vacancies increase near the phase transition at 610 K, which leads them to shuttle between vacancies and interstitial sites (Fig. 2d) to an ordered-disordered phase.10 This ordered-disordered transition enhances the thermodynamic entropy, enabling higher thermal stability in the AgBiS2 nanocrystals. Thus, proper tuning of the crystal and hence electronic structure of these materials alters the bandgap as well as the absorption co-efficient, thus making these nanocrystals good absorbers for SCs. Recently, a homogeneous cation-disordered structure has been attained, with control of the annealing conditions.13 This enables reduced band tailing and favourable optoelectronic properties to achieve the highest absorption coefficient (108) ever reported for a photovoltaic absorber offering a record power conversion efficiency of 9% for SCs of AgBiS2 NCs.13
However, theoretical studies conducted by Mehdaoui and his group on AgBiS2 report that the hexagonal structure (with semiconducting properties) exhibits excellent photovoltaic performance over the bulk cubic structure. The promising open circuit voltage of ∼1 V with a current density of 22 mA cm−2 points towards less non-radiative electron hole recombination losses occurring on these NCs, thus contributing to a theoretical PCE of up to 20% (ref. 2) (Fig. 3a). Even though studies indicate the bulk AgBiS2 in the matildite state to be the favourable candidate for photovoltaic applications2 (because of its semiconducting nature) over the metallic schapbachite, we can see only the schapbachite phase being explored for photovoltaics so far. However, the cubic schapbachite phase entirely exhibits a semiconducting nature when the size of the material reduces to nanocrystal size. More research on understanding the electronic and structural properties of NCs could help boost the performance of these materials.

Effects of size and morphology
Good control over the size and shape of AgBiS2 NCs by different synthesis techniques can yield the required physical and chemical properties. One can see a variety of synthesis techniques reported so far for AgBiS2, such as solvothermal,22 sonochemical,1,23 colloidal,19 SILAR24 and hydrothermal methods,25 among which the colloidal and SILAR methods are considered to be favourable. Reduced crystal size (of the Bohr exciton radius) enables larger surface/volume ratio that can lead to confinement of charge carriers within the particles, thus altering the band gap. Cubic bulk AgBiS2, an inadequate direct bandgap material with metallic behaviour, shows bandgap values of 1–1.32 eV,5,16,19 but when brought down to nanomaterial size it enables discreet energy levels showing semiconducting behaviour and allowing it to act as a good absorber.1 Grain boundaries have an important impact on the charge carrier dynamics and photoconductivity in AgBiS2 NCs. Uniform crystallite sizes reduce the intercrystallite barrier heights at the boundaries and this reduces minority charge carriers being trapped in the barrier regions during the photoexcitation process, or in other words reduces charge accumulation at the intercrystallite boundaries,23 as shown in Fig. 3b.
However, smaller sized NCs pave the way for higher surface to volume ratio, resulting in a greater number of surface trap states and recombination losses resulting in lower quantum efficiency. For example, the synthesis of larger sized NCs by Ceballos et al., using a double step hot injection method, enables the formation of large sized AgBiS2 NCs (6.5 nm compared to 4.3 nm). The reduction in the surface to volume ratio assists in enhancing the carrier diffusion lengths and reducing recombination losses,26 thus contributing to smooth carrier transport and charge collection efficiency. Also, non-coordinating solvents such as 1-octadecene (ODE) have been utilised for extracting larger NCs. Variation in the concentration of the coordinating solvent (oleic acid ligands) and metal precursors was suppressed by the introduction of ODE, which enabled a homogenous reaction between the cations and anions during both nucleation and growth to form NCs with larger sizes.27 Reducing the composition of the cationic precursor (Ag) also resulted in larger sized nanocrystals,28 which favours the Voc (open circuit voltage) and photovoltaic performance due to reduced recombination losses. It is important to maintain a smooth and monodisperse morphology as this reduces the band tail state density. Hu et al., in his study, developed monodispersed smooth and uniform AgBiS2 NCs enabling close packing of the nanocrystals,29 which lead to improved charge transport and reduced current leakage.30,31
Optoelectronic properties such as absorption and photoluminescence emission are strongly dependent on the size, surface and structure of NCs. AgBiS2 NCs exhibit a broad range of optical absorption with an excellent extinction coefficient. Absorption at higher wavelengths is mainly due to the low band gap of AgBiS2 NCs. Studies conducted by Bernechea on AgBiS2 NCs showed excellent photo absorption and photocurrent response in the favourable photovoltaic region of 300–1100 nm,19 with its maximum in the visible region (380–780 nm).2 Fine tuning of absorber layer thickness plays a vital role in the maximum absorption of photons. The optical simulation studies based on refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) show an optimum thickness of 35 nm for the AgBiS2 layer to provide maximum absorption of photons and this is reflected in an improved Jsc (short circuit current).32 One can see a wide variety of strategies utilised for improving light management in photovoltaics, and implementation of a textured structure in AgBiS2 SCs can enable effective light trapping and improve light management and device efficiency.33,34
Device architecture and passivation strategies
A planar depleted-heterojunction (PDHJ) (Fig. 3c) is the most widely used device architecture for AgBiS2 solar cells. Here, the deposition of the photosensitizer layer is accomplished by implementing several deposition cycles of pre-synthesized NCs.26,35 However, care should be taken as these multiple deposition cycles can cause agglomeration in the thick absorber layer, which can lead to surface trapping of generated carriers and also promote recombination.
AgBiS2 NCs for photovoltaic applications are mostly synthesized by easily processable solution processing. High purity yield, low cost processability and controlled synthesis makes solution processing one of the favourable techniques to synthesize these NCs. But as discussed earlier, the higher surface to volume ratio allows unbound orbitals (dangling bonds) leading to the generation of intermediate states between the bandgaps,21,36,37 also known as trap states,38,39 which tend to provide alternate pathways for excited charge carriers to recombine,36 making them unfavourable for photovoltaic applications.40 Choosing appropriate synthesis methods will control the distance between the NCs and prevent aggregation.41 The theoretical studies conducted by Diedenhofen et al. showed electron and hole traps in AgBiS2 NCs (Fig. 3d) as major recombination pathways over the second-order radiative recombinations and auger recombinations.7 These trap states adversely influence the charge carrier dynamics and affect the current and voltage of the device. The generally observed lower Voc found in these AgBiS2 devices mainly arises from these trap assisted recombination losses42 and recombinations from mismatches of the bandgap energy alignment of the interface layers, which will be discussed in the sections ahead.
Surface chemistry plays an important role in understanding and overcoming these defect states generated in NCs. Ligands play a major role in the performance of colloidal NCs as solar cell absorbers as they passivate surface defects and also help in coordinating NCs with the electron transport layer (ETL). The use of passivating ligands shoves the intermediate states deep into the valence or conduction band36,43 and reduces the recombination losses. A wide variety of ligands for AgBiS2 NCs have been studied to reduce these recombination losses. Incorporating solid state ligands by an exchange technique is a widely used method for AgBiS2 SCs because of its ability to provide smooth and compact films in the device. It is a process that involves the replacement of long chain alkyl ligands in colloidal NCs with short ligands. NCs with long chain ligands deposited on the substrate by spin coating are replaced by short chain ligands, and the exchanged ligands are washed away by protic solvents.44 The insulating behaviour of commonly used long alkyl chains of oleic acid and oleylamine remains as a constraint for higher performance in NCs obstructing the interdot charge carrier transport. However, the replacement of oleic acid with short ligands such as ethanedithiol (EDT) did not show any significant change in performance.19 Studies reveal thiol chemistry to be inadequate to passivate AgBiS2 NCs, unlike other chalcogenide QDs (CdTe, CdS, PbS),19 due to the weak inter-particle coupling. The utilization of halide ligands shows effective passivation and reduced surface trap states in NCs.45–48 Small sized halide ligands promote good carrier transport between NCs, while their strong binding with the surface allows for improved passivation. Halide ligands thus reduce the defect density and improve the carrier mobility compared to alkyl ligands.44 The replacement of organic ligands by tetramethylammonium iodide (TMAI) reflected more intrinsic behaviour of AgBiS2 NCs, due to good passivation, thus resulting in fast and efficient exchange of carriers leading to a power conversion efficiency of 6.3%.19 Iodide ligands significantly reduced the film defect density; from soft/hard base/acid theory one can conclude that the soft base iodide can strongly bind with soft acid Ag and Bi atoms on AgBiS2 NCs enabling good interaction between the thiol ligands and NCs. TMAI-exchanged AgBiS2 nanocrystals also exhibit excellent water stability, with a small degree of hydroxylation.49 Apart from high performing TMAI, a wide variety of other ligands have been explored for effective passivation and performance in AgBiS2 SCs and are as listed in Table 1. Aside from these, the distribution pattern of the nanocrystals (ordered and disordered) also plays an important role in charge and energy transfer. The utilization of amine ligands (oleylamine) over oleic acid has proved beneficial in terms of nanocrystal quality, such as morphology control, reduced aggregation and reduced surface traps.29,50 A closely packed nanocrystal arrangement with better size distribution was observed due to oleylamine ligand attachment and this improved the carrier mobility and enhanced the photosensitivity.

Ligand exchange by the solution-phase could reduce the number of exchange steps (unlike solid ligand exchange) and function as an ink, enabling a one-step film fabrication route. Also solution-phase ligand exchange prevents the loss of the ligand that occurs due to the use of protic solvents.51 The use of nano-inks developed for single-step deposition of MPA-ligated QDs is another well-established technique that exhibits good performance.52 Implementation of this technique further reduces the number of steps in film formation and also the time for device fabrication. Solution-phase ligand exchange has allowed a higher degree of ligand exchange in AgBiS2 NCs and reduced the trap density compared to solid-state ligand exchange. This resulted in a sharper band tail and enhanced device Voc.53 Recently, Akgul et al. reported a cost effective synthesis approach without any need for an inert atmosphere or expensive precursors (hexamethyldisilathiane). An in situ single-step ligand exchange was carried out using ethanethiol, a smaller ligand compared to the most widely used TMAI, and this enabled an efficiency of 5.5%.54 Apart from the above, molecular metal chalcogenide complex (MCC) formation is a well-known technique implemented for improving the carrier mobility in NCs.55 MCCs can facilitate better charge transport between individual NCs compared to organic ligands.56 This technique follows a typical inorganic ligand exchange (MCCs) method wherein a solution of organically capped nanocrystals, dispersed in a nonpolar solvent, is allowed to float on an inorganic ligand (e.g. K2S), dispersed in a polar solvent (e.g. formamide).57 These nanocrystals tend to transform into a formamide phase and inorganic ligands (S2−) bind onto the nanocrystals. The counter ion K+ does not bind to the nanocrystals, but forms a diffused ionic layer surrounding the nanocrystals, and this produces a net electrostatic repulsive force between the nanocrystals, effectively preventing agglomeration and promoting colloidal stability.58 Compared to long organic alkyl chains, MCC ligands exhibit a net charge, enabling efficient dispersion in highly polar solvents.59 Thus, the passivation of AgBiS2 NCs and good interaction (one to one) with the ETL layer can significantly tweak the device performance.
The spin coating technique commonly used in AgBiS2 devices, has the problems of rugose (nonuniform, inhomogeneous) deposition and also thin film formation on large sizes of substrate. The possibility of contaminants, such as remains of solvents, humidity and oxygen are high. One appropriate method implemented for avoiding these issues is the utilization of the SILAR technique. SILAR is the in situ growth of AgBiS2 NCs on the ETL (TiO2/ZnO), which can eliminate the requirement of capping by a ligand and its exchange, thus significantly reducing the interface defect states.19,29,42 Huang et al. reported SILAR-developed AgBiS2 NCs for the first time as an absorber in solar cells. The device used ethanol as the solvent for sensitization, which enabled uniform deposition across the photoanode to attain an efficiency of 0.76%.24 Later, Calva-Yáñez et al. improved the PCE to 2.87% (ref. 42) with reduced trap states, opening scope for further research in this area.
Influence of adjacent charge transport layers
The electron transport layer and hole transport layer (HTL) are two important functional layers in SCs, which play a significant role as interface layers for AgBiS2 NCs in photovoltaic devices. As the bandgap of AgBiS2 NCs is comparatively smaller, compared to CdS, CdSe and CuInZnS, the probability of the recombination of excited electrons with the holes in the VB of the photo absorber and the electrolyte (HTL) is higher. The ETL is responsible for the efficient extraction of these photogenerated electrons from the conduction band (CB) of the AgBiS2 NCs. An efficient ETL can prevent major damage of intrinsic charge recombination taking place within the AgBiS2 NCs.64 Also, the effective transport of excited electrons to the transparent conductive materials reduces recombination losses taking place between the ETL and oxidised species in the absorber and electrolyte. It should be noted that there should be a favourable alignment of the energy levels of these charge transport layers with that of NCs for efficient charge carrier dynamics, as shown Fig. 4a. The interfacial parameters, like series, shunt and recombination resistance, of a device are decided by these functional layers. Inefficiency or imbalance in the collection of charge by the interfaces results in hysteresis.19

(b) A schematic representation of the bandgap alignment of various hole transporting materials utilised in AgBiS2 SC devices. 
ZnO is the most favourable ETL used so far for AgBiS2 SCs due to the correct match of the energy levels, and also because of its low temperature processibility and better transport properties compared to other ETLs. Conventional ETLs, like TiO2, have also been explored with these NCs but were not as promising as ZnO due to the large gap in the CB energy levels of TiO2 and AgBiS2 NCs. Nanowires of ZnO have also been incorporated into AgBiS2 devices for enhanced carrier collection and diffusion lengths, providing higher EQE (82%) values over the EQE (41%) observed for control ZnO/AgBiS2 NCs.62 Oxygen vacancies in ZnO nanowires play an important role in determining the structural order of these materials and it has been found that a lower concentration of vacancies enables weaker electron–phonon interaction and can enhance the carrier collection from AgBiS2 SCs.65 Even though ZnO is a stable material, the spin coating method of ZnO deposition, if carried out in open air, allows accumulation of physiosorbed water, thus instigating AgBiS2 NCs to decompose into silver sulfide and bismuth oxide. Oxygen and light can further accelerate the degradation rate.66–69
HTLs should have good hole mobility, compatible energy levels (valence band maximum), thermal/photochemical stability and low cost. These components continuously regenerate charge carriers and influence the inner charge transfer between the cathode and anode.70 The important parameter, Voc, of the device is highly influenced by the redox potential of the hole transport layer, whereas the Jsc and FF (fill factor) are dependent on the charge transport resistance and diffusion capability of the HTL at the AgBiS2/HTL interface. Traditional liquid electrolyte (polysulfide) was used initially in the developmental stages of AgBiS2 SCs,60 but later, due to the lower stability of the electrolyte and hence poor performance of the device, it was replaced by solid state electrolytes. Polymeric HTLs such as P3HT, PTAA, etc., are favourites due to their excellent film forming properties and stability. One can see a list of HTLs and their performance reported for AgBiS2 SCs in Table 1. We can observe that the highest Voc achieved for these devices is 0.53 V, and the low Voc is mainly due to improper band alignment as shown in Fig. 4b. AgBiS2 exhibits a valence band edge (−5.2 eV) with an excessively narrow bandgap (1.4 eV), fostering recombination due to the unfavourable carrier dynamics across the AgBiS2/HTL interface. This reduces the Voc and performance of these NCs. Only P3HT has an appropriate band energy alignment, and this assists smooth and efficient hole extraction from the VB of AgBiS2 NCs. Organic HTLs like PTB7 have a major impact on the instability of AgBiS2 NC devices due to the breakdown of the organic extraction layers.71 These organic HTLs tend to degrade quickly, with a direct impact on the device stability and photodynamics. Our analysis on all devices with organic HTLs indicates that they tend to stimulate the degradation and relatively quicken the degradation time in these devices, containing organic HTLs. However, recent studies show that a poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) polymer doped with C60F48 has good potential (favourable band energy too) as a HTL due to its lower electron affinity that blocks the back transfer of electrons.72 More detailed studies on the photochemical stability and recombination dynamics at the HTL/AgBiS2 interface can help us to assess these HTLs better. Also, these HTLs are quite expensive, which makes these devices incompatible for commercialization. Inorganic HTLs show excellent hole transporting ability, with good defect passivation.73 Recently, NiOx (ref. 32) has been utilised as a hole transport layer for AgBiS2 SCs, with the n-i-p device architecture, and it exhibited remarkable stability with a PCE close to 88% of the initial efficiency after 104 days.32 The utilization of cheap and stable inorganic hole transport layers (CuO,74 LSM,75 YSZ76) with matching band potentials can hence be explored in these AgBiS2 SCs for better efficiencies and stability. Fig. 5 shows the different strategies that can be applied on AgBiS2 SCs to further improve the efficiency and stability.

Conclusions and perspectives
This review presents the figures of merit for AgBiS2 absorbers to assess their reliability for use in quantum dot solar cells. The analysis was based on theoretical and experimental findings concerning the optical absorption, band structures, charge carrier mobility, and stability of these materials. There are two different phases of AgBiS2 that have been reported as potential candidates. These absorbers have revealed promising optoelectronic properties, as portrayed by their visible to near IR absorption. Despite a good theoretical efficiency rating, experimental research has a long way to go. We find that the cubic schapbachite phase is, to date, the more extensively studied material, although matildite is semiconducting and has been theoretically proven to be promising. The fundamental drawbacks of the schapbachite phase are the presence of cationic disorder, a high density of electron traps, and the large indirect band gap. Effective capping through ligand exchange can reduce these traps and improve the performance of these devices. The SILAR method appears to be the most robust and promising approach for the fabrication of AgBiS2 SCs, as it offers reduced surface trap states, unlike colloidal synthesis, and there is an absence of problems related to ligands and their exchange, and the formation of rugose and inhomogeneous films, unlike in spin-coating. The p-i-n architecture exhibits more stability and better performance over conventional n-i-p architectures and comparatively cheaper devices, as it uses inorganic and inexpensive NiOx rather than organic HTLs. In addition to the above device engineering approaches, the intrinsic properties of other charge transport layers in the device, namely the ETL's (ZnO and TiO2) unfavourable energy level alignment (with AgBiS2), need thorough design and optimization, and this can significantly contribute to good SC performance. Eco-friendly AgBiS2 NCs can hence be referred to as promising solar cell absorbers, mainly as alternatives to lead-based and toxic photosensitizers.
