    , Accepted 12th August 2014First published on 14th August 2014AbstractZnO films deposited by atomic layer deposition at 70 °C were used to fabricate perovskite solar cells, and a conversion efficiency of 13.1% was obtained. On the ZnO layer, CH3NH3PbI3 was formed at room temperature using CH3NH3I and PbCl2 precursors, which is in contrast to the reported results.
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites based on organolead halides have attracted a great deal of attention in the field of solar cells. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.7% has been obtained using perovskite as a light absorber.1 This dramatic improvement in efficiency has occurred over a mere five years, and some reports suggest that solar cells with efficiencies of 20% could be achieved.2 Commonly, for perovskite solar cells, the underlying TiO2 compact layer requires high-temperature sintering at 450–500 °C,1,3 which limits its compatibility with plastic substrates. Therefore, low-temperature processing is the most important aspect of solar cell research and could allow for commercialization by reel-to-reel processing and the development of new multi-junction device architectures. ZnO is a viable alternative to TiO2 for perovskite solar cells with high PCE because it has energy levels comparable to those of TiO2 as well as having good electron transport properties.4 Additionally, the ZnO layer can be deposited easily and requires no high-temperature sintering step. Solar cells based on a ZnO nanoparticle layer have already achieved high performance.5
Although the nanocrystalline ZnO electron collection layer, forming an intimate junction of a large interfacial area with the CH3NH3PbI3 film, is much more effective in extracting electrons from the perovskite than a planar ZnO film, the ZnO film fabricated by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) method has many merits, such as large-scale, low-temperature fabrication and high repeatability.6 In this study, compact ZnO layers were deposited by the ALD method at 70 °C. These ZnO layers were then used to fabricate perovskite solar cells by a single step method.
High purity diethylzinc and H2O were used as the Zn and O precursors to deposit 30 nm thick compact ZnO layers onto FTO glass. A 350 nm thick mesoporous Al2O3 layer composed of 30 nm sized particles was then deposited by spin-coating. After that, in a N2-purged glove box, the precursor solution containing CH3NH3I and PbI2 was spin-coated onto the mesoporous Al2O3 layer at room temperature, followed by heating at 100 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, the spiro-OMeTAD-based hole-transfer layer was deposited. Finally, a 120 nm thick silver layer was thermally evaporated onto the hole-transfer layer, forming the back contact of the device.

Fig. 1(a) shows the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of a compact ZnO layer fabricated on a FTO substrate using the ALD method. The resultant thin ZnO layer replicates remarkably well the underlying FTO relief morphology. It is apparent in the SEM images that the surface lacks any visible pinholes. The compact ZnO layer acts as a hole-blocking layer that avoids intimate contact between the FTO and perovskite. As the ALD-ZnO layer is more compact than that of solution-based ZnO layers, it will efficiently suppress charge recombination inside the cells. The J–V curve of the best-performing device is shown in Fig. 1(b). Values of 20.4 mA cm−2, 976 mV and 0.66 were obtained for the short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF), respectively, yielding a PCE of 13.1% under standard AM1.5 illumination. This demonstrates that the ALD method can be used to prepare compact ZnO layers at low-temperature and, allowing for large-scale fabrication, has broad prospects in the domain of perovskite solar cells with the potential to meet commercial demand.

In addition, a precursor solution containing CH3NH3I and PbCl2 was used to prepare perovskite films by a single-step method. It was found, on the ALD-compact ZnO film, that CH3NH3PbI3 was completely formed at room temperature in just a few minutes, which is in contrast to the reported results.7 For comparison, two other compact layers, TiO2 layers deposited by the ALD method and ZnO layers deposited by the sol–gel method on a FTO/glass substrate, were also used to deposit perovskite films. Moreover, glass and FTO/glass were also used.

Fig. 2 shows the appearance of the perovskite film deposited by spin-coating onto different substrates after various standing times (0–60 min) at room temperature. All the thickness of the TiO2 and ZnO layers are about 30 nm. It is observed that on glass, FTO/glass, TiO2/FTO/glass, the colour of the spin-coated film always remains yellow corresponding to the colour of PbI2. This indicates that, in this case, the perovskite was not formed. However, it is amazing to notice that the colour of the perovskite film formed on the compact ZnO layer deposited by ALD changed in a few minutes. The metachromatism of the perovskite film indicates the formation of the perovskite according to regular observations of the colour change of the perovskite film with heating, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the film provides evidence for the complete formation of CH3NH3PbI3 without the appearance of PbI2 as shown in Fig. 3(a). The SEM image (Fig. 3b) also presents the typical perovskite structure with a crystalline particle size of approximately 1 μm, similar to that of previous work.8Fig. 2 indicates that the formation of the perovskite film on ALD-ZnO is not only different from that on the TiO2 compact layer, but also different from that on the ZnO layer in the solution-method.

However, all previously reported perovskite formation methods using either a single step or sequential deposition required heating to form the perovskite,7,9 and it has been confirmed that using a precursor containing PbCl2 and CH3NH3I will slow down the rate of the reaction, which will improve the uniformity, controllability and crystallinity of perovskite films, compared to those prepared with precursors free from chloride ions.7
The formation of a perovskite film on ALD-compact ZnO layers deposited at 70 °C after standing for a few minutes at room temperature is probably due to the reaction of CH3NH3Cl and ZnO. At room temperatures, the conversion to the perovskite dominates following reaction (1), and the rate is very slow, however if CH3NH3Cl is depleted, reaction (1) will be promoted.8 According to the metachromatism of the perovskite film on ALD-ZnO, so it was speculated that ZnO will react with CH3NH3Cl, as shown in reaction (2). The energy dispersive spectra (EDS) measurements as shown in Fig. 5 confirmed a large number of chloride ions, which suggest the existence of ZnCl2. To avoid the residual chloridion in the formed perovskite, before the EDS measurement, the samples were heated at 200 °C for 3 h in order to completely decompose the perovskite. But reaction (2) did not happen in the case of the ZnO film prepared by the solution-method. The difference between ALD-ZnO and solution-ZnO is that there are a large number of oxygen vacancies in ALD-ZnO.10 We thought the oxygen vacancies in ALD-ZnO enhance its reaction activity, which is commonly accepted in the photocatalytic field.10 In this study, the oxygen vacancies promote the reaction of ZnO and CH3NH3Cl. Nevertheless, ZnO did not react with CH3NH3I because of the different electronegativity of chlorine and iodine. Of the products of reaction (2), CH3NH2 is in the gas phase and H2O can be absorbed by ZnCl2 because ZnCl2 is extremely deliquescent in air (reaction (3)). The appearance of H2O will therefore not lead to the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3. For ALD-ZnO, due to the existence of reactions (1) and (2) will continue unless CH3NH3PbI3 is totally formed. 3CH3NH3I + PbCl2 → CH3NH3PbI3 + 2CH3NH3Cl(1) 2CH3NH3Cl + ZnO → 2CH3NH2 + ZnCl2 + H2O(2) ZnCl2 + H2O → H[ZnCl2(OH)](3)
To further investigate the formation mechanism of perovskite on ALD-ZnO films, the sintering of ALD-ZnO films at different temperatures was carried out. Photos comparing perovskite films on 70 °C-ALD-compact ZnO films sintered at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 4. The subsequent perovskite film formation process became slower when the sintering temperature increased from 70 to 450 °C and the compact ZnO film sintered at 350 and 450 °C for 30 min could not drive perovskite formation at room temperature. This increase in sintering temperature improved the crystallinity of ZnO films and decreases the content of oxygen vacancy, the change in perovskite formation indicates that ZnO sintered at high temperature does not react with CH3NH3Cl at room temperature. Subsequently, it was observed that perovskite can be formed at temperatures of 70 and 80 °C for ALD-compact ZnO layers sintered at 350 and 450 °C, respectively. In the standard case, where the precursor containing chloridion is spin-coated onto a compact TiO2 layer, annealing at 100 °C for 45 min is required to lead to the formation of the lead-iodide based perovskite material.11 The EDS (Fig. 5) of the layers also confirmed that a large number of chloride ions reside at the interface between ALD-ZnO sintered at 450 °C and PbI2, where, no chloride ions were observed in the sample based on an ALD-TiO2 film. It is demonstrated that the ALD-ZnO sintered at high-temperature can react with CH3NH3Cl at a higher temperature than as-deposited ALD-ZnO, and at a lower temperature than TiO2.

To study the impact of the metachromatism of the perovskite on the performance of ALD-compact ZnO layers in perovskite solar cells, we fabricated a group of perovskite solar cells with the traditional FTO/ZnO/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag structure under identical conditions, but with different compact ZnO films, either ALD-ZnO or ALD-ZnO sintered at 450 °C, using a precursor solution containing PbCl2 and CH3NH3I. The J–V curves of the devices with different ZnO films are shown in Fig. 6b, and their corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. Devices fabricated with the 70 °C-ALD-ZnO layer yielded low performances with a low Jsc, Voc, and FF. In contrast, the performance was improved, yielding a Jsc of 11.2 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 877 mV, together with a FF of 0.59, by using a ZnO layer sintered at 450 °C, resulting in a high PCE of 5.96%. In Table 1, the shunt resistance, Rsh, and series resistance, Rs, values of the corresponding devices are also listed. Rsh is closely related to the interfacial charge recombination inside the device. The ALD-ZnO solar cell sintered at 450 °C exhibited far higher Rsh than the ALD-ZnO solar cell obtained without sintering, indicating efficient suppression of charge recombination inside the cell, which leads to its higher Voc after sintering. It is suggested that the degree of corrosion of the ZnO sintered at 450 °C is lower than that of the ALD-ZnO layer obtained without sintering. The Rs of the devices prepared using ALD-ZnO is large, due to the redundant ZnCl2 at the interface between the ZnO layer and the perovskite and results in a lower Jsc. The Rs of the device based on the ALD-ZnO layer is higher than that on ALD-ZnO sintered at 450 °C, this is in accordance with the EDS and Rsh values and the observation that the reaction of the ZnO sintered at 450 °C is lower. Because of the identical absorption spectra of perovskite films on different compact layers (Fig. 6a), the Jsc of the device based on ALD-ZnO sintered at 450 °C was also larger. The higher Rsh and lower Rs enabled a larger FF. This experiment clearly indicates that the ALD-ZnO at 70 °C was more conducive to the formation of the perovskite by reaction (2) at room temperature, and when it was sintered at 450 °C, the formation was driven by the combined actions of reactions (2), (4) and (5). Reaction (4) is the reaction of CH3NH3I and PbCl2 at higher temperature. CH3NH3I and PbI2 can form the perovskite at 70 °C or 80 °C by a single step method. 3CH3NH3I + PbCl2 → PbI2 + CH3NH3I + 2CH3NH3Cl(4) PbI2 + CH3NH3I → CH3NH3PbI3(5)
To conclude, we replaced the conventionally used compact TiO2 layer with an ALD-ZnO film deposited at low temperature, and have successfully fabricated an ALD-ZnO-based perovskite solar cell with a high PCE of 13.1% by a single step with a precursor containing PbI2 and CH3NH3I. The devices based on the ZnO compact film using the ALD method has equal photoelectrical conversion efficiency to those based on the TiO2 compact layer, but the process temperature is lower. It is an irresistible trend of the ALD method that can meet the requirements necessary for commercialization with large-fabrication compared with solution methods, it is very important for the perovskite solar cell in practical application. In addition, we found that the ALD-compact ZnO layer can promote the single step formation of CH3NH3PbI3 with a precursor containing chloridion at room temperature; this is mainly attributed to the reaction of CH3NH3Cl and the ALD-ZnO film. Although perovskite formation by the single step chloridion method on the ALD-ZnO film at room temperature had a negative impact on the performance of the resulting perovskite solar cells, the compact ALD-ZnO layer is also an ideal substitution to the TiO2 film in perovskite solar cells using the no-chloridion precursor.
