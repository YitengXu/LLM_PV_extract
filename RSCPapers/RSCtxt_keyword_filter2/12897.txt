    , Accepted 27th July 2012First published on 17th August 2012AbstractThe article reports on the properties of a new class of arylene–ethynylene semiconductors incorporating anthracene and the bridged bithiophene dithienopyrrole. Two monodispersed structures were synthesised: the first with a dithienopyrrole core bound to two anthracenyl–ethynyl side groups namely the 2,6-bis(anthracen-9-ylethynyl)-4-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (ADA); in the second structure the anthracene core was functionalised with two dithienopyrrolylethynyl groups, obtaining 9,10-bis((4-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrol-2-yl)ethynyl)anthracene (DAD). The properties of these materials were compared with those of the corresponding polymer: poly[4-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole-2,6-diylethynylene-anthracen-9,10-diylethynylene] (polyAD). Devices employing PC61BM as an electron acceptor revealed that the monodispersed materials (ADA and DAD) were better performing than polyAD, seemingly due to the better homogeneity of the donor–acceptor blend, as revealed by AFM. The PCE value (1.3%) obtained with DAD ranks among the highest reported for non-polymeric small molecule-based BHJ solar cells constructed without the use of additives or annealing processes, thus demonstrating that ethynylene-containing electron-rich systems are promising donors for organic solar cell applications.
Introduction
Over the past few years, the branch of organic electronics devoted to the study of solar cells has seen an undeniably remarkable boost, which is being sustained by the need to fulfil critical niches of the energy market, in particular those requiring printable, mechanically conformable, lightweight and low-cost devices.1 The basic research put into this area has produced seminal contributions, devoted to the organic synthesis of novel light-harvesting organic semiconductors2 as well as to device architectures such as the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells,3 in which the presence of a suitably formed interpenetrating network between the electron donor material and the electron acceptor bypasses the limits posed by the exciton diffusion length.4 While much progress has been made, the potentially boundless synthetic tailoring of the properties of an organic semiconductor leads to the reasonable prediction that the necessary efficiency and processability improvements for commercialization of BHJ solar cells are possible.
Conjugated polymers have been widely employed as light-harvesting donor materials in BHJ solar cells5 and, among them, poly(arylene–ethynylene)s6 have been recognized as attractive because of their tunable molecular orbital energetics and of their low dependence from steric and conformational constraints, deriving from the quasi-cylindrical electronic symmetry of the triple bonds.7 The availability of efficient synthetic protocols for the incorporation of a triple bond into a conjugated framework8 can also facilitate the achievement of small-molecule donor materials, which, furthermore, exhibit the widely known advantages that monodispersed materials offer with respect to their polymeric counterparts in terms of purification, batch-to-batch property reproducibility and self-assembling properties.9 It is known that the preparation of monodispersed materials has mainly aimed at the obtainment of model systems for the corresponding polymers,10 however, there are no examples of monodispersed materials showing higher device performances than those of the corresponding polymers.
Considering the synthesis of light-harvesting materials, it is a common choice to adopt a donor–acceptor (D–A) architecture, in order to lower their band gap (thus increasing the portion of absorbed sunlight) exploiting the occurrence of an intramolecular charge transfer from the electron-rich to the electron-poor moiety.11 The presence of electron-poor units, however, could impair the hole transport within the active layer of the BHJ solar cell stressing the need for an evolution of the D–A concept.
Dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) has recently been indicated as an alternative donor unit for the synthesis of low energy gap conjugated systems.12 Its intriguing properties derive from the presence of a bridging nitrogen atom that contributes to the improvement of the hole-transport properties of the corresponding materials, due to the planarity of DTP units.13 Moreover, the alkyl substituents of DTP moieties can be tuned to improve the materials solubility and intermolecular packing without introducing significant torsions between adjacent aromatic units.14
Although the most investigated acceptor units are heteroaromatic systems such as [2,1,3]-benzothiadiazole,15 some examples have recently demonstrated the potential of ethynylene spacers in combination with a rigid and electron-rich central core, such as anthracene,16 in favoring the planarization of the corresponding molecules with consequent low absorption band-gap, π–π stacking and high carrier mobility.
On this ground, we designed mono- and polydispersed materials assembling anthracene and 2-ethylhexyl functionalized DTP units spaced by ethynylene moieties and used these materials in blend with fullerene derivatives as photoactive layers in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell devices. The highest power conversion efficiencies were obtained with the monodispersed materials, hinting that appropriate intermolecular interactions between small planar conjugated molecules can also lead to the formation of a suitable heterojunction with the fullerene electron acceptor.
Experimental section

General remarks: reactants were purchased from commercial sources and used without any further purification; 9-ethynylanthracene (5),17 9,10-diethynylanthracene (6)18 and Pd(PPh3)4 (ref. 19) were synthesized according to literature procedures. All manipulations were carried out under an inert nitrogen atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques. All solvents used were carefully dried and freshly distilled according to standard laboratory practice. Flash chromatography was performed using a silica gel of 230–400 mesh. 1H-NMR and 13C{1H}-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 400 MHz. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) downfield from tetramethylsilane (δ scale). The purity of all compounds was judged to be >95% as determined by a combination of 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR analyses. The high resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR ESI-MS) analyses were performed using a Bruker microTOF QII mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ion source operated in positive ion mode. The sample solutions (CH2Cl2–CH3OH) were introduced by continuous infusion at a flow rate of 180 μL min−1 with the aid of a syringe pump. The instrument was operated with end-plate offset and capillary voltages set to −500 V and −4500 V, respectively. The nebulizer pressure was 0.8 bar (N2), and the drying gas (N2) flow rate was 7.0 L min−1. The capillary exit and skimmer 1 voltages were 90 V and 30 V, respectively. The drying gas temperature was set at 180 °C. The calibration was carried out with sodium formate. FT-IR measurements were recorded on a JASCO FT/IR 4200 instrument. UV-Vis spectra were recorded on a Jasco V-670 instrument and fluorescence spectra were obtained on a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analyses were carried out on an Agilent Series 1100 instrument equipped with a Pl-gel 5 μm mixed-C column. THF solutions for GPC analysis were eluted at 25 °C at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 and analyzed using a multiple wave UV-Vis detector. Number-average molecular weights (Mn), weight-average molecular weights (Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI) are relative to polystyrene standards. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere (flow of 40 mL min−1) with a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 6 TGA in the range from 30 to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out on a Metrohm Autolab PGSTAT 302-N potentiostat. The materials were drop cast on a platinum working electrode from a 1 mg mL−1 solution. Measurements were carried out at 25 °C in acetonitrile solution containing tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (0.025 M) as a supporting electrolyte with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The potentials were measured versus Ag/Ag+ as the quasi-reference electrode. After each experiment, the potential of the Ag/Ag+ electrode was calibrated against the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple. The electrochemical HOMO–LUMO energy gap was determined as the difference between the onsets of the oxidation and the reduction potentials (Egelc = Eoxonset − Eredonset). The HOMO and LUMO energy values were estimated from the onset potentials of the first oxidation and reduction events, respectively. After calibration of the measurements against Fc/Fc+, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated according to the following equations:EHOMO (eV) = −[Eoxonset − E1/2(Fc/Fc+) + 4.8]ELUMO (eV) = −[Eredonset − E1/2(Fc/Fc+) + 4.8]where E1/2(Fc/Fc+) is the half-wave potential of the Fc/Fc+ couple (the oxidation potential of which is assumed to be +4.8 eV below the vacuum level) against the Ag/Ag+ electrode. Analyses of the ground-state structures for the molecules were carried out using density functional theory (DFT). The B3LYP function20 was used in conjunction with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set. Time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations were performed to assess the excited-state transition energies. All calculations were carried out with the Gaussian 09 program package and performed on the isolated molecule in vacuo. The compounds were tested in BHJ solar cells with structure ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS)/compound:PC61BM/LiF/Al. The photovoltaic devices were fabricated on patterned ITO-coated glass substrates as the anode. ITO glass substrates were sequentially cleaned by ultrasonication in deionized water, acetone, isopropyl alcohol and eventually cleaned for 10 min in a TL-1 solution at 85 °C. The ITO surface was then modified by spin-coating a conductive PEDOT-PSS thin film (40 nm) purchased by HC Starck, followed by baking at 140 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere for 15 min. Subsequently, the active layer blend (∼100 nm) was deposited by spin coating a solution of the relevant compound and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM, Nano-C) in o-dichlorobenzene at 700 rpm for 240 s. All the operations concerning the deposition of the active layer were performed in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere. The LiF (0.6 nm) and Al (150 nm) electrodes were thermally evaporated at a low pressure (<7 × 10−6 Torr) through a shadow mask. The active area of the device has been accurately determined by an optical microscope, using a 4× magnification objective equipped with a ruler. The active area of ca. 0.03 cm2 was obtained. The device testing was carried out under ambient conditions under illumination of one-sun (AM 1.5G). The atomic force microscopy (AFM) topography images were acquired using a XE-100 PSIA Park Scanning Probe Microscope in non-contact mode.

After cooling down the mixture to room temperature, water (50 mL) was added and the organic layer was separated. The aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane and the combined organic phase was dried over Na2SO4.

A solution of N-bromo-succinimide (NBS, 1.07 g, 6.00 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide DMF (5 mL) was added dropwise to a mixture of 2 (0.87 g, 3.00 mmol) in CHCl3 (30 mL) at 0 °C. After the addition, the obtained mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight. The reaction was quenched with water (30 mL) and the organic layer was separated.

A 1.6 M solution of n-BuLi (0.50 mmol, 0.3 mL) was added dropwise to a solution of 2 (140 mg, 0.50 mmol) in THF (5 mL) at −80 °C and the obtained solution was stirred for an hour at this temperature before the addition of I2 (191 mg, 0.75 mmol). The reaction system was allowed to reach the room temperature and monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) in order to ascertain the complete conversion of the substrate and the selectivity of the reaction. The reaction was quenched with water (30 mL) and the organic layer was separated. The aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane and the combined organic phase was dried over Na2SO4. After evaporation of the solvent, the iodo-derivative 4 (163 mg, 78%) was obtained as a colourless oil and rapidly used without any further purification and characterisation, due to its high instability.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic approach followed for the preparation of ADA, DAD and polyAD is shown in Scheme 1. The sequence started from 3,3′-dibromo-2,2′-bithiophene (1) prepared from 3-bromothiophene by lithiation with LDA and subsequent CuCl2-mediated coupling. The dithienopyrrole derivative 2 was obtained by a Pd-catalysed Buchwald reaction in the presence of 2-ethyl-hexylamine carried out on 1. In the subsequent step, dihalogenation or monohalogenation of 2 was performed in order to use the dithienopyrrole as a core or side group respectively. Bromination of 2 with two equivalents of NBS smoothly afforded the dibromo-derivative 3; on the other hand, attempts to obtain the mono-brominated compound under the same conditions using one equivalent of NBS gave unsatisfactory results in terms of isolated yield. Conversely, the iodo-derivative 4 was selectively obtained by lithiation of 2 with n-BuLi and subsequent reaction with molecular iodine. Unfortunately, 4 was revealed to be very unstable and had to be promptly used in the subsequent step without further characterization. The preparation of DAD was achieved by the Pd/Cu-catalysed Sonogashira coupling between 9,10-diethynylanthracene (6) and two equivalents of 4 in 58% yield. A higher yield (87%) was obtained for the synthesis of the target molecule ADA, accomplished by a Sonogashira coupling between two equivalents of 9-ethynylanthracene (5) and 3. The better yield can be ascribed to the higher stability of the dibromoaryl building block 3 with respect to the monoiodoaryl 4.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic sequence for the obtainment of ADA, DAD and polyAD. 
In order to properly compare the synthesised monodispersed materials (ADA and DAD) with the corresponding polydispersed structure, the synthesis of the alternating poly(arylene–ethynylene) comprising anthracene and dithienopyrrole (polyAD) was performed by a Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction between 3 and 6. The polymer was obtained in 48% yield. GPC analysis revealed that polyAD was endowed with relatively low (Mw = 12000 Da, PDI = 2.1) molecular weights. This aspect of the polymer can be explained by its low solubility, which led to the precipitation of the material during the polymerization in the reaction medium, hampering any further growth of the polymeric chain.
The structures of ADA and DAD were confirmed by 1H and 13C-NMR as well as by high resolution ESI-MS spectrometry (see the Experimental part). FT-IR analyses revealed the presence of the band attributable to the –CC– stretching mode that was found at 2166 and 2177 cm−1 for DAD and ADA respectively. The structure of polyAD was confirmed by 1H-NMR. Moreover, FT-IR showed the –CC– stretching band at 2166 cm−1. Comparison of the IR data reveals how the alkyne moieties in ADA show a greater triple-bond character with respect to those of DAD and polyAD. These findings can be ascribed to the higher delocalization of the electron density along the latter two molecules.
The thermal stability of the synthesized materials was evaluated by TGA analyses that revealed decomposition temperatures (corresponding to the 5% weight loss temperatures of the thermogravimetric plots) of 364, 381 and 410 °C for ADA, polyAD and DAD, respectively, indicating a satisfactory thermal stability, adequate for withstanding the thermal stress that the organic materials undergo during either fabrication processes or the operation regime of BHJ solar cells.
Optical characterization
The optical characterization of ADA, DAD and polyAD was carried out both in CHCl3 solution and in the solid state, as thin films on quartz (Fig. 1). In solution, the absorption spectra of DAD consist of two bands: a higher energy band with a maximum located at 348 nm and a lower energy band characterized by two maxima at 512 and 538 nm. The absorption profile of DAD observed in the solid state is very similar and slightly red-shifted with respect to the one observed in solution, with maxima falling at 361, 531 and 566 nm.
 Fig. 1  UV-Vis spectra of polyAD, ADA and DAD recorded in CHCl3 and in the solid state. 
In the case of ADA, the absorption spectrum in solution showed a lower energy absorption at 478 nm and a higher energy transition sparingly visible at 369 nm (Fig. 1). Also for this molecular structure, the solid-state spectrum is red shifted, showing an absorption maximum at 498 nm.
In solution, the evaluation of the optical energy gaps (Egopt) was carried out by measuring the onset of the absorption spectrum (λonset) which was 2.32 eV for ADA and 2.17 eV for DAD. In the solid state, the Egopt of the two monodispersed molecules are lowered to 2.16 eV (ADA) and to 2.01 eV (DAD) owing to the intermolecular interactions that probably favor a more planar conformation of the π-conjugated backbone.
Compared to ADA and DAD, the UV-Vis spectra of polyAD both in chloroform and as a thin film showed a consistent broadening of the absorption profiles as well as a red shift of the absorption maxima. As evidenced in Fig. 1, the absorption maxima of polyAD are located at 547 and 575 nm in CHCl3 solution and in the solid state, respectively. On the other hand, the λonset of its UV-Vis spectrum recorded in CHCl3 solution and in the solid state (638 and 702 nm respectively) is remarkably shifted to longer wavelengths with respect to those observed for the corresponding monodispersed materials. Consequently, the portion of the solar spectrum that can be absorbed by polyAD is remarkably higher with respect to that absorbed by the monodispersed molecules ADA and DAD.
The synthesized materials exhibited a fluorescence in chloroform solution with emission maxima ranging between 534 nm and 612 nm (Fig. 2), while no emission behavior could be recorded in the solid state, probably due to the occurrence of strong intermolecular interactions activating non-radiative pathways of the excited states.
 Fig. 2  Fluorescence spectra of polyAD, ADA and DAD recorded in CHCl3 and in toluene. 
In order to investigate the presence of an intramolecular charge transfer, despite the absence of a clear donor–acceptor architecture, their absorption and emission spectra were recorded in toluene, a solvent with a lower dielectric constant (ε = 2.38) with respect to chloroform (ε = 4.81). An intramolecular charge transfer state can in fact be stabilized by the solvent polarity,21 due to favorable dipole–dipole interactions between the π-conjugated segment and the solvent molecules, lowering the energy of the excited states. While the absorption profiles of the synthesized materials were not influenced by the polarity of the solvent, in the PL spectra a blue shift of the low energy emission maxima was observed for all materials (Fig. 2) indicating the formation of polarized excitons, although this blue shift is less evident in the case of ADA. Differently from what is observed at the ground state, an intramolecular charge transfer at the excited state could be favored by a localization of the electron density on a peculiar part of the molecule. This aspect was therefore investigated by theoretical calculations.
Theoretical calculations
In order to draw the appropriate structure–property relationships, we deemed it worthwhile to gain some insight into the electronic properties of the synthesized materials and, for this purpose, the structures of ADA and DAD were investigated by DFT and TDDFT calculations. Moreover, the electronic structure of polyAD was investigated by carrying out calculations on an appropriate molecular model of the alternating polymer backbone with two repeating units (n = 2). DFT and TDDFT calculations at the ground state were carried out on isolated molecules at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of the theory. Concerning the optimized geometry of the molecules, it was found that the torsion angle between the DTP and anthracene planes is low and comprised between 0.26° and 2.77°, indicating the near-planarity of the systems under investigation, due to the presence of the ethynylene spacers between the aryl moieties. The planarity of the conjugated skeleton could lead to a significant tendency towards intermolecular interactions in the solid state, further increased by the absence of very long alkyl chains in the synthesized molecules.
The calculated electron density distributions of the HOMO and LUMO levels along with the optimized geometry obtained for ADA, DAD and polyAD are shown in Fig. 3. Their HOMOs are evenly distributed along the entire chain, suggesting a good hole transport ability (at least along the conjugated backbone) after the electron transfer to the fullerene acceptor in a BHJ solar cell. In contrast, except for ADA that shows an extensively delocalized LUMO, the LUMOs of the other two systems are mainly described by the anthracene units, suggesting that the HOMO → LUMO transition of the materials might have a partial charge transfer character.
Concerning the energy values of the frontier orbitals (Fig. 3) the HOMO energy values of the optimized configurations of DAD (−4.47 eV) and polyAD (−4.45 eV) are very similar, while a slightly higher LUMO is calculated for DAD (−2.26 eV with respect to −2.39 eV). As a consequence, the calculated energy gap of DAD (2.21 eV) is slightly higher than that of polyAD (2.06 eV). Concerning ADA, the calculated HOMO and LUMO energy values lead to a gap of 2.37 eV, slightly higher with respect to that of DAD, substantially as a result of a lower energy of the HOMO frontier orbital (−4.62 eV).
 Fig. 3  HOMO (left) and LUMO (right) frontier orbitals of DAD, ADA, and polyAD at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of the theory. 
A deeper understanding of the optical behavior of the three materials was provided by the calculation of the vertical S0 → Sn excitation energies at the TDDFT level of theory. For this purpose it is crucial to bear in mind that the choice of an appropriate functional is mandatory in order to properly describe the transitions with non-negligible charge transfer character. As a matter of fact, the choice of a conventional exchange-correlation functional such as a pure and hybrid functional, due to the self-interaction error, would remarkably underestimate the energy of the excited states with significant charge transfer character.22 For this purpose, the Coulomb attenuating method CAM-B3LYP functional23 was chosen to calculate the vertical excitation energy and the oscillator strength. This method in fact takes into account long range corrections, which have been proved to be appropriate for charge transfer type excitations.
As shown in Table 1, the TDDFT results are in good agreement with the experimental data in terms of excitation energies. According to the results, the principal transition for ADA, DAD and polyAD corresponds to a S0 → S1 transition, predominantly described by a HOMO → LUMO transition.

Electrochemical behaviour
The redox behavior of ADA, DAD and polyAD was studied using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique that also provided more insight into the electronic structure of the materials. The representative CV traces obtained are shown in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  CV plots of ADA, DAD and polyAD. 
The oxidation behavior of ADA, DAD and polyAD was investigated at positive potentials, showing quasi-reversible p-doping (oxidation/re-reduction) processes. Moreover quasi-reversible n-doping (reduction/re-oxidation) processes were detected for all the molecules over a negative potential range. Consequently, both the oxidation and the reduction potentials of the materials could be evaluated from the onset of the anodic and cathodic events respectively, and are summarized in Table 2. Although the electrochemical results are strongly dependent on the solvation effects of the formed radical ions, it can be stated that polyAD and DAD have similar oxidation potentials (and therefore HOMO energy values), slightly lower than that of ADA, as also suggested by theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the obtained LUMO energy values (ranging from −2.83 to −3.13 eV) indicate that all the synthesized materials can thermodynamically photo-reduce the fullerene derivatives24 commonly used as electron acceptors in BHJ devices. All the properties discussed above lead to the conclusion that ADA, DAD and polyAD are viable candidates for application in this type of solar cell.

BHJ solar cell performances
We have explored the use of ADA, DAD and polyAD as donors in BHJ devices. The three donors have been deposited in blend with PC61BM at different donor–acceptor ratios (see ESI†). This screening allowed us to identify the optimal blend composition which is donor:acceptor = 40:60 (w/w) for all three compounds. It is worthy of note that the polyAD shows very low efficiency at all the donor–acceptor ratios. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the device performance of the three compounds are reported in Fig. 5 and Table 3 respectively. Despite the much broader absorption profile shown by polyAD with respect to that of ADA and DAD, the corresponding device exhibited a very low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.03%. Moreover, although ADA and DAD showed a similar absorption spectrum, the device employing DAD returned a PCE of 0.95% that is three times higher than that of the ADA-based device (0.34%). It can readily be observed that a considerable contribution to the higher PCE for the device containing DAD derives from its higher open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF).

The VOC has typically been correlated with the difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor (ΔEAD).25 As can be deduced from the inspection of Table 3, the ΔEAD for the compounds ADA and DAD with respect to PC61BM is not enough to explain such an increase of the VOC values from 0.36 V to 0.78 V for the corresponding devices. It has recently been proposed that the donor–fullerene interface electronic coupling also has an influence on the VOC.26 In particular, these studies lead to a predictably high VOC for materials showing weak intermolecular interactions with the electron acceptor and vice versa.27 On these bases, the lower VOC of ADA can be interpreted in terms of a higher intermolecular overlap with the fullerene acceptor with respect to DAD, leading to stronger donor–acceptor coupling. This is probably due to the presence of two peripheral anthracene units in the ADA structure. Analogous considerations might hold for polyAD, the device based on which shows an anomalous VOC value of 0.03 V degrading its performances notwithstanding the favorable optical and electronic properties of the material.
The satisfactory performance demonstrated for DAD could also be ascribed to a better charge separation and/or collection efficiency, which influence the FF parameter. These two features are correlated with the series (Rs) and shunt (Rsh) resistances of the solar cell equivalent circuit that have been calculated from the inverse slope of the J–V characteristics taken at V = 0 V and V = VOC respectively, and reported in Table 3. The results clearly indicate that, while the Rs of the device with ADA and DAD is very similar, the Rsh of the DAD-based device is much higher than that of the ADA-based one, explaining the enhancement in the FF value. Although the origin of the parallel resistance is not yet clear, the shunt behavior in low voltage regimes is often ascribed to the inhomogeneous active layer formation or to the presence of pinholes that connect the opposite electrodes with each other.
To gain further insight into the differences of performance, we investigated the morphology of the active layer by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The topography images of the thin films made by blending the three compounds with PC61BM are reported in Fig. 6. The DAD:PC61BM blend showed large grains with the lateral size ranging from 0.5 to 1 μm, while the ADA:PC61BM blend showed smaller and more numerous grains. In the case of domain sizes too small as in the ADA:PC61BM blend morphology, percolation channels should not be formed, leading to a poor carrier collection efficiency. However, the short circuit current density (JSC) exhibited by ADA (3.07 mA cm−2) was only slightly lower than that of DAD (3.37 mA cm−2), suggesting that the high planarity of ADA and the presence of two anthracene units are sufficient to promote strong intermolecular interactions (between ADA molecules) ensuring, in any case, that the carrier transport and collection are comparable to those of DAD.
 Fig. 6  AFM topography of the blended films of (a) ADA:PC61BM, (b) DAD:PC61BM and (c) polyAD:PC61BM (scan size 2 × 2 μm). 
Conversely, in spite of its quite low roughness (∼1 nm), the polyAD:PC61BM blend showed very large aggregates. The formation of such inhomogeneous blend can be ascribed to the strong π–π interactions between the polymer chains, which hampered the formation of an interpenetrating network, but, at the same time, ensured a non-negligible JSC deriving from a satisfactory absorption profile.
On the bases of the obtained results, we embarked in an improvement of the device performances using DAD as an organic donor and PC71BM as an acceptor in BHJ solar cells. The device was constructed with a structure: ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS)/DAD:PC71BM/LiF/Al using the same composition and thickness of the blend film of the previously discussed solar cell devices. In spite of a slight lowering of the VOC (0.70 V) and FF (31%), the use of PC71BM as an electron acceptor determined a remarkable increase of the JSC (6.03 mA cm−2), yielding a satisfactory PCE as high as 1.3% (Fig. 7). A more efficient electron transfer from the DAD donor to the fullerene acceptor can be held responsible for the improvement of this feature. Furthermore, the aspect which emerges from these results is that the strong intermolecular interactions of a small planar conjugated molecule can force the fullerene derivative to assemble in percolation channels to the electrodes.

Conclusions
Aiming at evaluating the structure–property relationships between poly- and monodispersed materials, a new class of organic semiconductors was synthesized by coupling a fused aromatic system (anthracene, A) and a bridged bithiophene (dithienopyrrole, D) unit spaced by ethynylene moieties. The materials (namely ADA, DAD and polyAD) were synthesized and characterized by NMR, HR ESI-MS, IR, UV-Vis, photoluminescence, cyclic voltammetry and DFT calculations. Organic BHJ solar cells using fullerene derivatives as electron acceptors revealed that the monodispersed materials (ADA and DAD) are surprisingly better performing than polyAD and the reasons for this result could be ascribed to its stronger intermolecular interactions with PC61BM as well as to the formation of an inhomogeneous polymer/acceptor blend. On the other hand, the PCE value (1.3%) obtained with DAD ranks among the highest reported for BHJ solar cells based on non-polymeric small molecules constructed without the use of additives or of annealing processes. We expect that further improvements will be achieved by a careful optimization of the processing conditions as well as by the fine tuning of absorption, redox and film-forming properties of this class of new organic semiconductors.
