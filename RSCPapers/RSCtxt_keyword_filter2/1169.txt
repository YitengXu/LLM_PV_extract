    First published on 29th May 2015AbstractGraphene is the thinnest two-dimensional (2D) carbon material and has many advantages including high carrier mobilities and conductivity, high optical transparency, excellent mechanical flexibility and chemical stability, which make graphene an ideal material for various optoelectronic devices. The major applications of graphene in photovoltaic devices are for transparent electrodes and charge transport layers. Several other 2D materials have also shown advantages in charge transport and light absorption over traditional semiconductor materials used in photovoltaic devices. Great achievements in the applications of 2D materials in photovoltaic devices have been reported, yet numerous challenges still remain. For practical applications, the device performance should be further improved by optimizing the 2D material synthesis, film transfer, surface functionalization and chemical/physical doping processes. In this review, we will focus on the recent advances in the applications of graphene and other 2D materials in various photovoltaic devices, including organic solar cells, Schottky junction solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells, quantum dot-sensitized solar cells, other inorganic solar cells, and perovskite solar cells, in terms of the functionalization techniques of the materials, the device design and the device performance.

1. Introduction
The energy consumption of the world reached 16 terawatts in 2006 and is predicted to rise to ∼30 terawatts by 2050.1 However, traditional energy sources like fossil fuels increase CO2 emission and cause severe environmental problems. Solar energy has been recognized as an important green energy source. Various solar technologies including solar heating, solar photovoltaics and solar thermal electricity have been employed to harness solar energy around the world. Solar photovoltaic technology has attracted much attention in recent years because it is a feasible way to solve some of the urgent problems that the world now faces, like environmental pollution and an energy crisis. Silicon p–n junction solar cells, for their advantages of high efficiency and stability, are the dominant photovoltaic products in the market and have been popularly used in our normal life. The best single crystalline silicon solar cells have shown power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of up to 25% and the commercial solar cell modules have achieved efficiencies of about 19%.2 However, silicon wafers are fragile, have a high cost, and have a complex manufacturing process, which limit their competition against other energy sources.3 Therefore, several new generation thin film solar cells, including organic solar cells (OPVs), Schottky junction solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), quantum dot (QD)-sensitized solar cells and perovskite solar cells, have attracted much research interest in the past decade and astonishing progress has been made in these fields.
As shown in Fig. 1, 2D materials especially graphene, a single atomic layer composed of sp2-hybridized carbon, are rapidly rising star materials, which have very broad applications in recent years. Graphene was successfully isolated from graphite using a technique called mechanical exfoliation in 2004.4 Since then, the study of graphene has been making a huge impact on many areas of science and technology due to its outstanding electronic, optical and mechanical properties,5 followed by a series of investigations on other 2D materials,6,7 such as 2D MX2 type crystals (M = Mo, W, Nb, Re, Ti, Ta, etc.; X = S, Se, Te) transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),8–11 phosphorene,12,13 transition oxides (e.g., MoO3, La2CuO4),14 silicene,15 germanene16 and perovskite materials (e.g., [NH3(CH2)12NH3]PbX4).17 To obtain full pictures of these applications, interested readers may refer to a number of reviews of 2D materials in different fields, including fundamental properties,8,18–21 photonic applications,22–25 electronic applications,26 energy devices,27,28 biomaterials and sensors.29–31

Due to its high conductivity and transparency, graphene has been successfully used in almost all types of photovoltaic devices as transparent electrodes or interlayers.32,33 Other 2D materials, such as MoS2, WS2 and black phosphorus, have demonstrated distinct electrical, optical, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties from their bulk three-dimensional (3D) counterparts and are promising for photovoltaic devices as interlayers or active layers as evidenced in recent research.34,35 Therefore, here we provide a comprehensive review on the applications of 2D materials in solar cells, mainly focusing on the critical issues of device design and processing techniques in using these materials.
2. Preparation and properties of graphene and other 2D materials
2.1. Exfoliation methods
In 2004, graphene was, for the first time, prepared, transferred and characterized by Novoselov et al. and its field effect and quantum hall effect were observed.4 Since then, graphene and other 2D materials, such as MoS2, WS2, WSe2 and MoSe2, have quickly become hot topics for physics, chemistry, material science and biology etc. The methods for synthesizing 2D materials can be categorized into mechanical, chemically assisted and solution based exfoliation, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The 2D materials prepared by these techniques have different sizes, quality and chemical properties, which in turn determine their applications.

2.1.1. Mechanical exfoliation. 
In graphite, the adjacent graphene layers are bound by weak van der Waals forces (2 eV nm−2), so pristine graphene can be exfoliated from graphite by using adhesive tapes. In 2004, Novoselov et al. obtained graphene by mechanical exfoliation of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite.4 This method involves repeatedly sticking and peeling apart graphite flakes into thinner layers with scotch tape until single or few-layer graphene flakes are obtained on the tape, and transferring it onto a Si wafer with a thermal oxide layer. The average size of such graphene is about several micrometers. The graphene showed ballistic transport in field-effect transistors with carrier mobilities ranging from 3000 to 10000 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature.36 The electronic characteristics of graphene can be tuned by applying a gate voltage.
This technique has also been applied to produce 2D TMDs, such as MoS2, WS2, WSe2 and MoSe2. TMDs are layered compounds with three-coordinate dichalcogenides and trigonal prismatic transition-metal centers. Each layer, being 6–7 Å thick, consists of a hexagonally packed transition-metal atom layer sandwiched between two layers of dichalcogenides atoms.21 The neighboring layers are bound by weak van der Waals force, which facilitate the exfoliation of bulk TMDs into atomically thin 2D films. Therefore, the mechanical method has been widely used to prepare 2D TMDs for various applications.37–39
To date, mechanical exfoliation is the most effective way to prepare highly crystalline and the lowest defective 2D materials, which makes exfoliated 2D materials the first choice for fundamental studies. However, the mechanical exfoliation process is far from scalable and suffers from low throughput. The transfer process can also leave glue residues on the 2D films. More importantly, the thickness, size and location of the peeled 2D films are largely uncontrollable and thus the exfoliation method can't be scaled up to the level of industrial production for applications in large-size electronic devices.


2.1.2. Chemical exfoliation. 
Chemical exfoliation methods were developed to exfoliate single- or few-layer graphene oxide (GO) from oxidized graphite for mass-production. GO is an important graphene derivative,40–42 which in general is synthesized by Brodie,43 Staudenmaier44 or Hummers methods,45 or some other variations of these methods.46 All these methods utilize strong acids (H2SO4, HNO3 or HClO4) and oxidants (KClO3, NaNO3 or KMnO4) to produce GO from graphite. GO has epoxide, carbonyl and hydroxyl groups attached to the surfaces of the graphene layers, which render GO strongly hydrophilic and dispersible in many solvents, particularly in water. The resulting GO aqueous colloidal suspension can be deposited on various substrates to prepare conductive films by means of several convenient methods such as spin-coating,47 drop-casting,48 Langmuir–Blodgett assembly,33 printing41,49 or spraying.50 GO can also be reduced by several reducing agents (hydrazine,40 hydroquinone,51 ascorbic acid52) via thermal treatment. Compared with mechanical exfoliation, chemical exfoliation provides the possibility of preparing GO or reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in relatively large quantities for scientific research as well as commercial applications. In 2008, Cote et al. prepared graphene nanoplates via chemical exfoliation of graphite oxide, which can be readily exfoliated as individual GO sheets by ultrasonication in water. The monolayer GO films were dispersed homogeneously on SiO2 substrates without aggregation, and then the GO sheets were reduced using hydrazine hydrate solution to obtain the graphene sheets.41
Although many works on chemically exfoliated TMDs have been conducted since the 1960s, a focus on the isolation of high-quality and large-quantity 2D TMDs materials was re-initiated after the discovery of graphene.4 In a typical chemically exfoliated procedure, bulk TMDs were submerged in a solution of a lithium-containing compound such as n-butyl lithium for more than one day to allow lithium ions to intercalate, and then the lithiated TMDs were exposed to water and separated by H2 that evolved during the reaction of water and lithium. For example, Eda et al. applied n-butyl lithium dissolved in hexane as the intercalation agent to exfoliate bulk MoS2. The lithiated MoS2 was retrieved by filtration and washed with hexane. Then the extracted product was exfoliated by sonication in water, and a yield of almost 100% atomically thin MoS2 was obtained.53 Unlike chemically exfoliated graphene, 2D TMDs prepared by the lithium intercalated method remain chemically unmodified so their fundamental electronic properties are largely preserved.


2.1.3. Liquid phase exfoliation. 
Reducing GO obtained by chemical exfoliation to graphene is relatively easy. However, rGO often shows much lower conductivity than pristine graphene because of uncompleted reduction and the presence of large defects that disrupt the graphene sp2 network. Therefore, a new liquid phase exfoliation method was developed to obtain a stable colloidal suspension of graphene sheets.54,55 The liquid phase exfoliation process is to disperse graphite into organic solvent. The solvent molecules can interpenetrate within the graphite layers, and oxide-free graphene can then be exfoliated from graphite during the sonication process. The quality of this graphene is undoubtedly higher than that exfoliated from graphite oxide due to the absence of oxygen in the former. For example, Hernandez et al. produced single- or few-layer graphene through dispersion and exfoliation of pure graphite in N-methyl-pyrrolidone with a yield of 12 wt%.55 Lotya et al. used a similar method to produce single- or few-layer graphene by using graphite power dispersed in sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS).56 Blake et al. reported that sonicating graphite in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) returned a high yield of monolayer graphene up to 50%.57 In 2010, Behabtu et al. directly exfoliated single-layer graphene from graphite in chlorosulphonic acid.58 The graphene obtained through this technique was of high quality and over 70% as single layer with few defects. The conducting films based on the graphene showed a sheet resistance (Rs) of 1000 Ω □−1 and a transmittance of 80%.
Well-dispersed TMD nanoflakes can form high-quality films by solution coating and are useful in high-performance devices, such as transistors and solar cells. They can be easily produced in a solvent (DMF or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)) by ultrasonication.59,60 Firstly, TMD powders are expanded by reacting with solvents under hydrothermal conditions. The solvents have low energy to intercalate into TMD layers and can expand the TMD sheets by more than 100 times their volume. Then the expanded TMDs were ultrasonicated to produce atomically thin flakes that are water dispersible. However, a drawback of this method is the low yield of single layers.


2.1.4. Electrochemical exfoliation. 
In an electrochemical exfoliation process, graphite rods are used as both the anode and cathode in an electrochemical cell. A static potential of 10–20 V is added between the two electrodes. The anode graphene rod will be exfoliated into graphene sheets in the ionic liquid solution. The graphene sheets can be individually and homogeneously suspended in DMF, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or NMP solvent without the need of further deoxidization.59 For example, Su et al. demonstrated a novel one-step approach of exfoliating a high-quality graphene film by this electrochemical method.60 The size of the exfoliated graphene films ranges from several μm up to 30 μm. A transparent conducting film was prepared by drop coating the exfoliated graphene on a glass substrate, which exhibits excellent conductivity and transparency (sheet resistance Rs = 210 Ω □−1 at T ∼ 96%).
The electrochemical technique can also be applied to intercalate TMDs with lithium, which is faster and more controllable compared with chemical exfoliation processes. In this kind of electrochemical cell, the lithium foil and bulk TMDs are used as the anode and cathode, respectively. A galvanostatic discharge is applied on two electrodes to intercalate lithium into bulk TMDs. The intercalated product is then washed and ultrasonicated to exfoliate 2D TMDs.61
The aforementioned exfoliation methods can produce gram or even kilogram quantities of 2D materials yet faces drawbacks such as a low production yield of single layer, the small size of the flakes, residual compounds on products and/or expensive intercalations. Therefore, alternative exfoliation methods besides the above are expected to be developed in the future.

2.2. CVD methods
Although the mechanical exfoliation method can lead to high-quality graphene and chemical exfoliation methods can provide large quantities of graphene, the average size of graphene prepared by these methods is too small to be suitable for applications in large electronic devices. CVD is a promising and inexpensive large-area producing method for growing high-quality, large-scale and continuous graphene on transition metal substrates (Ni,62 Cu,63 Pt,64 Ru,65 or Ir66). The conductivity of CVD grown graphene is approximately one order of magnitude higher than that of graphene films produced by chemical or liquid phase exfoliation methods, which makes CVD graphene more attractive for applications in high-performance optoelectronic devices. Similarly, other 2D materials can be prepared with CVD methods on solid substrates, like SiO2.

2.2.1. Graphene synthesis on Ni. 
Because Ni has high carbon solubility, carbon atoms can be dissolved in Ni at high temperature and then precipitate onto the Ni surface to form single- or multilayer graphene upon cooling. The first work on synthesizing large scale graphene on Ni by a CVD method was reported in 2006.67 It was estimated to have approximately 35-layer graphene, and this study opened a new processing route for graphene preparation. Later, Yu et al. prepared three to four-layer graphene through a CVD process on Ni foils.68 It was found that the formation of graphene on Ni occurred only under moderate cooling rates and the graphene synthesis was demolished at higher or lower cooling rates. This study provides better understanding about the growth mechanism of graphene on Ni in CVD processes. In 2008, Kim et al., grew high-quality graphene on patterned Ni films and transferred them on arbitrary substrates by using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).62 The obtained graphene showed a transmittance of about 77% with Rs as low as 280 Ω □−1. However, under the cooling process of CVD, the segregation rate of carbon from the metal carbide is heterogeneous at the Ni grains and grain boundaries, and the layers and homology of graphene are difficult to be controlled. Therefore, single or few-layer graphene does not homogeneously cover the entire substrate but just in the few to tens of micrometers region. In 2010, in order to improve the uniformity of graphene, Zhang et al. reported the formation of graphene on a single-crystalline Ni(111) surface by a CVD method.69 Compared to graphene grown on polycrystalline Ni, the as-grown graphene on single-crystalline Ni(111) shows a smoother surface and more uniform thickness; micro-Raman surface mapping reveals that monolayer and bilayer graphene is 91.4%, which is much higher than the percentage on polycrystalline Ni (72.8%).


2.2.2. Graphene synthesis on Cu. 
Up to now, Cu foils are the mostly used substrates for the growth of high-quality monolayer graphene films. In 2009, Li et al. grew large-area graphene films on Cu foils by a CVD method.63,70 The graphene films exhibited predominantly single-layer (95%) with small fractions of bilayer and few-layer graphene areas.63 The resulting graphene transistors showed electron mobilities as high as 4050 cm2 V−1 s−1. The single-layer graphene had Rs of 2.1 kΩ □−1 with a transmittance of about 97% whereas the Rs of four-layer graphene decreased to 350 kΩ □−1 with a transmittance of about 90%.70
The growth process of graphene on Cu is different from that on Ni due to the different solubilities of carbon in the two metals. Cu has an ultralow solubility of carbon, and the growth mechanism of graphene on Cu is based on a catalytic process. After one- or two-layer graphene is deposited, the surface of the Cu will lose its catalytic properties to decompose the hydrocarbon and precipitate extra carbon on its surface, so mainly single- or bi-layer graphene can be grown on polycrystalline Cu substrates.


2.2.3. Graphene synthesis on Pt. 
In 2012, Gao et al. demonstrated the growth of high-quality and large-size graphene on Pt foil by CVD, and a bubbling method was employed to transfer graphene films from Pt to arbitrary substrates.71 The Pt foils can be reused as catalysts with almost no limit, and the graphene obtained on a repeatedly used Pt substrate has almost the same quality as that obtained originally. More importantly, the electrochemically separated graphene showed high crystal quality with the lowest wrinkle height and the highest carrier mobilities (7100 cm2 V−1 s−1) compared with the samples prepared by other transfer methods.


2.2.4. Other bottom-up methods. 
Graphene can be directly synthesized on insulating substrates,72 which however is difficult to be transferred to other substrates. So it is suitable for wafer-based applications and has limited applications in solar cells. For example, epitaxial growth of graphene on SiC surfaces is another bottom-up approach to obtain high-quality graphene.73,74 After the sublimation of Si on SiC surfaces at high temperature (>1000 °C), the excess carbon left behind can graphitize and form a nearly perfect graphene structure on both the silicon-rich face (0001) and carbon-rich face of the hexagonal phase SiC.


2.2.5. Transfer of CVD graphene. 
CVD graphene grown on metal substrates must be transferred onto substrates for various applications. The transfer process of graphene films from transition metals (Ni, Cu, Pt) to target substrates will inevitably lead to cracking and introduce residues, which will influence the electrical properties of graphene. Therefore, the transfer process plays an important role in keeping the pristine properties of graphene. Two methods are often used to transfer graphene, one is wet-transfer, and other is dry-transfer. The wet-transfer is typically done by depositing a thin layer of PDMS or poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) on top of the graphene, and then etching the metal in acidic aqueous solution of FeCl3 or (NH4)SO8. After that, the polymer-coated graphene can be readily obtained and is strong enough to allow handing on the desired substrate.70 Once the transfer process is complete, the polymer on the graphene surface is removed by a corresponding solvent (e.g. acetone for the case of PMMA). The dry-transfer uses a thermal release tape as the transfer polymer. Firstly, graphene deposited on a metal foil is attached to a thermal tape by applying soft pressure, and then the metal foil is etched away. After that, the graphene on the tape is transferred to a target substrate, which is then heated (∼100 °C) to release the thermal tape. Eventually, graphene is transferred from the tape to the target substrate. In 2010, Bae et al. demonstrated the transfer of single layer graphene over 30 inches by this method.75
Apart from these main transfer routes of wet-transfer and dry-transfer, there have been attempts to transfer graphene through other techniques. One is a clean-lifting transfer method by using electrostatic forces to transfer graphene to various substrates recently reported by Wang et al.76 This method does not involve any organic residue on the graphene surface and thus has great potential for future industrial production of graphene-based optoelectronic devices. Another one is the bubbling transfer method that is suitable for Pt foils. A Pt foil with the grown graphene is spin-coated with PMMA and used as a cathode in an electrochemical cell. Graphene is separated from the Pt foil upon H2 evolution by applying a constant current across the cell. This bubbling transfer technology is non-destructive not only to graphene but also to the Pt substrate, which allows for the repeated growth of graphene on Pt.71
The highest field-effect mobility and the lowest Rs for transferred single-layer CVD grown graphene have been reported to be 7100 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 125 Ω □−1 at room temperature, respectively.18,75,77 But in most cases, the mobilities and Rs of CVD graphene range from 300 to 5000 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 600 to 3000 Ω □−1, respectively.78,79


2.2.6. Synthesis of other 2D materials. 
High-quality 2D TMDs with large areas can also be prepared by CVD methods. Unlike graphene grown on transition metal catalysts, TMDs can be directly deposited on SiO2 or sapphire substrates using transition metal (e.g. Mo or W) and sulfur powder as the precursors.80,81 For example, in the preparation of MoS2, Mo thin films are firstly deposited on SiO2 substrates by evaporation. Then the Mo/SiO2 substrates are put into a CVD furnace containing sulfur vapor. A vapor–solid reaction takes place at a temperature of ∼750 °C in an Ar environment, leading to MoS2 film growth driven by the increase in enthalpy. After the growth, the samples are annealed at a high temperature (∼1000 °C) to improve the crystallinity and uniformity.
The second strategy reported for the deposition of 2D MoS2 by a CVD method is based on a thermolysis of ammonium thiomolybdates [(NH4)2MoS4] process.82 Firstly, (NH4)2MoS4 dip-coated substrates (SiO2 or sapphire) are placed into a CVD furnace to convert (NH4)2MoS4 to MoS2 in a gas mixture (Ar/H2: 4/1) at a temperature of ∼500 °C. Then the sample is subjected to a second annealing at 1000 °C in a gas mixture of Ar and sulfur as a protection gas to improve the crystallinity of MoS2.
The third method is to use the MoO3 and S powders as precursors to deposit 2D MoS2 by a gas-phase reaction.83 The MoO3 and S powders are separately placed in a CVD furnace with a SiO2 substrate on top of them. The SiO2 substrate could be treated with aromatic molecules such as rGO, perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid tetrapotassium salt (TPAS) and perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) to promote the layer growth of MoS2. In the growth process, MoO3 is firstly reduced by the sulfur vapor to form volatile suboxide MoO3−x at a temperature of ∼650 °C in an N2 environment, and then the MoO3−x diffused to the substrate and further reacted with sulfur vapor to grow the MoS2 film. These MoS2 films produced by the above three methods can be peeled off from the SiO2 or sapphire substrates and transferred onto arbitrary substrates with the help of PMMA and NaOH.84

2.3. Properties

Mobility. 
Graphene is known to be a zero band gap semiconductor (Fig. 1), and shows an ambipolar conduction in its field effect transistor (FET). In 2008, charge carrier mobilities of ∼200000 cm2 V−1 s−1 were observed in a mechanically exfoliated graphene FET,85–87 which exceed those of semiconducting carbon nanotubes and InSb, and are the known highest mobilities for semiconductors. These high carrier mobilities make graphene potentially useful in highly conductive electrodes and high frequency electronic devices. TMD (MoS2, WSe2, MoSe2, WS2) monolayers, another type of 2D material, have direct band gaps (Fig. 1). In 2003, the recorded mobility of 980 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained in a multilayer MoS2-based FET. The MoS2 was obtained by a mechanically exfoliated method and showed an n-type semiconductor property.39 In 2004, WSe2 was prepared by a vapor phase transport technique (VPTT) and characterized via its FET, showing a p-type transport property with a mobility of up to 500 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature.88 Although the mobilities of MoS2 and WSe2 are much lower than that of graphene, they are still comparable to the mobility of silicon and exceed the mobilities of amorphous silicon and organic semiconductors by 2–3 orders of magnitude. Recently, a mobility of ∼250 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained in a MoSe2-based FET, which was fabricated by exfoliating VPTT-MoSe2 onto a SiO2 substrate and showed ambipolar behavior.89 Compared with that of other TMD materials, less work has been reported on 2D WS2. A mobility of ∼50 cm2 V−1 s−1 was recently obtained in a WS2-based FET, which was fabricated by the same process as the MoSe2-based FETs.90 2D phosphorene (monolayer or few-layer) is a direct band gap semiconductor (1.2–1.5 eV) (Fig. 1), showing p-type behavior and high carrier mobilities of up to 1000 cm2 V−1 s−1 in its FETs at room temperature.91


Absorbance. 
The theoretical transmittance of single-layer graphene can be calculated by the equation:25,92 (1)where α is the fine structure constant, α = e2/ℏc = 1/137. So the absorbance of single-layer graphene can be obtained by A = 1 − T = πα = 2.3%. Experimentally, as shown in Fig. 2a and b, the absorbance of mechanically exfoliated and CVD grown single-layer graphene is ∼2.3%,63,93 which is in excellent agreement with the theoretical result given by the above equation. Further measurements showed that single-layer graphene only reflects <0.1% of incident light over the visible spectrum.93,94
 Fig. 2  (a) The transmittance of single or two layer graphene prepared by mechanically exfoliated method.93 (b) The transmittance spectra of CVD-graphene with different layers.75 (c) Rs as a function of transmittance for graphene prepared by different methods.75 (d) Rs as a function of the number of layers for CVD-graphene before and after HNO3 doping.75 
The absorbance of 2D TMDs (MoS2, WSe2, MoSe2, WS2) can be calculated by a simplified equation: A = 1 − exp(−aL)(2)where A, a and L are the absorbance, absorption coefficient and thickness of the 2D film, respectively.95 For MoS2, a ≈ 1–1.5 × 106 cm−1, it has an absorbance of 5–10% at a thickness of 0.65 nm, which is one order of magnitude higher than that of GaAs and Si with the same thickness. So, 2D TMDs have a great potential application for solar energy absorption and conversion.


Conductivity properties. 
The sheet resistance Rs of graphene can be calculated by the equation:96 Rs = 1/eμNiN(3)where μ is the carrier mobility of graphene, Ni is the carrier density in graphene and N is the number of graphene layers. It is found that the carrier density of graphene can reach Ni = 1012 cm−2 after chemical doping while the carrier mobility of μ = 105 cm2 V−1 s−1 can be maintained. According to the above equation, the Rs of single layer graphene is ∼62.4 Ω □−1. If continuously increasing the number of graphene layers, as shown in Fig. 2c, we can get a graphene film with a better conductivity compared with indium tin oxide (ITO) at the same transmittance. As shown in Fig. 2d, HNO3 doped four-layer graphene with Rs of 30 Ω □−1 and a transmittance of 90% was obtained,75 which makes graphene an ideal candidate for transparent electrodes. The electrical conductivities of 2D TMDs (MoS2, WSe2, MoSe2, WS2) are very low for their semiconducting characters (band gap: 1.5–2.0 eV).97 However, these semiconductors have high light absorbance and carrier mobilities, and could be applied as active layers or charge transport layers in solar cells.


Mechanical flexibility. 
The 2D Young's modulus and intrinsic breaking strength of monolayer graphene have been measured to be ∼340 N m−1 and ∼42 N m−1, respectively.98 Assuming an effective monolayer graphene thickness of 0.355 nm, the corresponding 3D Young's modulus and intrinsic strength are ∼1.0 TPa and ∼130 GPa, respectively, which indicate that graphene is the strongest material ever measured with an atomic layer thickness. Therefore, graphene is suitable for flexible electronic devices. For monolayer MoS2, the 2D Young's modulus and intrinsic breaking strength are ∼180 N m−1 and ∼15 N m−1, respectively.99,100 Assuming a monolayer MoS2 thickness of 0.65 nm, the corresponding 3D Young's modulus and intrinsic strength are ∼270 GPa and ∼23 GPa, respectively.


Specific surface area. 
In theory, the surface area of single-layer graphene is 2630 m2 g−1.101,102 Recently, a surface area as high as 2150 m2 g−1 was obtained in chemically exfoliated graphene sheets.103 Therefore, graphene is a promising electrode material for super-capacitors, solar cells and sensors due to the possible ability of storing high densities of ions/charge on its surface. Other 2D materials can also have high specific surface areas. For example, MoS2 prepared through the reaction of (NH4)2MoS4 and N2H4 in aqueous solution exhibits a specific surface area of 210 m2 g−1.104

2.4. Characterization methods
Material characterization is critical to the study of 2D materials. Today, there are a vast number of scientific methods that can be utilized to characterize graphene and other 2D materials for the following properties:

Microstructure. 
The surface morphology and film thicknesses can be characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) can be used to characterize the surface potential or work function distribution of 2D materials.


Optical properties. 
The optical properties, including transmittance and absorption of 2D materials, can be measured by using UV-vis spectrophotometry. X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) can be used to confirm the chemical components and electronic states of the elements in the graphene and other 2D materials. Some groups (nitro groups, oxygen-containing groups, etc.) and bonds (C–F, C–N, etc.) on graphene can be analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) can be used to characterize the work functions of 2D materials. Raman spectroscopy is a convenient technique for deciding the number of layers or doping levels of 2D materials. In graphene Raman spectra, p (n)-type doping effects can cause the blue (red) shifts of the 2D and G bands of graphene due to the influence of the Fermi level on the photon frequencies of graphene.105


Electrical properties. 
The sheet resistance Rs of 2D materials can be characterized using four-point probe apparatus. Field effect transistors (FETs) can be used to measure the carrier mobilities and the doping type (p-type or n-type) of 2D materials. In graphene FETs, the carrier mobilities of graphene can be calculated from the slope of the linear regimes of the transfer curves (channel current IDSvs. gate voltage VG). The p (n)-type doping effect can be confirmed when the Dirac point of a graphene FET moves to a more positive (more negative) gate voltage.106 Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) can be used to analyze the electrocatalytic properties of graphene and other 2D materials.

3. Graphene transparent electrodes
The most important application of graphene in photovoltaic devices is for transparent electrodes due to the high conductivity and transparency of graphene. In this application, some other physical properties, such as the Fermi level, carrier mobilities and the surface properties, of graphene electrodes are also critical to the device performance, which will be addressed in detail in this section.
3.1. Transparent electrodes
Transparent electrodes are an essential component of modern electronic devices, such as displays, touch-panels, organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and photovoltaic devices. Traditionally, transparent conductive oxides (TCOs), such as ITO and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO),107 play a dominant role in transparent electrodes. For example, ITO has been popularly used in OPVs as the anode/cathode with transparencies of 80–90% and Rs of 10–30 Ω □−1.108 However, TCO electrodes have a number of disadvantages including high cost, fragility, fabrication in vacuum, instability towards acid or base, and poor transparency in near infrared region.77,109,110
The next generation optoelectronic devices require transparent electrodes to be cheap, lightweight, flexible and compatible with large-scale manufacturing methods. So many of the alternative transparent electrodes have been developed in order to replace TCOs, such as metal grids,111,112 metallic nanowires,113,114 conductive polymers like poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS),115–117 carbon nanotubes (CNTs)118–120 and graphene films.62,121,122 Metal grids are often prepared by photolithography with lift-off and metal evaporation processes,121 which is challenging when preparing large-area transparent electrodes. Metal (Ag123,124 Cu,125 and Au126) nanowire transparent electrodes can be prepared by solution process and show a sheet resistance Rs of less than 30 Ω □−1 at a transparency of ∼90%, being comparable to that of ITO.127 However, there are two critical issues that currently prohibit metal nanowire films for large-scale application in optoelectronic devices: (1) metal nanowire films have a high surface roughness that may lead to a short circuit in some devices, such as OPVs; (2) the adhesion of the films with substrates is not solid and the film can be easily removed just by adhesion or friction. Doped PEDOT:PSS with high conductivity has been used as a transparent electrode in many optoelectronic devices, like OPVs128 and OLEDs.129 However, the stability of PEDOT:PSS upon exposure to high temperatures, humidity, or UV light is a major problem for practical applications. Therefore, the environmental stability of PEDOT:PSS films must be improved before gaining widespread applications. CNTs are relatively cheap and can be deposited into large-area conductive films with various thicknesses. Transparent electrodes based on CNT films have been used in OLEDs,130,131 OPVs,132 touch screens,133 and biosensors.134 Although the conductivity for an individual CNT is high, there is a high contact resistance at CNT–CNT junction areas, which limits the conductive pathway within whole films.
It has been demonstrated that graphene has some advantages over conventional materials for transparent electrodes due to its outstanding electronic, optical and mechanical properties.47,109 The comparison between them is summarized in Table 1. Graphene transparent electrodes have been successfully used in touch screens,75 liquid crystal displays,57 memory devices,135,136 photodetectors,137,138 biosensors,139,140 field effect transistors,141 light-emitting diodes96,142 and photovoltaic devices, etc.101,143

However, the carrier mobilities of graphene are dependent on its quality which is largely limited by the fabrication process. For example, the mobility of large-area graphene synthesized by a CVD method is 300–5000 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature,62,63,72,144 which is much lower than the theoretical value, and the sheet resistance Rs of undoped graphene is normally several kΩ □−1. Therefore, the key challenge for using graphene to replace ITO in transparent electrodes is the high sheet resistance. According to eqn (2), the Rs of graphene could be reduced by increasing its carrier concentration, mobility, or number of layers (stacking multilayer of graphene). The carrier mobility of graphene is determined by the synthesis method and can be increased by optimizing the fabrication process. The density of charge carriers in graphene can be adjusted by shifting the Fermi level of graphene away from the Dirac point, where the carrier density is very low. There are many methods that can be used to modulate the charge carrier density in graphene, such as acidic doping,75,145–147 electrostatic gating,148 metal contact,149,150 organic or polymer doping.151–153 The modulation process can be simply classified by the type of induced carriers into n-type and p-type doping. If graphene is provided with electrons, n-type doping can be induced. Similarly, if electrons are extracted from graphene, p-type doping can be achieved.
3.2. p-type doping in graphene electrodes
Because all carbon atoms of a graphene layer are exposed to the surroundings, the electrical properties of graphene are sensitive to the surface materials with which the graphene is in contact with.154 Under ambient conditions, p-type transport behavior is often observed in graphene, which is usually caused by moisture, oxygen or other chemical residues introduced during the fabrication and transfer processes. For example, any transfer method utilizing solution etching can easily dope graphene due to the strongly oxidizing nature of the etching, which corresponds to the decrease of the Fermi level below the Dirac point and shows a p-type doping effect. To date, in order to control p-type doping in graphene, several approaches have been employed to modulate hole densities in graphene by means of metallic contact,150 acid modification,147,155 or molecule coating.156 For example, by immersing graphene films in AuCl3 or HAuCl4 solution, Au nanoparticles (NPs) can be formed on the surface of graphene, which can increase the surface potential and the conductivity of graphene.157 According to Raman spectra, the Au NPs lead to a heavy p-type doping in graphene films. It was observed that the Rs of single layer graphene was decreased from 448 to 150 Ω □−1, and the transmittance was only decreased for 2% after Au doping. By immersing graphene films in HNO3 solution, HNO3 molecules can be absorbed on the surface of graphene, which also shows a heavy p-type doping effect.147 It is notable that high-quality 4-layer CVD graphene doped with HNO3 shows a Rs of ∼30 Ω □−1 and transmittance of ∼90%, as shown in Fig. 2d, which are comparable to those of ITO (Rs = 20 Ω □−1, T ∼ 80%).75
Organic materials can be used to dope graphene films as well. Lee et al. employed a fluoropolymer as both the supporting layer for graphene transfer and the p-type doping layer.158 CVD grown graphene transferred with fluoropolymer exhibits an average Rs of 320 Ω □−1 that is lower than the Rs of graphene transferred with PMMA (650 Ω □−1) due to the doping effect of the fluoropolymer in the former. Hsu et al. developed a layer-by-layer tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) doping process on CVD-graphene.153 The optimized four-layer graphene with sandwiched three-layer TCNQ shows a Rs of 117 Ω □−1 and a transmittance of 88%. Besides normal polymers, ferroelectric polymers such as P(VDF-TrFE) were also applied as agents for doping graphene.159,160 Large-area CVD graphene can be heavily doped by ferroelectric dipoles provided by P(VDF-TrFE) and showed a Rs of 120 Ω □−1 and a transmittance of 95%. The doping effect of graphene can be tuned by changing the polarization of the P(VDF-TrFE) layer.
3.3. n-type doping in graphene electrodes
Due to the different requirements of electronic devices, it is necessary to obtain n-type doped graphene for logic circuits or as cathodes in photovoltaic devices. However, it is more difficult to realize n-type doping in graphene than p-type doping. For example, the substitution of carbon with nitrogen or boron atoms in the graphene lattice under vacuum conditions can result in n-type doped graphene, which however may increase the defect density and deteriorate the carrier mobilities of graphene.161–163 For example, Guo et al. annealed ion irradiated graphene in ammonia for n-type doping.163 Ion irradiation will introduce defect sites in graphene. After annealing in ammonia, some defects are filled by nitrogen atoms and graphene shows n-type doping behavior. However, as shown in Fig. 3a, the conductivity of graphene is decreased significantly after the doping process.161,164

Inset: schematic diagram of the GFET.167 (c) Conductivity of undoped or TiOx-doped GFETs as a function of VG.168 (d) Rs of undoped or PVA doped GFETs as a function of VG.57 
Alkali carbonate salts can also be used to realize n-type doping in graphene.165 For example, Huang et al. manipulated the work function of a graphene–CNT composite film by using alkali carbonate salts (Li2CO3, Na2CO3, K2CO3, Rb2CO3, Cs2CO3).166 These salts can form lots of interfacial dipoles on the surface of the composite films and the directions of the dipoles point from composite films to alkali salts, which thereby can decrease the work function of the composite films. It was found that the work function of the composite film was decreased from 5.1 to 3.4 eV after being doped by Cs2CO3, and these doped composite films can be used as cathodes in OPVs. However, the doping effect of alkali carbonate salts on graphene will be gradually decreased after the composite films are exposed to air.
Low work function metals can be deposited on graphene for n-type doping as well. For example, Szafranek et al. thermally evaporated a thin aluminum layer (1 nm) on graphene for n-type doping,167 it was found that aluminum causes a quite strong n-type doping in graphene. The gate voltage corresponding to the Dirac point of graphene in a graphene transistor was shifted from 0 V to −42 V and the Rs of graphene decreased from 8.7 kΩ □−1 to less than 2 kΩ □−1 after depositing aluminum on the surface, as shown in Fig. 3b. n-type inorganic semiconductors have also been deposited on graphene for n-type doping. Ho et al. covered graphene with TiOx thin films of different thicknesses for controllable n-type doping.168 The TiOx thin layers exhibited strong n-type doping in graphene, leading to the increase of conductivity of about 4 times and the increase of electron mobility of 2 times, as shown in Fig. 3c. The n-type doping effect is relatively stable, and exhibits little degradation even after 5 days of exposure in the ambient conditions.
Some doping techniques involve the introduction of a dipole moment using self-assembled monolayer (SAM) polymers or molecules, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG),169 polyvinyl alcohol (PVA),57 polyethylenimine (PEI),170 poly[9,9-bis((6′-(N,N,N-trimethylammonium)hexyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-(9,9-bis(2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethyl)-9-fluorene)] dibromide (WPF-6-oxy-F),171 and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO),171 which have larger electron positivity compared to carbon atoms. These kinds of polyol and multiamino compounds can physically adsorb onto the surface of graphene and create the strong interface dipoles to shift the work function and modify the conductivity of graphene.154 This type of noncovalent attachment of polymer on graphene is effective and simple, which is a significant way to tailor the electronic properties of graphene with little damage to the carbon lattice. For example, Blake et al. found that the Rs of graphene can be decreased from 6 to 0.4 kΩ □−1 after PVA doping,57 as shown in Fig. 3d, while the optical transmittance of graphene was not influenced.
3.4. Hybrid graphene electrodes
Graphene can be combined with other highly conductive materials for hybrid electrodes. For example, highly conductive metals like Au or Ag can be used to make a conductive grid or net, and graphene can be transferred on the top of them to fill the uncovered area for hybrid graphene electrodes.172 CVD-graphene–Au grid hybrid electrodes show a Rs as low as 3 Ω □−1 and a transmittance of ∼80%,121 which even outperformed all reported transparent electrodes. The hybrid electrodes can be fabricated on not only rigid substrates (glass) but also flexible ones, such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), with excellent bending stability.121 Similar cases were observed in graphene and Ag nanowire (NW) or Cu NW hybrid electrodes.110,173–175 Moreover, highly conductive transparent electrodes can be realized by combining graphene with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and conductive polymers.176 For example, the composite films of rGO and CNTs have been used as transparent electrodes, which exhibited higher conductivity compared to either graphene or CNTs while maintaining high transmittance. King et al. developed a water-based method to prepare graphene–CNT composite films.177 After the addition of 3 wt% graphene into a CNT solution, the direct current conductivity (σDC) to optical conductivity (σOP) ratio of the graphene–CNT composite film was increased by 40% from 12.5 to 18, compared to that of a CNT-only film. PEDOT:PSS is the most widely explored conductive polymer,178,179 which has a much lower conductivity compared with ITO. It was found that adding graphene flakes into PEDOT:PSS can effectively improve its conductivity.122,123,180,181 Chang et al. composited surfactant-modified graphene and PEDOT:PSS with different ratios and obtained transparent electrodes with a sheet resistance and transmittance of 80 Ω □−1 and 79%, respectively.180
4. OPVs
OPVs typically with a bulk-heterojunction structure of a mixture of n-type and p-type organic semiconductors have been intensively investigated in the past decade and the reported efficiencies have exceeded 10%.182–184 The performance of OPVs, including the open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), short circuit current (Jsc) and long-term stability, is closely related to the material properties of the electrodes, interlayers and semiconductors. As shown in Table 2, it is notable that graphene has been successfully used in OPVs as many essential parts, including transparent electrodes (anode and cathode), electron transport layers (ETLs), hole transport layers (HTLs), n-type acceptors and packaging layers, which will be addressed in more detail as follows.

4.1. CVD-graphene anodes in OPVs
The compatibility of a graphene anode in an OPV lies with its conductivity, work function and surface properties. Pristine CVD graphene has a conductivity much lower than that of ITO and its work function (∼4.5 eV) cannot match the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of many donor organic semiconductors (∼5.0 eV), which introduces a large hole-injection barrier between the graphene and the donor materials. Therefore, it is necessary to have p-type doping in graphene in its applications as an anode. Moreover, it is not easy to directly coat organic thin films on graphene due to its hydrophobic surface and thus the device design and fabrication process should be optimized.
In 2009, Wang et al. non-covalently modified few-layer CVD graphene with pyrene butanoic acid succidymidyl ester (PBASE) via π–π interaction in order to improve the work function of graphene.185 The aromatic ring of PBASE has strong electron affinity, which is able to withdraw electrons from graphene to provide p-type doping. The work function of graphene films was adjusted from 4.2 to 4.7 eV after the modification, which is close to the HOMO level of PEDOT for efficient hole collection. Moreover, the hydrophilic property of graphene was also improved. The modified graphene was used as an anode in OPVs with a structure of graphene/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/LiF/Al (Fig. 4a), the PCE of the OPVs based on modified graphene was increased to 1.71%, which is much higher than that of a device based on unmodified graphene (η = 0.21%). In 2010, Park et al. found that AuCl3 doping on few-layer CVD-graphene can improve the conductivity, change the work function and alter the surface wetting properties of graphene for a uniform PEDOT:PSS coating.186 The PCE of an OPV with a structure of graphene/PEDOT:PSS/copper phthalocyanine(CuPc)/C60/bathocuproine(BCP)/Ag (Fig. 4b) was significantly improved from 0.57 to 1.63% after AuCl3 doping.

To give higher conductivity, multilayer graphene can be used in transparent anodes, which however, decreases the transparency of the electrodes. In 2011, Wang et al. prepared multilayer graphene films by a layer-by-layer transfer method.187 During the transfer process, the individual graphene layers were doped by HCl to improve their conductivity. The HCl-doped four-layer graphene films exhibited a Rs of 80 Ω □−1 with a transmittance of 90%. Then a thin layer of molybdenum oxide (MoO3 ∼ 2 nm) was evaporated on graphene to improve its work function and hydrophilic property. The work function of graphene was improved from 4.36 to 5.47 eV after MoO3 coating and PEDOT:PSS can be uniformly deposited on graphene, both of which are favorable for hole transport from PEDOT:PSS to graphene. The doped multilayer graphene was used as the anode in OPVs with a structure of graphene/MoO3/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/LiF/Al, and a PCE of 2.5% was obtained, as shown in Fig. 4c and d. In 2012, Hsu et al. reported a layer-by-layer organic molecular doping process of multilayer graphene anodes in OPVs.153 Tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) molecules were thermally evaporated onto the surface of each layer, and embedded between two adjacent graphene layers. The anodes with two TCNQ layers sandwiched by three graphene layers exhibited a Rs of ∼140 Ω □−1 and a transmittance of ∼90%. The OPVs based on the hybrid electrodes showed a maximum PCE of 2.58%.
In 2012, Park et al. introduced a vapor printing method to evaporate a PEDOT film on a graphene surface and used it in OPVs.188 Compared with the poor wettability of spin-coated PEDOT:PSS on graphene, the vapor printing method can produce a complete, uniform and smooth PEDOT layer on graphene. Recently, they found that poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEDOT:PEG) shows a better wettability on graphene compared with PEDOT:PSS.189 So, they inserted a thin PEDOT:PEG layer between the pristine graphene and PEDOT:PSS as a composite buffer layer in organic solar cells. They also found that isopropyl alcohol (IPA) can be added into the PEDOT:PSS solution to tailor the wettability of PEDOT:PSS on graphene.190 By mixing PEDOT:PSS with IPA (volume ratio of 3:1), the contact angles of PEDOT:PSS on graphene decreased to 19.6°, and thus PEDOT:PSS could form uniform and complete coverage of the graphene surface. More recently, they employed another type of polythiophene derivative RG 1200 as the hole transport layer, which has comparable electrical and optical properties to PEDOT:PSS and a good wetting capability on graphene film (contact angle: ∼4.9°).191 RG 1200 can produce a uniform coating on graphene electrodes without any additional treatment, and the resulting OPVs showed a similar performance to the control devices with ITO electrodes.
Thanks to its excellent mechanical strength and elasticity, graphene is a good candidate for bendable, foldable and even stretchable electrodes. In 2010, Gomez De Arco et al. synthesized high-quality CVD graphene and transferred it on flexible PET substrates to fabricate flexible OPVs,192 which showed PCEs of about 1.18%. More importantly, the flexible devices could maintain their performance under harsh bending conditions up to 138°, while the ITO-based devices cracked and completely failed at a bending degree of only 60°. It was also found that the conductivity of the flexible graphene electrode was very stable even after hundreds of bending cycles. Similarly, Lee et al. transferred multilayer graphene on PET, doped the graphene with HNO3 and SOCl2, and obtained flexible OPVs with PCEs of about 2.5%.193
In 2013, our group reported the fabrication of flexible OPVs on polyimide (PI) substrates with highly doped multilayer graphene as the anode and P3HT:PCBM as the active layer.194 As shown in Fig. 5a, the devices have a structure of graphene/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/ZnO/Ag/PI. One to four layers of CVD graphene were used in the devices. The Rs of the two-layer graphene decreased from 320 to 92 Ω □−1 after doping with PEDOT:PSS and Au NPs on the surface. The optimized OPVs showed PCEs up to 3.2% with the two-layer graphene as the anode (Fig. 5b). Being fabricated on a thin PI substrate (thickness: 50 μm), the device showed an excellent bending stability and its PCE decreased only 8% relatively after 1000 bending cycles with a curved radius of about 3 mm, as shown in Fig. 5c. More importantly, multilayer graphene has a package effect on the flexible OPVs, which can substantially improve the device stability in air (Fig. 5d). It is notable that the flexible OPVs with graphene top electrodes may not need additional packaging, which will simplify the device fabrication, enhance the flexibility and decrease the cost of the devices.

Inset: photograph of the device under bending conditions. (d) Evolution of PCEs of package-free OPVs with 1 to 4 layers of graphene or Au top electrodes measured in air.194 
In 2013, Liu et al. demonstrated a fiber-shaped OPV wrapped by an Au NP-doped graphene anode.195 The flexible fiber-shaped device can keep its PCE of about 2.5% under bending conditions. The graphene layer not only serves as a flexible transparent electrode for the fiber-shaped device, but also provides good encapsulation on the polymer layers, resulting in excellent flexibility and device stability in an ambient atmosphere. In 2014, Lee et al. reported a “doping-transfer” method to transfer and dope graphene by PEDOT:PSS films,196 which solves the problem of a polymer residue being introduced during graphene transfer. The OPVs with PCEs of 5.5% (glass substrate) and 4.8% (flexible substrate) were fabricated by using the PEDOT:PSS-doped graphene as the anode and showed excellent stability even after 2000 bending cycles on flexible substrates. Meanwhile, Kim et al. transferred multilayer graphene on a ferroelectric polymer (P(VDF-TrFE)) for flexible OPVs,197 in which the ferroelectric polymer has an electrostatic doping effect on graphene. The OPVs exhibited PCEs of about 2% and good mechanical flexibility.
OPVs based on polythieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene:[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PTB7:PC71BM) can have PCEs higher than 9.2%.183 In 2014, Park et al. used PEDOT:PSS-doped graphene as the anode in flexible PTB7:PCBM solar cells which showed a record PCE of 6.1%.198 More importantly, the flexible device was extremely stable and there was no significant change in the device performance after 100 compressive flexing cycles at a ∼5 mm radius.
Semitransparent OPVs have been realized by using both graphene and ITO transparent electrodes.199–201 The device can be illuminated from both sides and has some potential applications like power windows for buildings and automobiles. Lee et al. laminated multilayer graphene as a top electrode in a semitransparent inverted OPV,199 as shown in Fig. 6a, which has the device structure of ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/GO/multilayer graphene. The semitransparent OPVs showed PCEs of 2.5% and 2% illumination from the ITO and graphene sides, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6b.

In 2012, our group reported the use of single-layer graphene as top electrodes in semitransparent OPVs based on P3HT:PCBM,200 as shown in Fig. 6c. The Rs of single-layer graphene decreased to less than 100 Ω □−1 with a transmittance of ∼90% after doping with Au NPs and PEDOT:PSS. The semitransparent OPVs were fabricated with single-layer graphene and ITO as the top and bottom electrodes, respectively. All of the devices exhibited higher PCEs when illuminated from the graphene side due to the higher transmittance of the graphene electrodes in comparison with ITO in the visible region. PCEs up to 3% were observed in the devices illuminated from graphene electrodes, as shown in Fig. 6d. The influence of the active areas of the devices on the performance was also studied. When the active areas increased from 6 to 50 mm2, the PCEs of the OPVs decreased from 3% to 2.3% because of the increased series resistances. All of the semitransparent devices were very stable and showed little change in PCEs (<5%) after 6 months storage.
4.2. rGO anodes in OPVs
Solution processable rGO has also been widely employed in preparing transparent electrodes for OPVs because of the advantages of low cost and convenient fabrication.202 rGO conductive films can be deposited by spin-coating, dip-coating or Langmuir–Blodgett assembly methods. There are many effective approaches for improving the dispersion and conductivity of rGO, such as chemical doping and the preparation of hybrid rGO films with other conductive materials,176,203 which have been used in optimizing the performance of OPVs with rGO electrodes.
In 2008, Wu et al. prepared rGO conductive films by a hydrazine reduction and thermal annealing process, and used the rGO films as anodes of OPVs with a structure of rGO/CuPc/C60/BCP/Ag.204 The Rs and transmittance of the rGO films were measured to be 100–500 kΩ □−1 and 85–95%, respectively. However, the PCEs of the OPVs were just about 0.4%, much lower than that of normal OPVs with ITO electrodes. To improve the conductivity of rGO, Su et al. modified a donor–acceptor complex on the rGO surface using pyrene-1-sulfonic acid sodium salt (PyS) as an electronic donor and 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide bisbenzenesulfonic acid (PDI) as an electronic acceptor.203 For the negative charges in both molecules, the stability of the aqueous dispersion of rGO was greatly enhanced. At the same time, the conductivity of the modified rGO improved about 100% compared to that of pristine rGO. Then, OPVs with a structure of rGO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/ZnO/Al were prepared on quartz substrates and PCEs up to 1.12% were achieved. Recently, Kymakis et al. prepared OPVs with a similar device structure and displayed a maximum PCE of ∼1.1%.205
In 2013, Zhang et al. fabricated rGO mesh electrodes (GMEs) by a photolithography and O2 plasma etching process using rGO solution.206 The GMEs with different thicknesses were prepared on glass substrates for the tradeoff between the transparency and conductivity. OPVs employing a GME (Rs ∼ 608 Ω □−1, T ∼ 55%) as the anode and P3HT:PCBM as the active layer exhibited a maximum PCE of 2.04%, as shown in Fig. 7a and b. Recently, Yusoff et al. fabricated a high-performance semitransparent tandem solar cell using a solution processed rGO mesh and laminated Ag NW as the transparent anode and cathode, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7c.207 The transparent rGO mesh electrode, with a Rs of 521 Ω □−1 and a transparency of 70%, was prepared by using standard photolithography and O2 plasma methods. PCEs of 8.02% and 6.47% were obtained when the devices were illuminated from the graphene anode and Ag NW cathode, respectively (Fig. 7d), which are comparable to that of tandem devices with ITO electrodes.

Flexible OPVs have been realized by using rGO transparent electrodes. In 2010, Yin et al. deposited rGO films on PET substrates by a spin coating method and used them as transparent electrodes in flexible OPVs with a structure of rGO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/TiO2/Al.208 The rGO film had a transmittance of 55% and Rs of 1.6 kΩ □−1, and the PCEs of the devices were only 0.78%, which is much lower than that of a standard OPV with an ITO electrode due to the high Rs of the rGO films. It is notable that the device exhibited excellent mechanical flexibility and its performance was well maintained after one thousand cycles of bending.
4.3. CVD-graphene cathodes in OPVs
A graphene cathode in an OPV needs not only high conductivity but also an appropriate work function that should be close to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the n-type organic semiconductor in the device to form an Ohmic contact for the collection of electrons. However, due to physically absorbed oxygen and water during the graphene fabrication and transfer process, pristine graphene often shows p-type doping with a work function (>4.5 eV) higher than the LUMO levels of normally used organic acceptors, such as PCBM (LUMO: ∼4.2 eV). Thus, n-type doping in graphene to decrease its work function is necessary in graphene cathodes, which is addressed in more detail in Section 3.4.
Huang et al. adjusted the work functions of rGO–CNT composite electrodes by doping alkali carbonates.166 The efficiencies of the OPVs with an inverted structure of rGO/CNT/P3HT:PCBM/V2O5/Al increased with the decrease of the work function of rGO–CNT cathodes and an optimized PCE of 1.27% was obtained. Jo et al. firstly demonstrated the application of polymer (WPF-6-oxy-F) doped graphene as the cathode in OPVs with an inverted structure of graphene (WPF-6-oxy-F)/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Al.171 They found that WPF-6-oxy-F can form dipoles on the surface of graphene and decrease the work function of graphene from 4.58 to 4.25 eV, which is close to the LUMO (∼4.2 eV) of PCBM. Thus, the built-in potential of OPVs and charge collection of graphene are all increased. The devices showed a maximum PCE of 1.23%.
In addition to the high conductivity and appropriate work function of graphene, the interface control of graphene is very important especially in its application as a bottom cathode electrode. In 2013, Park et al. found that spin-coating a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEDOT:PEG) film on graphene can change the wettability of the graphene surface, then a high-quality ZnO or TiOx film can be deposited on the graphene as hole blocking layers by a solution process. An inverted solar cell with P3HT:PCBM as the active layer and PEDOT:PEG modified graphene as the cathode was prepared and showed an efficiency of 2.27%.189 Meanwhile, they employed PEDOT:PEG-modified three-layer graphene as a substrate for the growth of ZnO nanowires, and combined the ZnO nanowires with P3HT for hybrid solar cells (Fig. 8a), which showed a PCE of 0.4%.209 In 2013, Zhang et al. prepared an inverted device with a structure of graphene/Al/TiO2/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3/Ag (Fig. 8b) and showed a PCE of 1.59%.210 To further improve the device performance, a layer of Au nanogrids was transferred below the graphene to improve its conductivity and an optimized device with a PCE of 2.58% was obtained.

Graphene was also used in flexible OPVs as cathodes. In 2012, Shin et al. deposited high-quality ZnO films on CVD-graphene/polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrates by a mist pyrolysis CVD (MPCVD) method at a low growth temperature of 160 °C.45 A flexible OPV with a PCE of 1.55% was obtained based on the ZnO/graphene electrode and P3HT:PCBM active layer. More recently, Park et al. discovered that zinc acetate in methanol can be uniformly spin-coated on graphene for a hole blocking layer without the aid of stabilizer and surfactant.198 Then a highly efficient flexible OPV based on a ZnO/graphene cathode and PTB7:PC71BM was fabricated on a PEN substrate, which exhibited a highest PCE of 7.1% and excellent flexibility, as shown in Fig. 8c and d.
4.4. Graphene interlayers in OPVs

4.4.1. Hole transport layers (HTLs). 
In OPVs with bulk-heterojunction structures, HTLs are used to block electrons but transport holes to minimize carrier recombination.211 An ideal HTL must be a p-type material with a wide band gap, and can play the following roles:77 (1) to adjust the energetic barrier height between the active layer and electrode; (2) to transport holes while blocking electrons; (3) to enable an optimum morphology of the active layer; (4) to prohibit the reaction between the active layer and electrode; (5) to act as an optical spacer. Conventionally, PEDOT:PSS has been used as a HTL in OPVs, which is solution processable and can minimize the detrimental effect of ITO and align the energy barrier between the active layer and ITO. OPVs with P3HT:PCBM as the active layers and PEDOT:PSS as the HTLs PCEs close to 5% can be yielded.212 However, PEDOT:PSS is a highly acidic composite material (pH ∼ 1) that can erode ITO electrodes and result in poor stability of the OPVs. To address this issue, some inorganic materials, such as V2O5,213 MoO3214 and NiO215 have been used to replace PEDOT:PSS as the HTLs in OPVs, and PCEs as high as 5% have been achieved. However, these inorganic oxides are usually deposited by cost-intensive vacuum techniques (e.g. pulsed laser deposition (PLD), thermal evaporation), which are incompatible with low-cost, solution processable and roll-to-roll processed OPVs.
Solution processable GO or rGO was found to be able to replace inorganic oxides or PEDOT:PSS as HTLs in OPVs (Table 2). GO is normally deposited by neutral aqueous solution, which can avoid erosion of ITO that occurs when PEDOT:PSS is coated. Moreover, GO HTLs (2–5 nm thick) used in OPVs are much thinner and more transparent than their PEDOT:PSS counterparts (40–50 nm). GO has been successfully used as the HTL in OPVs based on P3HT:PCBM and the resulting devices have shown comparable PCEs to those of the devices with PEDOT:PSS HTLs. In 2010, Li et al. spin-coated ultrathin GO films on ITO for OPVs (Fig. 9a).211 The 2 nm-thick GO film led to little change in the transparency of the ITO electrode. The device with a structure of ITO/GO/P3HT:PCBM/Al had an efficiency of 3.5%. More importantly, the OPV showed better stability in air than the device with a PEDOT:PSS HTL. Yun et al. prepared rGO by using a novel p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (p-TosNHNH2) reductant and used it as the HTL in OPVs with PCEs of ∼3.6%.216 In 2014, Liu et al. synthesized GO nanoribbons from single-wall CNTs and applied them as HTLs in P3HT:PCBM solar cells, showing an improved PCE of 4.14% in comparison with the aforementioned devices.217

The right images show the schematic structure of GO and the AFM topography image of GO nanosheets on a silicon substrate.229 (d) Cross-sectional SEM image of a tandem device with GO/PEDOT as an interconnect layer.181 
GO or rGO has also been used in high-efficiency OPVs with narrow bandgap polymers as HTLs.218–220 Murray et al. reported the employment of solution processable GO as the HTL in high-efficient OPVs based on the narrow band polymers PTB7 and PC71BM, as shown in Fig. 9b.221 The OPVs exhibited PCEs as high as 7.5% and a long lifetime in air. Recently, Yeo et al. introduced a versatile rGO with sulfonic acid groups modified on its edge and basal planes.220 The rGO was applied as the HTL in various OPVs regardless of their HOMO values, resulting in PCEs of 3.64%, 4.80%, 7.18% and 7.18% for P3HT, poly[2,3-bis-(3-octyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-5,8-diyl-alt-thiophene-2,5-diyl] (TQ1), PTB7 and (PBDTTT-CF) based devices, respectively.
However, when the thickness of the GO HTLs is bigger than 3 nm, the performance of the OPVs mentioned above will be rapidly decreased due to the high resistance of the GO layers. Spin-coating such a thin GO film (1–3 nm) that can fully cover the ITO surface is technically difficult. To address this issue, Kim et al. created a composition of GO and SWCNTs by direct mixing of them in water by sonication before deposition.222 The optimum thickness of the GO/SWCNT HTL increased (3–4 nm) due to the increase in conductivity and the device based on the new HTL and P3HT:PCBM active layer showed a PCE of 4.1%. In 2012, Liu et al. developed a sulfated GO with –OSO3H groups attached to its carbon basal plane.223 Compared with that of GO, the conductivity of GO–OSO3H was much improved, leading to greatly improved FFs and PCEs (4.37%) in the resulting P3HT:PCBM solar cells. The performance of the device was nearly independent of the thickness of the GO–OSO3H HTL over the range of 2 to 6 nm.
The composite films of GO and PEDOT:PSS were found to be excellent HTLs in OPVs.224–226 In 2010, Yin et al. employed a GO/PEDOT:PSS composite instead of PEDOT:PSS in a normal structure OPV.225 The maximum PCE of the device was observed to be 3.8% at the optimized thickness of 40 nm for the GO/PEDOT:PSS HTL, which is easier to deposit than an ultrathin GO film. Recently, Yu et al. homogenously dispersed GO in a PEDOT:PSS solution/film by adjusting the pH of the GO solution, and the GO/PEDOT:PSS composite film was used as the HTL in PTB7:PC71BM solar cells.226 A PCE of 8.21% was achieved, which was improved by 12% in comparison to a control device with a PEDOT:PSS HTL. In addition, many other composite films based on GO and inorganic oxides (VOx, MoO3) have been successfully used as HTLs in OPVs.227,228 For example, Intemann et al. sequentially spin-coated GO and MoO3 films as a hybrid HTL for solar cells and showed a PCE of 7.3%.228
GO can be spin-coated not only on ITO but also on organic active layers. Gao et al. spin-coated a layer of GO on top of the active layer P3HT:PCBM as the HTL for inverted OPVs (Fig. 9c).229 An optimized performance (η = 3.61%) was observed in the device with a thin GO (2–3 nm) HTL. It was found that the performance of the inverted OPV was not as sensitive to the thickness of GO as that of a normal OPV.230 Later, Gao et al. found that GO contained a high density of protons due to the presence of carboxylic acid and phenolic and enolic groups, which led to protonic doping in P3HT at the GO/polymer interface.231 After doping, the electrical conductivity of P3HT was increased by six orders of magnitude, leading to the improvement of the device performance. Recently, Mohd Yusoff et al. fabricated inverted OPVs with GO HTLs and PCDTBT:PC70BM active layers and demonstrated PCEs of 6.2% and good air stability.232 In 2013, Chao et al. sequentially spin-coated two layers of GO and vanadium oxide (VOx) as a hybrid HTL for an inverted OPV.227 The OPV was based on a PTh4FBT:PC71BM active layer and showed a PCE of 6.7%.
It is noteworthy that the work function of the GO HTL can influence the performance of OPVs. Yang et al. reported that the work function of GO increased from 5.0 to 5.2 eV after O2 plasma treatment. They employed O2 plasma treated GO as the HTL in OPVs, which can more effectively block electrons and extract holes and result in an apparent increase of PCE.233 More recently, it was reported that the work function of GO can be continuously tuned to more than 5.2 eV by photochemical chlorination or other methods,234–236 and lead to the improvement of OPV performance. The PCEs of OPVs based on poly[(4,8-bis-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexanoyl)-thieno[3,4-b]thiopene)-2,6-diyl] (PBTTTT-C):PC71BM active layers and photochlorinated GO HTLs were found to be up to 7.6%.


4.4.2. Electron transport layer (ETLs). 
n-type doped GO can be used as ETLs in OPVs, which is a promising alternative to Ca and LiF ETLs that need to be prepared by thermal evaporation. As mentioned in Section 3.4, Cs2CO3 can provide n-type doping in graphene, lower its work function and increase its electron density. Therefore, Cs2CO3 functionalized GO has been used as ETLs in OPVs.237,238 For example, Liu et al. fabricated an OPV by using GO as the HTL and Cs2CO3 functionalized GO as the ETL.237 It is found that the peripheral –COOH groups in GO can be replaced by –COOCs groups through Cs2CO3 functionalization. After Cs2CO3 treatment, the work function of GO decreased to 4.0 eV, which matches well with the LUMO level of PCBM for efficient electron extraction. Both normal and inverted OPVs were prepared and showed PCEs of 3.67% and 2.97%, respectively.
In 2013, Qu et al. attached PCBM on rGO via a noncovalent functionalization approach.239 Pyrene was employed to anchor PCBM to rGO via π–π interaction, and the attached PCBM can prohibit the restacking of rGO sheets. The rGO–pyrene–PCBM was successfully applied as the ETLs for P3HT:PCBM-based OPVs and PCEs up to 3.89% were observed in the devices.
Although alkali salts such as Cs2CO3 can provide effective n-type doping in graphene, this kind of doping through intercalation of graphene and alkali metal often suffers from rapid degradation upon exposure to air,168 which will limit its practical applications in OPVs. Therefore, GO or rGO was composited with other stable oxides (e.g. TiO2, ZnO or TiOx) for ETLs.240–242 In 2014, Beliatis et al. prepared a novel hybrid ETL by chemically modifying TiO2 or ZnO with rGO.240 The OPVs based on a PCDTBT:PC71BM active layer with the hybrid ZnO–rGO and TiO2–rGO ETLs showed PCEs of 6.72% and 6.57%, respectively. In the meantime, they prepared OPVs with PTB7:PCBM active layers which displayed PCEs in the range of 7.4–7.5% when using hybrid ZnO–rGO or TiO2–rGO as ETLs.241

4.5. Graphene-based interlayers for tandem OPVs
Tandem OPVs with stacked two or more single-junction cells can provide higher efficiency due to their accumulated Voc of single cells and better light absorption in broader wavelength regions in comparison with a single-junction cell.184 Graphene and GO films have been successfully used in tandem OPVs as interlayers that are able to collect both electrons and holes from two stacked cells.
In 2011, Tong et al. first employed multilayer CVD-graphene/MoO3 as an interlayer in a tandem OPV, which can extract electrons and holes from the bottom and top cells.243 Two bulk heterojunction layers P3HT:PCBM and ZnPc:C60 with complementary absorption were stacked together for bottom and top cells, respectively. The tandem OPVs showed a high Voc of about 1 V and a PCE of about 2.3%.
A GO/PEDOT:PSS composite can be used not only as a HTL as introduced in Section 4.4.1, but also as interlayers for tandem OPVs. In 2011, Tung et al. added a small amount of GO (0.1–2 wt%) into a PEDOT:PSS solution to get a sticky gel181 which can dramatically increase the viscosity and electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. Based on the sticky GO/PEDOT:PSS gel, as shown in Fig. 9d, tandem OPVs with two P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunctions were fabricated by a direct adhesive lamination process. The Voc and PCE of the tandem OPV were 0.94 V and 4.1%, respectively. Afterwards, they composited GO with CNTs as the interconnect layer for tandem OPVs using the same method.244 Both regular and inverted tandem solar cells were all prepared with PCEs of 4.1% and 3.5%, respectively. So these kind of sticky interconnects based on GO can greatly simplify the fabrication process of organic tandem OPVs and facilitate the stacking of active layers with complementary absorption while minimizing their intermixing during deposition, which could also be applied in other tandem organic electronic devices.
Recently, Chen et al. reported a tandem OPV with Al modified GO–Cs (cesium functionalized GO) as the ETL and MoO3 modified GO as the HTL.245 The work function of GO–Cs can be reduced to 4.0 eV after Al modification, matching well with the LUMO level of PCBM, while the work function of MoO3 modified GO (20 nm) can be increased to 5.3 eV, matching well with the HOMO level of PCDTBT. Therefore, GO–Cs/Al/GO/MoO3 can act as an efficient interconnecting layer in tandem OPVs to achieve a significantly increased Voc, reaching almost 100% of the sum of Voc of the subcells.
4.6. Graphene acceptors in OPVs
To date, the most efficient OPVs are based on the bulk heterojunction structure employing fullerene derivatives such as PCBM as electron acceptors. Recently, graphene derivatives have emerged as new electron acceptors to replace PCBM in bulk heterojunction OPVs owing to their high electron mobility and large surface area for donor/acceptor interfaces. Moreover, the composite of graphene and poly(3-octylthiophene) (P3OT) shows remarkably reduced photoluminescence and consequently efficient charge transfer, indicating that the composite can be used in OPVs.
In 2008, Liu et al. first fabricated OPVs by using phenyl isocyanate functionalized GO as an acceptor and P3OT as a donor.246 The best PCE of 1.4% was obtained in the devices with an optimized content of GO in the active layer. Afterwards, functionalized GO was blended with P3HT in OPVs and a PCE over 1% was obtained.247 In 2010, Li et al. prepared GQDs with sizes of 3–5 nm by an electrochemical method and used them in OPVs with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:GQDs/Al.248 The LUMO level of the GQDs was measured to be in the range of 4.2–4.4 eV and the HOMO level for P3HT was ∼5.2 eV, thus the Voc of the OPV was expected to be around 0.8 V, which is higher than that of an OPV based on P3HT:PCBM (Voc ∼ 0.6 V). In their experiments, they observed an optimized PCE of 1.28% and a Voc of 0.77 V that is close to the expected value as mentioned above.
Yu et al. chemically grafted CH2OH-terminated P3HT on the carboxylic group of GO via an esterification reaction and the resultant P3HT–GO sheets were soluble in many organic solvents.249 Photoluminescence spectra showed that P3HT–GO can facilitate exciton dissociation and charge transfer, which is an advantage of using it in OPVs. Bilayer devices based on the P3HT–GO/C60 heterostructure were fabricated and showed 200% PCE enhancement than devices based on P3HT/C60. GO can enhance electron delocalization and light absorption, and lead to a large P3HT/C60 interface area, which are the main reasons for the PCE enhancement. Later, they grafted C60 on rGO sheets by a lithiation reaction as the electron acceptor in P3HT-based OPVs. Compared to a P3HT/C60 film, the absorption band of the P3HT/C60–rGO film was red shifted by 18 nm, and the light absorbance in the wavelength region of 500–650 nm was increased significantly. In comparison with OPVs based on P3HT/C60, the Jsc and PCEs of P3HT/C60–rGO devices were increased about 2 and 2.5 times, respectively, and a maximum PCE of 1.22% was obtained.250 More recently, Mahmoudi et al. grafted rGO with 1-pyrenecarboxylic acid (PCA), and yielded highly soluble rGO with a high conductivity of ∼1.52 × 105 S m−1.251 Upon incorporating rGO–PCA in active and electron transport layers of OPVs (Fig. 10a), the optimized PCE of the P3HT/rGO–PCA devices was 2.85%, which is comparable to that of the OPVs based on P3HT:PCBM, as shown in Fig. 10b.

Graphene has been used as an additive in OPVs with promising performance. In 2013, Jun et al. demonstrated an improvement of the PCE in P3HT:PCBM solar cells by incorporating charge-selective graphene flakes into the active layers.252 The graphene flakes doped by nitrogen can provide transport pathways to specific charge carriers when mixed into the active layer of OPVs. The PCEs of the resultant devices were found to have increased significantly from 3.2% to 4.5% after the addition. Meanwhile, Kim et al. added partially reduced GQDs in PTB7:PC71BM OPVs (Fig. 10c).253 Compared with devices without GQDs, the devices showed a considerable enhancement of the light absorptivity and Jsc. On the other hand, due to the metallic properties of the GQDs, charge carrier extraction in the PTB7:PC71BM devices was also enhanced, which increased the FF of the devices. The PCEs of devices thus increased from 6.7% to 7.6% with the addition of GQDs in the active layers (Fig. 10d).
4.7. Other 2D materials in OPVs
2D materials such as MoS2 have tunable bandgaps (1.2–1.8 eV for MoS2) with the change of layer numbers. On the other hand, their carrier mobilities (200–517 cm2 V−1 s−1 for MoS2) are much higher than organic semiconductors.39,254 Therefore, many 2D materials are considered to be good candidates for photovoltaic applications. For example, n-type 2D materials have been used to replace PCBM to combine with P3HT for bulk heterojunction solar cells.255,256 Shanmugam et al. prepared MoS2 nanoflakes by ultrasonicating MoS2 small crystals in acetonitrile and combined them with TiO2 and P3HT for active layers in OPVs.255 The device with a structure of ITO/TiO2/MoS2:P3HT/Au exhibited a Jsc and PCE of 4.7 mA cm−2 and 1.3%, respectively. More recently, they prepared TiO2/WS2/P3HT solar cells by the same method and showed an improved Jsc and PCE of 7.1 mA cm−2 and 2.6%, respectively.256
Some TMDs, including MoS2,35,257,258 WS2,259 NbSe2260 and TaS2,261 have been used as interlayers (HTLs or ETLs) in OPVs. Ibrahem et al. prepared 2D MoS2 and WS2 nanosheets for use as ETLs in OPVs.262 The solar cells with MoS2 and WS2 ETLs exhibited PCEs of 3.35% and 2.98%, respectively, and good stability in air. Meanwhile, Yun et al. modulated the work function of MoS2 and successfully used p- and n-type doped MoS2 films as HTL and ETL in OPVs, respectively.263 More recently, Gu et al. prepared MoS2 nanosheets by chemical exfoliation and used them as HTLs in OPVs based on PTB7:PCBM, as shown in Fig. 11.35 The MoS2 nanosheets have surface dipoles that are favorable for charge extraction and can suppress charge recombination. The resulting devices showed an average PCE of 8.11%, a little bit higher than that of a standard OPV with PEDOT:PSS HTLs.

NbSe2 nanosheets prepared by chemical exfoliation are chemically inert and have few trap states. The work function of NbSe2 is also tunable in the range of 4.4–5.9 eV depending on the layer number.260 NbSe2 was found to be an ideal candidate material for HTLs in OPVs and its surface dipoles were favorable for charge extraction in OPVs.260 A maximum PCE of 8.1% was achieved in OPVs with PTB7:PCBM as the active layer and NbSe2 as the HTL.
TaS2 has a similar structure to MoS2 and WS2, consisting of a hexagonally packed Ta atomic layer sandwiched between two layers of S atoms. It was reported that TaS2 has a low electrical resistivity of 10−3 Ω cm, which is much lower than that of MoS2 (18 Ω cm) and WS2 (0.1 Ω cm).261 TaS2 was found to be promising in application as charge transport layers in OPVs. Recently, Le et al. prepared TaS2 nanosheets by a sonication-based exfoliation method.261 The TaS2 was treated with UV-ozone, resulting in an increase of the work function from 4.4 to 4.96 eV. The pristine and UV-ozone treated TaS2 films were used as the ETL and HTL in P3HT:PCBM OPVs and exhibited PCEs of 2.73% and 3.06%, respectively.
4.8. Graphene barrier films for OPVs
Besides efficiency, the stability and lifetime of OPVs are also important for their practical applications. However, the performance of unpackaged OPVs normally degrades rapidly under ambient conditions due to the instability of conjugated polymers. So the encapsulation of the devices is critical to maintain performance. Since graphene is very stable and almost impermeable to all gases and moisture, it is a promising encapsulation material for OPVs or other optoelectronic devices that are sensitive to their ambient environment.16,264,265 As mentioned in Section 4.1, our group found that multilayer CVD graphene is impermeable to air and can be applied as an air barrier to package OPVs.131 More recently, Yamaguchi et al. reported a lifetime increase of 1300 h for OPVs with the structure of ITO/MoO3/P3HT:PCBM/Al encapsulated by a uniform and continuous rGO film (10 nm), which was attributed to the close interlayer packing and the absence of pinholes within the impermeable rGO sheets.266 The normalized PCE of the rGO-encapsulated OPV was 20% higher than that of a device without the encapsulation over the period of 50 h. Similarly, Kim et al. directly spin-coated a rGO film on an OPV based on PCDTBT:PCBM as an environment barrier.267 The lifetime of the device increased by 50% over that of the control device without rGO.
5. Schottky junction and other junction solar cells
5.1. Graphene in Schottky junction solar cells
A Schottky junction solar cell is an alternative structure for a solar cell due to its simple design, low cost and easy fabrication process. Compared to metal or ITO electrodes conventionally used in Schottky junction solar cells, CVD graphene electrodes have the advantages of low cost, easy fabrication, high transparency and mechanical flexibility.268 Therefore, in the past several years, larger-scale highly transparent graphene has been transferred on n-type silicon (n-Si) as transparent electrodes to build Schottky junction solar cells (Table 3). In 2010, Li et al. first reported such a Schottky junction solar cell with a PCE up to 1.5% (Fig. 12a).269 The CVD-graphene served as not only transparent electrodes but also anti-reflection coating layers (reduced 70% reflection) in the devices. However, the efficiencies of the devices were much lower than that of a typical Schottky junction solar cell. Afterwards, in order to further improve the device performance, Fan et al. replaced the planer Si substrate with silicon nanowires (SiNW).270 The graphene/SiNW junction had enhanced light trapping and faster carrier transport compared to the device with planar Si and showed PCEs up to 2.86%. Similar efficiencies (∼2.9%) of the devices based on a graphene/silicon-pillar-array were reported by Feng et al. as well.271

The performance of graphene/Si Schottky junction solar cells can be dramatically improved by doping the graphene layer, which will not only reduce the series resistance of the device but also enhance its built-in potential. So far, various materials have been employed for doping graphene, such as boron,272 HNO3,269,271,273–277 SOCl2,278 AuCl3,279 1-pyrenecarboxylic acid (PCA)251 and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) amide (TFSA).280,281 In 2013, Lin et al. doped graphene with HNO3, and transferred on pillar silicon for graphene/Si Schottky solar cells (Fig. 12b). The pillar silicon can reduce light reflectance by 20%. Compared with the device with undoped graphene, the series resistance of the device doped with HNO3 was decreased from 120 to 20 Ω cm2. The Schottky junction solar cell based on the HNO3 doped graphene and silicon pillar exhibited an efficiency of up to 7.7%.273 Li et al. directly synthesized multilayer graphene (MLG) by an atmospheric pressure CVD (APCVD) method. The MLG film showed a Rs of ∼500 Ω □−1 and a transparency of ∼84% and the PCE of the corresponding solar cell was 4.98%.282 Then the device was exposed to the vapor of nitric acid for doping, which decreased the Rs of the MLG film from ∼500 to ∼200 Ω □−1 and nearly doubled the PCE of the devices from 4.98% to 9.63%. They also compared the effects of SOCl2-doping and HNO3-doping on graphene and showed PCEs of 8.94% and 9.27%, respectively.283 Recently, Miao et al. doped graphene in graphene/Si Schottky junction solar cells by TFAS (Fig. 12c),281 which can increase the carrier density of graphene and decrease the series resistance of the devices. In addition, the Voc of the devices improved due to the increase in the built-in potentials at the junctions. As a result, TFSA-doping gave rise to a 3–5 times increase in PCEs of the devices (from 1.9% to 8.6%), as shown in Fig. 12d.
Recently, Xie et al. demonstrated the effect of surface modification of Si on the performance of graphene/Si Schottky junction devices.284 They found that methylation of Si could suppress the surface recombination and tune the energy alignment near the Si surface,285 which led to a remarkable improvement of device efficiency. Carrier recombination was further reduced by inserting a 10 nm P3HT layer between the graphene and Si to prevent the transfer of electrons from n-Si to the graphene anode so as to minimize the current leakage, as shown in Fig. 13a. These methods, along with an acid doping process, gave rise to a PCE as high as 10.56% (Fig. 13b). Afterwards, they replaced planar Si with Si nanoarrays (SiNAs) in the devices.286,287 The SiNAs provided a lower reflectance and a larger Schottky junction area and enhanced the light absorption and Jsc of the devices.
 Fig. 13  (a) Schematic of a few layer graphene (FLG)/Si Schottky junction solar cell with a layer of P3HT inserted between the FLG film and Si, and (b) J–V characteristics of FLG/Si Schottky junction solar cells with different P3HT layer thicknesses.284 (c) Schematic of a graphene/Si Schottky junction solar cell with a layer of TiO2 coated on the graphene film, and (d) J–V characteristics of an as-fabricated graphene/Si Schottky junction solar cell, after HNO3 vapor doping, and after TiO2 coating (combined with HNO3 doping).288 
Meanwhile, Shi et al. reported a novel graphene/Si Schottky junction device involving an antireflection TiO2 layer on a HNO3-doped graphene surface by a simple spin-coating process,288 as shown in Fig. 13c. After spin-coating the TiO2 layer, more than 30% reflected light was reduced. Consequently, the Jsc of the TiO2/graphene/Si Schottky junction device increased 30% from 23.9 to 32.5 mA cm−2 and the PCE was increased from 8.9% to 14.5% (Fig. 13d), which is the highest reported value for a graphene/Si Schottky junction solar cell to date. However, they noticed that the doping in graphene by volatile acid (HNO3) was unstable and the device performance degraded after the loss of acid, which was a major problem in practical applications.
More recently, Yang et al. demonstrated a new structure of graphene/Si Schottky junction solar cells by introducing a GO interlayer to engineer the graphene/Si interface.289 They found that the GO interlayer could effectively increase the Voc and meanwhile suppress the interface recombination of the solar cells. An optimized PCE of 6.18% was achieved for the graphene/GO/Si solar cells with undoped monolayer graphene as top electrodes. In the meantime, Jiao et al. demonstrated a Schottky junction solar cell with a structure of TiO2/graphene/GO/Si.290 The GO film was used as an interface tailor and hole-extraction material, which led to a dramatic improvement of the device PCE by >100%. The device with the HNO3-doped graphene electrode, GO interlayer and TiO2 antireflection coating showed the highest PCE of 12.3%.
Graphene was also combined with inorganic nanomaterials for Schottky junction solar cells. For example, Ye et al. patterned graphene by an ultraviolet lithography and lift-off process, then the patterned graphene was combined with CdS NWs291 or CdSe nanobelts (NBs).292 The CdS NWs/graphene and CdSe NBs/graphene Schottky junction solar cells with sizes of ∼100 μm2 showed PCEs of 1.65% and 1.25%, respectively, which may find some applications in nano-photoelectronic systems to provide electricity.
In summary, these results demonstrated that CVD-graphene is a promising material for transparent electrodes in Schottky junction solar cells. However, effective and stable doping techniques for the graphene electrodes should be further developed to improve the device performance for practical applications.
5.2. Other 2D materials in Schottky junction solar cells
It has been reported that 2D TMDs (MoS2 and WS2) can absorb up to 5–10% of incident sunlight at thickness of less than 1 nm, which is one order of magnitude higher than the light absorption of GaAs and silicon.95,293 Therefore, MoS2 and WS2 have been successfully used in Schottky junction solar cells as photoactive layers. For example, Shanmugam et al. demonstrated Schottky junction solar cells by depositing CVD grown MoS2 or WS2 films on ITO substrates as photoactive layers.294 The devices showed PCEs of ∼1.8% and effective photon absorption in the wavelength range of 350–900 nm. Ultrathin Schottky junction solar cells can also be prepared based on graphene and TMDs. For example, MoS2/graphene monolayer-based solar cells have been reported as the thinnest solar cells with ultrahigh power densities per kilogram.95 These devices have ∼1 nm thick active layers and can attain PCEs of ∼1%. Despite the relatively low efficiency compared to GaAs and Si solar cells with thicker active layers (>1 μm), the power densities per kilogram of these ultrathin devices are up to 2.5 MW kg−1, which is approximately 1–3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the best existing thin-film photovoltaic cells. Obviously, for such ultrathin solar cells, a much higher efficiency could be observed in devices with multilayer stacked films. With the same structure of graphene/Si Schottky junction devices, more recently, Tsai et al. reported photovoltaic devices with a CVD MoS2 monolayer on p-type silicon (p-Si) substrates (Fig. 14a and b), giving rise to a short circuit current of 23.36 mA cm−2 (Fig. 14c) and an efficiency of 5.23%.295 The MoS2 monolayer could absorb light and showed a significant contribution in the EQE spectrum of the device below 680 nm (Fig. 14d).
 Fig. 14  (a) Schematic diagram; (b) band structure; (c) J–V characteristic and (d) EQE spectrum of a MoS2/p-Si heterojunction solar cell.288 
Cobalt sulfide (CoS), another transition-metal chalcogenide with a high conductivity, has been successfully used in many kinds of energy device.296,297 Fang et al. demonstrated that 2D CoS nanosheets can dramatically enhance the PCE of Si/PEDOT:PSS Schottky junction solar cells from 9.5% to 11.2%.298 CoS nanosheets can lead to increased conductivity and a higher work function level of PEDOT:PSS films, which will enhance the hole transport and increase the built-in potential in Si/PEDOT:PSS devices. Meanwhile, it was found that charge recombination in the devices was suppressed in the presence of CoS nanosheets. It is notable that study in this area has just started. With the development in synthesis and functionalization techniques of 2D materials, much higher performance of solar cells based on 2D materials is expected in the near future.
5.3. 2D materials in p–n junction or heterojunction photovoltaic devices
p–n junctions are essential building blocks for traditional silicon solar cells and organic solar cells. In the former, p- and n-type silicon regions are formed by phosphorous and boron doping, respectively. In the latter, p- and n-type regions are formed by using p-type polymers and n-type small molecules. Most recently, p–n junctions based on 2D materials such as graphene and TMDs have been prepared for optoelectronic applications due to their great potential in flexible and semitransparent devices. Graphene p–n junctions can be fabricated by having p- and n-type doping in different areas. However, these junctions cannot exhibit diode-like rectification behavior and high photovoltaic performance due to the zero bandgap of graphene.299,300 So it is more suitable to choose other semiconducting 2D materials, such as black phosphorus, which has a tunable direct bandgap from 1.51 eV for monolayer to 0.3 eV for bulk. Recently, Buscema et al. transferred hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and few-layer black phosphorus on a pair of gates as dielectric and p–n junction layers, respectively.301 The gates were used to control the charge carrier types (p- and n-type) in different regions of black phosphorus. Another two electrodes were deposited on the black phosphorus layer as source and drain electrodes for measurements. The black phosphorus p–n junction device showed an ideality factor of 1.96 and a current modulation of more than 104. A significant photocurrent and open circuit voltage were also observed due to the photovoltaic effect of the p–n junction, leading to a maximum EQE of 0.1% at 640 nm and energy harvesting up to the near-infrared region.
Although bulk TMDs are indirect semiconductors, their monolayers normally exhibit direct bandgaps that fulfill the requirement for p–n junction photovoltaic devices. It has been demonstrated that combining monolayer TMDs with a lateral p–n junction architecture by electrostatic doping could also lead to electrically tunable photovoltaic effects (Fig. 15a). For example, Baugher et al. demonstrated an electrically tunable lateral p–n junction based on mechanically exfoliated monolayer WSe2.302 As shown in Fig. 15b, the junction shows a strongly rectified current with an ideality factor of 1.9 and a rectification ratio of 105, which is also direction selectable through independently reversing the voltages of the two gates (±10 V). A bias voltage is applied between the source and drain to measure the photoresponse of the WSe2 p–n junction. At high bias, the junction produces a large photocurrent with a responsivity of 210 mA W−1. At low bias, the junction generates electric power via the photovoltaic effect, with a peak EQE of 0.2% at 522 nm (Fig. 15c and d). Meanwhile, a WSe2 p–n junction with a similar device structure was prepared by Pospischil et al.; by applying higher opposite gate voltages (±40 V), the p–n junction device shows an ideality factor of 2.6 and a PCE of ∼0.5%, which is comparable to that reported for bulk WSe2 p–n junctions (η ∼ 0.1–0.5%).303

Deng et al. demonstrated a gate-tunable p–n heterojunction based on p-type black phosphorus and n-type monolayer MoS2.304 The heterojunction shows a maximum rectification ratio of ∼105 under a back gate voltage of −30 V, a maximum responsivity of 418 mA W−1 and an EQE of 0.3% at wavelength of 633 nm. These p–n junction or heterojunction photovoltaic devices mentioned above can be operated by electrostatically controlling the doping in 2D semiconductors. However, extra electric power needs to be applied when they are used as photovoltaic devices, which is unpractical for real applications.
2D TMD heterojunctions have recently emerged as a new class of structure for novel optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications, because the photoexcited excitons in TMD heterojunctions can transfer very fast, which will facilitate efficient electron–hole separation for light detection and harvesting.305 Cheng et al. vertically stacked p-type monolayer WSe2 and n-type few-layer MoS2 for a p–n heterojunction, as shown in Fig. 16a.306 The monolayer WSe2 was prepared by a CVD method on a Si/SiO2 substrate, then a MoS2 flake was exfoliated onto the WSe2 film by mechanical exfoliation. The scanning photocurrent measurement shows that the p–n heterojunction was formed over the entire overlapping region of WSe2 and MoS2 with a maximum EQE of 12% (Fig. 16b). Meanwhile, Lee et al. fabricated graphene sandwiched p-WSe2–n-MoS2 heterojunctions with different layer numbers.34 The measured EQEs at 532 nm were 2.4%, 12% and 34% for monolayer, bilayer and multilayer WSe2–MoS2 heterojunctions, respectively. The spectral photoresponse indicated that both WSe2 and MoS2 layers generate excitons and contribute to the photocurrent. Similarly, Wi et al. reported a p–n heterojunction type MoS2 photovoltaic device with a structure of ITO/pristine MoS2/plasma-doped MoS2/Au, as shown in Fig. 16c.307 The pristine and plasma treated multilayer MoS2 flakes (10–140 nm) were prepared by exfoliating a bulk MoS2 ingot. The photovoltaic device based on the whole MoS2 active layer exhibited a PCE of 2.8% and Jsc of 20.9 mA cm−2 (Fig. 16d).

So far, 2D based p–n junction or heterojunction photovoltaic devices with small sizes have often been prepared by mechanical exfoliation of monolayers or multilayers from their bulk counterparts, and show low photovoltaic efficiencies. Therefore, the growth of large-scale and high quality 2D materials is urgently required for the realization of 2D-based photovoltaic devices with a larger size and higher efficiency.
6. DSSCs
A DSSC, a type of thin-film solar cell, is normally based on a semiconductor (e.g. TiO2) modified with a photosensitive dye and an electrolyte.308 DSSCs have received much attention because of their low cost, convenient manufacturing process, and comparable efficiency to polycrystalline silicon solar cells. However, the high cost of platinum-based counter electrodes (Pt-CEs) and FTO-based transparent electrodes normally used in DSSCs are obstacles to the commercialization of this technology.309 Thus, it is necessary to explore new electrode materials to replace FTO and noble metals. Recently, much progress has been made in the applications of graphene in photoanodes and CEs in DSSCs.310 Graphene-based electrodes have shown many advantages, including a high transparency, large specific surface area, high conductivity, and remarkable flexibility, over conventional electrodes used in DSSCs. The performance of DSSCs based on graphene electrodes reported recently is summarized in Table 3.
6.1. Graphene photoanodes
The application of graphene as the photoanode in DSSCs has been studied since 2008. Wang et al. first revealed the possibility of employing rGO as the photoanode in DSSCs (Fig. 17a).107 The rGO electrode was prepared by dip coating aqueous rGO on a quartz substrate, which exhibited a transparency of ∼60% in the wavelength range from 500 to 3000 nm and a conductivity of 550 S cm−1. However, the DSSC showed a PCE of only 0.26% due to the low conductivity of the rGO electrode. Therefore, the rGO film cannot replace FTO as a photoanode in high-performance DSSCs. On the other hand, due to its high electron mobility, high transparency and large specific surface area, graphene can be incorporated into a TiO2 matrix to enhance electron transport and reduce charge recombination in DSSCs, leading to improved device performance.311–313 For example, Yang et al. composited rGO with TiO2 nanoparticles as the photoanode for DSSCs,314 as shown in Fig. 17b. The Jsc and PCE (η = 6.97%) of the devices increased by 45% and 39% respectively, compared with that of the device with pure TiO2 (η = 5.01%). In 2014, Liu et al. uniformly composited graphene with TiO2 nanoparticles as the photoanode in DSSCs.315 After thermal treatment at 400 °C for several hours, the interface between the graphene and TiO2 was well formed. The device showed a PCE of 8.25%, which increased by 65% in comparison with that of a device with TiO2 only.

6.2. Graphene counter electrodes (CEs)
In DSSCs, CEs play the important role of injecting electrons into electrolytes and restoring the redox couple (from I3− to I−). An ideal CE should simultaneously possess both high conductivity and considerable electrochemical activity.316 Conventional CEs used in DSSCs are made of Pt, which possesses superior catalytic activity and high conductivity. However, Pt-CEs are unsuitable for the mass production of DSSCs due to the scarce source and high cost. Carbonaceous materials, such as carbon black,317 carbon nanofibers,318,319 carbon nanotubes,320,321 and mesoporous carbon,322 were under intensive investigations in recent years for their low cost and high electrical conductivity and catalytic activity. Compared with conventional carbonaceous materials, graphene and its derivatives show much better optical transparency and mechanical flexibility and have thus attracted much research interest in replacing Pt as the CE.
rGO has been successfully used as the CE in DSSCs (Table 3). In 2008, Xu et al. spin-coated 1-pyrenebutyrate functionalized rGO on FTO as the CE in a DSSC.323 However, the devices showed PCEs of only 2.2%, which was much lower than that of a control device with a Pt-CE due to the high Rs of the functionalized rGO. In order to improve the performance of DSSCs, Hong et al. composited rGO with PEDOT:PSS as the CE for DSSCs, which showed higher PCEs up to 4.5%.324
Graphene CEs with 3D structures that possess large specific surface areas have been successfully used in DSSCs. In 2011, Zhang et al. screen-printed rGO dispersion onto FTO as CEs for DSSCs, as shown in Fig. 17c. The annealed rGO film presented an unusual 3D network structure.325 It was found that the special 3D structure was beneficial for charge transfer at the electrode–electrolyte interface due to the enlarged effective reaction area. DSSCs with the 3D rGO CEs showed PCEs of 6.81%, being comparable to that of a control device with a Pt-CE (η = 7.59%), as shown in Fig. 17d. In 2012, Lee et al. reported the use of CVD grown 3D graphene as the CE in DSSCs and showed a PCE of 5.2%.326 Recently, Wang et al. synthesized graphene sheets with a 3D honeycomb-like structure by a simple reaction between Li2O and CO.327 These graphene sheets exhibited excellent catalytic activity as CEs of DSSCs and PCEs as high as 7.8% were achieved. In 2014, Wei et al. synthesized a 3D cauliflower fungus-like graphene (CFG) by a reaction between Li liquid and CO2 gas.328 The CFG showed high conductivity and catalytic activity, and excellent performance as the CE for a DSSC, leading to a PCE as high as 8.1%, which is much higher than that of the first DSSC with a regular graphene CE reported by Xu et al.323 and even better than that of the DSSCs with Pt-CEs.
In order to improve the conductivity of graphene-based CEs in DSSCs, graphene has been combined with some other conductive materials such as CNTs,329,330 Pt NPs,331,332 Ni NPs333,334 and Ag NPs335 for hybrid CEs. For example, Yang et al. used composite rGO with CNTs as hybrid CEs of DSSCs, in which the CNTs can bridge graphene flakes to increase the conductivity of the electrodes.336 The DSSCs with rGO–CNT hybrid CEs showed PCEs up to 8.23%. In 2014, Yeh et al. synthesized Pt NPs (2–5 nm) on graphene by using a polyol reduction method.331 The graphene–Pt NP hybrid films with different amounts (10–60%) of Pt NPs were prepared and used as CEs in DSSCs. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis revealed that the Pt NPs on graphene actually decreased the charge-transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface and increased the electrocatalytic activity of graphene. The DSSCs with the graphene–Pt NP (20%) CE showed the highest PCE of 8.79%. Meanwhile, Bi et al. synthesized a novel quasi core–shell structure of cobalt sulfide (CoS)–N-doped graphene (NG),337 which showed high catalytic activity and conductivity owing to the close interactions between the core (CoS) and the shell (NG). The DSSCs based on the core–shell CoS–NG CEs showed a PCE of 10.7%, which is the highest reported efficiency for DSSCs based on Pt-free CEs so far.
Another method for improving the performance of DSSCs based on graphene CEs is to enhance the electrochemical catalytic activity of graphene. So far, various approaches have been developed. One method is to introduce oxygen-containing functional groups to the graphene (Fig. 18a).338–340 For example, Roy-Mayhew et al. found that the catalytic activity of graphene increased with the increasing density of oxygen-containing groups.339 However, the conductivity of graphene decreased dramatically when the oxygen content was too high. Later, Das et al. covalently attached C–OH, C(O)OH and NO3− moieties to graphene by using HNO3.340 The covalently attached groups can cause the enrichment of the electrocatalytic active sites and facilitate charge transfer from the graphene CE to redox couples.

The second approach is to dope or co-dope heteroatoms (N,341,342 B,343,344 S,345 F346) into the graphene basal plane, which may lead to less damage in the conductivity of graphene. Xue et al. prepared 3D N-doped graphene foams (N-GFs) and used them as a metal-free CE in DSSCs.347 N atoms were introduced by annealing the freeze-dried graphene oxide foams (GOF) in ammonia, as shown in Fig. 18b, which can enhance the catalytic activity of graphene and meanwhile maintain its conductivity. The DSSCs with N-GF CEs showed PCEs as high as 7.07%, which is comparable to that of a DSSC with a Pt-CE (η = 7.44%) and much higher than that of a device with an undoped graphene electrode (η = 4.84%). Similar results were reported by other research groups.348,349
The third method is to decorate graphene by a nitrogen-containing polyelectrolyte. In 2013, Xu et al. reported a layer-by-layer (LBL) assembling technique to fabricate poly(diallydimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) decorated GO thin films,350 as shown in Fig. 18c. The electrostatic interaction between the quaternary N of PDDA and the COO− like groups of GO would render GO-based CEs high catalytic activities toward the reduction of I3−. DSSCs with CEs of PDDA decorated GO exhibited PCEs up to 9.54% (Fig. 18d), which is even higher than that of a control device with a Pt electrode (η = 9.14%). The considerable enhancement in the PCE of the DSSCs was mainly attributed to the high electrochemical catalytic activities of GO which arises from the electron-withdrawing ability of PDDA.
The above DSSCs are mostly based on redox electrolytes with I3−/I−, which have a low redox potential of ca. 0.35 V vs the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), and have some disadvantages such as low Voc, visible light absorption and corrosive effects with some metals.351,352 Although I3−/I− is the dominant redox couple in typical DSSCs, the PCEs of DSSCs based on I3−/I− are often less than 10%.353 Another redox system Co(bpy)33+/2+ with a redox potential of ca. 0.56 V vs. SHE has been explored for DSSCs, which showed PCEs up to 12.3%.354,355 Graphene-based CEs have been confirmed to have superior catalytic activities towards Co(bpy)33+/2+ redox couples.356–358 In 2011, Kavan et al. employed solution processable graphene CEs in such DSSCs and found that the graphene electrodes had better electrocatalytic activity to Co(bpy)33+/2+ redox in comparison with a Pt electrode, which could be attributable to the lower charge transfer resistance (RCT) at the graphene/electrolyte interface (graphene-CE: 3.3 Ω cm2, Pt-CE: 5.5 Ω cm2).357 The resulting DSSC showed a higher PCE (η = 9.4%) than that of a device with a standard Pt-CE (η = 8.2%). Similar results were recently reported by Ju et al., who used a nitrogen-doped graphene nanoplatelet film as the CE in DSSCs and obtained PCEs higher than 10%.359,360 Meanwhile, they prepared edge-carboxylated graphene nanoplatelets (ECGNPs) by the simple and eco-friendly ball-milling of graphite.361 They found that ECGNP (RCT: 0.87 Ω cm2) has higher catalytic activity to the Co(bpy)33+/2+ redox couple than other materials such as Pt (RCT: 2.19 Ω cm2), rGO (RCT: 1.21 Ω cm2) and PEDOT:PSS (RCT: 2.63 Ω cm2). Furthermore, the ECGNP CE exhibited better electrochemical stability under a prolonged cycling potential than that of the Pt, rGO and PEDOT:PSS counterparts.
In addition, semitransparent DSSCs that could be illuminated from both the front and rear sides have been prepared using graphene CEs. For example, Dao et al. synthesized Pt NPs (1–2.5 nm) on CVD grown graphene by a using dry plasma reduction method near room temperature under atmospheric pressure, which had a transmittance of ∼80%.362 The DSSC with the Pt NPs/graphene electrode showed PCEs of 6.55% and 5.17% illuminated from the front and rear sides, respectively. Similarly, Shih et al. prepared a hybrid film by synthesizing Pt NPs (4–10 nm) on graphene nanoplatelets for use as the CE in a DSSC, which showed PCEs of 8.0% and 7.0% from the front and rear sides, respectively.363
Being similar to OPVs, graphene has been successfully used in flexible DSSCs. The composites of graphene with polymers364 or carbon nanotubes,365 and graphene fibers366 or ribbons367 have been reported as flexible CEs in DSSCs. Lee et al. prepared a flexible CE by spin-coating PEDOT:PSS on a graphene/PET substrate, which showed not only superior electrochemical activity but also excellent conductivity,364 as shown in Fig. 18e. Moreover, the flexible DSSCs showed excellent performance even under bending conditions. In 2011, Li et al. prepared an all-carbon electrode by growing vertically aligned carbon nanotubes on a free-standing graphene paper, which resulted in a PCE of 6.05% in the device.365 More recently, Yang et al. have developed a novel wire-shaped DSSC with a graphene fiber electrodeposited with Pt NPs as a CE and a titanium wire impregnated with titania nanotubes as a working electrode (Fig. 18f).366 The graphene fiber exhibited high flexibility, mechanical strength (102–103 MPa) and electrical conductivity (102–103 S cm−1), which resulted in the recorded PCE of 8.45% for fiber-shaped DSSCs.
6.3. Other 2D materials as CEs
Promisingly, some other 2D materials, such as MoS2,368,369 MoSe2,370 FeS2,371 CoS, CoSe372 and NiSe,372 have been used as efficient CEs with remarkable stability. For example, Al-Mamun et al. grew MoS2 films on FTO substrates by a facile one-pot hydrothermal method.368 The resulting MoS2 films exhibited high electrocatalytic activity and were directly used as CEs for DSSCs, which showed the higher PCE of 7.41% compared to DSSCs with Pt-CEs (η = 7.13%). To further improve the electrocatalytic activity of MoS2, it can be composited with carbon materials, such as graphene,373,374 CNTs375 and porous carbon.376 Recently, Yue et al. prepared a porous MoS2–carbon hybrid film by using an in situ hydrothermal route.376 The MoS2–carbon CE possesses low charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte–electrode interface, high electrocatalytic activity and fast reaction for the reduction of I3−, which is attributed to the high specific surface area and the unique structure of the MoS2–carbon composited film. The PCEs of the DSSCs were up to 7.69%. In 2014, Lee et al. prepared few layer MoSe2 by surface selenization of Mo-coated soda-lime glass.370 The MoSe2/Mo substrate was used to replace the commonly used Pt/FTO substrate in DSSCs. The results showed that few-layer MoSe2 displayed high catalytic efficiency for the reduction of I3−, leading to a PCE of 9.0%.
Gong et al. in situ grew 2D metal selenides (Co0.85Se and Ni0.85Se) on FTO by a low-temperature hydrothermal method and directly used them as CEs in DSSCs,372 as shown in Fig. 19. The graphene-like Co0.85Se exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity than Pt for the reduction of I3−, and the resulting DSSC achieved a PCE of 9.4% versus 8.64% for a control device with a typical Pt-CE.

7. Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells and other inorganic solar cells
Similarly, graphene is promising for application as transparent electrodes or charge transport materials in some inorganic solar cells, such as QD sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). In 2010, Guo et al. hybridized graphene with CdS QDs, prepared photovoltaic devices with a novel multilayer graphene–CdS QD structure on ITO and showed incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of the devices up to 16%.377
Functionalized graphene can be used as both the photoanode and CE in QDSSCs.102,378,379 For example, Zhu et al. incorporated graphene frameworks (GFs) into TiO2 photoanodes as the electron transport medium to improve the performance of CdS/CdSe QDSCCs.380 It is found that the GF/TiO2 electrode has a shorter electron transport time, longer electron lifetime and diffusion path length than those of conventional 2D graphene sheets/TiO2. A PCE of 4.2% was obtained in the QDSSC with the GF/TiO2 photoanode, which was higher than those of the QDSSCs with a TiO2 photoanode (η = 3.17%) or a 2D graphene sheet/TiO2 photoanode (η = 3.58%). Meanwhile, Ye et al. wrapped Cu2S by rGO via a one-step solvothermal process.381 The rGO–Cu2S hybrid film was used as the CE in CdS/CdSe QDSSCs, which showed better electrocatalytic activity, greater stability, lower charge-transfer resistance and higher exchange current density in comparison with Pt or Cu2S electrodes. The QDSSCs based on rGO–Cu2S CEs showed η = 3.85%, higher than those of devices with Pt (2.14%) or Cu2S (η = 3.39%) electrodes.
Graphene has been used as transparent electrodes in solar cells based on PbS QDs.382 For example, Park et al. used CVD-graphene as the cathode for PbS-based hybrid solar cells.209 After coating a layer of PEDOT:PEG on graphene, ZnO nanowires were grown on the graphene as an acceptor, and then PbS QDs were spin-coated on ZnO nanowires as a donor. The optimized PCE of the devices was 4.2%, which was comparable to the performance of the devices with ITO electrodes (η = 5.1%).
Meanwhile, graphene has been employed as transparent electrodes in conventional high-efficiency inorganic solar cells. In 2011, Bi et al. used multilayer CVD graphene as transparent electrodes in devices with the structure of graphene/ZnO/CdS/CdTe/(graphite paste), which showed an optimized PCE of 4.17%.383 In order to improve the device performance, boron-doped graphene was employed as electrodes in CdS/CdTe solar cells by the same group.384 The boron-doped graphene has better conductivity and a higher work function, resulting in a PCE of 7.86%. Afterwards, they prepared 3D graphene networks on Ni foams by a CVD method and employed the 3D graphene as electrodes in CdS/CdTe solar cells, which led to an improved PCE of 9.1% due to the high conductivity of the 3D graphene.385 In 2012, they further improved the performance of CdS/CdTe solar cells by using Cu NWs-doped graphene as transparent electrodes and showed a maximum PCE of 12.1% and good thermal stability.386
In 2014, Yin et al. first used a doped graphene to replace ZnO:Al (AZO) electrodes in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells.387 Compared with the CIGS solar cells with AZO electrodes, the devices with graphene electrodes showed a decreased reflectance and enhanced quantum efficiency in the near infrared region. By optimizing the contact between graphene and the intrinsic ZnO (i-ZnO), a high PCE of 13.5% was achieved, which is comparable to that of a device with an AZO electrode (η = 14.9%). Moreover, the graphene film can protect the active layer from moisture damage, leading to a much better stability than that of a standard CIGS solar cell, similar to the packaging effect of OPVs reported before.194
8. Perovskite solar cells
Perovskite solar cells based on hybrid organic–inorganic methylammonium lead halide perovskites have attracted much attention recently due to their large light absorption coefficient,388 high charge carrier mobility,389 long carrier diffusion length390 and high efficiency. In the past 5 years, their efficiencies have skyrocketed from 3.8% to 19.3%,390–392 making it possible to replace conventional photovoltaic devices based on crystalline silicon in commercial applications. In normal perovskite solar cells, CH3NH3PbI3 or CH3NH3PbI3−xClx is deposited on a submicrometer-thick mesoporous or planar TiO2 film as a light absorber, TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD act as the ETL and HTL, respectively. Similar to the cases in other types of photovoltaic devices, it is obvious that graphene can find important applications in perovskite solar cells. For example, a TiO2 film requires high-temperature processing to increase it crystallinity and charge carrier mobility so adding graphene into it can not only increase its conductivity and mobility but also decrease its treatment temperature, which has been utilized in DSSCs as well.393 On the other hand, the spiro-OMeTAD HTL is expensive and unstable in air, which is the bottleneck for realizing cost effective and stable perovskite devices. GO is stable in air, and can be prepared on a large scale, which has been effectively used as HTL in OPVs.237 So it can also be applied as the HTL to replace spiro-OMeTAD in perovskite solar cells.
In 2013, Wang et al. composited graphene nanoflakes with TiO2 nanoparticles as the electron collection layer in perovskite solar cells, as shown in Fig. 20a.394 The appropriate work function of graphene nanoflakes (4.4 eV) reduced the energy barrier between TiO2 (4.2 eV) and FTO (4.5 eV) and led to better electron collection in TiO2 (Fig. 20b). On the other hand, the superior charge mobility of graphene nanoflakes provided the high electrical conductivity of the graphene–TiO2 composites (Fig. 20c). Moreover, graphene nanoflakes enable the entire device to be fabricated at a temperature no higher than 150 °C, and the solar cells based on graphene–TiO2 composites showed a remarkable photovoltaic performance with a PCE up to 15.6% (Fig. 20d). Later, Zhu et al. inserted a thin GQD layer between the TiO2 film and the perovskite layer in the devices.395 Upon the addition of GQDs, a strong quenching of perovskite photoluminescence was observed at about 760 nm, and the PCE of the device was improved from 8.81% to 10.15%, which were attributed to the shortened electron extraction time with the presence of GQDs (90–106 ps). More recently, Wu et al. spun GO films on ITO as the HTL for inverted perovskite solar cells. The GO film can efficiently extract holes out of perovskite, facilitate the formation of homogenous large domains and improve surface coverage of the perovskite. The perovskite film grown on GO showed high quality crystallization and a preferential in plane orientation of the (110) plane, which resulted in high mobilities in perovkite films to facilitate the exciton separation and extraction. The inverted device with CH3NH3PbI3−xClx as the absorber and GO as the HTL achieved a champion PCE of 12.4%.396

(d) J–V characteristics of the perovskite solar cells with different electron collection layers under solar irradiation (solid line) and in the dark (dotted line).394 
As reviewed in other sections, graphene can replace FTO or opaque metal as the anode or cathode to realize flexible or semitransparent devices. However, until now, there is no report on applying graphene as transparent electrodes in perovskite solar cells, which is expected in the near future.
9. Conclusions and outlook
In summary, functionalized graphene and other 2D materials have been successfully used in photovoltaic devices, including OPVs, Schottky junction solar cells, DSSCs, perovskite solar cells, quantum dot-sensitized solar cells and other inorganic solar cells. The most important application of graphene in photovoltaic devices is for transparent electrodes that may replace conventional ITO or FTO transparent electrodes due to its high conductivity and transparency. On the other hand, GO and functionalized GO are promising interfacial materials for OPVs, Schottky junction solar cells and perovskite solar cells, which lead to a pronounced improvement of device performance including efficiency, lifetime and stability. Moreover, other unique properties of graphene including excellent mechanical flexibility, a large specific surface area, high electrocatalytic activity and gas impermeability make graphene promising in many specific applications, such as flexible electrodes, packaging layers and as a charge transport medium for solar cells. Other 2D materials have also shown outstanding properties in charge transfer, electrocatalytic activity and light absorption, and have been successfully used as interlayers, active layers and CEs in several types of solar cells.
Although dramatic progress has been made in this field, photovoltaic applications of 2D materials are still at the early stage. Great challenges exist in commercializing photovoltaic devices with 2D materials because of the following critical issues yet to be solved. First of all, to achieve highly conductive, transparent and low cost graphene electrodes, synthesis methods should be optimized and further developed to improve the quality of graphene and decrease the cost, and the doping techniques being compatible with the fabrication process of solar cells should be explored to realize high charge carrier densities, good stability and tunable Fermi energy levels in graphene. CVD methods are an important approach to preparing high-quality and large-area graphene for high performance optoelectronic devices and the preparation conditions, especially the carbon sources and substrates, should be further studied. Massively produced graphene derivatives (rGO or GO) from bulk graphite allow for the industrial-scale fabrication of electrodes or charge transport layers for photovoltaic devices. However, the conductivity of GO or rGO films is significantly lower than that of high-quality graphene, thus novel doping techniques for GO-based composite materials should be investigated.
For OPVs, graphene has been successfully used as transparent electrodes (cathode and anode), interlayers (HTL and ETL) and as an additive for enhancing charge transfer. In addition, considering OPV is unstable in air, graphene and GO films can provide encapsulation of the device. The main challenge of using graphene in OPVs as transparent electrodes is the preparation of large-area devices by a solution process. The realization of high efficiency large-area devices lies on the high conductivity and the solution processability of graphene electrodes. To have a high fill factor of the devices, the sheet resistance of the graphene electrodes is better to be less than 10 Ω □−1. Large-area CVD graphene can be prepared and transferred by a roll-to-roll process, which however has been rarely used in the fabrication of OPVs probably due to some technical difficulties. It is notable that the hydrophobic surface of graphene makes it difficult to uniformly coat organic solutions on the top. Thus, lots of surface modification techniques have been developed to make graphene compatible with solution processable OPVs. Another issue that should be noted is the poor stability of doped graphene by certain acid or ions, which should be avoided in its applications in OPVs.
For DSSCs, graphene has been successfully used as both the photoanode and CE. Besides the high conductivity and transparency, the high electrocatalytic activity of graphene plays a key role in many devices. In terms of the device fabrication, it is much easier to incorporate graphene electrodes in DSSCs than in OPVs due to the electrolytes used in the former. Therefore, various graphene-based composite electrodes which synergize with other functional materials have been the main trend in using graphene in DSSCs. For other photovoltaic devices, including Schottky junction solar cells, quantum dot-sensitized solar cells and perovskite solar cells, graphene has shown similar advantages in fast charge transfer and high transparency. High-efficiency perovskite solar cells have been a hot topic in recent years. However, the application of graphene transparent electrodes in perovskite solar cells has been rarely reported until now, which will be an important technique to be studied due to the great possibility of commercializing perovskite solar cells in the near future.
It is notable that the application of other 2D materials in photovoltaic devices has been studied for only two years. Several materials, including MoS2, WS2, FeS2, MoSe2, WSe2, CoS, CoSe, NiSe and so on, have been used in solar cells. Considering the big family of 2D materials currently studied, many other 2D materials could be tested in the future. Some advantages have been found in their application as interlayers (HTL and ETL) which can enhance charge transfer from the active layer to the electrodes. In addition, given the same thickness, the light absorption of some 2D materials (e.g. MoS2, WS2) is higher than that of conventional bulk semiconductors and thus ultrathin solar cells can be realized based on them. However, there are many challenges in using the 2D materials for practical photovoltaic applications, including the fabrication of large-area devices and the way of improving the efficiency, which are expected to be solved by using more suitable materials and optimizing the device design and fabrication techniques, such as the preparation of multilayer 2D material photovoltaic devices.
