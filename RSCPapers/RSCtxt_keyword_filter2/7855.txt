    , Accepted 5th January 2015First published on 6th January 2015AbstractHerein, we report the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼3.71%, achieved in a mesoporous SnO2 based solar cell by introducing 15 wt% of 3D porous hierarchical MgO composed of 2D nanosheets by a simple sonochemical route followed by a mixing process, sensitized with a metal-free carbazole dye, namely, 2-cyano-3-(4-(2-(9-p-tolyl-9H-fluoren-6-yl)vinyl)phenyl)acrylic acid (i.e. SK1 dye). We have optimized the performance of solar cell devices with the addition of MgO and performed a comparative study on photovoltaic performances of the fabricated devices, such as SnO2–MgO with pristine SnO2, by employing two different redox mediators, namely, (I−/I3−) and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+. We observed a significant improvement in the open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) for the SnO2–MgO based dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) over the pristine SnO2 device, i.e. from 357 mV to 550 mV and from ∼38% to ∼50% respectively, wherein an ∼60% enhancement in PCE for the SnO2–MgO device as compared to bare SnO2 device using the redox mediator (I−/I3−) is achieved. Interestingly, in the case of cobalt tris(2,2′-bipyridyl) redox shuttle, we observed further improvement in the PCE value of the photovoltaic device by 74%, i.e. from ∼1% (pristine SnO2 device, redox mediator I−/I3−) to ∼3.71% (SnO2–MgO device). From electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the devices, we conclude that the charge transfer resistance at the SnO2–MgO/SK1/electrolyte interfaces is lower as compared to SnO2/SK1/electrolyte interfaces, which demonstrates faster charge migration across the interfaces and a slower electron–hole (e−–h+) recombination rate. It was observed that in the presence of MgO, the life time of photoinduced electrons in the conduction band (CB) of SnO2 microspheres increases to τe = 15.9 ms from 7.1 ms (for pristine SnO2 device), by employing [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ as a redox shuttle, and thus resulting in higher values of open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current density (Jsc). Therefore, hierarchical MgO not only improves the PCE of the photovoltaic devices by minimizing the leakage of trapped electrons in the conduction band level of SnO2/electrolyte interface but also provides more surface area for the adsorption of dye molecules.
Introduction
Low-cost fabrication techniques for the photovoltaic devices have attracted significant attention amongst the scientific community since the first report on the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) in 1991 by O'Regan and Grätzel.1,2 DSSC's working principle is based on efficient visible light absorption by dye molecules on the surface of a wide band gap metal oxide semiconductor and generation of photoexcited electrons followed by their injection into the conduction band (CB) of metal oxide. Moreover, a suitable redox couple, such as I−/I3− (redox potential 0.35 V), [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ (redox potential 0.56 V), [Co(dmb)3]3+/2+ (redox potential 0.43 V) and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) (redox potential 0.80 V), completes the transport cycle in DSSCs by regenerating the oxidized dye molecules.3–5 Numerous wide band gap semiconductors, such as ZnO,6 Nb2O5,7 SnO2,8–10 and SrTiO3,11 have been explored as an alternative to TiO2 in DSSCs. Among these semiconductors, the use of SnO2 over TiO2 has two main advantages: (i) SnO2 has an electron mobility of (∼100–200 cm2 V−1 s−1),12 considerably higher than that of anatase TiO2 (0.1–1 cm2 V−1 s−1)13 or porous TiO2 (∼10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1),14 which leads to the faster transport of photo-injected electrons to FTO (ii) formation of fewer oxidative holes in the valence band under UV illumination due to its wider band gap (3.6 eV) than that of anatase TiO2 (3.2 eV), thus minimizing the rate of dye degradation.15 In spite of these advantages, to date, the DSSCs based on SnO2 have lower energy conversion efficiency than those based on TiO2. The poor performance of the SnO2 based DSSCs is due to the faster electron recombination and back electron transfer to the redox shuttle due to reactive low energy trap states in SnO2 and minimal dye adsorption because of its low isoelectric point (pH 4–5).16,17 To overcome these drawbacks, engineering of SnO2 nanoparticle (NP) surface with barrier layers, such as ZnO,18,19 TiO2,20 and MgO,21,22 have been implemented to improve the power conversion efficiency. In principle, these barrier layers could passivate the reactive surface states in SnO2 and slow down the electron interception process. Grätzel et al. modified the SnO2 electrodes with a thin layer of high band gap metal oxides, such as ZnO, TiO2, ZrO2, MgO, Al2O3, and Y2O3, and employed them as photoanodes in DSSCs. They observed a significant improvement in open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) after the modifications.21 In addition, Hupp et al. investigated the photovoltaic properties of surface modified SnO2 photoelectrodes with Al2O3 and observed a 5-fold increment of PCE over the pristine SnO2 device.23 A photoanode with a thin MgO layer on SnO2 nanoparticles is of particular interest because it enhances the photovoltaic device performance of pristine SnO2 from 1% to 7% in some cases.15,21,22 The wide band gap metal oxide shells have an unfathomable impact on the solar cell performance parameters because they can affect innumerable characteristics of a photoanode such as dye loading, charge recombination, photoinduced electron transfer and conduction band edge position.24,25 The characteristics of a highly efficient photoanode to be used in DSSC requires high surface area for dye loading and densely packed microstructures as well for fast electron diffusion and light scattering. To satisfy these requirements, considerable efforts have been made to develop a wide band gap semiconductor oxide by controlling the size, shape and surface morphology. A number of 1D and 2D SnO2 nanostructures, such as nanowires and nanorod arrays, have been applied to improve photovoltaic properties due to their faster electron diffusion.26 However, less exposed surface area provided by these nanostructures for the adsorption of sensitizer molecules limits the light absorption, and thus the power conversion efficiency more than that of 3D structures. Porous 3D SnO2 structures provide higher surface area for the adsorption of sensitizer molecules along with better light scattering effects to harvest the solar energy and facilitate the electrolyte diffusion process to regenerate the oxidized species. Different SnO2 architectures, such as hierarchical microspheres,27 nanoflowers,28 multilayered SnO2 hollow microspheres,29 and coral-like porous SnO2 hollow architecture,30 composed of 1D and 2D structures have been synthesized and have been demonstrated as suitable materials with improved power conversion efficiency in DSSCs.
Herein, we demonstrate the effect of porous hierarchical MgO composed of 2D nanosheets on the photovoltaic characteristics of 3D microstructures of SnO2 by a simple sonication followed by mixing process and sensitized with a metal free carbazole dye, namely, 2-cyano-3-(4-(2-(9-p-tolyl-9H-fluoren-6-yl)vinyl)phenyl)acrylic acid, (i.e., SK1 dye). We have optimized the amount of MgO to be added to SnO2 for achieving the maximum performance of the photovoltaic devices and made a comparative study of the SnO2–MgO with pristine SnO2 devices by employing two redox couples (I−/I3−) and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ to understand the effects of electrolytes as well. Current–voltage (J–V), incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements have been carried out to explain the role of MgO in the improvement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the photovoltaic devices.

Synthesis of SK1 dye
We have reported the synthesis of SK1 dye in our previous work31 by following the steps that are mentioned in the Scheme 1. In a typical procedure, an aldehyde was reduced by reacting with sodium borohydride in the presence of tetrahydrofuran at 5 °C, followed by stirring at room temperature for 6 h. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was poured into cold water and extracted using dichloromethane. The organic layer was dried using anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was removed under vacuum to yield the oil.

The alcohol obtained in the previous step was then converted into Wittig salt using triphenylphosphine hydrobromide in dichloromethane, and it was separated out as a white colored salt by the addition of diethyl ether. Further, it was condensed with terephthaldehyde in ethanol using sodium ethoxide as a base under cold conditions (5–10 °C), and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h, poured into water followed by neutralizing with dilute hydrochloric acid to obtain a yellow colored crude solid. The yellow solid thus obtained was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a catalytic amount of iodine and refluxed for 4 h. Then, the reaction mass was poured into dilute alkali solution to separate the solid product, which was purified by column chromatography (EtOAc:n-hexane, 3:7, v/v). In the next step, purified aldehyde was dissolved in acetonitrile and cyanoacetic acid, and then a catalytic amount of piperidine was added. The reaction mass was allowed to reflux for 3 h, after which the solvent was removed under vacuum. Finally, the dried crude product was purified by column chromatography (EtOAc:n-hexane, 1:1, v/v) to obtain an orange solid product.

Synthesis of 3D hierarchical SnO2 microspheres
3D hierarchical SnO2 was synthesized following a previously reported protocol.32 To prepare 3D SnO2 microspheres, 2.25 g tin dichloride dihydrate (10 mmol) and 5.6 g oxalic acid (44.4 mmol) were dissolved in Milli-Q water (20 mL) followed by the addition of 0.4 mL hydrochloric acid (35 wt%). Aqueous solution (80 wt%) of 2.16 g (41.5 mmol) hydrazine monohydrate was added dropwise with magnetic stirring until the solution became clear. Finally, the solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 14 h. Subsequently, the autoclave was allowed to cool naturally to room temperature, and the obtained product was centrifuged and thoroughly rinsed with distilled water and absolute ethanol several times, dried in a hot air oven at 60 °C for 24 h and calcined at 500 °C for 2 h to obtain the final product.
Synthesis of porous 3D hierarchical MgO
In a typical procedure, MgCl2·6H2O (0.5 mmol) was dissolved in 25 mL distilled water, followed by the addition of sodium bicarbonate (5 mmol) into the solution. This solution was slowly added to ethanol with vigorous stirring (100 mL, in a 250 mL two-necked flask) at 80 °C. After 10 min, the stirring was stopped and the solution was maintained at 80 °C for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained precipitate was centrifuged and washed with water and absolute ethanol several times followed by drying in a hot air oven at 60 °C for 12 h. Finally, the obtained precursor [Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2·4H2O] was annealed in air at 400 °C for 4 h to obtain the porous hierarchical MgO.
Fabrication of photoanodes and devices
Pristine SnO2 and SnO2–MgO based photoanodes were fabricated as follows: for the fabrication of the bare SnO2 based photoanode, synthesized hierarchical SnO2 microsphere powder (0.5 g) was added to a mixture of 1.0 mL terpineol and 0.2 g of PEG–PPG–PEG and ground well in an agate mortar until a homogeneous paste was obtained. This paste was coated on the conductive glass substrates using the doctor blade technique. These films were then dried in a hot air oven at 70 °C and calcined at 450 °C for 30 min to remove the polymer. For sensitization, SnO2 pasted FTO substrates were immersed into a 0.3 mM SK1 dye solution in anhydrous ethanol:dichloromethane (1:1, v/v) mixed solvent for 6 h. The sensitized photoanode films were withdrawn from the dye solution, rinsed with ethanol, and dried under hot air blow. SnO2–MgO photoanodes were fabricated by following the same procedure used for the pristine SnO2 based photoanode, except ultrasonication of the mixture of porous hierarchical MgO powder and SnO2 microspheres with different weight ratios in ethanol (5 mL) for 1 h was carried out, prior to making the paste. This mixture paste was coated using doctor blade technique over precleaned FTO substrates (Scheme 2 and S1 see ESI†). The substrates were dried in air and then calcined at 450 °C for 30 min to obtain SnO2–MgO films. These substrates were then sensitized with SK1 dye solution for 6 h, washed with ethanol and dried under hot air blow. The thicknesses of all the photoanode films were found to be in the range of 12–15 μm using a surface profilometer. For the preparation of counter electrode, a 50 mM H2PtCl6 solution prepared in isopropanol was spin coated on precleaned, ozonized FTO substrates, followed by calcination at 450 °C for 30 min. The photovoltaic devices were fabricated by sandwiching the photoanodes and counter electrodes, and then electrolyte solution was injected after sealing (using low-temperature thermoplastic sealant, thickness ∼50 μm) to complete the device. In this work, we also studied the effect of two electrolytes on the PCE of fabricated devices. To prepare I−/I3− electrolyte solution, 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M guanidium thiocyanate, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine were dissolved in a solvent mixture of acetonitrile:valeronitrile (9:1, v/v), and similarly Co(II/III) electrolyte solution was prepared by dissolving 0.2 M [Co(bpy)3](PF6)2, 0.02 M [Co(bpy)3](PF6)3, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile:valeronitrile (9:1, v/v) solvent mixture. Before the photovoltaic measurements, the fabricated devices were kept under dark condition for 24 h. It should be noted that an active surface area of ∼0.25 cm2 was fixed for all the devices.

Material characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were recorded using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα (λ = 1.54 Å) with an operating voltage of 40 kV and current of 40 kA. The scan rate was fixed at 0.1° s−1 for taking the XRD patterns within the scan range of 10°–80°. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded via a JASCO Model V-650 spectrophotometer using a 150 mm integrating sphere and BaSO4 was used as an internal standard. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of SK1 dye molecules were obtained using a 400 MHz Bruker Advance NMR instrument. Mass spectrum of a SK1 dye molecule was obtained using a liquid chromatography mass spectrometer (Model no: Q-Tof Premier). The surface morphology of the as-synthesized materials were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using the Leo model 1430vp instrument at an operating voltage of 10 kV, and FESEM images were obtained using a Zeiss (Gemini) instrument operated at the voltage of 3 kV. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analysis for hierarchical microporous SnO2 and MgO was performed by nitrogen (N2) adsorption at liquid N2 temperature with a Beckman-Coulter SA 3100 N2 adsorption apparatus. For the surface area analysis, sample was degassed at 150 °C for 2 h prior to the N2 adsorption. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were carried out on a JEOL JEM 2100 microscope with an operating voltage of 200 kV. For the thickness measurements of the photoanode films, Veeco Dektak-150 surface profilometer was used. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed using a CH instruments model CHI680E, Inc., Austin, TX. The electrochemical analysis of the metal-free carbazole dye (SK1) was carried out through cyclic voltammetry (CV) [CH instruments model CHI600E, Inc, Austin, TX] using a three electrode system. A 2 mm platinum disc was used as the working electrode, platinum wire as the counter electrode, and nonaqueous Ag/Ag+ as the reference electrode. Ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) system was used as the standard for calibrating the redox peaks. A Keithley 2400 sourcemeter was used for current density–voltage (J–V) measurements of the fabricated devices in dark, and for light illumination, an AM 1.5G artificial solar simulator of 100 mW cm−2 was used. A standard Si photovoltaic cell was used to calibrate the intensity of a 450 W arc lamp of Newport ORIEL Sol3A solar simulator. The incident photon to current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) of the fabricated devices were evaluated on a Newport ORIEL IQE-200 instrument fitted with a 250 W quartz tungsten halogen lamp, which was calibrated with standard Si and Ge diodes.
Results and discussion
Powder X-ray diffraction analysis

Fig. 1 shows the PXRD patterns of (a) 3D SnO2 microspheres, (b) carbonate precursor of MgO, i.e., Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2·4H2O and (c) 3D porous MgO. The diffraction peaks of 3D SnO2 microspheres [trace (a), Fig. 1] are observed from the lattice planes (110), (101), (200), (111), (211), (220), (002), (310), (112), (301), (202) and (321) of a rutile crystal structure of SnO2 (JCPDS card no.# 41-1445). Trace (b) of Fig. 1 shows the XRD diffraction pattern of the carbonate precursor of MgO and confirm its structure as Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2·4H2O from JCPDS card no.# 25-0513. The PXRD peaks of Fig. 1c are matched well with the diffraction from the (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) planes of cubic MgO (JCPDS card no. # 04-0829). No peaks for other phases are observed for all three samples, confirming that SnO2 microspheres, the carbonate precursor Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2·4H2O of MgO and 3D porous MgO are highly pure. The high crystallinity of the as-synthesized SnO2 and MgO was confirmed from high intensity diffraction peaks observed for both of the compounds.

Material morphology

Fig. 2 shows the FESEM and SEM features of the as-synthesized 3D SnO2 and MgO microspheres at different magnifications. Fig. 2A and B show the SnO2 microspheres having an average size dimension of 1–3 μm. The magnified FESEM view (Fig. 2C) of a single SnO2 microsphere confirms its porous nature with numerous randomly arranged SnO2 2D nanoplates. Fig. 2D–F represent SEM images of 3D porous MgO particles at different magnifications. Fig. 2D and E clearly demonstrate that the diameters of MgO microspheres are in the range of 2–4 μm. Higher magnification SEM image (Fig. 2F) reveals that the microspheres are made up of numerous 2D nanosheets and are porous in nature, which was further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy.

Fig. 3A represents the TEM image of SnO2 nanoplates obtained from SnO2 microspheres after ultrasonication for 1 h in ethanol. The ultrasonicated solution was allowed to settle down for 15 min, and a drop of supernatant solution was drop-casted on the TEM grid. The size of SnO2 nanoplates are in the range of 10–15 nm. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 3B) of a single SnO2 nanoplate shows a well-resolved lattice pattern, indicates its crystalline nature and facilitates efficient photogenerated charge migration. The interplanar distance of the lattice pattern was obtained from inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) of atomic planes (trace C) and was found to be ∼0.33 nm, which corresponds to the (110) lattice planes. The inset to trace 3C represents FFT obtained from the HRTEM image. Fig. 3D shows an MgO microsphere from where 2D MgO nanosheets are coming out after ultrasonication for 1 h in ethanol. Trace E of Fig. 3 represents the TEM image of ultrathin MgO nanosheets. These nanosheets have numerous pores (Fig. S6, see ESI†) resulting from the thermal decomposition process of the carbonate precursor Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2·4H2O, which causes generation of a large amount of gases (e.g., CO2 and H2O).33 Trace 3F represents the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of 2D MgO nanosheets, which is consistent with the PXRD pattern and confirms their crystalline nature. These porous 2D MgO nanosheets can enhance the surface area of the photoanode for higher adsorption of dye molecules and can also facilitate the electrolyte diffusion process for faster regeneration of the oxidized dye molecules.

Traces E and F are representing TEM image of 2D MgO nanosheets and corresponding selected area electron diffraction pattern, respectively. 
BET surface area analysis
The BET surface area analysis of the as-prepared SnO2 and MgO microspheres is shown in Fig. 4. To achieve better photovoltaic performance of a solar cell, the electron transporting materials (i.e. photoanodic materials) should have high surface area. Both the samples, SnO2 and MgO, exhibit type IV isotherm patterns with H3 hysteresis loops confirming a characteristic mesoporous nature. The observed BET surface area of the as-synthesized SnO2 microspheres was found to be 123 m2 g−1, whereas for MgO it was found to be 219 m2 g−1. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution curve for SnO2 indicates that two types of pores are present in the material, one in the range of ∼10–20 nm and other in the range of ∼30–60 nm. The pore size distribution in MgO is in the range of ∼10–15 nm. Due to the mesoporous nature and high surface area of the SnO2 and MgO microspheres, they provide more adsorption sites for dye sensitization as well as better penetration of electrolyte to regenerate the oxidized dye molecules.

UV-vis absorption and diffused reflectance spectra

Fig. 5 represents the normalized UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of spin-coated thin-film of SK1 dye on FTO (SK1), unsensitized bare SnO2 and SnO2–MgO films, SK1-sensitized pristine 3D SnO2 microsphere (SnO2–SK1) and SK1-sensitized SnO2–MgO film (SnO2–MgO–SK1) on FTO substrates. The scan range was 200–800 nm for all the samples and was recorded against a blank FTO as a reference. The characteristic absorption spectrum of SnO2 (blue line) shows a steep absorption edge at ∼340 nm, whereas SnO2–MgO film displays that at ∼360 nm. From the Tauc's plot (inset, Fig. 5) the band gap of 3D SnO2 and SnO2–MgO films were found to be ∼3.57 eV and ∼3.42 eV, respectively, where (αhν)2 is plotted against the photon energy (hν), and α is the absorption coefficient. The absorption spectrum of SK1 dye thin-film (magenta line) shows its absorbance in the range of 350–550 nm with a high molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 3.42 × 104 M−1 cm−1. The absorption spectrum of the SK1-sensitized 3D SnO2 microsphere (red line) film shows the characteristic absorption edges for both the components SnO2 and SK1, indicating the adsorption of the dye on the surface of SnO2. Interestingly, the absorption onset of SK1 dye in the SnO2–MgO (black line) is higher than the pristine SnO2 film, indicating a higher loading of dye molecules. This is mainly due to the low isoelectric point (IEP) of SnO2 (i.e. at pH 4–5), which indicates the acidic surface of SnO2, causing the minimum adsorption of SK1 dye having carboxylic acid (–COOH) as the anchoring group. After the addition of MgO (IEP at pH 12), the dye molecules anchor on both the surfaces, i.e., on MgO as well as SnO2, resulting in a higher loading of dye molecules on the photoanode.18

Fig. 6 shows the diffused reflectance spectra of the pristine SnO2 microsphere and SnO2–MgO films. Diffused reflectance measurements were carried out to investigate the light scattering properties of the films. The SnO2–MgO film exhibits considerably higher reflectance in the wavelength range of 420–800 nm than that of the pristine SnO2 film. This confirms better light scattering effect after the addition of 2D nanosheets of MgO in the photoanode.34

Photovoltaic characteristics of the solar cells

Fig. 7A shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the SK1 dye sensitized solar cells constructed using the combination of 3D SnO2 and optimized weight percentage of 3D porous MgO (15 wt%, see Fig. S8, ESI†), as well as pristine 3D SnO2 microspheres under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic parameters, such as short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE, η), of SnO2–MgO (15 wt%) device were found to be around 10.53 mA cm−2, 619 mV, 57% and 3.71%, respectively, using [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ as the redox mediator, whereas these parameters were 9.21 mA cm−2, 550 mV, 49%, and 2.48%, respectively, in the case of I−/I3− as the redox shuttle. For pristine SnO2 devices, the parameters were found to be ≈8.04 mA cm−2, ≈445 mV, ≈51% and ≈1.82%, respectively, for [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ as the redox mediator, whereas I−/I3− as the redox couple in electrolyte yields Jsc ≈ 7.2 mA cm−2, Voc ≈ 357 mV, FF ≈ 38% and η ≈ 0.98%.

(B) IPCE plots for the respective devices employing [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and (I−/I3−) as the redox couples. Inset shows digital photographs of the fabricated photoanodes. 

Table 1summarizes the measured and calculated values obtained from each J–V curve, the average values and standard deviations for each device configuration. We observe a dramatic enhancement of Voc, fill factor (FF) and η in the SnO2–MgO system with an increase in Jsc values as well. The lower Voc values of pristine SnO2 devices (357 mV and 445 mV for I−/I3− and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couples, respectively) may be due to faster back electron transfer from CB of SnO2 to the redox shuttle (roughly 3-fold faster than TiO2), resulting from the reactive low-energy trap states of SnO2.16,35,36 The Voc values for SnO2–MgO devices are observed to be considerably higher (i.e., 550 mV, 619 mV for I−/I3− and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couples, respectively) indicating a significant drop of reverse tunnelling probability in the presence of MgO. Thus, the MgO barrier is minimizing the recombination rate of the photoinduced electrons with the I3− at the electrolyte/SnO2 interface. In addition, the conduction band-edge of the SnO2 may be shifted by MgO, resulting in a higher quasi-Fermi level and higher Voc.8,23,24 To probe this, we performed CV measurements for both the electrodes (i.e., pristine SnO2 and SnO2–MgO), which are presented in Fig. S7 (see ESI†). Fig. S7† indicates a shift in the conduction band edge by ∼30 mV in the case of the SnO2–MgO electrode as compared to the pristine SnO2 electrode. In principle, Voc of a DSSC is defined as the potential difference between the Fermi level of the semiconductor (i.e., SnO2) and the redox potential of the redox couple (see Scheme 3). Therefore, the observed positive shift of the conduction band edge of SnO2 after the addition of MgO also contributed to the significant increase in Voc (i.e., from ∼445 mV to ∼619 mV, employing [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ as redox shuttle, and from ∼357 mV to ∼550 mV, employing I−/I3− as redox shuttle), as illustrated in Scheme 3. It should be noted that the SK1 dye molecules are energetically capable of injecting photoinduced electrons across the MgO barrier because the excited level of the dye (LUMO) is located well above the CB (Scheme 3) of SnO2. A further increase in the Voc for the redox couple [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ is due to the minimization of the mismatch between the redox potential and the sensitizer HOMO level to 550 mV, whereas for I−/I3− redox couple, the mismatch is 770 mV. This has contributed in higher Voc and PCE of the devices with the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple as compared to the I−/I3− redox couple. Higher fill factor and short circuit current density values achieved for the devices with [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple (FF ≈ 57%, Jsc ≈ 10.53 mA cm−2 and ≈51%, ≈8.04 mA cm−2 for SnO2–MgO and pristine SnO2, respectively) compared to the I−/I3− redox couple (≈49%, ≈9.21 mA cm−2 and ≈38.2%, ≈7.20 mA cm−2 for SnO2–MgO and pristine SnO2, respectively) describe the minimum recombination and faster regeneration kinetics. It is well known that the energy disbursement for the effective regeneration of the oxidized dye molecules by I−/I3− redox couple is larger due to the complex regeneration kinetics involved in the formation of intermediates, i.e., the I2−˙ radical, which slows down the process.3,4,31,36

 Scheme 3  Schematic representations of the energy levels of pristine SnO2 (A) and SnO2–MgO (B) devices showing the shifting of the conduction band edge of SnO2 and inhibited electron interception at the SnO2/electrolyte interface in the presence of 2D MgO nanosheets. 

Fig. 7B shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of wavelength for the fabricated DSSCs. Increase in Jsc values due to the minimum photoinduced electron interception, higher loading of dye molecules and faster regeneration kinetics of the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple are also explicit in the IPCE value of the SnO2–MgO device, exhibiting the highest value of ∼60–63% in the measured wavelength range from 400 nm to 530 nm. From Fig. 7B, it is obvious that the IPCE values for the SnO2–MgO device with (I−/I3−) as the redox couple is ∼55–60%, while for pristine SnO2 devices employing [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and (I−/I3−) as the redox couple, the IPCE values are ∼50–54% and ∼47–51%, respectively, indicating a better light harvesting ability of the SnO2–MgO photoanode and superiority of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ as the redox couple in the device.
To further gain insight into the effect of MgO in the electron transport and recombination kinetics of the DSSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed. Fig. 8(A) represents the electrochemical impedance (EIS) spectra of all the devices obtained under darkness in a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz at the applied bias equivalent to the open-circuit voltage. As can be seen from Fig. 8(A), all Nyquist plots are composed of two semicircles. The right semicircle in the medium-frequency region is due to the charge-transfer process at the working electrode/electrolyte interface and the left semicircle in the high-frequency region is ascribed to the redox reaction at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface.31,37 It is observed that the diameters (Rk) of the right semicircles in the medium-frequency region are considerably decreased for the SnO2–MgO devices, indicating that the charge transfer resistance at SnO2–MgO/SK1/electrolyte interfaces is lower as compared to that at SnO2/SK1/electrolyte interfaces.38 Thus, the introduction of MgO into the devices provides a faster charge transfer process at the working electrode–electrolyte interfaces in the case of SnO2–MgO than in pristine SnO2 devices. This may be due to inhibited photo-induced electron recombination at the SnO2/electrolyte interface in the presence of MgO, faster oxidized dye molecule regeneration kinetics of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple and faster charge transfer through the highly crystalline 2D nanoplates in the SnO2 microspheres. The smaller diameter of the semicircle observed for the devices with Co(II/III) electrolyte in contrast to iodide/tri-iodide electrolyte, in the high frequency region, indicates a faster regeneration of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox shuttle at the Pt/electrolyte interface, [as shown in the inset of Fig. 8(A)].

The Bode phase plots for all the fabricated devices are shown in Fig. 8(B). The characteristic peak frequencies in the medium frequency region (fmax) for the pristine SnO2 devices are located at ∼26.1 Hz and ∼21.54 Hz by employing I−/I3− and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ as the redox couples, respectively. We calculated the photo-induced electron lifetimes in the CB of SnO2 (τe) using the formula (τe = 1/2πfmax)39 and are found to be 6.1 ms and 7.3 ms. The increase in electron lifetime further confirms the minimum photo-induced electron interception to the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox shuttle compared to the I−/I3−. A similar trend is observed for the SnO2–MgO devices with I−/I3− and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox shuttles, for which fmax values are located at around 13.3 Hz and 10.07 Hz, yielding an electron lifetime of 11.9 ms and 15.8 ms, respectively. As we have seen, there is a considerable increase in photoinduced electron lifetime in the SnO2–MgO devices compared to the pristine SnO2 devices, suggesting the effective suppression of electron recombination in the devices in the presence of MgO. As a result, photoinduced electron density in the CB level of SnO2 increases, leading to the higher value of open circuit voltage (Voc). This result also confirms the increased trend of the power conversion efficiency of the device.
Conclusions
We have successfully fabricated a mesoporous SnO2 based photoanode, utilizing the benefits of 3D hierarchical MgO composed of 2D nanosheets, by a simple sonication followed by a mixing process resulting in improved photovoltaic performances. Comparative study of the devices with two different redox couples, i.e., (i) (I−/I3−) and (ii) [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+, was also carried out, and it is found that [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ furnishes superior photovoltaic performance as compared to the I−/I3− redox couple. An increment of 74% in PCE, i.e., from ∼1% (pristine SnO2 device, redox mediator I−/I3−) to ∼3.71% (SnO2–MgO device, redox mediator [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+), has been achieved by employing 15 wt% of hierarchical MgO with porous SnO2 microspheres. Furthermore, from EIS measurements, we have explained the charge transfer dynamics across the interfaces in the photovoltaic devices and lifetime of the photoinduced electrons in CB of SnO2. It is found that with the introduction of 15 wt% of hierarchical MgO with porous SnO2 microspheres in the photoanodes, charge transfer resistance at SnO2/MgO/SK1/electrolyte interfaces decreases compared to SnO2/SK1/electrolyte interfaces, which implies a slower electron–hole (e−–h+) recombination rate. An increase in the lifetime of the photoinduced electrons in the SnO2–MgO photoanode up to τe ≈ 15.9 ms from τe ≈ 7.1 ms (pristine SnO2 devices) by employing the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox shuttle indicates the minimum leakage of trapped electrons in the conduction band level of SnO2, resulting in higher values of open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current density (Jsc). In addition, high BET surface area provided by the SnO2 microspheres (123 m2 g−1) boosts the adsorption of dye molecules, which upsurges the flux of photoinduced electron injection for an esteemed value of short circuit current density (Jsc ∼ 8.04 mA cm−2, [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ as redox shuttle, pristine SnO2 device). Although there is increase in dye loading upon MgO treatment, a moderate increase in Jsc value is noted (∼10.53 mA cm−2), which leads to a lower PEC value (∼3.71%, SnO2–MgO device). This may be due to a decrease in the electron injection rate in the presence of the MgO barrier layer. However, better absorption of solar irradiation by the SnO2–MgO photoanode due to a higher light scattering ability than that of the pristine SnO2 photoanode contributes towards the increase in Jsc value.
