    , Accepted 12th November 2014First published on 13th November 2014AbstractTwo novel porphyrin dyads (9 and 11) consisting of two zinc-metallated porphyrin units, covalently linked at their peripheries through 1,2,3-triazole containing bridges and functionalized by a terminal carboxylic acid group, have been synthesized via “click” reactions, which are Cu-catalyzed Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions between azide- and acetylene-containing porphyrins. Photophysical and electrochemical measurements, together with DFT calculations, showed that the two dyads possess suitable frontier orbital energy levels for use as sensitizers in DSSCs. The 9 and 11 based solar cells were fabricated resulting in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 3.82 and 5.16%, respectively. As shown by photovoltaic measurements (J–V curves) and incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the two solar cells, the higher PCE value of the latter is attributed to its enhanced photovoltaic parameters, and particularly its enhanced short circuit current (Jsc). This is related to the stronger absorption profile of the sensitizing dyad 11 (the dyad with the shorter triazole containing bridge) and the higher dye loading of the corresponding solar cell. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) demonstrated that the 11 based solar cell exhibits longer electron lifetime (τe) and more effective suppression of the recombination between the injected electrons and the electrolyte.
Introduction
Over the last decade, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted significant interest as potential alternatives to the amorphous silicon-based solar cells, due to their low production cost, simple fabrication, and controllable optical properties.1–5 Such devices consist of a working electrode (anode) composed of a dye-sensitized, wide band-gap metal oxide semiconductor, usually TiO2 or ZnO, deposited on a transparent conducting oxide glass substrate, a counter electrode (cathode) composed of a Pt-coated conducting oxide glass substrate, and an electrolyte containing a redox couple, such as I−/I3−. The sensitizing dye is a key element in achieving high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), as it is responsible for photon harvesting, excitation of electrons, and injection of excited electrons into the metal oxide semiconductor conduction band (CB). Ruthenium-polypyridyl complexes have been proven to be very efficient as sensitizers, achieving high photovoltaic efficiencies above 11%, but the high cost and scarcity of ruthenium, as well as related environmental issues, prevent their affordable commercial application.6,7 Therefore, in recent years, extensive efforts have been directed towards the exploration of new, low-cost and efficient metal-free organic sensitizers.8–18
Porphyrins appear to be a very promising class of sensitizers of this type, owing to their enhanced light harvesting potential (they display an intense absorption in the 400–450 nm region, Soret band, and moderate absorptions in the 550–700 nm region, Q-bands), as well as their simple, low-cost and environmentally friendly synthetic procedures.19–22 Moreover, their physical, optical, and electronic properties can be appropriately modulated by suitable functionalization of their meso and β positions, following established molecular design procedures.23–36 In particular, porphyrins with a donor–π-acceptor (D–π-A) molecular architecture (“push–pull”) have attracted much attention,37–41 resulting in PCE values as high as 13%.42,43
In an effort to further improve the performance of porphyrin based solar cells, multi-porphyrin arrays consisting of covalently linked porphyrin macrocycles, linked either through suitable π-conjugated groups or directly, have been investigated as sensitizers. Due to extended conjugation, the photophysical properties of such systems appear to be enhanced and their characteristic absorptions and emissions are shifted to longer wavelengths, compared to single porphyrins. For example, ethynyl-bridged porphyrins through their meso positions display strong electronic coupling between porphyrin macrocycles resulting in splitting of their Soret band and broadening of their Q bands.44 Furthermore, directly linked porphyrins45 and fused porphyrin arrays46–48 exhibit broad absorptions, covering the visible and near IR regions of the solar spectrum. Solar cells based on such dyes allow the exploitation of lower energy photons and have the potential to lead to enhanced light harvesting and overall solar cell efficiencies. Corroborating the above, a DSSC based on an ethynyl-bridged carbazole–porphyrin–porphyrin triad showed efficient light to current conversion throughout the visible to near IR regions achieving a PCE value of 5.21%.49 In addition, we recently reported the use of porphyrin dyads and triads as sensitizers in DSSCs achieving PCE values in the range 4–6%.50–52
Among the various synthetic strategies that have been applied towards the synthesis of multi-porphyrin assemblies, transition metal catalytic reactions play a very important role. In particular, Pd-based cross-coupling reactions, through the formation of C–C and C–N bonds, have been proven to be a powerful tool for the construction of elaborate architectures, through simple, versatile, and cost- and time-efficient routes. Alkynyl- and alkenyl-bridged systems can be synthesized via Sonogashira53 and Heck reactions54,55 respectively. Furthermore, still reactions based on organotin compounds can be utilized for the synthesis of alkenyl-, alkynyl- and aryl-bridged assemblies,56 while Suzuki reactions based on organoboron compounds are used for linking aromatic groups.57 Finally, connection through C–N bonds can be achieved via Bachwald–Hartwig reactions.58,59
Another type of metal catalyzed reaction that has recently received great attention for the construction of multi-chromophore arrays is “click” reactions.60 Click chemistry is a powerful method to synthesize new compounds in a reliable and selective way by linking two chemical moieties together, which has found many applications in chemical synthesis, drug discovery, chemical biology, and proteomic applications.61 On the other hand, in porphyrin chemistry it is highly desirable to have available a simple, efficient and versatile synthetic strategy for functionalizing porphyrin units, in order to be used in various areas of interest. Towards this direction, the utilization of click reaction between alkynes and azides (as porphyrin terminal substituents) has emerged as one of the most effective tools, since it can be conducted under mild conditions, using a variety of solvents and resulting in the formation of the desired products in high yields, independently of the steric and electronic properties of the starting reagents (both electron-rich or electron-deficient substrates can be used).60,62,63 Cu-catalyzed Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between azide- and acetylene-containing derivatives is the most effective reaction of this type which has led to a variety of porphyrin, phthalocyanine and other chromophore containing systems.64–70 The 1,2,3-triazole bridge that results from such reactions has been proven to be very efficient for energy transfer in donor–acceptor systems.71,72 Also, according to literature reports, the measured efficiencies for a variety of mono-carboxylphenyl triaryl porphyrins have shown values from 0.5 to 3% in standard DSSCs.73–75 Consequently, the solar cell performance of the single porphyrin dyes is expected to be lower than the performance of the final dyads. Herein, we describe the syntheses of two 1,2,3-triazole bridged porphyrin dyads, 9 and 11 (Scheme 1), synthesized under “click” reaction conditions, which contain terminal carboxylic acid groups for attachment to the TiO2 surface of DSSCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that “click” reaction derived porphyrin dyads are used as sensitizers in DSSCs. Nevertheless, to investigate the influence of the spacer (length) between the donor and acceptor parts of the sensitizing dye, the two derivatives 9 and 11 were synthesized. The difference between derivatives 9 and 11 is due to the longer distance of the two porphyrin rings, as well as due to the presence of the small and non-conjugated aliphatic chain (C4) between them. The 9 and 11 sensitized solar cells resulted in PCE values of 3.82 and 5.16%, respectively. The enhanced photovoltaic performance of the latter solar cell is attributed to its better photovoltaic parameters, which are related to the stronger absorption profile of its sensitizing dye (dyad 11 with the shorter triazole containing bridge), higher dye loading onto the TiO2 surface, longer electron lifetime and reduced recombination between the injected electrons and the electrolyte.

Equimolar amounts of porphyrin 6 (30 mg, 0.034 mmol) and porphyrin 7 (25 mg, 0.034 mmol) were dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of THF–CH3CN (5 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere. Next, CuI (6 mg, 0.032 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 hours.

Electrochemistry
Cyclic and square wave voltammetry experiments were carried out at room temperature using an AutoLab PGSTAT20 potentiostat and appropriate routines available in the operating software (GPES, version 4.9). Measurements were carried out in freshly distilled and deoxygenated THF, with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, with a solute concentration of 1.0 mM in the presence of tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte. A three-electrode cell setup was used with a platinum working electrode, a saturated calomel (SCE) reference electrode, and a platinum wire as a counter electrode. The system was calibrated using ferrocene.
Computational methods
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations77 were performed using the GAUSSIAN 03 program suite.78 Gas phase geometry optimizations were carried out by employing Becke three parameter exchange in conjunction with the Lee–Yang–Parr correlation functional (B3LYP).79,80 For the geometry optimization, the LANL2DZ basis set was used for Zn atoms and the 6-31G(d) basis sets were used for lighter atoms. The input geometries were modeled using the ChemCraft software.81 The optimized minimum-energy structures were verified as stationary points on the potential energy surface by vibrational frequency analysis calculation. Computed structures and molecular orbitals were visualized and analyzed using ChemCraft software.
Preparation of TiO2 electrodes and DSSCs
The DSSCs were fabricated with electrodes based on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrates, which were pre-cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and ethanol and then dried in air. The working electrodes for the DSSC were prepared by first forming a blocking layer from 0.2 M di-isopropoxy titanium bis(acetylacetone) in isopropanol by spray pyrolysis. This was then followed by the deposition of a nano-crystalline layer of TiO2 using the doctor blade technique using dye sol TiO2 paste (DSL 18NR-T) on a pre-cleaned FTO coated glass substrate. The TiO2 coated FTO electrodes were heated at 500 °C for 30 min. The TiO2 electrodes were then dipped in 0.02 M aqueous TiCl4 for 20 minutes, rinsed with water and ethanol and annealed at 500 °C for 20 min. The thickness of the TiO2 electrode was measured using a thin film thickness measurement system (Nano calc XR Ocean Optics Germany) and found to be in the range 10–12 μm. Finally, it was immersed in a porphyrin solution (200 μM in THF) for 12 h to give the porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 working electrode. The platinum wire counter electrode was prepared by spin-coating drops of a H2PtCl6 solution onto a FTO-coated glass substrate and heating at 350 °C for 15 min. The DSSCs were assembled by separating the working electrode from the counter electrode with a 20 μm thick Surlyn hot-melt gasket. In the space between the working and counter electrodes, the electrolyte [consisting of 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M LiI, 0.6 M dimethylpropyl-benzimidazole iodide, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in an acetonitrile solution] was introduced through a hole and sealed with Surlyn.
Photovoltaic measurements
The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs under illumination were measured using a Keithley source meter and a solar simulator coupled with a 150 W xenon lamp and an AM optical filter to give an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2 at the DSSC surface. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) in the dark were recorded by using an electrochemical workstation (Auto lab PGSTAT) with a frequency response analyzer. The frequency range was from 10 mHz to 100 KHz, and an ac potential of 10 mV was used. A dc bias equivalent to the open-circuit voltage of the DSSC was applied. The impedance data were analyzed by using Z-View software with an appropriate equivalent circuit. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured as a function of wavelength with a xenon lamp, monochromator, and Keithley source meter at 10 mW cm−2. The intensity calibration for the IPCE measurement was performed by using a standard silicon photodiode.
Results and discussion
Structures, synthesis and characterization
As shown in Scheme 1, dyads 9 and 11 consist of two zinc-metallated porphyrin units which are covalently linked at their peripheries by 1,2,3-triazole containing bridges of different lengths. One of the porphyrin units of each dyad is functionalized at the meso position opposite to the triazole bridge with a benzoic acid moiety, which can function as an anchoring group for attachment onto the TiO2 surface of DSSCs.
The synthesis of the two dyads 9 and 11, depicted in Scheme 2, is based on the utilization of click-type reactions. The dyads were obtained via click-reactions which are Cu-catalyzed versions of the Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between an alkyne and an azide group that lead to the formation of a 1,2,3-triazole ring. Therefore, the first step of their syntheses involved the preparation of the corresponding terminal alkyne and azide containing porphyrins. The former, i.e. 5-(4-prop-2-ynyloxyphenyl)-10,15,20-triphenylporphyrin (7), a reagent used for the syntheses of both dyads, was prepared according to previously published procedures. Two different azide containing porphyrins were used, 4 and 6, which differ in the positioning of the azide group relative to the porphyrin framework. In porphyrin 4, the azide group is located at the end of a six-membered, heteroatom containing aliphatic side chain, which is attached to a meso phenyl group of the porphyrin unit. The synthesis of this compound started from the reaction of porphyrin 1 with an excess of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O which yielded the metallated porphyrin 2. The reaction of 2 with 5-bromovaleryl chloride in CH2Cl2 in the presence of Et3N resulted in the formation of the alkyl-bromide containing porphyrin adduct 3, which, after its purification and isolation, further reacted with NaN3 to afford the azide containing porphyrin 4. The analogous porphyrin 6 containing the azide group at the periphery of a meso phenyl group substituent was prepared from the reaction of the free-base porphyrin 1 with NaN3, followed by metallation with Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O.
 Scheme 2 
“Click” reaction between the azide containing porphyrin 4 and the terminal alkyne containing porphyrin 7, catalyzed by CuSO4·5H2O and sodium ascorbate, in a mixture of CHCl3–H2O, resulted in the formation of the triazole-bridged porphyrin dyad 8. The most noticeable feature in the 1H NMR spectrum of 8 is the appearance of a characteristic signal at 8.40 ppm which is assigned to the H of the newly formed triazole ring. Finally, basic hydrolysis of the methyl ester group of 8, followed by aqueous work-up, resulted in the formation of the desired dyad 9. In the 1H NMR spectrum of 9, it should be noticed the absence of any signal due to the methyl-ester H's and the appearance of a signal assigned to the carboxylic acid H at 13.18 ppm, while in its 13C NMR spectrum the characteristic signal of the secondary carbon atom of the triazole ring and the carboxylic acid group, which appear at 125.25 and 168.08 ppm respectively, is to be noted.
The synthesis of porphyrin dyad 11 was achieved in a similar fashion except that in this case the click-reaction affording the triazole-bridged porphyrin dyad 10 was catalyzed by CuI in THF. The use of the CuSO4/ascorbate catalytic system employed in the aforementioned click-reaction did not afford the desired dyad. Apparently, this can be attributed to the different nature of the azide group. The fact that the reaction does not lead to the desired product is known from the literature data.64 More precisely, when the azide group is located on the phenyl ring of the porphyrin the reaction does not take place in the presence of CuSO4 and Na ascorbate. That is the reason why we had to use the described experimental procedure66 for the synthesis of the desired product (10). The final product 11 was obtained after basic hydrolysis of the methyl ester group of 10. All the synthesized compounds were fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MALDI-TOF spectrometry.
Photophysical studies
The UV-vis absorption spectra of porphyrin dyads 9 and 11 in THF solutions are shown in Fig. 1a (black and red color lines, respectively). The spectra of both compounds exhibit the typical absorption bands of zinc-metallated porphyrins, with an intense Soret band in the 420–430 nm range and two moderate Q-bands observed in the 555–600 nm range (Table 1), which are attributed to π–π* electronic transitions within the porphyrin framework. No other spectral features are observed, which gives an indication that there are no intramolecular interactions between the porphyrin units through the triazole bridges in the ground states of both porphyrin dyads.

In Fig. 1b are depicted the UV-vis absorption spectra of porphyrin dyads 9 and 11 adsorbed on TiO2 films (black and red color lines, respectively). They show the usual porphyrin Soret and Q bands, but, compared to the corresponding absorption spectra in solution, these are broadened and slightly shifted to longer wavelengths. In general, when anchored onto the TiO2 surface, porphyrins form either face-to-face π-aggregates (H-aggregates), which usually result in absorption bands shifted to shorter wavelengths (blue-shifted) relative to the corresponding bands in solution spectra, or edge-to-edge π-aggregates (J-aggregates), which usually give red-shifted (to longer wavelengths) absorption bands. The observed red-shifted bands of both 9 and 11 provide an indication of J-type aggregation of the porphyrin dyads onto the TiO2 surface. It is worth-mentioning that dyad 11 adsorbed onto the TiO2 film exhibits stronger absorption bands than dyad 9, which suggests a larger amount of dye adsorbed onto the TiO2 film. Furthermore, the broad, red-shifted and higher intensity Q-bands of both dyads 9 and 11 adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface indicate a strong electronic coupling between the dyads and the TiO2 surface as well as an enhanced light harvesting capacity of the low energy photons, which is highly desirable for efficient sensitizers in DSSCs.
Based on the onset absorption edges λonset of the Q bands of dyads 9 and 11 adsorbed on thin TiO2 films, which are found to be 646 and 626 nm, respectively, the corresponding optical band gap energies Eoptg, calculated from the expressionEoptg = 1240/λonsetwere found to be 1.92 and 1.98 eV, respectively (Table 1).
Electrochemical studies
In order to evaluate the feasibility of electron transfer from the photo-excited dyads 9 and 11 into the TiO2 CB as well as their regeneration by the I−/I3− couple of the electrolyte in the corresponding DSSCs, the electrochemical properties of the two dyads were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 2) and square-wave voltammetry measurements (Fig. S33 in ESI†). The relevant electrochemical data are summarized in Table 2. Porphyrin dyad 9 exhibits one reversible oxidation process at E1ox = +0.93 V and one reversible reduction process at E1red = −1.48 V, vs. SCE which corresponds to the overlapping oxidation and reduction of both porphyrin units. Porphyrin dyad 11 exhibits similar reversible processes at E1ox = +1.02 V and E1red = −1.42 V vs. SCE. These data are typical for meso tetra-aryl substituted Zn-metallated porphyrins82 and suggest that there is a negligible electronic interaction between the two porphyrin units in the ground states of both dyads.

In a DSSC, for efficient electron injection of the photo-excited sensitizer into the TiO2 CB, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of the sensitizer (which corresponds to its first reduction potential E1red) should be higher than the TiO2 CB edge (−0.74 V vs. SCE). Both compounds 9 and 11 display E1red values which are more negative than the TiO2 CB, suggesting that there is sufficient driving force for electron injection from the photo-excited dyads into the TiO2 CB (ΔGinj < 0) (Fig. 3). Furthermore, in order to ensure efficient regeneration of the sensitizer radical cation (after electron injection) in a DSSC, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the sensitizer (which corresponds to its first oxidation potential E1ox) should be lower than the corresponding redox potential of the electrolyte redox couple used in the solar cell, i.e. I−/I3− (+0.40 V vs. SCE). The E1ox values of both 9 and 11 are more positive than the electrolyte redox potential, and therefore regeneration of the dyads, after electron injection, is thermodynamically feasible (ΔGreg < 0).83,84

The HOMO−LUMO band gaps Eelecg for 9 and 11 estimated from electrochemical data were found to be 2.41 and 2.44 eV, respectively (Table 2), which are larger than the corresponding HOMO−LUMO band gaps Eoptg estimated from photophysical measurements (Table 1). However, this is an ordinary characteristic of organic dyes of this type, which can be attributed to solvent effects.85
DFT calculations
In order to gain insight into the molecular and electronic structures of dyads 9 and 11, DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory were performed. Due to the fact that the total number of atoms of dyads is too large for DFT calculations in our computer cluster, the molecules were simplified by replacing the phenyl and 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl groups at the meso positions of the porphyrin units with H atoms, which should not have any influence on the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the molecules.
The gas-phase geometry optimized structures of dyads 9 and 11 are depicted in Fig. 4, while their optimized coordinates are provided in Tables S1 and S2 in ESI.† Both molecules adopt a “butterfly like” structure, in which the porphyrin units are attached as wings at the ends of the triazole-containing bridges. In 11, the triazole ring is almost co-planar with the two bridging phenyl groups forming a framework which is in a perpendicular orientation with respect to the two porphyrin units.
 Fig. 4  Gas-phase geometry-optimized structure of 9 and 11. Phenyl and 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl groups at the periphery are replaced with H atoms. Carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, and zinc atoms correspond to grey, blue, white, red, and green spheres, respectively. 
The electron density distributions of the frontier molecular orbitals of the two dyads and the corresponding energy levels are presented in Fig. 5. The HOMO, HOMO−1 and HOMO−2 are close in energy. In both molecules, the electron density of the HOMOs is predominantly located on the unsubstituted porphyrin unit, with some additional contributions on the bridging phenyl groups. The LUMO is spread over the functionalized porphyrin unit, the terminal benzoic acid group and the bridging phenyl group, while the LUMO+1 is entirely localized on the functionalized porphyrin unit. Consequently, both dyads could be described as “push–pull” D–π-A systems (D: donor, A: acceptor) and they have the potential to act as successful sensitizers in DSSCs, since the electron density distributions on HOMO, LUMO, and LUMO+1 are such that could promote intramolecular electron transfer, upon photoexcitation, from one porphyrin unit to the porphyrin with the carboxylic acid and, finally, injection into the TiO2 CB. Nevertheless, intramolecular electron transfer is not expected to be very efficient. The non-planar orientation of the porphyrin units, the conjugation break caused by the twisted phenyl and triazole rings and the presence of sp3 hybridized atoms (O and C) in the bridging units, together with the long distance between the two chromophore units weaken the electronic communication between the porphyrin π-systems. This is evident from the UV-vis absorption spectra, and electrochemical behavior of both dyads.

The calculated HOMO−LUMO gaps in a THF solution of dyads 9 and 11 were found to be 2.793 and 2.744 eV, respectively, which are similar to the experimentally observed HOMO−LUMO gaps from electrochemistry experiments.
Photovoltaic properties
The 9 and 11 based DSSCs have been fabricated and their current–voltage (J–V) characteristics are shown in Fig. 6 (black and red color lines, respectively), while the corresponding photovoltaic cell parameters, i.e. short circuit photocurrent (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE), are compiled in Table 3. The solar cell employing porphyrin dyad 9 as a sensitizer exhibits a PCE value of 3.82% (with Jsc = 9.36 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.62 V, and FF = 0.68) while the solar cell based on 11 gives a higher PCE value of 5.16% (with Jsc = 10.84 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.68 V, and FF = 0.70). In other words, the dyad with the shorter triazole containing bridge results in a higher PCE value than the dyad with the longer bridge.

One of the reasons for the higher PCE value of the 11 based solar cell is its higher Jsc value. Given that Jsc of a solar cell is related to its IPCE response, the different Jsc values of the two solar cells should be reflected on their respective IPCE spectra. The IPCE spectra of both devices, shown in Fig. 7 (black and red color lines, respectively), resemble the absorption spectra of the dyads adsorbed on TiO2 films, exhibiting characteristic peaks of moderate intensity in the 400–470, 540–580, and 600–740 nm ranges. However, the scattering by TiO2 nanoparticles increases the photocurrent in the relatively weak absorption region.86 The solar cell sensitized by 11 exhibits a stronger IPCE response than the solar cell sensitized by 9, which is consistent with a higher Jsc value.
 Fig. 7  IPCE spectra of DSSCs based on 9 (black color line) and 11 (red color line). 
The IPCE of a DSSC is defined asIPCE = LHE × φinj × ηcwhere LHE is the light harvesting efficiency, φinj is the electron injection efficiency, and ηc is the charge collection efficiency of the solar cell.87 LHE depends on the absorption profile of the sensitizer and the amount of dye adsorbed on the TiO2 surface and it is expressed as 1 − 10−εΓ, where ε is the molar absorptivity of the dye and Γ is the molar concentration of the dye loaded per surface area of the TiO2 film. Therefore, the stronger IPCE response and the corresponding higher Jsc value of the 11 based solar cell should result from higher values of these two parameters. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1b and 7, dyad 11 adsorbed on TiO2 displays a stronger absorption profile with a higher molar absorptivity value than 9. Furthermore, the amount of dye per surface area or dye loading value (estimated spectroscopically by immersing the dye-sensitized TiO2 films of thickness 12 μm in a 0.1 M NaOH solution in a 1:1 v/v mixture EtOH–THF and measuring the absorption spectra of the de-adsorbed dyes) for the 11 based solar cell was found to be higher than the one for the 9 based solar cell (4.34 × 10−7 and 1.45 × 10−7 mol cm−2, respectively).
The electron injection rate from the photo-excited dye into the TiO2 CB influences the Jsc and, hence, the PCE value of a solar cell. This is strongly affected by dye-aggregation on the TiO2 surface of the photoanode of the solar cell, since it increases the probability of relocation of porphyrin excited states in neighboring porphyrin units (exciton quenching) decreasing the electron injection efficiency.84,88,89 The onlydifference between the structures of dyads 9 and 11 is the length of the triazole containing bridge connecting the two porphyrin units. Since dyad 9 contains a longer bridge, it has higher flexibility than dyad 11, and therefore it should be expected to have a higher tendency to resist dye aggregation, resulting in a higher PCE value. However, the results presented herein suggest that the different degrees of dye aggregation of the 9 and 11 based solar cells is not a factor that decisively differentiates their electron injection rates and their overall performances.
Furthermore, the ΔGinj values of the two solar cells are similar, as estimated from the aforementioned electrochemistry data, indicating that there is essentially no difference in their corresponding driving forces available for electron injection.
Charge transport and recombination processes also play an important role in determining the PCE value of a DSSC. Aiming to obtain information about the relationship between these processes in the 9 and 11 based solar cells and the corresponding observed photovoltaic parameters, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the two solar cells under dark conditions at a forward bias of 0.65 V were recorded.90–92 The Nyquist plots of EIS of the two devices are shown in Fig. 8a (black and red color lines for the 9 and 11 sensitized solar cells, respectively). The plots for both devices comprise three semicircles, which are associated with the charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode–electrolyte interface (in the high frequency region), the charge recombination resistance at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface (in the middle frequency region) and the ion diffusion resistance in the electrolyte of the solar cell (in the low frequency region). The larger semicircle radius in the middle frequency region for the DSSC sensitized by porphyrin dyad 11 indicates a higher charge recombination resistance for the former device which means that the charge recombination rate is slower for this device.
 Fig. 8  (a) Nyquist plots and (b) Bode phase plots of electrochemical impedance spectra of DSSCs based on 9 and 11 (black and red color lines respectively), measured at a bias voltage of 0.65 V under dark conditions. 
The Bode phase plots of EIS of 9 and 11 sensitized solar cells are shown in Fig. 8b (black and red color lines, respectively). In both plots, the peak in the high frequency region corresponds to the charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode, while the peak in the lower frequency region is related to the charge recombination resistance. The frequency at the maximum (fpeak) of the latter peak can be used to calculate the electron lifetime (τe) of a solar cell.93,94 The electron lifetime (τe) values for the 9 and 11 based solar cells were calculated according to the relationship  and they were found to be 22 and 31 ms, respectively. The longer electron lifetime for the latter device based on 11 is indicative of a more effective suppression of recombination between the injected electrons and the electrolyte, and therefore to a reduced charge recombination rate, resulting in an enhanced Voc value.95
Conclusions
We have synthesized two novel porphyrin dyads 9 and 11 consisting of two zinc-metallated porphyrin units, which are covalently linked through their meso phenyl groups by 1,2,3-triazole containing bridges of different lengths. Both dyads are also functionalized with a terminal carboxylic acid group. These were synthesized via “click” reactions, which are Cu-catalyzed Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions between azide- and acetylene-containing porphyrins. Due to the different position of the azide group in the corresponding azide-containing porphyrins (either on the aliphatic carbon chain or on the phenyl group), the “click” reactions leading to the syntheses of the two dyads required the use of different catalytic reactions conditions. UV-vis spectra and cyclic voltammetry measurements, as well as DFT calculations, revealed that there is negligible electronic interaction between the two porphyrin units in the ground states of both dyads, but the dyads possess frontier orbital energy levels which are suitable for use as sensitizers in DSSCs. Fabrication of the corresponding solar cells revealed that the device based on the dyad with the shorter triazole containing bridge (11) results in a better photovoltaic performance (3.82 and 5.16% for 9 and 11, respectively). As demonstrated by the J–V curves and the IPCE and EI spectra of the two solar cells, the higher PCE value of the latter can be attributed to its enhanced short circuit current (Jsc) under illumination, its longer electron lifetime (τe) and more effective charge recombination resistance between the injected electrons and the electrolyte, as well as its higher dye loading on the TiO2 surface.
