, Accepted 27th June 2013First published on 14th August 2013AbstractCu2O–ZnO nanowire solar cells have the advantages of light weight and high stability while possessing a large active material interface for potentially high power conversion efficiencies. In particular, electrochemically fabricated devices have attracted increasing attention due to their low-cost and simple fabrication process. However, most of them are “partially” electrochemically fabricated by vacuum deposition onto a preexisting ZnO layer. There are a few examples made via all-electrochemical deposition, but the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is too low (0.13%) for practical applications. Herein we use an all-electrochemical approach to directly deposit ZnO NWs onto FTO followed by electrochemical doping with Ga to produce a heterojunction solar cell. The Ga doping greatly improves light utilization while significantly suppressing charge recombination. A 2.5% molar ratio of Ga to ZnO delivers the best performance with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 3.24 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 0.25%, which is significantly higher than in the absence of Ga doping. Moreover, the use of electrochemically deposited ZnO powder-buffered Cu2O from a mixed Cu2+–ZnO powder solution and oxygen plasma treatment could reduce the density of defect sites in the heterojunction interface to further increase Jsc and PCE to 4.86 mA cm−2 and 0.34%, respectively, resulting in the highest power conversion efficiency among all-electrochemically fabricated Cu2O–ZnO NW solar cells. This approach offers great potential for a low-cost solution-based process to mass-manufacture high-performance Cu2O–ZnO NW solar cells.
1. Introduction
Inorganic solar cells have attracted increasing attention because of their advantages of light weight, high reliability, relatively high efficiency and potential for large-scale manufacturing.1–3 However, the expensive active layer materials necessary for their production, including copper, indium, gallium, selenite, and cadmium telluride, substantially limit their large-scale commercialization.4,5 Meanwhile, low cost metal oxides such as ZnO and Cu2O have become the hot alternatives in various photovoltaic devices. ZnO, an n-type metal oxide, has prominent advantages such as easy fabrication, nanostructure tailorability, good stability and high transparency for photovoltaic applications.6–9 As a representative nanostructured ZnO material, vertically aligned ZnO nanowire arrays (ZnO NWs) grown directly on a conducting substrate can provide a favourable architecture for efficient light utilization and high charge transportation for inorganic solar cells.10,11 Cu2O, a p-type oxide semiconductor has a bandgap of around 2.0 eV and a high light absorption coefficient for wavelengths of less than ∼475 nm,12 and is a very attractive alternative to replace organic dyes for photovoltaic applications. In particular, a Cu2O–ZnO nanowire solar cell can provide a large interface for potentially high power conversion efficiency,12–18 and thus research into this type of solar cell has accelerated.
A low-cost, large-scale manufacturing process is essential for the practical application of inorganic solar cells. Currently, the main approaches to fabrication are based on vacuum deposition methods, which are costly as they require rigorous device preparation conditions. Therefore, inexpensive solution-based synthetic approaches under atmospheric conditions are much more preferable. An electrodeposition method is just such an approach that is capable of producing a uniform film on a conductive substrate directly from a solution.19 In a landmark work on the synthesis of a bilayer Cu2O–ZnO solar cell, a power conversion efficiency of 0.41% has been accomplished.20 Electrodeposition has also been recently explored in order to fabricate Cu2O–ZnO NW-based solar cells. Musselman et al. studied the effects of the Cu2O layer thickness and the ZnO nanowire length on the device performance.12,17 Buffering was also used to reduce charge recombination and further improve the device performance.18 “Partially” electrochemically fabricated ZnO nanowire array–Cu2O solar cell devices have been fabricated via vacuum deposition onto a preexisting ZnO layer, leading to significant improvements in device performance.12,15,17,18,21,22 Nevertheless, all-electrochemically deposited Cu2O–ZnO NW solar cells fabricated without the preexisting sputtered ZnO layer still deliver low PCEs (0.13%).13 It is possible that the poor transport and/or electrical properties of the metal oxides limit the solar device performance. Doping is an efficient approach to adjust a semiconductor’s transport and electrical behaviours.23 It has been demonstrated that Ga doping can enhance the n-type conductivity of metal oxides, resulting in high electron concentration and good electron mobility.24 Therefore, we expect that Ga-doped ZnO NWs could improve the PCE of Cu2O–ZnO NW solar cells. Various Ga doping techniques including pulsed laser deposition (PLD),25 metal organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD),26 e-beam deposition,27 and thermal evaporation28 have been well-developed, but they cannot serve as a low-cost wet chemical method for the synthesis of an all-electrochemically fabricated Ga-doped Cu2O–ZnO nanowire solar cell.
In this work, we demonstrate an all-electrochemically fabricated high performance Ga-doped Cu2O–ZnO nanowire solar cell. The fabrication process is shown schematically in Fig. 1. A thin film of a Ga-doped ZnO (Ga:ZnO) seed layer was first co-electrodeposited from an aqueous solution containing ZnO and Ga precursors onto pre-cleaned FTO glass. Ga:ZnO NWs were synthesized on the Ga:ZnO seed layer coated FTO glass using the same electrolyte but under electrodeposition conditions different from those used in the initial electrodeposition of the Ga:ZnO seed layer. Then a dense film of Cu2O was deposited on the top of the Ga:ZnO NWs, followed by the growth of a gold (Au) electrode to produce the final Cu2O–Ga:ZnO NWs solar cell device. The effects of Ga doping on the performance of the Cu2O–Ga:ZnO NW solar cells were studied and analyzed.

2. Experimental details
Electrodeposition
Electrodeposition was performed with a CHI 760D electrochemical workstation using a three-electrode system with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) reference electrode and a 2.5 cm2 platinum counter electrode that was placed ∼2 cm apart from the sample (working electrode). All chemicals used were reagent grade, and water was purified (18.2 MΩ cm).
Ga:ZnO nanowire synthesis
Commercial FTO/glass substrates with an approximately 200 nm thick FTO layer (sheet resistance < 10 Ω sq.−1) were used. All substrates were thoroughly cleaned by ultrasonic treatment for 30 min in a 5% (V/V) detergent solution in deionized water. Then an oxygen plasma process was used to clean the ZnO and also increase the number of nucleation sites. In order to grow the nanowires, a thin Ga-doped ZnO (Ga:ZnO) seed layer was first co-electrodeposited, from a solution containing ZnO and Ga precursors, onto the pre-cleaned FTO at a constant potential of −1.3 V for 10 s. Similarly to a previously reported method,29 Ga:ZnO NW nanowire arrays (∼1 μm) were then deposited, from solutions containing varying concentrations of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (5 mM)–NaNO3 (50 mM) + Ga(NO3)3·xH2O, at −1.0 V and 85 °C, for investigation of the effects of doping with various ratios of [Ga]/[Zn]. The as prepared Ga:ZnO nanowires were finally annealed at 300 °C for 30 min in air.
Cu2O–Ga:ZnO nanowire synthesis
Cu2O was then electrodeposited from a solution containing CuSO4 (0.4 M)–lactic acid (3 M) onto the prepared Ga:ZnO nanowire arrays at 40 °C. The pH value was adjusted to 12.5 by the addition of 5 M NaOH solution. After the Cu2O electrodeposition, no further annealing of the Cu2O–Ga:ZnO NWs was performed. When studying the effects of oxygen plasma treatment, the annealed Ga:ZnO NWs were treated with oxygen plasma for 10 min at a high level, followed by Cu2O deposition at 1.0 mA cm−2, according to the method of Izaki.30 Another solution containing CuSO4 (0.4 M)–lactic acid (3 M) + ZnO powder (0.2 mg ml−1) was also prepared by heating at 40 °C with stirring for 4 hours, to grow Cu2O–Ga:ZnO nanowires.
Solar cell fabrication
Gold electrodes (0.07 cm2 illuminated area) were evaporated onto the Cu2O to form an ohmic contact by physical vapor deposition (PVD) under high vacuum (2.0 × 10−5 Pa).
Characterization of materials and devices
SEM images were measured using a JSM-6700F field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). The crystal structure of the Ga-doped ZnO NWs was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 nm). The extent of Ga doping was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded with ultraviolet-visible spectro-photometers at room temperature, and the background contribution of the FTO glass to the absorption spectra was eliminated.
Evaluation of device performance
Impedance was measured using an Agilent 4294 Precision Impedance Analyzer. For each frequency scan, 66 data points were measured on a logarithmic scale and recorded. The impedance data were fit to a proper equivalent circuit with Z-Plot fitting software. Current density–voltage measurements were performed using a Keithley 2420 Source Meter. A solar simulator equipped with AM 1.5G filters was used at 100 mW cm−2 intensity.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effects of Ga doping on the properties of ZnO NWs
The effects of Ga doping on the structure and morphology of ZnO NWs were studied with SEM. The SEM image in Fig. 2a shows that electrochemically deposited ZnO without Ga doping has a well-defined nanowire structure with an average diameter of 200 nm. The cross section SEM image in Fig. 2b shows that the ZnO nanowires are vertically aligned in a perpendicular direction to the FTO glass, with a length of ∼1 μm. With 2.5% Ga doping (molar ratio of Ga precursor to the ZnO precursor), the Ga:ZnO NWs retain their well defined configuration of nanowire arrays with an average diameter of 180 nm, which is slightly smaller than that of the plain ZnO nanowires shown in Fig. 2a. With Ga doping increased to a higher level of 10%, the Ga:ZnO still retains the vertically aligned configuration of nanowire arrays, but the average diameter decreases to ∼150 nm. XPS elemental analysis, as shown in the ESI†, indicates that Ga is present in the Ga:ZnO NWs with [Ga]/[Zn] ratios of 0.9% to 7.1%. These results clearly confirm the successful fabrication of Ga:ZnO NWs on FTO glass.

The effect of Ga doping on the crystal structure of the ZnO NWs was investigated by XRD as shown in Fig. 3a. Plain undoped ZnO NWs on FTO glass exhibit two strong XRD peaks with 2θ at 34.55° and 36.38°, corresponding to the (002) and (101) crystalline planes, respectively, which is consistent with wurtzite ZnO (JCPDS 36-1451). With Ga doping from 0% to 10%, although the Ga:ZnO NWs retain the original XRD peaks observed for the undoped ZnO NWs, their (002) crystalline plane peak corresponding to the c-axis orientation increases gradually, indicating that Ga doping promotes the c-axis growth of ZnO NWs but doesn't affect the crystal structure of ZnO NWs.31 The XRD patterns also show that no Ga oxide formed during Ga doping. The O1s binding energies of the undoped and 2.5% Ga doped ZnO NWs, as measured by XPS (Fig. 3b), can be divided into two curves with peaks centered at 530.2 and 531.7 eV, respectively, by Gaussian fitting. The lower binding energy curve (OI) should come from the binding between O2− and Zn2+ (or substitutional Ga3+) ions in the hexagonal ZnO. In contrast, the higher binding energy (OII) corresponds to oxygen vacancies, and the relative intensity of the OII–OI emission curves is reduced for the 2.5% Ga doped ZnO NWs. This can be attributed to the stronger binding of Ga dopant with oxygen from its higher binding energy, while consequently suppressing oxygen vacancies. This phenomenon is in good agreement with that reported for Ga-doped ZnO nanorods grown by magnetron sputtering.32

(c) Absorption spectra of different Ga-doped ZnO NWs and undoped ZnO film. (d) Absorption optical bandgap modulating effect at different Ga doping levels. 
The optical properties of the Ga:ZnO NWs were examined by UV-vis absorption measurement as shown in Fig. 3c and d. The light absorption of the ZnO NWs is stronger than that of the ZnO film over the wavelength range of 400 to 700 nm, indicating the enhanced light utilization of the nanowire arrays. The visible light adsorption of the ZnO NWs increases with increasing Ga doping up to 2.5%, and then decreases with a further increase in Ga doping. The absorption optical bandgap can be determined from the absorption spectra by linear extrapolation of the absorption edge and the weak absorption area. The calculated absorption optical bandgap for the plain ZnO NWs is around 3.21 eV, which is in good agreement with that reported.33 Ga doping reduces the absorption optical bandgap of the ZnO NWs down to between 3.14 and 3.21 eV, and the lowest value of 3.14 eV is observed for the 2.5% Ga-doped Ga:ZnO NWs. The change in the absorption optical bandgap induced by Ga doping can be ascribed to the doping-induced bandgap renormalization (BGR) effect, which is related to the free electron density.34 Simulation results have proved that Ga can behave as an electron donor to the ZnO lattice, and in doing so greatly increases the free electron density of the ZnO,35 which produces many-body effects that renormalize the bandgap by lowering the bandgap energy of the ZnO NWs, leading to a red shift in the light adsorption. It has also been reported that Ga doping can affect the Fermi level of ∼1.73 eV, but with little effect on the built-in potential and the open circuit voltage.36 On the other hand, Ga doping can also decrease the diameter of the ZnO NWs which could possibly lead to increased light scattering. These two factors, the Ga doping-induced red shift from BGR and the increased light scattering from the reduced diameter of the ZnO NWs, can compete against each other, resulting in the lowest adsorption bandgap value of Ga:ZnO NWs being observed at 2.5% Ga doping. These optical results also suggest that the bandgap of Ga:ZnO NWs can be tuned through Ga doping.
3.2. Unique nanostructured Cu2O–Ga:ZnO NW solar cells
The device architecture is schematically shown in Fig. 4a, and the corresponding SEM cross section image of the Cu2O–Ga:ZnO NWs heterojunction is displayed in Fig. 4b. The electrodeposited Cu2O has a dense structure with a thickness of ∼2 μm and completely fills the space surrounding the Ga:ZnO NWs, forming a continuous heterojunction. The interface is without any obvious voids or gaps between the Ga:ZnO NWs and the Cu2O, which can be clearly seen from the high magnification SEM shown in Fig. 4c. XRD was used to study the crystal structure of the Cu2O film as presented in Fig. 4d. All of the peaks of the Cu2O film can be attributed to cubic Cu2O (JCPDS 78-2076). The corresponding lattice spacing is 4.27 Å for the (111) crystalline plane (Fig. 4e), which is close to that for the (002) plane of the ZnO, i.e. these two planes have a matching atomic arrangement at the interface.

3.3. Performance evaluations of the Cu2O–Ga:ZnO NW solar cells
The J–V characteristics of the solar cells under AM 1.5G illumination are shown in Fig. 5. For the Cu2O–ZnO NW solar cell without Ga doping, a Jsc of 1.63 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.30 V, a fill factor (FF) of 26% and a PCE of 0.12% were obtained. With Ga doping, the Cu2O–Ga:ZnO NW solar cell could achieve a Jsc of 3.24 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 0.25%, both of which are up to two times greater than that of the Cu2O–ZnO NW solar cell without Ga doping, while retaining the same Voc and FF. The effect of the Ga doping level on the device performance was also investigated. By plotting the normalized PCE (over that of the device without Ga doping) against the Ga doping level (ratio of [Ga]/[Zn]), it can be found that the PCE increases with an increase in Ga doping up to a level of 2.5%, and then decreases with any further increase in Ga doping. This observation can be explained well by examination of the SEM, XRD and UV-vis absorption characterization results in Fig. 2 and 3. As Ga is an electron donor to the ZnO lattice, Ga doping increases the free electron density of ZnO, which induces a lower ZnO bandgap leading to enhanced light adsorption. Additionally, in comparison to that of the ZnO NWs, the Ga-doped ZnO NWs have increased nanowire density (1.6 × 1013 m−2 vs. 1.4 × 1013 m−2), leading to an increased interfacial area between the ZnO and the Cu2O. These altered properties of the ZnO NWs induced by 2.5% Ga doping thus synergistically deliver the highest PCE performance of the tested solar cells. However, any further increase (>2.5%) in Ga doping may increase the impurities in the ZnO crystal structure, which can result in reduction of electron mobility. Similar phenomena have also been observed in chemical vapor deposited Ga-doped ZnO.24 The reduced electron mobility with higher levels of Ga doping might be the reason for the decreased PCEs of the solar cells.

Impedance spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the investigation of the behaviors of interfaces in solar cells.37,38 In the characterization of a solar cell, the most significant voltage under steady-state conditions is that between the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit voltage. Thus in this study, all impedance spectra were measured in darkness in the range of 0.05 V to 0.30 V.39 The Nyquist plots in Fig. 6 show the typical features of p–n junctions, which consist of a large and low frequency arc. Equivalent circuits consisting of a resistor in series with a parallel combination of a resistor and a capacitor generally describe these junctions.40–42 The series resistor (Rseries) describes the resistance of the collection electrode and the parallel resistor (R and Rrec) characterizes the leakage and recombination paths through the cells. The parallel capacitor represents the capacitance resulting from the depletion region of the p–n junction. Typically there may be multiple interface states with a significant spread in time constants. To account for this time constant distribution in the electrical properties at the interface, a constant phase element (CPE) can be used to replace a simple capacitor, as shown in the inset of Fig. 6a. The impedance of the CPE is defined as 
ZCPE = 1/Q0(ωτ)n
(1)where ω is the frequency and n is a parameter from 0 to 1. The case n = 1 describes an ideal capacitor while the case n = 0 describes a pure resistor. Q0 = 1/|Z| at ω = 1 rad s−1. In Fig. 6a and b, the experimental data and the fitting plots represented by solid lines are in good agreement, confirming the suitability of the equivalent circuit model used.

As shown in Fig. 6, all of the impedance spectra have two arcs, where the high and low frequency arcs are attributed to the Schottky barrier between ZnO and the FTO layer and the p–n junction between ZnO and the Cu2O layer, respectively.18 Under bias, the dark current of a solar cell flows in an opposing direction to the photogenerated current for a lattice-mismatched Cu2O–ZnO NW heterojunction, which should result in charge recombination at the Cu2O/ZnO NWs interface.43 The value of the parallel resistor (Rrec), which provides a measure of the resistance to the charge recombination, is 21.88 kΩ and 44.27 kΩ for Cu2O–ZnO NW and Ga-doped Cu2O–ZnO NW solar cells, respectively, suggesting that Ga doping can significantly suppress charge recombination. The mechanism of the suppressed charge recombination can be further explained by the schematic illustration shown in Fig. 7b. The Ga doping increases the Fermi level, thus making it more difficult for the separated electrons at the Fermi level to recombine with the holes at the valence band, resulting in the more efficient suppression of the charge recombination process. This argument is well supported by the larger charge recombination resistance obtained from the impedance measurements (Fig. 6) and much larger photocurrent (Fig. 5a).

The dashed line (purple) shows the energy levels of undoped ZnO nanowires. 
To further improve the solar cell performance, buffered solution and oxygen plasma treatments were used to decrease the interface defect density between the ZnO NWs and Cu2O. The working mechanism of the Ga-doped Cu2O–ZnO NW solar cells with an improved Cu2O/ZnO interface is also shown schematically in Fig. 7b. During the fabrication of the device, the Cu2O film was electrodeposited at a pH of 12.5, which could etch the metastable polar (002) plane of ZnO NWs44 and induce defect states, leading to the removal of electrons from the depletion region and bending the energy bands upwards. Likewise, the defect states near the interface could facilitate carrier tunneling to the interface enabling recombination. Therefore, ZnO powder buffered solution was applied to reduce the etching of the (002) plane of the ZnO NWs in order to decrease the number of interface defects (highlighted with green in Fig. 7b). Ga-doped Cu2O–ZnO NW solar cells fabricated with the ZnO powder buffered solution treatment step achieved a Jsc of 5.31 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.21 V, FF of 27% and a PCE of 0.30% (Fig. 7a), which is 20% higher than that of the same solar cell fabricated without the buffered solution treatment. Together with the buffered solution approach, oxygen plasma treatment was explored to further improve the interface properties, in which ZnO NWs were treated with oxygen plasma, followed by electrodeposition of Cu2O with ZnO powder buffered solution. The PCE of the resulting devices was improved to 0.34%, which is 36% higher than that of Ga-doped Cu2O–ZnO NW solar cells fabricated without the oxygen plasma and ZnO powder buffered solution treatments (Fig. 7a). It is known that oxygen plasma can reduce the surface dangling bond and the density of defect sites (e.g. vacancies) of metal oxides such as ZnO,45 resulting in an improved interface and a reduced charge recombination for higher device performance (also shown in Fig. 7b). Significantly, Ga-doping (0.25%) in addition to surface treatment greatly reduces charge recombination resulting in the achievement of the highest power conversion efficiency (0.34%) yet for an all electrodeposited Cu2O–ZnO NW solar cell.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we report a high-performance Cu2O–ZnO NW heterojunction solar cell, fabricated solely by electrochemical deposition with the inclusion of Ga doping in aqueous solution. Ga doping greatly enhances the light utilization of the ZnO NWs while significantly suppressing charge recombination. Solar cells with 2.5% Ga doping (molar ratio of [Ga]/[Zn]) delivered a Jsc of 3.24 mA cm−2 and a PCE of up to 0.25%, which is significantly higher than the equivalent undoped solar cells. Moreover, by utilizing ZnO powder buffered Cu2O deposition and oxygen plasma treatment to reduce the density of interface defect sites, we have successfully further enhanced the PCE of the Ga-doped Cu2O–ZnO NW solar cells to 0.34%, which is the highest power conversion efficiency achieved by an all-electrodeposited Cu2O–ZnO NW solar cell. This work represents significant progress in the development of low-cost and high-performance inorganic solar cells, offering great potential for the large-scale production of such a photovoltaic device.
