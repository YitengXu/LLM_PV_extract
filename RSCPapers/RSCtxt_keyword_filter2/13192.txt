    , Accepted 3rd January 2017First published on 3rd January 2017AbstractA small molecule/fullerene binary acceptor system was developed for achieving high performance polymer solar cells. The additional blended small molecule acceptor not only improved the utilization of solar energy, but also achieved balanced carrier mobilities, leading to a significantly enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 9.55%.
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology has been extensively studied due to its capability of high-throughput, roll-to-roll and printing manufacturing of flexible solar modules.1 Numerous efforts have been directed toward developing light-harvesting materials, interfacial modification methods, morphology engineering and new device architectures.2–8 High power conversion efficiencies (PCE) exceeding 11% have been achieved for both single-junction devices and tandem cells.9,10 Alternatively, ternary blend OPV devices have emerged as a promising way to improve the utilization of solar energy by incorporating multiple light-harvesting materials in single-junction devices, leading to high short-circuit current densities (JSC) and PCE values.11 Commonly, the third components are utilized to complement or extend the absorption scope of the polymer/fullerene hosts. In addition, their functions in improving charge transport, film morphology and exciton dissociation have been explored.11–14
One mostly adopted ternary blend system is that an active layer containing two donors and one fullerene acceptor. In these systems, increasing the hole mobility (μh) by selecting the third component appropriately is an important method in enhancing the device performance.11 However, we should note that the commonly utilized high efficiency polymer/fullerene blend films generally show a much larger μh than electron mobility (μe). Thus, adding a third component to increase μe, such as another electron acceptor, might also be attractive to enhance the device efficiency via balancing the charge transportation, which is believed to be beneficial for reducing exciton recombination. Nevertheless, such a trial still remains to be attempted yet. The studies on binary acceptor systems are quite limited, mainly owing to the lack of efficient acceptors. Most of the previous cases were based on fullerene derivatives.15–19 For example, a typical system is a blend of a small amount of indene–C60 bisadduct (ICBA) in the donor/[6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) host system.19 The high lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of ICBA provides an opportunity to pin the open circuit voltage (VOC) to higher values, but the relatively lower electron mobility of ICBA appears to be not helpful for balancing the charge transport.16,20 Another limit for the binary fullerene acceptor system is that the weak absorption of fullerene derivatives fails to provide a real “complementary absorption”, which is a widely adopted strategy in designing ternary blend systems with two donor materials.21 As far as we know, no enhanced efficiency over 9% has been reported for the ternary system with two kinds of fullerene acceptors, as summarized in Table S1 (ESI).† Alternatively, recently developed high performance non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) provide a broad idea for designing novel ternary blend systems.22,23 By the utilization of NFAs as the third component, significantly enhanced PCE values up to 10% have been achieved through the extended light absorption.24,25 We proposed a novel ternary blend strategy to balance the carrier mobility by blending a small molecule acceptor into the polymer/fullerene host. The novel ternary system consists of a high efficiency donor polymer, poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th), a fullerene derivative PC71BM, and a rationally designed small molecule acceptor (RTCN). The material structures are depicted in Fig. 1a. The suitable energy levels of RTCN provide extra exciton dissociation at PTB7-Th/RTCN interfaces in the ternary blend films. A significantly enhanced PCE from 8.50% to 9.55% has been demonstrated by blending a small amount of RTCN into the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system. Our results have revealed that the blended RTCN can not only lead to an enhanced utilization of solar energy but also balance the charge transport properties.
 Fig. 1  (a) Chemical structures of the active layer components employed: electron-donor (PTB7-Th) and -acceptors (RTCN and PC71BM); (b) energy-level diagrams of the inverted device components. The energy levels for RTCN were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The energy levels for other layers were from the literature.26,27 (c) Normalized UV-vis absorption for PTB7-Th (red triangles) and polystyrene: RTCN film (1:0.2, w/w) (blue squares); (d) the PL spectra for neat PTB7-Th films (black line), PTB7-Th/RTCN blend films of 1:0.1 (red line), 1:0.2 (blue line), 1:0.3 (green line) and 1:0.4 (violet line), respectively. 
The synthetic procedures for RTCN are depicted in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The electrochemical properties of RTCN were studied by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method, and the corresponding CV curves are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). RTCN features the LUMO level of −3.83 eV, and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of −5.91 eV. The strong electron-withdrawing properties of dicyano-end-cappers effectively decrease the energy level values. Compared to the donor polymer, the low lying energy level suggests its n-type properties, which appear to be suitable to transport electrons. The energy diagrams for ternary blend solar cells are sketched in Fig. 1b. A typical inverted structure with a sol–gel ZnO film as the electron extraction layer was utilized.27 The similar LUMO energy levels of RTCN and PC71BM hinder the possible charge transfer from each other, and both of them should work as acceptors separately in the ternary blend films. This was confirmed by the study of RTCN/PC71BM binary OPV devices where no photovoltaic behaviour was found (Fig. S2a, ESI†). The UV-vis spectra of RTCN dispersed in polystyrene, together with the spectra of a neat PTB7-Th film are presented in Fig. 1c. The absorption spectrum of RTCN is complementary to the spectra of PTB7-Th films. It is expected to increase solar energy absorption when used in the ternary blend solar cells.
To unravel the role of RTCN in the ternary blend system, it is essential to determine whether the PTB7-Th/RTCN blends have enough driving force for efficient exciton dissociation. The photoluminescence (PL) of PTB7-Th/RTCN blend films was studied first. As shown in Fig. 1d, the emission band of the PTB7-Th film was fully quenched when the RTCN blended ratio was up to 1:0.4, which can be attributed to the existent photo-induced charge transfer. Moreover, the emission peak of the PTB7-Th/RTCN blend was red-shifted by increasing the RTCN content, probably resulting from the radiative decay of charge transfer states at the interface between PTB7-Th and RTCN.28 This is also evidence to certify the existence of charge transfer at the PTB7-Th/RTCN interface.29 One direct method to determine the role of RTCN in the ternary blend is to prepare its binary solar cell devices as the reference. The devices were prepared with the structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:RTCN (1:1.5)/MoO3/Ag. The optimized device showed an average PCE of 3.90%, with a high open circuit (VOC) of 0.936 V, a JSC of 9.32 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 43.7%, as summarized in Table 1. The J–V characteristics of the champion PCE (3.96%) are shown in Fig. S2b (ESI†).

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to probe the morphology of the ternary blend films and the binary reference. The TEM images are shown in Fig. 2a–d. Less variation was observed between the PTB7-Th/PC71BM film and the ternary blend films when the blended RTCN ratio was less than 0.25 (Fig. 2a and b). However, enlarged domains could be found when the RTCN ratio was more than 0.30. In order to understand the origin of the large domains, the fluorescence confocal microscopy (FCM) images of PTB7-Th/PC71BM and PTB7-Th/PC71BM/RTCN blend films were investigated. In the case of PTB7-Th/PC71BM films and the ternary blend films with RTCN ratio less than 0.25, no fluorescence could be detected, which suggested that the intimate mixing of the components led to complete quenching of the RTCN excitations at the RTCN/PTB7-Th interfaces. The results also confirmed that no phase separation took place on the micrometer scale. In contrast, further increasing the RTCN contents up to 0.30 and 0.40 led to the formation of 10 micrometer-scale domains, which is in good agreement with the TEM results. To understand the morphology variations, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for PTB7-Th/PC71BM/RTCN mixtures (Fig. S5, ESI†) was performed. According to the DSC results, there was no endothermic peak of RTCN during the heating cycle with a RTCN ratio of 0.25 and pure PTB7-Th, which suggested that RTCN was not present as an individual phase in the blended layer when its weight ratios were less than 0.25. When the ratio was up to 0.30, an endothermic peak appeared for the 1:0.30 blended mixture, suggesting the existence of the individual phase of RTCN. Moreover, the crystalline RTCN phase in the 1:1.5:0.30 ternary blend film was detected by X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) measurements, as presented in Fig. S6 (ESI†), which matched well with morphological measurements and DSC results. All these tests confirmed that the appearance of crystalline RTCN generated a distinguished morphology at its ratio of more than 0.30. The crystalline RTCN was also confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The formed large RTCN domains were not favorable for high performance devices since they could bring about poor interfacial contact and strong charge recombination.
 Fig. 2  Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (a–d) and fluorescence confocal microscopy (FCM) images (e–h) of PTB7-Th:PC71BM = 1:1.5 (a and e), PTB7-Th:PC71BM:RTCN = 1:1.5:0.25 (b and f), PTB7-Th:PC71BM:RTCN = 1:1.5:0.30 (c and g) and PTB7-Th:PC71BM:RTCN = 1:1.5:0.40 (d and h) on ITO/ZnO substrates. 
As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), atomic force microscopy (AFM) was conducted to further understand the morphology variation after RTCN loading. A typical phase separated morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.25 nm was found for PTB7-Th/PC71BM binary films. The RMS roughness values for ternary blend films were 1.57 nm (0.10 RTCN loading), 1.58 nm (0.20 RTCN loading), 1.54 nm (0.25 RTCN loading), 1.68 nm (0.30 RTCN loading), and 3.31 nm (0.40 RTCN loading). Blending RTCN into PTB7-Th:PC71BM up to 1:1.5:0.30 leads to a slightly increased roughness, indicating enhanced phase separation with RTCN loading, which is believed to be beneficial for efficient charge transport. Large variation was found when the RTCN ratio was up to 0.40. An extremely rough surface possibly results in a poor interfacial contact with electrodes. Furthermore, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed to study the crystallite orientation in the binary and ternary blend films, which is shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). Compared to the PTB7-Th/PC71BM binary films, there were no obvious changes after RTCN loading, suggesting little influence of the blended RTCN components on the crystallite stacking and orientation.
Next, inverted solar cell devices with the structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:PC71BM together with various RTCN blending/MoO3/Ag were prepared. The average photovoltaic parameters (VOC, FF, JSC and PCE) of the ternary blend devices and PTB7-Th/PC71BM binary reference devices under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 are depicted in Fig. 3a (VOC and FF) and Fig. 3b (JSC and PCE). The overall PTB7-Th to PC71BM ratio was kept at 1:1.5 (w/w). The average J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3c, and the corresponding J–V curves for champion PCEs at various RTCN ratios are shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The PTB7-Th/PC71BM reference devices yielded an average PCE of 8.32% with a typical VOC of 0.789 V, a JSC of 15.61 mA cm−2 and a FF of 67.6%. Notably, additional incorporation of RTCN components into the ternary systems showed little influence on VOC, as presented in Fig. 3a (top), although the PTB7-Th/RTCN binary devices showed a high VOC of 0.936 V (Fig. S2b, ESI†) and a relatively low JSC of 9.32 mA cm−2 (Table 1). Generally, VOC is mainly determined by the difference between the LUMO level of acceptors and the HOMO level of the donors. But there are also other possible factors that can significantly influence VOC. In the case of PTB7-Th/RTCN, lots of large micrometer-scale RTCN crystals/domains were found, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The formed large domains would reduce the donor/acceptor interfaces. This is believed to be positive to enhance the carrier life time, thus resulting in a larger VOC, but the corresponding photocurrent is sacrificed.30,31 It is also reported that NFAs can achieve a larger VOC due to their less energy loss compared to the commonly utilized fullerene derivatives.32 However, for the ternary blends, PTB7-Th/PC71BM still dominates the main donor/acceptor interfaces of the blends as confirmed by the AFM and TEM results discussed above with only a slightly increased roughness due to the relatively low loading of RTCN. Moreover, RTCN and PC71BM show similar LUMO energy levels. So, negligible changes in the VOC were recorded for the ternary blends. As clearly demonstrated in Fig. 3b (top), JSC was enhanced significantly after the incorporation of a small amount of RTCN (0.10 to 0.25) into the host blends, which was the main reason for the enhanced PCE values. Higher RTCN blend ratios up to 0.30 led to a largely decreased JSC and FF. With 0.20 RTCN loading, the highest average PCE value of 9.39% was achieved with average parameters of VOC = 0.789 V, JSC = 17.27 mA cm−2 and FF = 68.9%. A champion PCE of 9.55% was achieved. Moreover, other PTB7-Th/PC71BM binary controlled devices with an equal combined acceptor ratio of 1:1.7 were prepared, exhibiting inferior performance relative to the 1:1.5 binary reference, as presented in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The figures of merit of the electrical characterization results are summarized in Table 1.

Each value is an average of 12 devices. (c) J–V characteristics under AM 1.5 G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 of the binary reference (1:1.5) and the ternary blend devices with various RTCN ratios. (d) External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the reference binary devices (1:1.5) and the ternary device with optimized RTCN loading (1:1.5:0.20). 
To understand the origin of enhanced JSC in the ternary blend devices, the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the optimized ternary blend device and binary reference were measured as shown in Fig. 3d. In contrast to the binary blend devices, the ternary one (1:1.5:0.20) exhibited an overall enhancement in their EQE response. According to the integration of EQE spectra from 300 to 850 nm, the calculated JSC values are 15.44 mA cm−2 and 17.35 mA cm−2 for binary reference devices and ternary devices, respectively. These results are consistent with the larger JSC of the ternary blend devices. The main contribution of enhanced JSC originated from the enhanced EQE response across the spectral range of 450–620 nm, which is mainly derived from the absorption band of RTCN as indicated in Fig. 1c and S12 (ESI†).
The charge transport properties of the binary and ternary blend films were studied by space-charge limited current (SCLC) measurements with the Mott–Gurney equation. The calculated carrier mobilities are summarized in Fig. 4a and Table 2. The tendency of μh increased slightly when RTCN loading was less than 0.25. The highest μh of (1.65 ± 0.35) × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved with 0.10 RTCN loading. The tendency of μe is strongly dependent on the RTCN ratio. With 0.20 RTCN blending, the highest average μe of (1.36 ± 0.55) × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 was recorded, which also provided a relatively balanced charge transportation with a μh/μe value of 1.35. The increased μe can be attributed to the enhanced n-type phase in the blends, which provides more channels to facilitate electron transport. Moreover, the improved donor/acceptor phase separation, suggested by AFM measurements, could be another important factor for the improved μe. The balanced carrier mobility is a positive factor to reduce exciton recombination, and is thus beneficial for enhancing the device performance. With higher RTCN loading up to 0.25 and 0.30, μe decreased significantly, resulting in extremely imbalanced charge carrier properties, which would cause strong charge recombination and is thus unfavorable for improving the device performance. As to the rapidly declining mobility with increasing the RTCN loading, we trust it is caused by the formed large RTCN crystals. As depicted in Fig. 2, the blended films show enhanced phase separation with increasing the contents of RTCN loading and separated large RTCN domains appear, especially for the blends of 1:1.5:0.30 and 1:1.5:0.40 (PTB7-Th:PC71BM:RTCN). The formed large crystals may play a role in causing poor interfacial contact with the electrodes thus leading to poor mobility and device performance. Such a trend is also reflected in the device efficiency difference for the blend films.

The photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves were plotted to unravel the exciton dissociation variations with 0.20 RTCN blending. Here, Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under light illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph = 0, and Va is the applied voltage. The Jph–Veff curves are shown in Fig. 4b. The Jph of the ternary blend device reaches saturation at lower Veff in comparison with that of the binary reference, suggesting a weaker bimolecular recombination and a more efficient charge collection.33,34 A larger saturated current density (Jsat, at 2.0 V) of 17.7 mA cm−2 is found for a ternary blend device in contrast to a Jsat of 16.57 mA cm−2 of the binary reference. Since Jsat is limited only by the total amounts of absorbed incident photons, the larger Jsat of the ternary blend device implies an enlarged overall exciton generation. Furthermore, the charge collection efficiency, which is determined from the ratio of JSC/Jsat, is calculated. In the current case, the JSC values for the PTB7-Th/PC71BM device and PTB7-Th/PC71BM/RTCN ternary blend device are 15.66 mA cm−2 and 17.10 mA cm−2, respectively. The charge collection efficiency under the short circuit condition for the binary device and the ternary device (1:1.5:0.20) is 94.5% and 96.7%, respectively. The incorporation of 0.20 RTCN into the PTB7-Th/PC71BM system not only enhanced the overall charge generation, but also improved the charge dissociation process, which can be attributed to the additional exciton dissociation at the PTB7-Th/RTCN interface.
The light intensity dependent JSC and VOC were tested to further understand the recombination dynamics process in the binary and ternary blend devices, and their fitting results are shown in Fig. 4c and d. The slope of VOCversus the natural logarithm of the light intensity is used to describe the competition between bimolecular and monomolecular recombination under open circuit conditions.35 The slopes for both cases happened to be 1.06 kT/q, which suggests perfect optimization of the interfacial layer and very weak monomolecular recombination. JSC as a function of illumination intensity has manifested that the deviation of the exponent from unity is attributed to the bimolecular recombination, space charge effects, and the variations in mobility between the two carriers.35,36 The resulting power value (α) is 1.04 for the ternary blend devices, slightly lower than that of their binary counterparts (α = 1.07). All in all, both JSC–light intensity results and Jph–Veff curves suggested reduced bimolecular recombination for the optimized ternary blend devices, which matched well with the mobility results.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated an efficient fullerene and small-molecule binary acceptor system for achieving high performance ternary blend polymer solar cells. The small-molecule electron acceptor, RTCN, was well designed to improve the overall incident photon harvesting ability of the PTB7-Th/PC71BM blends by complementing their absorption spectra. The additional generated charges at the PTB7-Th/RTCN interfaces resulted in significantly enhanced photocurrent. The optimized ratio for the ternary blend PTB7-Th:PC71BM:RTCN is 1:1.5:0.20, accomplishing a high PCE value of 9.55%. The balanced and improved charge carrier mobility are believed to be responsible for the boosted power conversion efficiency. Our results offer a facile strategy to generate high-performance polymer solar cells with the incorporation of efficient non-fullerene acceptors into a ternary blend system.
