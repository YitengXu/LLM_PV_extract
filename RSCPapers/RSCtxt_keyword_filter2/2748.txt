, Accepted 5th August 2013First published on 6th August 2013AbstractTwo new carbazole-based copolymers PT and PP carrying thienyl or phenyl, respectively, alternating segments and 4-nitrophenylcyanovinylene pendant groups attached to the carbazole nitrogen were synthesized and characterized. Their optical and electrochemical properties were investigated. Both copolymers showed broad absorption bands in the longer wavelength region, which is complementary to those of PC61BM and PC71BM acceptors, and showed optical band gaps about 1.64 eV and 1.69 eV for PT and PP, respectively. The deep lying HOMO energy level benefited a high open circuit voltage (Voc), leading to an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.19%, 2.98% 2.02% and 2.54% for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on PT:PC61BM, PT:PC71BM, PP:PC61BM and PP:PC71BM blends, respectively, processed from tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent. The BHJ solar cells based on PT:PC71BM and PP:PC71BM blends processed from THF and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) mixed solvents showed overall PCE of about 5.39% and 4.20%, respectively. The increase in the overall PCE for the BHJ devices based on solvent additives was attributed to the balanced charge transport in the devices.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) hold promise for a cost effective, lightweight solar energy converter, due to the simple solution processing of the active layer.1 Most OSCs are based on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) concept with an active layer of conjugated polymer donor and soluble fullerene derivative acceptor blend, an anode of transparent indium doped tin oxide (ITO) coated glass and a cathode of low work function.2 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs is determined by the short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of the device. Moreover, all of these parameters are dependent on the electrical properties of the conjugated polymers and the nanoscale morphology within the BHJ solar cells. In particular, the Voc of the BHJ solar cells is determined by the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the electron donor (polymer) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the electron acceptor (fullerene). Many efforts have been focused on the improvement of the PCE of these devices by designing new materials,3 device structures4 and processing techniques.5 In recent years the research devoted to this field, both in academia and industry (i.e. Solarmer Energy Inc. Kornaka Inc., Mitsubishi Chemical and Heliatek), resulted in devices with record PCE being reported for both PSCs and small molecule organic cells.6 As a result of these efforts, so far, PSCs based on conjugated polymers as electron donor material blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an electron acceptor material have yielded more than 8% PCE using a BHJ device structure.7
The most studied polymer–fullerene BHJ active layer is that of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61 or C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM or PC71BM), which favor the charge transfer from the LUMO of the photoexcited polymer to the LUMO of the acceptor, but it has proven difficult to improve the PCE of polymer solar cells based on P3HT beyond 5%. This is primarily due to its intrinsic limited absorption in the solar spectrum (band gap of ~1.90 eV) and relatively small energy difference between its HOMO and the LUMO of fullerene derivatives. These factors limit the overall PCE in terms of both Voc and Jsc. Therefore, to achieve a high PCE in the polymer BHJ solar cells, it is imperative to design new electron donating polymer materials that exhibit (i) strong and broad absorption to harvest more sunlight, (ii) high charge mobilities, and low lying HOMO energy levels, while keeping the band gap between 1.2 and 1.9 eV.8 One approach for obtaining low band gap copolymers is based on alternating donor (D)–acceptor (A) units along the polymer backbone, forming a partial charge separation between each moiety. This approach increases the HOMO level and at same time decreases the LUMO level, giving a low band gap material and red shifting the absorption spectrum of the copolymer due to the intramolecular charge transfer.9 Many D–A type copolymers have been used for OSCs and have achieved PCE above 7%.9
Recently, we have synthesized a series of novel low band gap copolymers which contain thiophene and pyrrole rings and used them as electron donors along with a modified PCBM as an electron acceptor and reported PCE of 4.14% with a solvent additive and subsequent thermal annealing of the BHJ active layer.10 Carbazole based polymers are among the most promising conjugated polymers used for optoelectronic devices11 due to their high hole mobility, good solution processability, deeper HOMO energy level and air stable features, which are derived from the nature of the carbazole unit, such as the rigid biphenyl unit, and the delocalization of the electron lone pair of the nitrogen atom over the aromatic structure. D–A copolymers based on a carbazole donor unit and various acceptors have been used as electron donor materials for polymer solar cells and have achieved initial PCE of 3.6% and this has subsequently been improved up to 6% by device structure optimization.12 The combination of the unique features of the 2,7-carbazole and the advantage of the main chain donor–side chain acceptor architecture offers promising donor materials for high efficiency polymer solar cells and have recently reached a PCE of 6.9%.12c It was expected that the combination of the excellent optoelectronic properties of the carbazole electron unit along with the merits of pendant-acceptor molecular design would lead to promising donor materials for BHJ organic solar cells. Recently, we have reported BHJ solar cells based on an A–D–A small molecule (donor) based on a 3,6-dithienyl carbazole donor unit at the center and a nitrophenyl acrylonitrile acceptor unit at the terminal ends and achieved PCE values of 3.76% and 4.96% using PC60BM and PC70BM as acceptors, respectively, when CN/THF was used a processing solvent.13 Continuing our research work, in the present investigation we have synthesized two new carbazole-based copolymers PT and PP having thienyl or phenyl, respectively, alternating segments and 4-nitrophenylcyanovinylene pendant groups attached to the carbazole nitrogen. These two alternating copolymers have a D–A architecture, since the carbazole and adjacent thiophene or phenyl segments behave as donors, while the 4-nitrophenylcyanovinylene pendant group attached to the carbazole nitrogen behaves as an acceptor. For the acceptor materials in BHJ organic solar cells, PC60BM offers the advantages of good solubility in organic solvents, high electron mobility, longer exciton diffusion length and high electron affinity. However, weak absorption in the visible region is the main drawback of PC61BM, which limits its contribution to light harvesting in the organic solar cells. In contrast, the other form of fullerene derivative PC71BM has a greater absorption in the visible region than PC61BM.14
Herein, we have used PT and PP copolymers as electron donors along with PC60BM and PC71BM as electron acceptors for the fabrication of BHJ solar cells. The PCE of the BHJ polymer solar cells based on PT:PC61BM, PT:PC71BM, PP:PC61BM and PP:PC71BM blends processed from THF solvent was 2.19%, 2.98%, 2.02% and 2.54%, respectively. Moreover, the BHJ devices based on PT:PC71BM and PP:PC71BM processed from CN/THF mixed solvents yielded PCE about 5.39% and 4.20%, respectively. This increase in the PCE has been attributed to the increase in hole mobility leading to the balance charge transport between hole and electrons in the BHJ device.

2.3 Characterization methods
1H NMR (400 MHz) spectra were obtained using a Bruker spectrometer. Chemical shifts (δ values) are given in parts per million with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. The electrochemical properties, i.e. onset oxidation and reduction potentials of copolymers, were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CH instruments). We used an electrochemical cell with a conventional three electrode assembly and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) (0.1 M) acting as the electrolyte in anhydrous acetonitrile solution. The voltammetric measurements were performed at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at room temperature. Copolymer was deposited on the glassy carbon electrode which was used as the working electrode, while a Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The optical absorption spectra of the pristine copolymer (in solution and thin film) and blended films were measured using a Perkin Elmer UV-Vis spectrophotometer.
The crystallinity of the thin films was studied using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique (PANalytical make, USA) having Cu-Kα, as radiation source of wavelength 1.5405 A with the film coated on quartz substrate.
2.4 Theoretical calculations
We have studied the PT and PP monomer structures theoretically within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). We have taken into account the structural flexibility of the structures by examining stereoisomers (rotamers) of structures PT and PP, which however are not many, as initial geometries for our calculations.
The first round of calculations was performed employing the gradient corrected functional PBE19 of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof. For each structure we have used several stereoisomers as initial geometries for the geometry optimizations. The TZVP basis set20 which is of triple-ζ quality was used throughout. The resolution of the identity method21 was used for the treatment of the two-electron integrals. The resulting structures were further optimized using both the hybrid exchange–correlation functional PBE022 (without adjustable parameters) of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof, as well as that of Becke, Lee, Yang and Parr, B3LYP,23 using the same basis set and also taking into account solvent effects. Tight convergence criteria were placed for the SCF energy (up to 10−7 Eh) and the one-electron density (rms of the density matrix up to 10−8) as well as for the norm of the Cartesian gradient (residual forces both average and maximum smaller than 1.5 × 10−5 a.u.) and residual displacements (both average and maximum smaller than 6 × 10−5 a.u.).
The TD-DFT excited state calculations have been performed using the same functionals on the corresponding ground state structures. In each case we have calculated the optical gap with and without the presence of solvents. For solvents we have used tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform (CF), and acetonitrile (AN) using the self-consistent reaction field solvent parameters as defined in the Gaussian 09 electronic structure package.24 The first round of geometry optimization was performed using the Turbomole package.25 All of the follow up calculations were performed using the Gaussian package.24
2.5 Device fabrication and characterization
The BHJ photovoltaic devices were fabricated with an indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate as the positive electrode and aluminium as the negative electrode. The patterned ITO glass substrate was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone, isopropanol and then dried at room temperature. A thin layer (60 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Bayon, Germany) was spin coated onto the ITO glass and baked at 80 °C for 20 min. A tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of blend copolymers (PT or PP):PC61BM or PC71BM (1:1 w/w) was subsequently spin coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer to form a photoactive layer. The thickness of the photoactive layers were about 80–85 nm. The deposition of all organic layers was carried out in ambient atmosphere. Aluminium (Al) was then evaporated onto the surface of the photoactive layer under vacuum of 10−5 Torr. The active area of the device was about 5 mm2. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured with a computer controlled Keithley 238 source meter unit. A xenon lamp coupled with AM1.5 solar spectrum filters was used as the light source and the optical power at the surface of device was 100 mW cm−2. All the measurements were also carried out in ambient conditions. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency of the device was measured by illuminating the device using a xenon lamp and a monochromator and the resulting current was recorded with a Keithley electrometer under short circuit conditions.
The thin film of the blend was cast from mixed solvents and is described as follows: the blend of the solution of PT:PC71BM and PP:PC71BM (1:1 w/w) was first prepared using THF solvent and stirred for 4 h. A 0.5 mL of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) was added to the blend solution prepared from the THF solvent and stirred for another 2 h.
Hole or electron only devices were fabricated using the configurations: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PT or PP or PT:PC71BM (85 nm)/Au for holes and Al/PT or PP:PC71BM (85 nm)/Al for electrons. Mobilities are extracted by fitting the current–voltage curves using the Mott–Gurney relationship (space charge limited current).26
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis of polymers
Scheme 1 outlines the synthesis of alternating copolymers PT and PP. The copolymers were obtained in 76% and 70% yield and had number-average molecular weights (Mn) of 13800 and 11 600 with a polydispersity of 2.3 and 2.1 for PT and PP, respectively. These copolymers were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and the data have already been described in the experimental section. Both of the copolymers were soluble in THF, chloroform and acetonitrile solvents but not in 1,2-dichlorobeneze.

3.2 Theoretical calculations
Having performed the geometry optimizations we set forth to calculated the optical gaps of the monomers, both in the gas phase as well as in the presence of solvents. All of the results are given in Tables 1 and 2. Since the PBE functional belongs to the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) family of functionals we would expect that the corresponding calculated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gap (HL gap) and the optical gap would be systematically underestimated compared to experimental values. However, from Table 1 we can see that the PBE functional values for the optical gap of the PT monomer are in exceptional agreement with the experimental values. This situation has also been encountered by Jacquemin et al.27 specifically for certain long-wavelength (560–640 nm) anthraquinone derivative compounds. Both hybrid functionals overestimate the optical gap by about 1.1 and 0.8 eV for PBE0 and B3LYP respectively. The situation holds for the PP monomer as well, with a slightly higher overestimation of the optical gaps, specifically 1.15 and 0.9 eV for PBE0 and B3LYP respectively.

A moderate increase in the dipole moment of the monomers is noted when solvent effects are taken into account with respect to gas phase values. The largest increase is computed using the PBE functional, ranging from 24.5% to 34.3%. For the hybrid functionals the increase ranges are 20.4%–28.7% and 21.9%–30.7% for PBE0 and B3LYP respectively. The dependence of the dipole moment on the dielectric constant of the solvent is monotonic but weak.
Fig. 1 shows the HOMOs and LUMOs of the two monomers. The HOMO of both monomers extends over the carbazole unit as well as over the thiophene or the phenyl groups for the PT and PP monomers respectively. A small contribution to the HOMO by the p-nitroacetonitrilebenzene (p-NNB) unit can also be distinguished in both cases. The LUMO is highly localized over the p-NNB units in both cases. The carbazole and thiophene units contribute 50.2% and 36.1% to the HOMO, respectively. The remaining 13.7% is the contribution of the p-NNB unit which is low but not negligible. The LUMO is significantly more localized on the p-NNB unit from which we find a 94.6% contribution. A 5% contribution is from the carbazole unit, but even this small value is localized on the region near the p-NNB unit. Similar, although varying, contributions from the subunits are found for the near HOMO orbitals. The first level encountered with a dominant contribution of 54% by the p-NNB is located at −7.8 eV. The situation is analogous for the PT monomer for which we find a 62% and 16.9% contribution to the HOMO by the carbazole and phenyl units respectively. The p-NNB unit contributes the remaining 21.1%, which is higher than the corresponding value for the PT monomer. Also, the first level encountered with a dominant contribution of 53.1% by the p-NNB is located at −7.6 eV.
 Fig. 1  (a) The frontier molecular orbitals of PT and PP monomers calculated from DFT calculations. 
We have calculated the UV/Visual absorption spectrum at the DFT/B3LYP level of theory using THF as a solvent for both of the PT and PP monomers, which we show in Fig. 2. The spectra have been produced by convoluting Gaussian functions with HWHM = 0.15 eV centered at the excitation wave numbers. The spectrum for the PT monomer exhibits three nicely distributed bands of high intensities which are centered at 280 nm (4.43 eV), 375 nm (3.30 eV), and 507 nm (2.45 eV). The spectrum of the PP monomer also exhibits three bands, however with peaks of varying intensities and with two of the bands adjacent. More specifically, two clear bands are centered at 270 nm (4.59 eV) and 480 nm (2.58 eV). The last band has a finer structure with peaks at 310 nm (4.0 eV) and 360 nm (3.44 eV).

Photophysical and electrochemical properties. The normalized optical absorption spectra of the PT and PP copolymers both in dilute THF solution and thin films cast from THF solvent are shown in Fig. 3a and 3b. All the photophysical characteristics are summarized in Table 3. The absorption curves were broad and extended from the visible to near infrared region of the solar spectrum. Both copolymers displayed an absorption band in the shorter wavelength region (460–490 nm), corresponding to the π–π* transition and in the longer wavelength region (650–680 nm) corresponding to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor (carbazole and thiophene or phenyl) to the acceptor (4-nitrophenylcyanovinylene) unit present in the copolymers. Moreover, carbazole derived copolymers exhibited a much enhanced and slightly red shifted intramolecular charge transfer absorption at longer wavelength region, as well as a lower oxidation potential being caused by the more efficient electron donating capability of the nitrogen atom on the 3,6-carbazole units. We found that the absorption peak corresponding to the longer wavelength region for PT copolymer was bathochromically shifted. This can be attributed to the enhanced intramolecular charge transfer due to the presence of thiophene in the electron donating segment in PT. The absorption peak for thin films of both copolymers was red shifted in the longer wavelength region, relative to that for solution. Both copolymers showed broad absorption spectra with an extended absorption edge in the thin film. The broader and better absorption in the solid state originates from the better planarity of the polymer and stronger electronic interaction between individual polymer chains in the thin film. The optical band gap of these copolymers was calculated from the absorption onset edge of the thin film using Eoptg = 1240/λonset with λonset being the absorption onset wavelength of the materials and were 1.64 eV and 1.69 eV for PT and PP, respectively, which are smaller than that for P3HT with 1.95–2.0 eV. The absorption band maxima of PT is more red shifted as compared to PP, which indicates that there is an excited state delocalization in the PT copolymer relative to PP due to the presence of the thiophene ring and more exciton interaction between adjacent π-conjugated chromophores in PT. The presence of the thiophene ring in the electron donating segment increases its electron donating ability and lowers the band gap, resulting in a red shift in the absorption maximum band. Moreover, it has been well established from our earlier reports that the presence of the cyanovinylene 4-nitrophenyl terminal moieties also affects the absorption spectra of the materials by red shifting and broadening.28 Both the copolymers exhibit a broad band absorption in the longer wavelength region and a low band gap as compared other carbazole based copolymers.

Cyclic voltammetry was employed to calculate the reduction and oxidation potential of copolymers and the corresponding LUMO and HOMO energy levels of copolymers. The onset oxidation potential (Eoxdonset) and reduction potential (Eredonset) observed from the cyclic voltammograms are summarized in Table 3.The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated from the following equations:29EHOMO = −(Eoxdonset + 4.7) eVELUMO = −(Eredonset + 4.7) eV
The calculated values of HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PT are −5.18 eV and −3.24 eV, respectively (Table 1). PP has HOMO and LUMO energy levels at −5.30 eV and −3.38 eV, respectively (Table 1). These values are in good agreement with those theoretically estimated. The electrochemical band gap estimated from the cyclic voltammetry measurement is 1.94 eV and 1.92 eV for PT and PP, respectively. The electrochemical band gap is slightly higher than the optical band gap. This is a common phenomenon in most of the organic materials due to their high binding energy.30 PT exhibits a smaller band gap compared to PP which reflects the stronger donor property of the electron donating segment due to the presence of the thiophene ring, thus increasing the HOMO level more than the LUMO level, leading to a decrease in the band gap as has been observed by Patil et al. in the case of copolymer based on diketopyrrolopyrrole.31 Moreover, the HOMO energy levels of PT and PP are lower than that of P3HT (−4.95 eV), indicating that these copolymers could have better air stability. Incorporation of the weak electron donating donor carbazole unit into the push pull conjugated backbone resulted in relatively low lying HOMO energy levels. The incorporation of a carbazole unit into the polymer helps to generate high Voc in the BHJ polymer solar cells.32 Moreover, the offsets between the LUMO energy levels of both PT and PP and fullerene derivatives, i.e. PC61BM and PC71BM, were larger than 0.3 eV, which would guarantee energetically favourable electron transfer in the BHJ active layers under illumination.

Electrical properties of PT and PP. The focus of this paper is to use these two copolymers as electron donors for BHJ polymer solar cells. Therefore, we have fabricated the device having a ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PT or PP/Al configuration and measured their current–voltage (J–V) characteristics in dark (Fig. 4). The J–V characteristics of both devices in the dark showed a rectification effect, when a positive potential is applied to the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode with respect to the Al electrode. Since the HOMO level of both copolymers is very close to the work function of PEDOT:PSS (−5.1 eV), this electrode behaves as an ohmic contact for the hole injection from PEDOT:PSS into the HOMO level of the copolymers. On the other hand, the LUMO level of the copolymers is very far from the work function of the Al electrode (−4. 2 eV) and forms a Schottky barrier for electron injection from Al into the LUMO level of copolymers. Therefore, the rectification is due to the formation of a Schottky barrier at the interface between Al and the copolymers in the respective devices.

Photovoltaic properties of BHJ solar cells. We have used PC61BM and PC71BM as electron acceptors along with the PT and PP as electron donors. Fig. 5 shows the optical absorption spectra of PT:PC61BM and PT:PC71BM blend cast from THF solvent. Similar absorption spectra were observed for PP:PC71BM and PP:PC71BM. The absorption spectrum of the blend shows two bands, i.e. one in the shorter wavelength region corresponding to the fullerene derivative and another in the longer wavelength region corresponding to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) band of the copolymer. A broader absorption covering from the visible to the near infrared part of the solar spectrum is observed for both copolymer:PC71BM blends due to the absorption of PC71BM in the wavelength region below 550 nm. It can be seen from the absorption spectrum of the blend with PC71BM that the absorption band is broader than that of the blend with PC61BM, indicating a higher light harvesting efficiency and an exciton generation in the copolymer:PC71BM blend. The use of PC71BM as an acceptor in the BHJ active layer can complement the valley between the π–π* transition absorption band and the ICT absorption band of the copolymers, thereby contributing to the photocurrent in the BHJ solar cells. Therefore, we expect a higher Jsc for the BHJ solar cell based on an active layer with PC71BM.

The J–V characteristics of the BHJ solar cells based on the BHJ active layers processed from THF solvent are shown in Fig. 6a and 6b and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters, i.e. short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are summarized in Table 4. The PCE for the organic solar cells fabricated with PT:PC61BM, PT:PC71BM, PP:PC61BM and PP:PC71BM are 2.19%, 2.98% 2.02% and 2.54%, respectively. It can be seen from these figures and Table 4 that the photovoltaic devices based on copolymer PT as electron donor either using PC61BM or PC71BM as electron acceptor in the BHJ active layer showed higher values of Jsc, FF and PCE. This has been attributed to the higher energy separation between the LUMO level of the fullerene derivatives and PT, as compared to that for PP. Since the driving force for the photoinduced charge separation at the D/A interfaces is directly correlated with this difference, the photoinduced charge separation is more efficient for the device based on PT as compared to PP as electron donor. The value of Voc for photovoltaic devices with PP is higher than that for PT, which is in agreement with the values of the HOMO levels of PT and PP (as discussed earlier), since the Voc in the BHJ organic solar cell is related to the energy difference between the LUMO level of the acceptor and the HOMO level of the donor. For both copolymers, the BHJ solar cells exhibited high Voc approaching 0.80 V, which is comparable to BHJ organic solar cells based on other pendant carbazole derived copolymers.30 The IPCE of the solar cell based on a BHJ active layer with PC71BM showed a broader shape as compared to that for PC61BM (as shown in Fig. 7) which is also consistent with the observed values of Jsc.

The PCE for the photovoltaic devices is higher for PC71BM as electron acceptor as compared to its PC60BM counterpart irrespective of whether PT or PP is used as the electron donor. The performance of the organic solar cell is mainly determined by the photon harvesting efficiency of the BHJ active layer (light absorption and exciton generation), separation and transport of charge carriers. Our results show that the PCE of the devices based on PC70BM as the electron acceptor is better than that of PC61BM due to the increase in Jsc and FF. The increase in the Jsc for the devices based on the PC71BM acceptor compared to that for PC61BM can be attributed to the higher absorption of PC71BM in the visible region as compared to that for PC61BM, which causes an enhancement in the light harvesting properties. Moreover, PC71BM has higher solubility in THF than PC61BM which leads to high molecular intermixing between the donor and acceptor, resulting in an increase in the interfacial area for exciton dissociation into free electrons and holes. These effects enhance the Jsc and FF, and result in higher PCE for the devices based on PC71BM as electron acceptor. As can be seen from Table 4, the Voc is almost the same for the devices based on PC61BM or PC71BM, which may be attributed to the same LUMO level for both acceptors.
The best performance of the BHJ device was obtained from the PT:PC71BM blend processed from THF solvent with Voc = 0.76 V, Jsc = 8.16 mA cm−2, FF = 0.48 and PCE = 2.98%. The FF of the device remains low due to the low hole mobility of PT.23 The value of Voc is 0.47 V smaller than that estimated from the energy gap (~1.23 eV) between the LUMO of PCBM and HOMO of PT. These results indicated that the recombination reactions between photoinduced electrons and holes are dominant in the devices based on the blend processed from the THF solvent.33
The PCE of the BHJ solar cells based on these two copolymers i.e. PT and PP as electron donors and PC61BM or PC71BM is still low. The two phase morphologies of the BHJ active layer play an important role in the performance of the BHJ photovoltaic devices. Many methods have been explored towards the aim of achieving the nanoscale bi-continuous morphology including choice of casting solvents,34 thermal35 and solvent annealing.36 These strategies have been found effective for controlling the morphology and performance of BHJ devices based on P3HT:fullerene derivatives but are less effective for low band gap D–A copolymers. The most versatile and widely employed technique however is the use of a solvent additive during film deposition, which increases the solar cell efficiency by modifying the donor and acceptor phases. In the case of some D–A copolymers, it has been found that processing of the polymer:fullerene blend film from a binary solvent mixture containing a small amount of a higher boiling point additive, which is good solvent of fullerene but a bad solvent for the polymer, can improve the photovoltaic performance of polymer solar cells. Initial investigations suggested that the role of the processing additive in controlling the two phase nanoscale morphology was to increase the domain size of the polymer and/or the fullerene. The domain size of the polymer was controlled by enhancing the aggregation during the spin coating and drying while delaying the aggregation of fullerene by virtue of its selective solubility in the higher boiling point additive. Among various processing additives, the diiodoalkanes were used frequently. The incorporation of diiodoalkanes alters the phase separated nanoscale morphology in the BHJ active layers based on the polymer:fullerene device due to selective solubility, i.e. it is a poor solvent for the polymer but a good solvent for fullerene derivatives.37,38 On the other hand, 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) has good solubility for both polymer and fullerene and allowed each component to mix well in the blend.39
The J–V characteristics of BHJ polymer photovoltaic devices based on a CN/THF processed blend are also shown in Fig. 6a and 6b and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are also compiled in Table 4. It can be seen from these figures and Table 4 that all the photovoltaic parameters i.e. Jsc, Voc and FF have been improved for the devices processed from the CN/THF cast blend, resulting in an overall PCE of 5.39% and 4.20% for the PT:PC71BM and PP:PC71BM based devices, respectively. The higher IPCE values of the device with the CN/THF cast blend film (as shown in Fig. 7) also confirm the observed higher value of Jsc. The increase in the PCE has been attributed to the increase in the crystallinity of the BHJ active layer and balanced charge transport in the devices, upon the addition of CN additive, as discussed in the latter part of the manuscript.
The optical absorption spectra of the BHJ active layer thin films cast from THF and CN/THF are shown in Fig. 5. As shown in this figure, in the PT:PC71BM blend cast from CN/THF, the absorption peak in the longer wavelength region which corresponds to PT shows a red shift and also the absorption coefficient increases. In addition, the PT:PC71BM blend cast from CN/THF solution shows a vibronic shoulder around 690 nm. These observations indicate the increase in the crystallinity due to the enhanced interchain π–π* stacking as has been observed in other polymers.40 Similar results were also observed for PP:PC71BM film. The improved crystallinity of the copolymer, facilitated through self organised chain stacking, enhances the light harvesting capabilities thus improving the Jsc.
Evidence for the change in the crystallinity of the BHJ active layer, upon the CN additive, was obtained by recording the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the thin film of PT and PT:PC71BM processed from THF and CN/THF (Fig. 8). The pristine PT cast from THF showed a peak at 2θ = 7.17°. However, when the PT is blended with PC70BM, the diffraction peak which corresponds to PT becomes weak suggesting an effective mixing of PC71BM with the copolymer. When the PT:PC71BM film is processed from CN/THF, the diffraction peak centred at 2θ = 7.17° reappears and is slightly shifted to a higher value of 2θ. This indicates the blend film cast from the THF solvent was not sufficiently crystallized. But on the addition of a small amount of CN in the host solvent, the blend recrystallized due to the high boiling point of CN, which evaporates slowly. The decrease in the full width at half maximum of the XRD pattern upon the addition of CN also indicated an improvement in the crystallinity of PP. This is in agreement with the increased optical absorbance of the blend in the absorption band that corresponds to the copolymer. The XRD peak of the blend film processed with CN additive shifted from 2θ = 7.17° (corresponding to an interlayer spacing of 14.45 A) to 2θ = 7.23° (corresponding to an interlayer spacing of 14.36 A). Similar XRD results were observed for the PP:PC71BM blend. The reduction of interlayer spacing in the blend film with CN additive may be beneficial for improving the charge transport.

The charge transport i.e. the transportation of electrons and holes towards cathode and anode plays an important role in the overall PCE of the BHJ solar cells. The PCE of the BHJ solar cells is governed by the balance between the transport and recombination of charge carriers. The imbalance in the mobilities of holes and electrons contribute to the large recombination, which results in the lower Jsc and PCE. We have estimated the electron and hole mobilities in the BHJ layers processed from THF and CN/THF solvent, from the space charge limited current (SCLC) current–voltage characteristics measured in the dark for electron only and hole only devices, respectively,26 using the Mott–Gurney square law and the current is given byJ = (9/8)εrεoμ(V2/d3)where V is the applied voltage corrected for built in voltage arising from the difference between the work function of electrodes, εo is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the active layer and taken as 3.5, μ is the charge carrier mobility and d is the thickness of the active layer. The hole and electron mobilities estimated using the current–voltage characteristics of hole only and electron only devices and the above equation are listed in Table 5. The hole mobility for CN additive films increased by a factor of 43 and 45, for PP:PC71BM and PT:PC71BM blends, respectively. However, the electron mobility has been decreased by a factor of about three. We assume that the increase in the self ordering in the donor phase probably causes a decrease in the ordering of the acceptor phase, which leads to the reduction in electron mobility. The simultaneous increase in hole mobility in the donor phase and slight decrease in the electron mobility in the acceptor phase leads to a more balanced hole and electron transport which is beneficial to the enhancement of Jsc and FF. The ratio between electron mobility and hole mobility for PT:PC71BM and PP:PC71BM blends is 122 and 146, respectively. In the case of BHJ polymer solar cells processed with THF only, the space charges remain in the device due to an imbalance between the electron and hole mobilities (high ratio between electron and hole mobilities), the photoinduced charge carriers are not fully extracted and do not produce enough current. In this case, the possibility of recombination between the holes and electrons at donor–acceptor interfaces may increase, resulting in low Jsc and FF. However, when the blends are processed from the CN/THF solvent, this ratio is reduced to 1.54 and 1.24 for PP:PC71BM and PT:PC71BM, respectively. The reduced value of this ratio reduced the space charge and recombination of the photo-induced electrons and holes at the interface in the BHJ solar cells and increases the Jsc and PCE.

CN additives can improve the film quality of BHJ films and thus enhance the photovoltaic performance. The AFM images of the PT:PC71BM cast from THF and CN/THF are shown in Fig. 9. The PT:PC71BM film cast from THF exhibits unevenly aggregated polymer and PCBM domains with root mean square (rms) surface roughness about 3.45 nm. This adverse morphology reduces the effective D/A interfacial area and limits the exciton dissociation probability resulting in exciton loss and poor charge mobility.41,42 In contrast, with the addition of CN the blend film results in a smoother surface (rms surface roughness of 2.34 nm). Similar AFM images have been observed for PP:PC71BM blends. This may be because of good solubility of the fullerene derivatives in the high boiling point additives which improves the miscibility of copolymer and fullerene derivatives. This increases the interfacial area of D/A and leads to a more efficient exciton dissociation which in turn leads to enhancement in Jsc and FF.

The dark current in the reverse bias is a measure leakage of current related to the recombination process. We have measured the J–V characteristics in the dark and found that the dark current for the device based on the CN/THF cast BHJ layer is lower than for that cast from THF. This also indicates that addition of solvent additives provides more effective charge transport in the device.
It has been reported that in BHJ polymer solar cells, the Voc also depends on the charge transfer interaction between polymer and fullerene, in addition to the HOMO–LUMO difference.43 The Voc for a BHJ device is given byVoc = (nkT/q)LN(Jsc/Jo) + ΔEDA/2q
Here n is the diode ideality factor, k is Boltzmann's constant, Jo is the reverse saturation current, T is the temperature in kelvin and ΔEDA is the interfacial energy gap between donor and acceptor. The above equation suggests a linear dependence of Voc on ΔEDA. Since ΔEDA is the same for both THF and CN/THF cast BHJ active layers, therefore Jo has played a role in controlling Voc.39 The value of Jo depends on the material properties that determine the carrier generation, transport and recombination. The increase in the value of Voc for CN/THF cast film is attributed to the lower value of Jo due to the improved charge transport. Therefore, we assume that the CN additive plays an important role not only in improving the nanomorphology of the BHJ active layer but also in improving the interface between the polymer and PCBM phases. This well defined boundary between polymer and fullerene domains may reduce the bimolecular charge recombination,44,45 thus also improving the Voc.

4. Conclusions
Two novel carbazole-based copolymers PT and PP were synthesized and their optical and electrochemical properties were investigated. Their optical absorption spectra were extended up to 750 nm and the optical band gaps were 1.64 eV and 1.69 eV for PT and PP respectively. The HOMO (−5.18 and −5.30 eV for PT and PP) and LUMO (−3.24 and −3.38 eV for PT and PP) energy levels of these copolymers are well aligned for the efficient photoinduced charge transfer in BHJ organic solar cells. The values of HOMO and LUMO levels of these materials are similar to other D–A copolymers using carbazole based copolymers.32 The BHJ organic solar cells based on PT:PC61BM, PT:PC71BM, PP:PC61BM and PP:PC71BM blends showed overall PCE of 2.19%, 2.98% 2.02% and 2.54%, respectively. Further improvement in the PCE (5.39% and 4.20%, for PT:PC71BM and PP:PC71BM respectively) has been achieved when the BHJ active layer is processed from a solvent additive i.e. CN/THF mixed solvents. The increase in the PCE has been attributed to the improvement in both Jsc and Voc, due to the increased crystallinity of the donor phase and improvement in the hole mobility. The increase in hole mobility and slight decrease in the electron mobility, upon the incorporation of CN, leads to a more balanced charge transport in the BHJ solar cells, resulting in higher overall PCE. These values of PCE for these devices based on PT as electron donor and PC71BM as electron acceptor are comparable to those of other copolymers based on carbazole units.12 Moreover, the ease of synthesis of these copolymers compared to earlier reported copolymers based on carbazole makes them suitable for low cost polymer BHJ solar cells.
