Broader context
In these times of a continuously growing world energy demand and depletion of fossil fuels, the search for alternative energy sources is an important task for human beings. The cost and efficiency of solar cells that make use of renewable resources are of paramount importance. The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) is based on one of the most interesting technologies developed in the past 20 years for generating electric power through solar energy, attracting much attention since an early report of major advance in performance in 1997. A further increase in power-conversion efficiency to a value of 12.3% was reported in 2011 obtained by using a judiciously engineered porphyrin sensitizer coupled with a co-sensitizer and Co(II/III) (2,2′-bipyridine)3 complex as a redox shuttle. The redox electrolytes utilized are crucial in determining the efficiency of DSCs and, thus, have become one of the most instrumental and pertinent subjects of research in the context of DSCs. Many investigations of various alternative iodine-free electrolytes have been pursued. In this perspective article, the advantages and disadvantages of these iodine-free electrolytes are highlighted in terms of structure, interaction with the sensitizing dye and the charge transfer dynamics (charge transport and recombination). Challenges to further improvement in performance of DSC and strategies to enhance the efficiencies and stability of new generation DSCs are emphasized.

1. Introduction
With a continuously growing world energy demand and depletion of fossil fuels, the search for alternative energy sources is an important task which human beings are forced to face. The sun is a very reliable source of energy, and therefore photovoltaic devices are obvious candidates when searching for renewable technologies in the production of energy. Within the last few decades, photovoltaic production featured an annual growth rate of more than 20%, making it the world's fastest growing energy technology.1–3 Using sunlight as a renewable energy source has great potential;4 however, presently photovoltaic cells contribute only 0.04% to the world energy supply, leaving room for improvement of existing technologies and the development of new systems.
While the present solar cell industry is dominated by silicon-based p–n junction cells,2 research is now focussing on the development of next generation photovoltaics. One of the most interesting technologies that has emerged is the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) initially reported by Michael Grätzel et al. in 1991, and which is often referred to as the “Grätzel cell.”5–7 In traditional photovoltaic cells, the semiconductor light harvesting and conduction of the charge carriers under illumination occur in the same material. By contrast, the DSC separates light harvesting from charge carrier transport, mimicking the principles of solar energy conversion that natural photosynthesis has successfully adopted over the last 3.5 billion years. Thus, this technology is often described as ‘artificial photosynthesis’.
The attractive feature of the DSC is that it can be made from low-cost materials and does not need sophisticated equipment for manufacturing. Its mode of operation is illustrated in Fig. 1. The device consists of a few micrometers thick mesoporous metal oxide film sensitized with dyes or quantum dots used as a photo-anode filled with electrolyte and a cathode (counter electrode) which are sandwiched between two glass plates or embedded in plastic. The sensitizer that is adsorbed onto the surface of the metal oxide absorbs light. Charge separation takes place at the interface via photo-induced electron injection from the excited dye into the conduction band of the metal oxide photoanode. The TiO2 semiconductor nanoparticles collect electrons and transfer them to an external circuit, producing an electric current. The utilization of sensitizers having a broad absorption band in conjunction with an oxide film having nanocrystalline morphology permits harvesting of a large fraction of sunlight. Nearly quantitative conversion of incident photons into electric current can be achieved over a large spectral range extending through the visible to the near IR region.

Schematic illustration of the electron-transfer processes occurring at the dye-sensitized heterojunction: process 1, light-induced excitation of the chromophore; process 2, electron injection into the conduction band of the TiO2 semiconductor; process 3, electron diffusion in the TiO2; process 4, dye regeneration via hole transporting medium; processes 5 and 6, the direct recombination of primarily separated charges and the secondary recombination process between the injected electron and the oxidized species in the hole transporting medium; process 7, charge transfer in the hole transporting medium. 
On the laboratory scale DSCs have currently reached 12.3% efficiency8 under standard reporting conditions, while the efficiency attained for larger modules designed to function under outdoor conditions is 9.9%.9 Thus, the DSC provides a credible alternative to conventional p–n junction photovoltaic devices rendering it an attractive candidate for future renewable energy sources.
The photo-voltage of a DSC corresponds to the difference of the quasi-Fermi level of electrons in the nanocrystalline TiO2 under illumination and the Nernst potential of the redox electrolyte. A redox couple with higher redox potential provides higher photo-voltage (see Fig. 1). Thus, a fine tuning of the composition of the redox electrolyte is critical for increasing the photo-voltage of DSC, while there is less room for improvement of the fill factor as it is limited to approximately 0.85 depending on the total series resistance of the cell and the ideality factor of the junction. A careful selection of the redox shuttle is important in a new device design.10 This article will focus on the recent advances in redox electrolytes, emphasis being placed on the key parameters determining their performance.
2. Required properties of redox electrolytes
The redox electrolyte is one of the key components of the DSC and its properties have great influence on both the efficiency and stability of the devices. The redox electrolytes used in a DSC can be broadly classified into three categories: liquid electrolyte,11 quasi-solid electrolyte,12 and solid-state hole conductors.13 The function of the redox shuttle is to transfer electrons from the counter electrode to the oxidized dye (processes 4 and 7 in Fig. 1) formed when the photo-excited electron is injected into the photo-anode (process 1 in Fig. 1), completing the electrochemical circuit. The dual criteria of fast dye regeneration (process 4 in Fig. 1) and slow electron recapture (process 5 in Fig. 1) place challenging constraints on the choice of effective redox shuttles. Fast dye regeneration is a precondition for obtaining highly efficient DSCs. The application of various cations such as alkaline metal ion, organic cations containing quaternary ammonium or alkylimidazolium groups as well as other additives have a great influence on the above-mentioned kinetic processes.14 This field is rapidly developing. Several studies have examined the effect of the electrolyte composition on the photovoltaic performance which is also addressed in recent reviews.10,15–20
To increase the Voc of the DSC devices it is critical to use a redox electrolyte that has energy as close as possible to the D+/D energy level but with sufficient driving force to regenerate the dye quantitatively. To obtain a best performing electrolyte the redox shuttle utilized should have good solubility and high ionic mobility in an organic solvent. In addition, slow recombination between the oxidized form of the redox shuttle (process 6 in Fig. 1) and the injected electron from the photoanode as well as fast electron transfer kinetics at a minimal over potential at the counter electrode are required.16
3. The advantages and disadvantages of triiodide/iodide based electrolytes
Thus far the family of I3−/I− electrolytes has been the most commonly used redox mediator. These electrolytes exhibit desirable kinetic properties leading to the ‘asymmetric behaviour’ needed for the efficient functioning of the DSC, i.e., the forward electron donation by I− is sufficiently fast to ensure efficient dye regeneration while the reduction of I3− at the photoanode is slow enough to allow for high carrier collection efficiencies. This behaviour along with their excellent stability has rendered the iodide/triiodide system to be the present “candidate of choice” in the initial commercial applications of the DSC. Though the I3−/I− redox shuttle shows remarkable performance in DSCs, there is an ongoing quest to find suitable alternatives due to a number of reasons:21 The I3−/I− based redox electrolytes absorb light in the blue part of the spectrum, lowering the short circuit photocurrent and hence the power conversion efficiency (PEC) of the devices. For commercial up scaling of DSCs, the corrosion of Ag and/or Cu current collectors by I3− is of concern. The mismatch (about 0.6 V) between the redox potential of a typical sensitizer (EF,redox ≈ 1.0 V vs. NHE) and that of I3−/I− (EF,redox ≈ 0.4 V vs. NHE), causes a loss in the device Voc. The mechanism of the dye cation's reduction by iodide is still under investigation. Recently, attempts to use new organic dyes with the possibility to increase efficiency by extending the spectral absorbance have been partially thwarted by inefficient dye regeneration by I−. According to the Marcus theory,22 a driving force of 0.2–0.3 eV should be sufficient for outer sphere single electron transfer reactions to ascertain a fast dye regeneration rate, opening up the opportunity to increase the Voc. This beneficial effect has indeed been observed when the I3−/I− redox couple was replaced by new cobalt complexes23 or solid-state hole conductors24 yielding higher Voc values. An increase of the Voc by up to 0.4–0.5 V appears feasible resulting in a doubling of the conversion efficiency.
4. Techniques utilized in redox couple studies
There are several methods available (notably time-dependent techniques) to measure the dynamics (processes 4, 6, and 7) of electron transfer reactions related to the redox shuttle such as the interfacial charge recombination at the dye-sensitized heterojunction and charge exchange on the cathode/electrolyte interface.25 Nanosecond–millisecond time resolved laser photolysis studies coupled with transient absorption spectroscopy has been applied to evaluate the electron-transfer dynamics in dye-sensitized nanocrystalline solar cells using various electrolytes and relate these kinetic studies to solar cell performance.26 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a useful technique that has been widely employed to investigate the kinetic processes occurring in the DSC, mostly under dark conditions.27 EIS measures the current response to a harmonically modulated voltage superimposed on a constant applied bias voltage. Photo-voltage and photocurrent transient decay measurements in real time are useful to confirm these important kinetic parameters.28 In this case, a bias light establishes a steady-state population of electrons in the nano-crystalline oxide semiconductor film. A weak probe pulse is applied to the system to slightly increase the concentration of charge carriers. The relaxation of the system back to steady state conditions following this transient perturbation is measured. The information on the characteristic electron lifetime for recombination can be obtained from the temporal decay of the photovoltage following the probe pulse.29 The photo current transient decay measured at short circuit and the photovoltage rise time provide information on the electron transport rate within the nanocrystalline titania particle network. Other small amplitude modulation techniques such as intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS)30 are used to measure the respective time constants for charge recombination at open circuit and the combined processes of charge collection and charge recombination at short circuit in nanocrystalline TiO2 cells in the absence and presence of sensitizers. Recently, scanning electrochemical microscopy was explored to study the charge transfer kinetics between I− and photo-oxidized dye molecules (Eosin Y+) adsorbed on a ZnO film.31,32 A pseudo-first-order rate constant for this reaction was obtained from steady-state feedback measurements. Extension of the applicability of these techniques to other material combinations of DSCs and other electrolyte systems seems therefore straightforward.31
5. Alternative redox mediators to triiodide/iodide
Until recently attempts to find alternatives to the I3−/I− redox shuttle have had limited success, as the DSC efficiency rests on a delicate balance between the rate of charge collection and that of interfacial redox processes. Recently, research efforts to find alternate redox electrolytes have been growing. Improvements of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) stem mainly from an increase in the Voc of the DSC. Transition metal complexes and organic redox couples as well as solid-state hole conductors are showing promise as alternatives to the conventional I3−/I− system.33 The structures of various alternate redox couples used in DSCs are shown in Table 1 and the composition of electrolytes and photovoltaic parameters are tabulated in Table 2.

5.1. Transition metal complex systems
One-electron outer sphere redox shuttles based on transition metal complexes have shown promising results. The majority of them are cobalt(III/II) polypyridyl complexes. Nusbaumer et al. have studied redox couples for DSC based on cobalt polypyridyl complexes (see Table 1) in combination with ruthenium dyes,34 demonstrating an impressive efficiency of over 8% at low light intensities with IPCE values of more than 80%.35 Fast recombination due to reduction of the oxidized species (CoIII) at the conductive glass substrate was observed. Association of the oxidized species (CoIII) with some sensitizers can impair dye regeneration under full sunlight intensity (100 mW cm−2). Due to the big molecular size of the redox shuttle some serious ionic diffusion problems became evident.36 However, this work has demonstrated the potential advantages of using this redox shuttle for DSCs. Compared to the I3−/I− system, the cobalt(III/II) polypyridyl complex redox shuttles have low visible light absorption, and the ease of tuning their redox potentials is a very significant aspect for accomplishing a photovoltage enhancement. Nelson et al. studied the diffusion of Co3+(4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine)3 by rotating disk electrode voltammetry to compare the rates of diffusion in a bulk solution with a typical mesoporous titania film.36 The diffusion of Co3+(4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine)3 was an order of magnitude slower than the diffusion of I3− in bulk solution for the mesoporous film. This behaviour was attributed to the large size of the cobalt complex, higher viscosity of the electrolyte and electrostatic surface interaction between the cobalt complex and TiO2 film. Thus, the mesoporous TiO2 films with larger porosity would be advantageous for cobalt complex-based electrolytes.
When comparing cobalt redox electrolytes in devices comprised of TiO2 films of nanoparticles (20 nm pore size) to films made of nanotubes (80 nm pore size) the nanotube-based devices show significant improvement over the nano-particle based devices.52 The employment of vertically aligned TiO2 nanotube electrodes alleviated certain mass transportation problems observed with TiO2 nanoparticles.52 In another study using nano-particulate films near infrared transmittance and EIS measurements showed that the lower PCE and Jsc values observed with N719 dye compared to Z907 dye when using the CoII/III (bpy)3 complex as a redox shuttle results from a less efficient charge collection and a higher charge recombination rate.53 The PCE values could be improved by increasing the bulkiness of the high molar extinction coefficient ruthenium sensitizers to block the approach of the oxidized form of the redox electrolyte to the TiO2 surface. A PCE of up to 6.5% was achieved using a CoII/III (bpy)3 redox mediator in conjunction with the well-known ruthenium complex Z907. Detailed studies show that these recent breakthroughs in efficiency with Co-based redox electrolytes are due to a reduction of interfacial recombination through the increase of the steric bulkiness of a selected dye, enhancing the charge collection efficiency.
In recent years, the ease of synthesis and low cost of organic dyes has made them more attractive for the development of organic dye based DSCs. There are limitations to increase the molar extinction coefficients of ruthenium-based dyes. Metal free organic sensitizers are an attractive choice as their molar extinction coefficients are higher than that of the ruthenium complexes. DSCs prepared with an organic sensitizer in conjunction with cobalt-polypyridine redox mediator-based electrolytes surpassed the efficiencies of iodide-based electrolytes under full sunlight intensity.54 Solar cells with overall power conversion efficiencies of 6.7% and open circuit potentials of more than 0.9 V under standard full sunlight conditions were obtained by utilizing the D–π–A dye D35 in combination with Co(II/III) (2,2′-bipyridine)3 complex. Excellent performance was also obtained under low light intensity conditions. The steric properties of triphenylamine based organic dyes (D–π–A dye) enhance the charge transport and function as insulating spacers in the presence of cobalt polypyridine redox mediators, slowing down the interfacial charge recombination process between the TiO2 and electrolytes, and thus augmenting overall device performance. Because of their high molar extinction coefficients, organic dyes allow the use of thin TiO2 films, which themselves retard the interfacial charge recombination due to the decrease in electron transport time through the TiO2 film. Higher than 1.0 V open-circuit potential was reported by the same group using D35 organic dye in combination with the CoII/III(1,10-phenanthroline)3 redox electrolyte.47 Introducing different electron-withdrawing groups on the 2,2′-bipyridine or 1,10-phenanthroline ligands tunes the redox potential of the cobalt complex (Fig. 2). The Voc of the devices followed the trend in redox potentials while the Jsc decreased due to enhanced recombination and inefficient dye regeneration. This was also reflected in the IPCE values. The D–π–A organic sensitizer C218 bearing a 2,6-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-4,4-dihexyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′] dithiophene-conjugated spacer achieved a PCE higher than 9%63 while the sensitizer Y123 yielded a PCE of 9.6% with Co(II/III) (bipyridine)3.64 It is worth mentioning that with organic sensitizers there was no mass transport problem at full sunlight intensity as commonly observed with the ruthenium complexes. This warrants further investigations. Recently, Yella et al. boosted the efficiency of DSC to 12.3% by using a Co(II/III) (bipyridine)3-based redox electrolyte in conjunction with a donor–π-bridge–acceptor zinc porphyrin dye as a sensitizer (YD2-o-C8).8 The gain in photovoltaic performance over the devices using an iodide redox mediator was due to an increase in Voc. This system generated a strikingly high photovoltage close to 1 volt and has an impressive photocurrent density due to the specific molecular design of YD2-o-C8 which greatly retards the rate of interfacial back electron transfer from the conduction band of the nanocrystalline titanium dioxide film to the oxidized cobalt mediator. Presently research is focused in this direction to improve the performance of various sensitizers with cobalt-based redox electrolytes.65

The one electron, outer-sphere redox shuttle ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) couple had been intensively investigated in a DSC due to its fast kinetic properties.66–68 Early work by Gregg and co-workers led to the conclusion that fast outer-sphere redox couples like Fc+/Fc are not suitable electrolytes for DSC due to a facile back transfer of electrons from the TiO2 and the substrate.69 Though various technologies (such as atomic layer deposition) were applied to produce coatings onto the mesoporous films in order to retard the undesired recombination, the photovoltaic performance (most of them less than <0.4%) has not been satisfied due to the dilemma of achieving fast forward electron transfer while retarding the recombination.69,70 Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that such an overlayer slowed down the dye regeneration process.70 Recently, an efficient DSC based on the Fc+/Fc couple was reported, in which a metal-free carbazole donor–acceptor dye and chenodeoxycholic acid co-adsorbent were used.42 An impressive high open-circuit voltage of 842 mV with a short circuit current of 12.2 mA cm−2 was achieved, yielding an energy conversion efficiency of 7.5% under AM1.5 conditions. In this study the electrolyte and device fabrication were performed in a glove box under nitrogen atmosphere to avoid the influence of oxygen on the redox electrolyte.
5.2. Organic redox shuttles
Recently organic redox shuttles have been widely investigated in DSCs. A stable organic radical, 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy radical (TEMPO), can be reversibly oxidized to TEMPO+, the redox potential being tuneable by judicious substitution to increase the Voc significantly over that of the triiodide/iodide system.71 An efficiency of 5.4% was obtained by using TEMPO/TEMP+ under standard AM 1.5 illumination.49
The introduction of organic disulfide/thiolate redox couples into DSCs has shown respectable efficiency. Recently, M. Wang et al. investigated a thiolate/disulfide-based redox couple,39i.e., 1-methyl-1-H-tetrazole-5-thiolate (T−) and its dimer (T2) (see Table 1). Organic redox shuttles based on thiols undergo S–S bond formation and breakage during the dye regeneration and reduction of a redox couple at the counter electrode respectively. The process takes place in a two electron concerted electrochemical reaction for this type of redox couple. The thiolate redox shuttles have several advantages over the I3−/I− redox shuttle. First of all, the thiolates belong to the biological redox couples, in which the reduction–oxidation reaction is coincident with the loss of hydrogen. The biological redox can be widely used in water-based electrolytes for a dye sensitized solar cell. Another attractive feature of the thiolate redox shuttle is the electrochemical reaction involving two electrons, which is similar to the I3−/I− system, leading to an ‘asymmetric behaviour’ for highly efficient DSCs. An important feature of the thiolate redox couple electrolyte is that there is less competitive visible light absorption than with the I3−/I− system which would result in higher photocurrent density of DSC. Even though the redox potential of this T2/T− electrolyte is close to that of the I3−/I− based electrolyte, the device performance is superior. Apart from a small increase in the Voc, the advantage of employing this organic redox shuttle is in its ability to enhance the photon harvesting capacity of the devices. Fig. 3a shows a comparative IPCE of the I3−/I− based device and T2/T− based device with and without additives in conjunction with Z907 dye. Compared to the I3−/I− redox electrolyte, the device using T2/T− as a redox couple without additives has a broader IPCE in the spectral range of 360–460 nm. From wavelengths 360 nm to 460 nm an increase in integrated current of 36% was obtained (2.03 mA cm−2versus 1.49 mA cm−2 between devices using T2/T− and I3−/I−), showing the advantage of this redox electrolyte. With additives (TBP and Li+) in the T2/T− redox electrolyte and when increasing the thickness of a double layer TiO2 film the PCE of the DSC device reached 6.44% under full sunlight intensity.39 From Fig. 3b, one can infer that the devices with the new organic redox couple have a lower fill factor compared to that of I3−/I−. The fitting results with a simple diode model are presented in Table 3, showing that the charge transfer resistance (included in the series resistance Rs) of the T2/T− redox shuttle at the counter electrode is 5 times higher than that of I3−/I− and thus responsible for the observed low fill factor. The simulation result (Table 3) shows that when the Rs of a T2/T− electrolyte can be reduced to a value similar to that of I3−/I−, the device efficiency could be enhanced (from 5.8% to 7.6%), mainly due to the increase of fill factor (see Fig. 3b and Table 3).

The interfacial recombination has been studied by performing transient photovoltage decay measurements under open circuit conditions.39 The electron density within the TiO2 film was obtained by switching the cell from open to short circuit, followed by charge extraction. The transient decay measurement revealed that the device utilizing the T2/T− redox electrolyte (black, square symbols) has a charge recombination lifetime of about 25 times longer than that of a device using I3−/I− (red, square symbols) under identical charge density conditions as shown in Fig. 4. The additives (TBP and Li+) in the device (blue) using the T2/T− redox shuttle further increased the recombination lifetime (by 3 times).

The photovoltaic performance of DSCs depends greatly on the kinetic competition between the back electron transfer of the injected electrons from the conduction band of the semiconductor electrode to the oxidized dye cations (D+) and the interception of the oxidized sensitizer by the redox mediator (dye regeneration). Nanosecond time resolved laser transient absorbance measurements have been performed to scrutinize the kinetics of these two charge transfer processes in the presence of different redox electrolytes. In the electrochemically inert pure solvent, the decay of the absorption signal recorded at λ = 680 nm (excited state of Z907) reflects the dynamics of the recombination of injected electrons with the oxidized dye (process 4 in Fig. 1). The data in the inert electrolyte could be fitted by a single exponential with a typical half lifetime τ1/2 = 180 μs yielding a rate constant of kb = 4.01 × 103 s−1 (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  Transient absorbance decay of the oxidized state of a Z-907 sensitizer adsorbed on nanocrystalline TiO2 films in an acetonitrile–ethylene carbonate solvent mixture. Traces display the kinetics observed with no redox electrolyte added (a), and in the presence of I3−/I− (b) and T2/T− (c) redox mediator couples under similar conditions. The last trace was recorded with the T2/T− electrolyte in which Li+ ions and TBP were added (d). Half-reaction times measured for these systems are (a) t1/2 = 180 μs, (b) 10 μs, (c) 20 μs, and (d) 12 μs. Taken from Fig. 4 of ref. 39. 
In the iodide-based electrolyte device, the decay of the oxidized dye signal was significantly accelerated, the half lifetime being τ1/2 = 10 μs. The interception reaction is known to be pseudo first order with respect to iodide concentration. Data could therefore be fitted to a single exponential yielding a rate constant of kr = 7.3 × 104 s−1 for the pseudo first order rate constant of the dye regeneration process. The kr/kb (kb denotes the back reaction rate constant) branching ratio of 18.25 indicates that 94.5% of oxidized dye is intercepted by electron donation from I− resulting in an efficient dye regeneration process. For the T2/T− redox electrolyte the interception of the back reaction occurred with a similar rate constant of kr = 3.65 × 104 s−1 corresponding to a kr/kb branching ratio of 9.1 and 89% yield for dye regeneration. The addition of Li+ and TBP to the electrolyte enhances the rate of dye regeneration to kr = 6.08 × 104 s−1 corresponding to a kr/kb branching ratio of 15 and a 93% yield for dye regeneration. The agreement between kr values of devices with the iodide-based electrolyte and of those with the T2/T− redox electrolyte is consistent with the photovoltaic measurements, showing that the former device has higher photocurrent and IPCE response within the wavelength range longer than 500 nm. For the case of T2/T− redox electrolytes, the absorbance was observed to reach a pseudo-plateau at approximately 20% of the initial signal magnitude, 300 μs after the excitation pulse. This residual absorbance, which eventually decayed down to the baseline within a few hundreds of μs, is attributed to the T˙ radical, the one-electron oxidation product of the mediator, whose absorption spectrum should be significant at the probe wavelength λ = 650 nm.
These results provided a new direction in the development of an iodine-free redox electrolyte and also showed advantages in flexible DSCs where the light is obliged to pass through the counter electrode. Several research groups have intensively studied the application of thiolate/disulfide analogous electrolytes for DSCs with various counter electrodes.72 A colourless redox couple consisting of tetramethylthiourea and its oxidized dimer tetramethylformaminium disulphide dication (coded as TMFDS2+/TMTU) was applied as a redox electrolyte for DSCs.44 This redox electrolyte also shows advantages, including low visible light absorption and non-corrosion at the Pt counter electrode. In combination with carbon based counter electrodes, the devices show up to 3.1% power conversion efficiency under AM 1.5 illumination of 100 mW cm−2 and 4.5% under lower light intensities. Another organic redox couple consisting of the thiolate and disulfide dimer (coded as McMT−/BMT) was studied using a metal-free sensitizer (TH305).55 Though the McMT−/BMT shows a more negative redox potential (0.155 V vs. NHE) compared to the I3−/I− redox couple (∼0.4 V vs. NHE), the two devices show a comparable Voc due to the negative shift of the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 with the McMT−/BMT-based electrolyte. Using the McMT−/BMT-based electrolyte, 4.0% efficiency was achieved under simulated sunlight illumination (100 mW cm−2). Liu et al. has evaluated the organic redox mediator tetramethylformaminium disulfide/tetramethylthiourea (coded TMFDS2+/TMTU) in the DSC electrolyte and compared the photovoltaic performance using both ruthenium and organic sensitizers.73 The metal free indoline based sensitizer (D131) has better performance than that of a standard ruthenium based sensitizer (Z907). The overall light to electric power conversion efficiency of 3.9% was achieved under AM 1.5 full sunlight illumination. A near unity incident photon-to-collected-electron conversion efficiency was achieved at low light intensity for optimized devices. The detailed study with transient absorption spectroscopy and EIS illustrated that the poor photovoltaic performance could be due to inefficient dye regeneration and poor electrochemical behaviour on the Pt counter electrode. A series of organic thiolate/disulfide redox couples dissolved in an acetonitrile–ethylene carbonate mixture (Table 1) have been studied systematically for their use in DSCs and obtained 6.0% PCE under AM 1.5G light illumination using PEDOT as a counter electrode. Pure ionic liquid and solvated ionic-liquid electrolytes based on a thiolate anion gave efficiencies of 3.4% and 1.2% under 10 mW cm−2 light illumination, respectively.74 To reduce the viscosity of McMT−/BMT ionic liquid electrolyte, low viscosity 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetracyanoborate (EMI+[TCB−]) ionic liquid was added. Various counter electrodes (including CoS, Pt, and PEDOT) were tested aiming to identify a suitable catalyst for the reduction of BMT.75 The introduction of an ionic liquid thiolate largely enhances the stability of the thiolate/disulfide-based electrolyte stored at room temperature under dark conditions. Z. Ning et al. have reported a McMT−/BMT based electrolyte for quantum dot sensitized solar cells.57
Despite the good performance of the iodine-free T2/T− based redox electrolyte, the long-term stability of photovoltaic cells still needs to be improved. A thiol based self-assembled layer tends to form onto the metal counter electrodes, such as Pt. Devices assembled with a platinum loaded counter electrode and T2/T− based redox electrolytes suffer a drop in device performance. A possible reason for this decay is the deactivation of the electroactive platinum layer on the counter electrode with time. The stability of DSC devices fabricated with the T2/T− redox couple could be significantly improved by replacing the thermalized platinum layer on the counter electrode by electrochemically deposited PEDOT.76 The stability of thiolate redox shuttles can also be improved by introducing an ionic liquid thiolate. Tian et al. have reported a T2/T− based electrolyte in combination with ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetracyanoborate,75 which showed better photovoltaic performance and long-term stability, whereas the devices containing an organic solvent based T2/T− electrolyte resulted in decreased performance. The reasons behind the device instability are still unclear and further in depth studies are required to elucidate this phenomenon. To further increase the charge regeneration capacity and photo-stability, the replacement of alkali metal ions with other cations such as imidazolium and pyrrolidinium, in combination with new counter electrodes other than platinum, may offer further improvement.
5.3. Solid State DSCs (SSDSCs) using Hole Transporting Materials (HTMs)
An alternative and promising approach to improve the open circuit voltage of a DSC employs a solid-state hole transfer material (HTM). In principle, all materials with p-type semi-conducting behaviour, capable of accepting holes from the excited state or oxidized form of the dye, are potential candidates for replacing the liquid electrolyte in DSCs. These materials can be crystalline inorganic salts, such as CuI and CuSCN, or amorphous organic molecular solids and polymer, such as those based on the triarylamine derivatives 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxy-phenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene(spiro-MeOTAD). Using the latter HTM and N(PhBr)3SbCl6 and Li[(CF3SO2)2N] as the dopants, an initial successful demonstration of a 0.74% power conversion efficiency in SSDSC devices was reported in 1998, with a maximum IPCE value of 33%.24 Recent advances in the photovoltaic performance of solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (SSDSCs) have augmented the PCE to a level of 4.0 to 9.3%.46,60–62,77–82 In order to facilitate the filling of the mesoporous photo-anode and ascertain a good contact between the hole transporter and the dye-coated surface, liquid hole conductors at room temperature were also synthesized and utilized in DSCs. After p-doping by NOBF4, the amorphous liquid hole conductor shows enhanced conductivity, and works remarkably well in DSCs exhibiting PCEs close to 3% and external quantum efficiencies exceeding 50%.51 The electrochemical characterization of this liquid hole conductor shows similar charge transport properties and mechanisms to their solid state counterparts.
However, to date the conversion efficiencies of DSCs employing solid HTMs still remain lower than that of their liquid electrolyte based counterparts. Detailed investigations have shown that the low performance could be attributed to the low electronic conductivities of organic HTMs, the fast interfacial charge recombination from the TiO2 to HTM and incomplete penetration of solid-state HTMs into the pores of the mesoporous TiO2 electrodes. The present SSDSC embodiments employ thin nanocrystalline TiO2 films in order to establish complete pore filling by the hole conductor and quantitative collection of the photogenerated charge carriers. The use of high molar extinction coefficient sensitizers in combination with such thin mesoporous TiO2 electrodes is advantageous. Co-grafting of dyes with amphiphilic molecules containing carboxylic or phosphonic acid end groups were reported to form a more compact monolayer than the adsorption of dye alone. This insulating molecular layer could effectively shield the back electron transfer from the TiO2 conduction band to HTM. The poor pore filling by organic HTM is considered to be a drawback to this system. In order to improve the pore filling capacities of organic p-type semiconductors, the in situ polymerization of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) for use as polymer HTM based DSCs has been proposed.83 PEDOT exhibits high transparency in the visible range, high conductivity and remarkable stability at room temperature. A high efficient polymer-HTM based DSC (6.1% under 1 sun condition) prepared by in situ polymerization of bis-EDOT in a thin layer electrolytic cell using organic dye (D149) as the sensitizer was reported.84 An initiated chemical vapor deposition technique can also be used as an effective liquid-free means for in situ polymerization and pore filling in solid-state DSCs. In this case, a complete pore filling of 12 μm thick titania can be achieved, augmenting cell performance.85 Recently, the combination of quantum dots with HTM has attracted the attention of many scientists. A Sb2S3 sensitized solar cell fabricated using PCPDTBT (poly(2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene)-alt-4,7(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole))) as HTM and an overall PCE of 6.18% was achieved at 100% solar irradiation.45 Depleted heterojunction solar cells use colloidal quantum dots such as PbS as light harvestors.86 Here the colloidal particles have a dual function; they absorb sunlight and transport the photogenerated carriers to the current collector. Given the fact that these systems are made by simple solution processing their photovoltaic performance is truly remarkable. Short circuit current densities over 20 mA cm−2 have been obtained under standard AM 1.5 reporting conditions. Internal quantum efficiencies over 100% have been witnessed when the photon energy exceeds twice the band gap suggesting the feasibility of multiple exciton generation and their collection as photocurrent.87,88 DSC architectures based on energy relay dyes, i.e., highly emissive secondary dyes placed in the HTM, show an increase in overall light absorption and improve the collection of high energy photons via the Förster resonant energy transfer mechanism.89 By using a combination of red-light sensitizing dyes with high molar extinction coefficient and energy relay dyes that absorb in the visible region, a significant increase of light harvesting efficiency in spiro-MeOTAD based DSC devices was demonstrated.90 K. Driscoll et al. reported on the use of a spiro-linked molecule as a secondary absorber in solid state excitonic solar cells.91 Blending spiro-MeOTAD with a near infrared dye yields a notable enhancement in Jsc and thus in the PCEs. This photovoltaic performance improvement is attributed to the exciton energy transfer as well as to nanoscale charge generation in the blend via the formation of an excited state spiro-complex with charge transfer character.
6. Current and future developments
Mastering the dynamics of charge transport and charge recombination that take place in dye sensitized mesoscopic solar cells employing alternate redox electrolytes is key to further improvement of their photovoltaic performance. It is mandatory to deepen our understanding of the factors that govern these processes. This includes the theoretical analysis and modelling of the dye's interaction with the oxide surface as well as its spatial configuration and interaction with neighboring molecules including the calculation of the rates for such electron transfer reactions. Equally important will be the careful analysis of the nature and role of surface states, such as oxygen vacancies, in promoting the unwanted recombination process. Finally exploring the effects of the local electric field at the interface generated by ions, electrons and solvent as well as sensitizer dipoles is an urgent task. Controlling the interface between the nanocrystalline oxide film and the redox electrolytes or hole conductors is of great importance to avoid the unwanted recapture of the injected conduction band electrons by the oxidized form of the redox couple or the hole in the hole conductor. Controlling the collection and minimizing the trapping of charge carriers at these boundaries is crucial for making further substantial gains in open circuit voltage and hence conversion efficiency.92
The PCEs of recent DSCs have been demonstrated to be over 12% efficient, which is still relatively low compared to multi-junction III–V semiconductor tandem collectors, where efficiencies of over 40% have been obtained albeit by using highly concentrated sunlight without collecting the diffuse radiation being present in natural sunlight. However, these lower efficiencies are offset by the lower cost and ease of fabrication of DSCs, rendering this technology an extremely attractive alternative. Also under ambient diffuse light or indoor conditions the DSC outperforms all competitors by a larger margin power conversion efficiency reaching over 25% presently.
Work on new sensitizers that can absorb in the near IR region with relatively higher molar extinction coefficients will lead to higher photocurrents. Higher Voc values will be obtained by adjusting the redox levels (potential) of alternate redox couples closer to the dye HOMO level while maintaining a sufficient driving force for dye regeneration. Through controlled-morphology of TiO2 nanostructures, porosity, and thickness, the mass transport problem existing in the presence of alternative (to I3−/I−) redox electrolytes can be alleviated. Lower surface area films can be used with high molar extinction coefficient dyes to enhance the light harvesting properties, profiting electron collection. We reckon that development of new redox melts would be beneficial to increase the concentrations of oxidized/reduced species in the electrolyte enhancing device performance. Significant improvements in the alternate redox couples' solubility in organic solvents which are used as electrolytes, diminishment of charge recombination between injected electrons and redox ions, and the minimization of the over-potentials of these new redox shuttles are the important next steps to take in the production of promising new electrolytes for the augmentation of power conversion efficiencies and stability (both mechanically and during aging) in new generations DSCs.
The field of solid state DSCs will contribute increasing momentum to this development. Recently, research in this field has accelerated; new efficiency records being attained at short intervals. After years of struggling to get over the 5 percent PCE limit, efficiencies close to 10% have been reached using methylammonium lead iodide (perovskite) nanoparticles as sensitizers.62 This bodes well for rapid further efficiency gains with these very promising systems.

Broader context
In these times of a continuously growing world energy demand and depletion of fossil fuels, the search for alternative energy sources is an important task for human beings. The cost and efficiency of solar cells that make use of renewable resources are of paramount importance. The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) is based on one of the most interesting technologies developed in the past 20 years for generating electric power through solar energy, attracting much attention since an early report of major advance in performance in 1997. A further increase in power-conversion efficiency to a value of 12.3% was reported in 2011 obtained by using a judiciously engineered porphyrin sensitizer coupled with a co-sensitizer and Co(II/III) (2,2′-bipyridine)3 complex as a redox shuttle. The redox electrolytes utilized are crucial in determining the efficiency of DSCs and, thus, have become one of the most instrumental and pertinent subjects of research in the context of DSCs. Many investigations of various alternative iodine-free electrolytes have been pursued. In this perspective article, the advantages and disadvantages of these iodine-free electrolytes are highlighted in terms of structure, interaction with the sensitizing dye and the charge transfer dynamics (charge transport and recombination). Challenges to further improvement in performance of DSC and strategies to enhance the efficiencies and stability of new generation DSCs are emphasized.
