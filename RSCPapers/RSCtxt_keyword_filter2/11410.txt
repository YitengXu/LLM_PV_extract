, Accepted 1st August 2013First published on 1st August 2013AbstractPlasmonics have been proven to be an effective way to harness more incident light to achieve high efficiency in photovoltaic devices. Herein, we explore the possibility that plasmonics can be utilized to enhance light trapping and power conversion efficiency (PCE) for polymer–quantum dot (QD) hybrid solar cells (HSCs). Based on a low band-gap polymer poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT) and a CdSe QD bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) system, gold nanoparticles were doped at different locations of the devices. Successfully, an improved PCE of 3.20 ± 0.22% and 3.16 ± 0.15% was achieved by doping the hole transporting layer and the active layer, respectively, which are among the highest values reported for CdSe QD based HSCs. A detailed study of processing, characterization, microscopy, and device fabrication is conducted to understand the underlying mechanism for the enhanced device performance. The success of this work provides a simple and generally applicable approach to enhance light harnessing of polymer–QD hybrid solar cells.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs), as a potentially competitive technology for green energy, have attracted much attention for their advantages of light weight, low cost and mechanical flexibility.1–7 Attributed to the intensive development of new materials,2,6–9 device architectures4,10–12 and fabrication techniques,13 power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 10%1 and 9%4 has been achieved in the tandem and single-junction bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs, respectively.
As a competitive alternative to OSCs, solution-processed hybrid solar cells (HSCs) using inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals instead of fullerene derivatives, usually used in OSCs as electron acceptors, are attracting more and more attention due to their potentially higher electron mobility and adjustable absorption properties.14–18 During the past decade, many efforts, such as tuning inorganic nanocrystal size and shape,17,19–21 surface modification of nanocrystals,22–27 functionalization of conjugated polymers,28,29 and optimizing device structures30–32 have been reported, aiming at improving the exciton generation and charge transport, thus improving the performance of the HSCs. However, the PCE of HSCs is still far below the polymer–fullerene solar cells, which is mainly limited by the relatively low external quantum efficiency (EQE).
One way to improve the EQE is to increase the photon absorption. However, similar to the organic counterparts, the HSCs suffer from a mismatch between optical absorption length and charge transport scale, due to low electron mobility of the devices arising from the complicated surface of the nanocrystals.19,24,33 This mismatch limits the thickness of the active layer and thus limits the improvement of current density. Therefore, a new device architecture that can enable efficient light trapping in thin films (∼100 nm) with effective charge collection and reduced recombination losses is urgently needed.34–41
The employment of light trapping based on plasmonic effects of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) have been proven to be a promising strategy for highly efficient light harvesting in OSCs.34,39,42–44 These plasmonic nanoparticles can be used as sub-wavelength antennas where the plasmonic near-field can be coupled into the adjacent photoactive materials to effectively increase the cross-section of absorption. Meanwhile, metallic NPs can also be used as sub-wavelength scattering elements to prolong the optical path of the incident light within the photoactive layer. It is also believed that the metallic NPs can improve the electrical properties of OSCs.35,36,40,41 And the improvements in the electrical properties contributes to a higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF).36,41,42 However, to the best of our knowledge, there is still no report on utilizing a plasmonic light trapping strategy to improve the efficiency of hybrid solar cells.39,45,46
Herein, we demonstrate the first report trying to manage light trapping with plasmonic Au NPs in thin film HSCs based on a low band-gap polymer, poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT) and CdSe quantum dot (QD) bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) system. Appropriate sized Au NPs were doped into different layers of the devices. Successfully, the PCE of the device increased from 2.95 ± 0.12% to 3.20 ± 0.22% and from 2.91 ± 0.11% to 3.16 ± 0.15% after doping the hole transporting layer and the active layer, respectively. We further investigated the optical and electrical properties of the plasmonic HSCs to understand the underlying mechanism for the enhanced device performance. The different locations of plasmonic nanoparticles within the devices were also compared. These results show that plasmonic effect enhanced device performance can be achieved in HSCs. This successful demonstration provides a novel strategy to improve the efficiency of polymer–QD HSCs.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Syntheses of water-dispersed and oil-dispersed Au NPs
The ∼35 nm sized Au NPs in water were prepared by a hydroquinone-reduction seed-growth method reported previously.47 Briefly, a 15 nm diameter Au seed solution was prepared according to the protocol by Frens, resulting in a colloidal suspension containing [Au] = 1.5 mM. Then, a 136 mL “growth solution” containing 0.9 mL 50 mM centrifuged HAuCl4 solution, 0.2 mL 0.1 mM sodium citrate solution, a 15 mL Au seed solution and 120 mL deionized water was prepared in a 250 mL flask. At last, 1 mL 45 mM hydroquinone was injected into the “growth solution” under vigorous stirring. These reactions completed within 3 h. In order to cap the Au NPs with poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, MW = 10000, Aldrich), we added 2 mL 45 mg mL−1 PVP solution to the mentioned reaction solution, and stirred for 24 h. The obtained solution was centrifuged to eliminate the excess ligands and re-dissolved in 1 mL of deionized water to avoid the aggregation of Au NPs.
In order to obtain oil-dispersed Au NPs, the Au NPs in water should be centrifuged, washed with ethanol twice, and then centrifuged one more time. Finally, 1 mL chlorobenzene was added and sonicated to obtain the Au NPs in chlorobenzene.
2.2. Synthesis of CdSe QDs
CdSe QDs were synthesized according to the reported procedure.24,30 In a typical synthetic process, CdO (76 mg), trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO, 3.0 g) and oleic acid (OA, 3.0 mL) were added into the reactor and the mixture was heated to 285 °C under vigorous stirring in a nitrogen atmosphere. Se (80 mg) was added into trioctylphosphine (TOP, 1.0 mL) and the mixture was sonicated until the solution became clear. Then, the Se–TOP solution was quickly injected into the reactor. The hot solution was quickly transferred into toluene (5 mL). The as-prepared CdSe QDs were washed in methanol and centrifuged twice, and then dispersed in pyridine and stirred for 24 h. The resulting nanocrystals were flocculated by hexane and centrifuged.
The PCPDTBT:CdSe QD blended solution was prepared by dispersing CdSe QDs (30 mg) and dissolving PCPDTBT (Luminescence Technology Corp., 3.3 mg) in a mixture solvent of chlorobenzene and pyridine (v:v = 9:1, 1 mL) and stirred overnight. The blend solution with Au NPs was prepared before spin-coating by adding oil-dispersed Au NPs with different weight ratios (wt%) and sonicated for 30 min.
2.3. Device fabrication
Prior to device fabrication, the substrates were cleaned by sonication using detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol sequentially every 15 min followed by 15 min of ultraviolet ozone treatment. Then a layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Baytron P AI4083) was spin-coated onto the cleaned ITO and baked in air at 140 °C for 15 min. The PEDOT:PSS blend with Au NPs was prepared before spin-coating by adding water-dispersed Au NPs with different weight ratios (wt%) and sonicated for 30 min. Then, the substrates were transferred into a glovebox for spin coating of a PCPDTBT:CdSe QD active layer with the thickness of about 70 nm. Then, the substrates were dipped in the 0.1 M ethanethiol (in acetonitrile) solution for 30 s, followed by a rinse with pure acetonitrile. Then, all the samples were annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, samples were loaded into a vacuum deposition chamber (background pressure ≈ 5 × 10−4 Pa) to deposit a 120 nm thick aluminum cathode with a shadow mask (device area of 4 mm2).
Charge carrier mobility in blended films was measured by a space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The hole-only devices with the same active layer thickness as that in HSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCPDTBT:CdSe/MoO3(10 nm)/Al. The electron-only devices were fabricated in a structure of glass/Al/PCPDTBT:CdSe/Al, where a layer of 120 nm thick Al was first deposited onto the glass substrate and then the PCPDTBT:CdSe QD solution was spin coated on the Al-covered substrate followed by depositing a layer of 120 nm thick Al. The treatments of the active layer were the same as fabrication of hybrid solar cells and the area for those electron-only and hole-only devices was 4 mm2.
2.4. Film and device characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured with Keithley236 measurement source units at room temperature in air. The photocurrent was measured under a calibrated solar simulator (Abet 300 W) at 100 mW cm−2, and the light intensity was calibrated with a standard photovoltaic reference cell. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was measured with Stanford lock-in amplifier 8300 unit. The absorption spectra of the samples on ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates were recorded on a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-2450, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan). The surface morphology of the PEDOT:PSS layers was taken on a Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). The morphological structures of the PEDOT:PSS and the PCPDTBT:CdSe QDs hybrid films were investigated on a Veeco Multimode atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the tapping mode. The morphology of the CdSe QDs and Au NPs was investigated on a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEM-1200EX, NEC Corporation, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 120 kV.
3. Results and discussion
PCPDTBT, whose molecular structure is shown in Fig. 1a, is one of the most widely used low band-gap polymers in HSCs due to its improved harvesting of the long wavelength photons compared to the most popular donor polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT).16,33,48 Although the current study on HSCs has mainly focused on highly anisotropic nanocrystals such as nanorods (NRs) and tetrapods (TPs) due to their perceived advantages in supporting directional charge transport paths for efficient charge transport and collection,17,48 in our previous work24 we have found that HSCs based on P3HT:CdSe QDs blend with a post-deposition ligand exchange process using monothiols can achieve a PCE similar to that of NRs or TPs-based devices. Compared to NRs or TPs, the QDs are easier to be synthesized, so CdSe QDs (Fig. 1b) were used as electron acceptors in this work. Based on our previous results,34,36 we choose Au NPs with size of 35 nm (inset of Fig. 1c) as the plasmonic antennas here and compare the plasmonic effects by doping different locations (in the PEDOT:PSS layer and PCPDTBT:CdSe blend active layer, respectively). First, this NP size is comparable to the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer (30–40 nm), aiming to couple more near-field enhancement to the photon active materials while the separation with active layer can avoid exciton quenching.37,38 Second, the shorting problem can be avoided when doping this small sized NPs in the ∼70 nm active layer. The extinction spectrum of water-dispersed Au NPs determined by UV-vis spectroscopy is shown in Fig. 1c, which indicates that the plasmon resonance peak for 35 nm sized Au NPs in aqueous is located at 536 nm.

3.1. Doping Au NPs in the PEDOT:PSS layer
To clarify the plasmonic effect in HSCs, we dope the Au NPs into the PEDOT:PSS hole transporting layer with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS with Au NPs/PCPDTBT:CdSe QDs/Al (Fig. 1e). The successful embedding of Au NPs in the PEDOT:PSS can be proved from the SEM images (Fig. 2), showing a uniform distribution of Au NPs in the PEDOT:PSS layer without any aggregation at low Au NPs concentrations (Fig. 2b and c). However, the Au NPs start to aggregate when the concentration increases to 1 wt% (Fig. 2d).
 Fig. 2  SEM images of the surface of Au NPs doped PEDOT:PSS films with different concentrations of Au NPs: (a) 0, (b) 0.25 wt%, (c) 0.5 wt%, (d) 1 wt%. The scale bars are 200 nm. 
Morphology changes of the PEDOT:PSS layers before and after Au doping were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 3a and b). It shows that ∼3 nm height humps appear after Au NPs doping. It is reported that these humps can increase the interfacial area between the anode and the active layer, providing shorter routes for holes to transport to the anode and enhance holes collection at the anode, thus increasing short circuit current density (Jsc) of the corresponding devices.36,40

The performance of HSCs with Au NPs incorporated into the PEDOT:PSS layer was investigated. Under 100 mW cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5 G), the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of devices with different concentrations of Au NPs are shown in Fig. 4a with their performance summarized in Table 1. The control device showed a PCE of 2.95 ± 0.12% with an open circuit voltage (Voc), Jsc, and fill factor (FF) of 0.70 V, 8.38 mA cm−2, and 0.503, respectively. After doping with Au NPs in PEDOT:PSS layer, an increased PCE can be observed. Particularly, with an optimized Au concentration of 0.5 wt%, the highest PCE of 3.20 ± 0.22%, with Voc, Jsc, FF of 0.70 V, 8.85 mA cm−2, and 0.517, respectively can be achieved, mainly due to the increased Jsc. The Voc remains nearly the same at all concentrations, indicating the introduction of Au NPs into PEDOT:PSS layer does not alter its interfacial property. Further increasing the concentration of Au NPs has negative effect on the performance of devices, with PCE dropping to 2.71% at a concentration of 1 wt%. This is due to the aggregation of Au NPs at a high concentration which may lead to formation of recombination centers (Fig. 2d).38

EQE measurements were conducted to understand the improved Jsc which are shown in Fig. 4b. We can observe that low concentrations of incorporated Au NPs (0.25 wt% and 0.5 wt%) in the PEDOT:PSS make EQE increase over a broad wavelength range from 350–800 nm. But the EQE decreased with increasing Au NPs concentration, which is consistent with the change of Jsc. To better illustrate the EQE and Jsc changes, the UV-vis absorption measurements of the active layer with and without NPs doping in the PEDOT:PSS were performed and the absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 5. For hybrid films on the Au NPs doped PEDOT:PSS, the absorption of PCPDTBT:CdSe QDs blend films in the range of 350–800 nm is improved when increasing the weight ratio of NPs incorporated at low concentrations (0–0.5 wt%), but enhanced less at a high concentration (1 wt%) probably due to the backward scattering.35 The enhanced absorption is in good agreement with LSPR region of the Au NPs (Fig. 1c) and consistent with the enhancement of EQE. On the basis of EQE and absorption results, we can infer that the enhanced light absorption induced by the Au NPs plasmonic effect contributes to the enhanced performance of HSCs when doping the Au NPs in the hole transporting layer.

3.2. Doping Au NPs in the hybrid films
Encouraged by the successfully improved PCEs by incorporating Au NPs into the PEDOT:PSS layer, we are also interested in the possibilities of adding Au NPs into the active layer since such architecture can couple much more LSPR effect to the active materials. The performance of HSCs with Au NPs doped within the active layer was investigated (Fig. 1f). Fig. 6a shows the J–V curves of the LSPR enhanced HSCs, with their performance summarized in Table 2. The control device shows a PCE of 2.95 ± 0.11% with Voc, Jsc, and FF of 0.67 V, 7.57 mA cm−2, and 0.574, respectively. Similar to the above described PEDOT:PSS modified devices, increasing Au NPs content in active layer at low concentrations also improves the performance of the HSCs, peaking at 1 wt%, resulting in a PCE of 3.16 ± 0.15%, with Voc, Jsc, and FF of 0.68 V, 8.28 mA cm−2, and 0.561, respectively. Further increasing the concentration of Au NPs has negative effect on the performance of devices, with PCE dropping to 2.87% at a concentration of 2 wt%.

a Note that the control device shows slightly lower Jsc and higher FF here compared to the former control one discussed in Fig. 4a. We attribute this to the batch to batch variations, because we find that the performance of the HSCs is highly dependent on the surface conditions of the CdSe QDs and the humidity of the atmosphere when they were measured in air.

The variation of the absorption spectra shown in Fig. 5b indicates that the hybrid films incorporated with Au NPs exhibit greater light absorption than the control film especially in the range of 600–800 nm. This enhanced wavelength range is almost consistent with the plasmon resonance peak of the doped Au NPs after considering the LSPR changes of different surrounding optical environment.34,40 Therefore, we contribute this absorption enhancement to the LSPR effects of the doped Au NPs. Besides, the EQE enhanced a lot in the same wavelength range shown in Fig. 5b. On the basis of EQE and absorption results, we believe that the enhanced light absorption induced by the Au NPs plasmonic effect contributes to the enhanced performance of HSCs when doping the Au NPs in the hybrid active layer.
The morphology changes of the active layer after doping Au NPs were also provided in Fig. 7. Apparently the incorporated Au NPs in the active layers could modify the nanoscale morphology of the hybrid blends. The addition of 1 wt% Au NPs makes the phase boundaries become clearer, forming domains with sizes of 80–100 nm, although some large domains remain unchanged. Comparing to the control device with all large domains, this morphology favours exciton dissociation. However, the formation of larger domains (100–140 nm) which is unfavourable for exciton dissociation when more Au NPs (2 wt%) were incorporated led to a worse performance. Therefore, the improved phase separation could also contribute to the improvement of Jsc for the active layer doped devices at optimized concentration of Au NPs.

We further studied the changes of hole and electron mobilities by making hole-only and electron-only devices and fitted the dark J–V curves using the SCLC model. The variations of mobilities of holes and electrons are shown in Fig. 8. It shows that the electron mobility almost remains the same as the concentrations of Au NPs change because the electron mobility is heavily dependent on the surface ligands of CdSe QDs.24 Doping Au NPs in active layer can improve the hole mobility at appropriate concentrations and the variation of the hole mobility is consistent with variation of Jsc. The enhancement may due to the more definite phase separation, forming more efficient charge-transporting network. Au NPs can also introduce dopant states within the band-gap of polymer which can provide hopping sites for holes and enhance the mobility.41 Thus the slightly enhanced hole mobility should partly contribute to the performance improvement for the active layer doped devices.

4. Conclusions
Hybrid solar cells based on a low band-gap polymer PCPDTBT and CdSe QDs with significantly improved PCEs (up to 3.20 ± 0.22%) have been demonstrated by incorporating Au NPs into the hole-transporting layer and the active layer. The absorption enhancement caused by plasmonic effect as well as the improved exciton generation and hole collection caused by the interface increase between the active layer and the anode contribute to the performance improvement in the hole-transporting layer doped device. Incorporating Au NPs in the active layer also enhances light absorption, increases slightly hole mobility, and forms smaller phase separation domain size in the active layer, leading to better device performance. Overall, our results indicate that the plasmonic effect enhanced device performance can be achieved in a hybrid system and provide a new strategy to enhance the performance of the HSCs.
