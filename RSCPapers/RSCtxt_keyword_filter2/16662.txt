Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are one of the promising clean photovoltaic technologies due to their low fabrication cost and relatively high efficency.1–4 One effective method to increase power conversion efficiency is to increase the light harvesting capability of the photoanode by introducing optical scatterers into a photoanode film. It is reported that, theoretically, optical absorption can be promoted by additionally admixing larger particles.5–7 However, it will unavoidably result in decreasing internal surface area and dye loading. To overcome this weakness, bifunctional TiO2 structures such as mesoporous microspheres8 and nanoembossed hollow microspheres9 and hemispheres10 have been intensely investigated because they can increase dye loading and localize incident light within the electrode as well. However, the packing density is rather low due to the point attachment of spherical scattering particles, which is adverse to light harvesting and electron transfer. Therefore, a special scattering layer constructed from planar mesostructured particles with high surface area and sufficient attachment to each other is expected to be one of the good choices to improve light harvesting for benefiting cell performance. In this communication, novel hierarchical TiO2 nanoplates are developed with variable shells to satisfy the demand of light harvesting of scattering layers by forming close packing density via linear and planar contacts and increasing surface areas to improve dye loading. This structure is found to exhibit excellent light capture and electron transfer performance, and better cell power conversion efficiency is obtained.
Hollow structures (e.g., spheres, spindles, cubes) with complex hierarchical or interior structures have exhibited superior properties compared with those with single structures,11–16 but the template and self-assembly approach are complicated and not easily controllable, especially free and precise control of shell structure and shell number. In this communication, anatase TiO2 hollow nanoplates can be obtained by using Cd(OH)2 nanoplates without any further template removing process due to in situ dissolving of the hydroxide during the reaction. By simply controlling the hydrolysis and deposition process of titanium precursors, hierarchical TiO2 nanoplates with variable shells can be prepared, different from those previously reported.17–19 It is suggested that this strategy can be extended to design and synthesis of other metal oxides with intriguing hierarchical mesostructures.
The reagents used in the experiment were analytical in grade and were used without further purification. The synthesis of hexagonal Cd(OH)2 nanoplates was carried out by a hydrothermal route referred to our reported work.20 Hexagonal anatase TiO2 hollow nanoplates with hierarchical mesostructures were prepared by adding Cd(OH)2 templates to an aqueous solution of 0.075 M (NH4)2TiF6 and 0.2 M H3BO3 and shell numbers can be tuned by suitable mediating hydrolysis and deposition reaction (see the detailed experimental procedure in ESI†). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image shown in Fig. 1(a) indicates that the products consist of uniform hexagonal nanoplates, successfully inheriting the shape of Cd(OH)2 templates. The inset of Fig. 1(a) shows the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image of a randomly broken nanoplate, obviously revealing the central cavity and shelled structure. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images shown in Fig. 1(b) to (d) further verify successful duplication of hexagonal Cd(OH)2 templates with plate thickness of 30–40 nm, shell thickness of 10–12 nm and shell spacing of ∼8 nm, respectively. The SAED pattern (inset of Fig. 1(c)) of one chosen hierarchical nanoplate clearly shows bright diffraction rings indexed to (101), (004), (200), (211), and (204) planes, respectively, of anatase TiO2, indicating its polycrystalline nature. HRTEM images show the d-spacing of 0.35 nm corresponding well with that of the (101) plane of anatase TiO2. The results of elemental analysis indicate only trace Cd residue in the products (Fig. S1 in ESI†). The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms show type IV isotherms with H3 and H4 hysteresis-loops, arising from both platelike structures with slitlike pores and internal voids of hexagonal shape with broad size distribution (Fig. S2 in ESI†).

To optimize light harvesting of the photoanode film composed of TiO2 nanoplates, a precise control of hierarchical structure and high surface area is desired. The shell number was found to be strongly dependent on the deposition state of TiO2 sol on the template upon (NH4)2TiF6 hydrolysis. If white precipitates were collected immediately after the reaction, hollow nanoplates with a single shell 10–12 nm in thickness would be obtained (Fig. S3 in ESI†). Double-shelled TiO2 nanoplates, as mentioned earlier, were obtained while keeping the white precipitates in the reaction solution for 18 h. Interestingly, when the double-shelled TiO2 products were put into a fresh precursor solution, TiO2 nanoplates with three shells were formed with an unchanged thickness of each shell (Fig. S4 in ESI†). It is reasonable to speculate that repeating the above process would form multi-shelled TiO2 hollow plates with variable hierarchical structures. During the formation process, two equilibrium reactions occurred simultaneously, hydrolysis of (NH4)2TiF6 and deposition of TiO2 sol. The reaction process can be summarized as follows,[TiF6]2− + nH2O = [TiF6−n(OH)n]2− + nH+ + nF−H3BO3 + 4H+ + 4F− = BF4− + H3O+ + 2H2OCd(OH)2 + 2H+ = Cd2+ + 2H2OThe metal-fluoro complex ion, TiF62−, would hydrolyze to TiO2 sol in the system upon the addition of boric acid as an F− scavenger. Once Cd(OH)2 nanoplates were immersed, deposition of the TiO2 sol would take place easily on the surface of Cd(OH)2 nanoplates as the deposition sites, accompanied by the gradual dissolution of Cd(OH)2 due to the presence of H+ in the system. When Cd(OH)2 nanoplates were completely dissolved, hollow nanoplates could be formed. For the formation of TiO2 hollow plates with variable mesoshells, a localized “inside-out Ostwald ripening” mechanism could be taken to address the formation mechanism. Initially, a robust shell of TiO2 sol formed upon complete deposition by 2 h vigorously stirring. Prolonging deposition time without stirring may induce gradual deposition of amorphous TiO2 on the robust TiO2 shell, which is kinetically favored. As the supersaturation dropped with time, another thermodynamically stable and robust shell of TiO2 formed on the outer surface of amorphous TiO2. However, unlike this robust shell, there existed a strong tendency for these amorphous TiO2 to recrystallize and diffuse into the robust shells around upon the following calcination process. Hence, continuous void space between two TiO2 shells formed. The calcination also improved the crystallinity of the products with micropores formation within the shells during the rearrangement of the crystallized TiO2 particles. The formation mechanism of the TiO2 hollow nanoplates with tunable shells is schematically shown in Fig. 2.

        Light scattering properties have been generally accepted as one important attribute in determining light harvesting efficiencies. Herein, the bilayer photoanode was screen-printed with a ∼4 μm light scattering nanoplates layer and a ∼8 μm P25 TiO2 bottom layer (the cross-sectional SEM image is shown in Fig. S5 in ESI†). Fig. 3 shows the diffused reflection spectra of the undyed bilayer films and P25 TiO2 film with the same thickness (∼12 μm). The reflectance of nanoplates bilayer films is found to be markedly higher than that of P25 TiO2 film over the entire region, indicating a superior light scattering effect. With increasing the shell number of the hollow nanoplates, better reflection can be obtained due to the confinement of incident light within the mesoshells. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra further confirm better scattering effect of the hierarchical nanoplates layer with IPCE values 1.2 times higher than that of P25 TiO2 layer at the maximum value of the IPCE spectra at 525 nm (Fig. S6 in ESI†).

Dye loading capacity was also studied by measuring the BET surface areas and saturation adsorption of N719 dye of the nanoplates, implying larger specific surface area and higher dye adsorption were obtained upon shell numbers (Table S1 in ESI†) and a relatively higher current density may be therefore expected. Fig. 4(a) shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the nanoplates layer with dye loading. Better absorption performance is obtained from the combination of better light scattering and relatively larger surface areas of the nanoplates film. Fig. 4(b) shows the current–voltage (I–V) curves of the DSSCs constructed from nanoplates and the results are summarized in Table S2 in ESI†. The cell derived from TiO2 nanoplates with three shells as the light scattering layer possesses a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 13.52 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.79 V, a fill factor (FF) of 61% and an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 6.53% at AM 1.5G condition. The conversion efficiency is 24% higher than that derived from P25 TiO2 and 14% higher than that from commercial spherical 200 nm-sized TiO2 particles (HeptaChroma SolarTech) (Fig. S7 and Table S2 in ESI†). The higher Jsc is probably related either to the amount of adsorbed dye or light scattering or both. Considering the surface area of hierarchical nanoplates, similar to or less than that of P25 TiO2 (∼52 m2 g−1), the improved cell performance confirms an enhanced light harvesting ability from the nanoplates with dense packing density to reflect incident light back somewhat and localize it within the special hierarchical structures totally to make a more efficient use of solar energy in the case of comparable dye loading capacity.

In summary, hierarchical TiO2 nanoplates with tunable shell structure were successfully fabricated by duplicating in situ dissolved Cd(OH)2 nanoplates templates via simple control of the hydrolysis and deposition reaction. On forwarding hierarchical TiO2 nanoplates to the photoanode as planar scattering layer, different from the traditional spherical structure, promising DSSC performance was obtained due to the enhanced light harvesting ability from the excellent scattering performance and comparable dye loading capacity.
