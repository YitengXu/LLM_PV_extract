Cyclic voltammetry measurements reveal that both the HOMO and LUMO levels of a structurally related analogue to PDI, perylene tetracarboxylic tetraester (PTTE), are 0.3 eV higher than those of the corresponding PDI. It was envisioned that replacing PDI by the weaker electron acceptor of PTTE in making polymeric acceptors with D–A structure could help to raise the LUMO level of the resultant polymers, which would lead to a higher Voc when these PTTE based polymers are used as acceptors in all-polymer solar cell devices. In this work, a new conjugated alternating copolymer, poly([perylene tetracarboxylic tetra(2-hexyldecyl)ester-1,7-diyl]-alt-5,5′′-(2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene)) (PPTTE-TerT), was synthesized via Stille coupling reaction and characterized as an electron acceptor. The copolymer shows good solubility in common aliphatic organic solvents and good thermal stability. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements indicate that the copolymer at solid state is amorphous. PPTTE-TerT has a relatively broad absorption in the visible region from 400–650 nm with an optical band gap of 1.91 eV. The energy levels of HOMO and LUMO derived from the onset of the first oxidation and reduction potential of the cyclic voltammograms are at −5.6 and −3.54 eV, respectively. All-polymer solar cells of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (RR-P3HT) as the donor and PPTTE-TerT as the acceptor at an optimized donor–acceptor weight ratio of 1:0.7 achieved the best power conversion efficiency of 0.76%. The Voc is 0.83 V, the short-circuit current (Jsc) is 2.38 mA cm−2 and the fill factor (FF) is 0.34 under 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) AM1.5G solar illumination. The Voc value is about 0.3 V higher than that of the all-polymer solar cell based on blending RR-P3HT with the acceptor copolymer comprised of alternating PDI-terthiophene units, which is consistent with the fact that the LUMO level of PTTE is 0.3 eV higher than that of PDI. These results indicate that PTTE is a promising electron-accepting unit to construct polymeric acceptors to be used in all-polymer BHJ solar cells.
Introduction
Recent efforts in the development of polymer/fullerene blend based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have resulted in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) approaching 10%.1–10 In polymer/fullerene blends based solar cells, the weak absorption of fullerene derivatives in the visible region largely decides their primary role as the electron acceptor and the electron transport material, with much less contribution to the solar light absorption. In addition, the deep lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of fullerene based acceptors also limit the energetically expected open-circuit voltage (Voc) for polymer/fullerene based BHJs, since the Voc of such BHJ cells is (almost linearly) proportional to the energy level difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the electron donors and the LUMO of fullerene acceptors.11,12 For these reasons, alternative strategies to replace these fullerene acceptors, for example, by electron-accepting polymers, are identified as one of the research priorities for further advancing the efficiency of BHJ cells. Indeed, using polymers for both donors and acceptors offers a few advantages. For example, both components can be rationally tuned to absorb different parts of the solar spectrum. If appropriate energy levels are matched to achieve efficient photo induced electron transfer, and the subsequent charge transport within the polymer/polymer blends can be achieved efficiently, higher energy conversion efficiencies can be expected. Unfortunately, it is very challenging to identify such efficient acceptors based on polymers. In fact, only a few polymeric acceptors with appreciable efficiencies in all-polymer solar cells have been demonstrated.13–23 As one of the most successful examples, all-polymer solar cells utilizing alternating fluorene-dithienylbenzothiadizaole copolymers of high molecular weight as the electron acceptor have been reported to demonstrate a notable efficiency of 2.7%.13 Impressive as the efficiency value is, the photovoltaic performance of all-polymer blend based BHJ solar cells is still far less than those of polymer/fullerene blends. Therefore, the development of novel semiconducting polymers with electron accepting characteristics to achieve high efficiency all-polymer solar cells remains a grand challenge.
Perhaps the most important design criterion for an ideal polymeric acceptor is that its HOMO and LUMO levels must be appropriately adjusted (i.e., sufficiently lowered) to the corresponding levels of the donor polymer in the BHJ blend, such that an efficient dissociation of excitons can occur at the polymer/polymer interface. Substitution of strong electron-withdrawing groups, such as cyano, nitro, and perfluorogroups, onto conjugated backbones has been the primary strategy to lower the LUMO and HOMO levels of conjugated polymers, in order to obtain polymeric acceptors.14 Another method, which has also been actively pursued, is to incorporate electron deficient building blocks such as isoindigos, quinoxaline, thienopyrazine and diketopyrrolopyrrole into homopolymers or copolymers. This method has resulted in new polymeric acceptors with related all-polymer solar cells showing PCE up to 0.5%.15–17 Conceptually similarly to this method, aromatic diimides have also been incorporated into polymeric semiconductors that have shown good thermal and oxidative stability, high electron affinity and high electron mobility.14 Indeed, polymeric acceptors based on perylene diimide (PDI) or naphthalene diimide (NDI) units have already been instrumental in improving the efficiency of all-polymer solar cells up to 2%.18,20–24
Perylene diimide (PDI) and thiophene analogues based electron-deficient copolymers usually have their LUMOs located at between −3.7 and −4.3 eV.14,24,25 Thus when these n-type PDI based copolymers are mixed with regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (RR-P3HT) with its HOMO and LUMO levels at −5.1 eV and −3.2 eV,26 these all-polymer based BHJ devices have only shown a low Voc around 0.5 V and PCE less than 0.8%. Although PCE up to 2% were achieved recently from a regio-regular acceptor of a PDI-dithiophene alternating copolymer by employing inverted BHJ device configuration, the reported Voc was still around 0.5 V.24 Interestingly, structurally related to PDI, but with four electron deficient carboxylic ester groups attached, perylene tetracarboxylic tetraester (PTTE) has rarely been considered as an efficient electron acceptor,27 and has never been introduced into conjugated polymer backbones. Thus there have been no previous reports on using PTTE, or related polymers, as acceptors in solar cells. However, PTTE does have interesting features when compared with the more commonly employed PDI. For example, in addition to an increased solubility of PTTE than that of PDI with identical side chains (e.g., PTTE-HD vs. PDI-HD in Fig. 1), both the oxidative and reductive potentials of PTTE-HD are shifted negatively ∼0.3 V to those of PDI-HD, suggesting a weaker electron-withdrawing ability of PTTEs than that of PDIs. Therefore, the replacement of the PDI unit by the PTTE unit in PDI based polymeric acceptors with D–A structures would likely raise the LUMO levels of the new PTTE based polymeric acceptor. Such an increased LUMO energy level would help improve the Voc of related solar cells.11
 Fig. 1  The molecular structures and energy levels of PTTE-HD and PDI-HD and their corresponding cyclic voltammograms acquired in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 solution in anhydrous methylene dichloride with a scan rate of 30 mV s−1 and 100 mV s−1, respectively. 
Herein we report the synthesis of a new soluble alternating copolymer based on perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic tetra(2-hexyldecyl)ester (PTTE-HD) and 2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene (PPTTE-TerT), and its application as an electron acceptor mixed with RR-P3HT in all-polymer solar cells. A much improved Voc (0.83 V) was observed in such all-polymer solar cells. Interestingly, a rather low loading of this n-type polymer (23 wt%) was sufficient to fully achieve the Voc. The highest efficiency observed was 0.76%, mainly limited by the low Jsc and FF.

Structure and property characterization
All 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Mercury plus-400 MHz spectrometer in CDCl3. Elemental analysis was tested on Elementar Vario EL III instrument. The mass spectroscopy was performed on a VG-ZA-HS EI or Bruker Biflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis were carried out on a NETZSCH syncthermogravimetric analyzer (STA449F3) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen. The temperature of degradation (Td) was correlated to a 5% weight loss. Molecular weights of the polymer were determined with gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using Shimadzu LC solution, tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the eluent and polystyrenes as standards to calibrate.
Optical absorption spectra of films were taken by a Shimadzu UV-1750 spectrophotometer. Pristine and blend films were spun coated onto pre-cleaned glass substrate from polymer solutions in CH2Cl2 or ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), respectively. Fluorescence spectra of the films on quartz glasses from polymer solutions in ODCB were acquired with an excited wavelength at 520 nm on a LS 55 Fluorescence Spectrometer. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) measurements were obtained at room temperature under highly purified N2 using a standard three-electrode configuration connected to a CHI 660D Electrochemical Analyzer. The solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in anhydrous acetonitrile was used as the supporting electrolyte. The counter electrode was a platinum wire and an Ag/AgNO3 (0.01 M AgNO3 in supporting electrolyte) electrode was employed as the reference electrode. Films of the polymer were drop-cast onto the working electrode of a glassy carbon disk from a 2 mg mL−1 solution in CHCl3 and dried under nitrogen stream prior to the measurements which were recorded at a constant scan rate of 100 mV s−1. HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the copolymer were estimated respectively from the onsets of oxidation and reduction potentials and calibrated with the internal standard of a ferrocene/ferrocinium pair (Fc/Fc+), assuming the energy level of Fc/Fc+ is 4.8 eV below the vacuum level.
Fabrication and characterization of the solar cells
All-polymer BHJs were fabricated with a basic device configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios PH750)/RR-P3HT:PPTTE-TerT/Ca (20 nm)/Al (80 nm). Glass substrates with patterned ITO were sonicated for 10 minutes subsequently in DI water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, followed by drying under a stream of N2. The substrates were then treated over UV-ozone for 5 minutes. A layer (45 nm) of PEDOT:PSS film was spun-cast onto the substrates at 3000 rpm for 60 s and baked at 150 °C for 30 minutes. The substrates were then transferred into a glovebox under N2. Subsequently, the active layer was spun-cast from the blended solutions in ODCB with a different blend ratio (weight ratio) of RR-P3HT and PPTTE-TerT onto the PEDOT:PSS film for 60 s and dried naturally in the glovebox. The concentration of the solution of RR-P3HT was fixed at 13 mg mL−1 for processing. Finally, Ca (20 nm) and Al (80 nm) were sequentially deposited on the top of the active layer as the cathode at a pressure around 4 × 10−6 mbar through a shadow mask that defines 8 devices with each active area of 18 mm2. The thicknesses of the active layers were recorded by a DEKTAK XT profilometer.
Current–voltage measurements were carried out in a nitrogen-filled glove box under AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) from a 450 W solar simulator (Newport 94023A-U) calibrated by a NREL certified standard silicon cell. Current versus potential (J–V) curves were recorded with a Keithley 2420 digital source meter. For the external quantum efficiency (EQE) tests, the devices were transferred by a self-made testing box under the protection of nitrogen atmosphere into the sample chamber of a 7-SCSpec Spectral Performance of Solar Cell Test System consisting of a 500 watt SCS028-7ILX500 xenon light source, a 7ISW301 vertical grating spectrometer, a 7IFW6 filter wheel, a SR540 chopper and a SR810 lock-in amplifier. The calibration of the incident monochromatic light was carried out with a Hamamatsu S1337-1010BQ Silicon photo detector.
The electron mobility of the copolymer was tested in the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (45 nm)/PPTTE-TerT (125 nm)/Ca (20 nm)/Al (80 nm) by taking the dark current–voltage in the range of 0–5 V and fitting the results to a space charge limited form.
Thin film X-ray diffraction (XRD) data was recorded by an out-of-plane XRD profile in reflection mode with a D8 ADVANCE X-ray Diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.540598 Å) at room temperature. The morphologies of the blend films were characterized through the traditional Tapping Mode on a Multimode 8 SPM at ambient conditions. RTESPA (0.01–0.025 ohm cm Antimony (n) doped silicon) tips with a spring constant of 20–80 N m−1 and frequency of 305–356 kHz were used in the imaging.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
Scheme 1 shows the synthesis of PPTTE-TerT. First, perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic tetra (2-hexyldecyl) ester (PTTE-HD) was prepared from the esterification of perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride (PTCDA) with 2-hexyl-1-decanol and 1-bromo-2-hexyldecane in acetonitrile. Long alkyl chains of 2-hexyldecyl were introduced to improve the solubility of the target alternating copolymer since the other building block, ter-thiophene, has no solubilizing side chains. One advantage of PTTE over the more commonly employed PDI is that PTTE has four solubilizing alkyl groups attached, rather than the two alkyls on PDI. Thus with identical alkyl chains (and other constructing units), alkylated PTTE (and related conjugated polymers) would have much better solubility than that of PDI (and its related polymers). This increased solubility of the conjugated polymers incorporating alkylated PTTE would allow the use of shorter chains on PTTE, which could shorten the intermolecular distance among polymers in the solid state and benefit the exciton separation and the charge transport.28

The subsequent bromination of PTTE-HD and purification led to the desired 1,7-dibromo-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic tetra(2-hexyldecyl)ester, mixed with ∼0.22 equivalent of 1,6-isomer, as indicated by 1H NMR (ESI, Fig. S1a†). Multiple attempts to separate the 1,6-isomer from the mixture were not successful, therefore we submitted the mixture to polymerization with di-stannylated terthiophene via Stille coupling polymerization. The resultant PPTTE-TerT, with four long alkyl chains on the PTTE unit, displayed good solubility in common organic solvents at room temperature, including n-hexane, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, THF and chlorobenzene. The chemical structure of PPTTE-TerT was verified by 1H NMR spectroscopy (ESI, Fig. S1b†) and the molecular weight and distribution of PPTTE-TerT were 52.75 kDa (number-average, Mn), and 68.51 kDa (weight-average, Mw), with a dispersity of 1.30. Additionally, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that PPTTE-TerT has good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (Td) of 340 °C under nitrogen flow (ESI, Fig. S2†). Further, PPTTE-TerT did not show any distinct transition up to 300 °C from the synchronous differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) scan, indicating the copolymer is amorphous in the solid state.
Optical, electrochemical properties and quantum chemical calculations
Fig. 2 displays the normalized optical absorption spectra of PPTTE-TerT both in solution and as a thin film, together with that of RR-P3HT film on quartz substrate. The copolymer displays a broad absorption in the visible region from 350 to 650 nm, with two absorption peaks at 412 nm and 539 nm. We did not observe any distinct red-shift from the thin film absorption of PPTTE-TerT when compared with its spectrum in solution, suggesting no significant aggregation when transitioning from solution to the solid state. The optical band gap of PPTTE-TerT was estimated to be 1.91 eV, determined from the onset of the film absorption. The strong absorption of PPTTE-TerT in the range of 350–450 nm complements the strong absorption of RR-P3HT appearing at 450–650 nm, indicating a BHJ blend of PPTTE-TerT and RR-P3HT would cover a significant fraction of the visible spectrum (350–650 nm).

To determine whether PPTTE-TerT can serve as an n-type semiconductor in BHJ solar cells with other p-type semiconductors, we applied cyclic voltammetry to approximate the relative energy levels of PPTTE-TerT. Fig. 3a shows the cyclic voltammogram of PPTTE-TerT, revealing quasi-reversible reduction with an onset potential of −1.26 V and irreversible oxidation with an onset potential of 0.8 V, both of which are relative to the oxidation potential of ferrocene. Using the empirical formula, EHOMO = −(Eox,onset + 4.8) eV and ELUMO = −(Ered,onset + 4.8) eV,29 we estimated the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PPTTE-TerT at −5.60 eV and −3.54 eV, respectively. The alignment of the energy levels of PPTTE-TerT with those of RR-P3HT is shown in Fig. 3b, which clearly indicates that the LUMO level of PPTTE-TerT is 0.34 eV lower than that of RR-P3HT, while the HOMO level is 0.5 eV lower. The offset between the two LUMO levels of PPTTE-TerT and RR-P3HT and that between the corresponding two HOMO levels are sufficiently large to enable electron transfer and charge separation at the RR-P3HT/PPTTE-TerT blend interface, since the generally accepted minimal value for such offset to these necessary processes is ∼0.3 eV.15,26 One benefit of adopting PPTTE-TerT as the acceptor is that PPTTE-TerT has a relatively high-lying LUMO energy level at −3.54 eV, which can contribute to higher open-circuit voltages in organic photovoltaic devices, based on PPTTE-TerT as the acceptor, than the counterparts based on fullerene acceptors (or PDI based polymeric acceptors).

Computational study of the copolymer gave better insight into its electronic structure, accounting for the observed optical and electrochemical properties. To appropriately depict the electronic features of the PTTE units in the conjugated backbone of PPTTE-TerT, the local unit of TerT-PTTE-TerT was subject to the calculations, with the alkyl chains replaced by methyl groups. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels and the electron density distributions of the unit of Tert-PTTE-TerT were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory based on the optimized geometry using density functional theory with the Gaussian 09 package. As indicated in Fig. 4, the electron density of the HOMO of TerT-PTTE-TerT was mainly delocalized on the terthiophene units and partially across the entire backbone of PTTE, while the electron density of the LUMO of TerT-PTTE-TerT was mainly localized on the backbone of the PTTE moiety and partially extended to its adjacent thiophene units. These distinguished electron density distributions on the HOMO and LUMO help reveal the electron deficient nature of the PTTE units in the conjugated backbone of the PPTTE-TerT.

Fluorescence quenching, mobility and photovoltaic properties
Comparing the optical absorption features and energy levels of PPTTE-TerT with those of RR-P3HT indicates a potential BHJ device, with PPTTE-TerT serving as the acceptor and RR-P3HT as the donor. Prior to the BHJ device fabrication and testing, we probed the pristine films and their blended film with static fluorescence spectroscopy. Fig. 5 reveals that the distinct and strong fluorescence of both RR-P3HT and PPTTE-TerT was significantly quenched after they were mixed (with a 1:1 weight ratio) into a BHJ. We attributed such fluorescence quenching to the photo-induced charge transfer between P3HT and PPTTE-TerT, rather than the energy transfer, since both polymers in their pristine films have similar optical bandgaps with an appropriate offset of energy levels, and the fluorescence of both components was quenched after blending these two polymers.

We next investigated the charge carrier mobility of PPTTE-TerT, since the charge carrier mobility is a key parameter that would largely decide the device performance of the BHJ solar cells. Fast electron and hole transport in addition to balanced mobilities are desirable features for such BHJ cells. In our experiment we applied PPTTE-TerT film as a thin layer in an electron-only device with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PPTTE-TerT/Ca/Al. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows that the dark current density scales quadratically with the corrected voltage, indicating characteristics of field independent space charge limited current (SCLC) transport through the layer. The electron mobility of the pristine acceptor polymer PPTTE-TerT was then determined by fitting the I–V curve to the SCLC formula, with an estimated value of ∼1.4 × 10−4 m2 V−1 S−1. This quite respectable electron mobility of PPTTE-TerT is in fact close to the hole mobility of RR-P3HT, also measured via SCLC,30 implying a rather fast and balanced charge transport could be achieved in the BHJ device of PPTTE-TertT:RR-P3HT.
All previously discussed results indicate that a BHJ device of PPTTE-TerT:RR-P3HT should work as a solar cell with potentially high efficiencies. We therefore fabricated all-polymer BHJs comprised of RR-P3HT as the donor and PPTTE-TerT as the acceptor with a standard device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/RR-P3HT:PPTTE-TerT/Ca (20 nm)/Al (80 nm) and investigated the photovoltaic performance of these devices. As part of the device optimization, we varied the film thickness at different donor–acceptor weight ratios. The optimum RR-P3HT:PPTTE-TerT weight ratio was found to be 1:0.7, defined as the weight ratio that gave the highest efficiency in our tested solar cells. Fig. 6 displays the typical J–V curves of the all-polymer BHJ blends at different donor–acceptor weight ratios and optimized thicknesses, with the photovoltaic parameters of these devices summarized in Table 1.

Indeed, a Voc of 0.85 V was obtained for the RR-P3HT:PPTTE-TerT BHJ cells, which is ∼0.3 V higher than that of the BHJ solar cell comprising of the n-type copolymer of alternating PDI and terthiophene/bithiophene units and the p-type RR-P3HT.24,25 This noticeably improved Voc demonstrates the benefit of the higher LUMO level offered by the acceptor polymer PPTTE-TerT, resulting from replacing PDI with PTTE units in the conjugated backbone. Furthermore, the weight ratio of the donor and acceptor polymers in the BHJ blend has much less impact on the Voc and FF, but the weight ratio noticeably affected the Jsc and thus the overall PCE. Nevertheless, RR-P3HT:PPTTE-TerT at a 1:0.7 weight ratio provided the best device performance with a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 2.74 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 0.34, offering the highest PCE of 0.76% at the optimized film thickness of 149 nm of the blend. While the observed Jsc and FF are modest when compared with these values of state-of-the-art fullerene:polymer solar cells, they are comparable to corresponding values obtained from other all-polymer solar cells based on non-fullerene polymers, such as PDIs and NDIs.14,24,25
To probe the effectiveness of the polymer in converting light into current, we conducted the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements of the optimized BHJ devices under the illumination of monochromatic light. Fig. 7 shows the EQE spectrum of the BHJ device based on RR-P3HT:PPTTE-TerT (weight ratio of 1:0.7) and the corresponding absorption of its thin film. The calculated Jsc value obtained by integrating the EQE spectra with the standard AM1.5G solar spectrum corroborated the Jsc value acquired from the J–V measurement (within 5% error). More importantly, the EQE spectrum traces the optical absorption of the active layer quite well, exhibiting a broad photo response from 350 nm to 650 nm with a rather uniform plateau of EQE around 10–15%. It is very encouraging that the n-type polymer, PPTTE-TerT, noticeably contributes to the photocurrent (e.g., 350 nm to 450 nm where the RR-P3HT barely absorbs), since the prevailing fullerene derivatives (e.g., PC61BM) contribute very little to the current of their BHJ devices. This clearly shows the advantage of having a non-fullerene based acceptor in the BHJ cells.

Morphological study
The morphology of the donor–acceptor blend in BHJ solar cells has a significant impact on the key device performance characteristics, in particular the Jsc and FF. On one hand, small donor and acceptor domains and intimate mixing favor exciton dissociation and charge generation. On the other hand, large donor–acceptor domains and bicontinuous pathways can improve charge transport to the corresponding electrodes. Therefore, striking a delicate balance between the phase separated domain size and the network of these domains in the active BHJ layer is crucial in achieving both efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport.15,31 In order to further understand the cause for the observed small Jsc in our cells, we applied atomic force microscopy (AFM) with tapping mode to investigate the surface morphology of the RR-P3HT:PPTTE-TerT blends as indicated in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  AFM topographical height (top) and phase (bottom) images of RR-P3HT:PPTTE-TerT blend film at a blend ratio of 1:0.3 (a and d), 1:0.7 (b and e) and 1:1 (c and f). These images were acquired from the actual BHJ solar cells in regions where the cathode material was not deposited. 
Fig. 8 shows the AFM topography (top) and phase images (bottom) of the blends at different donor–acceptor weight ratios (1:0.3, 1:0.7 and 1:1). Depending on the weight ratio, the RR-P3HT:PPTTE-TerT blend demonstrates noticeably different surface morphologies. For example, particles ∼100 nm in size can be observed from the height image (Fig. 8a) of the blend at a weight ratio of 1:0.3, with a surface root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of 10 nm. Its corresponding phase image (Fig. 8d) shows an almost featureless surface, suggesting intimate mixing of the two polymer components and abundant donor–acceptor interfacial areas. As we increased the ratio of the acceptor, PPTTE-TerT, in the donor–acceptor blend to the weight ratio of 1:1, we obtained fibrillar morphology with a RMS of 33 nm in the blend (Fig. 8c). Such a rough surface indicates the polymer self-organization to form ordered structures in the film, and the obtained RMS of 33 nm can be correlated to the degree of ordering of RR-P3HT in the bulk as previously reported.32 Furthermore, the phase image (Fig. 8f) indicates interlaced P3HT fibers on the surface with dimensions of 2–5 μm in length and 20–40 nm in width, suggesting strong phase segregation between RR-P3HT and PPTTE-TerT. For the blend at the weight ratio of 1:0.7, the fibrillar structure with scattered grains can also be observed with a RMS of 26 nm. These fibers have dimensions of 1–5 μm in length and 30–50 nm in width. Compared with the phase image of the 1:1 blend, the phase image of the 1:0.7 blend (Fig. 8e) gives a more interconnected network of two different phases with fine features. The analysis of Fig. 8b and e indicates that not only a good phase separation occurs between RR-P3HT and PPTTE-TerT, but that amorphous materials also exist, which might be both RR-P3HT and PPTTE-TerT molecules, in between these fibers. The AFM results clearly suggest that the weight percentage of PPTTE-TerT in the donor–acceptor blend strongly affects the order of RR-P3HT in the blended BHJ films and other features of the morphology. It appears that the film morphology at the weight ratio of 1:0.7 reaches a compromise between the phase separated domains, their size and interconnectivity. This more desirable morphology helps explain, at least in part, the better Jsc of the 1:0.7 based BHJ device over those of the other two BHJ devices with different donor–acceptor ratios.
As the final part of the morphology study, we also conducted out of plane grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurement of the pristine and blend films at different weight ratios to examine the order of RR-P3HT in the blend films after introducing the copolymer PPTTE-TerT. As shown from the GIXRD profiles (Fig. S4 in ESI†), no diffraction signals were detected from the neat film of PPTTE-TerT, indicating its amorphous nature. However, the pristine RR-P3HT and all the RR-P3HT:PPTTE-TerT blend films exhibit a diffraction peak at around 2θ ≈ 5.4° with a spacing value of ∼16.4 Å, which can be assigned to the (100) interchain packing of RR-P3HT along the direction of the alkyl side chains. This observed local crystallinity of RR-P3HT is consistent with the AFM results.
Conclusions
In summary, we introduced the perylene tetracarboxylic tetraester (PTTE) as a new electron-accepting unit to construct the polymeric acceptor to be used in BHJ solar cells. Compared with its more commonly employed analog, perylene diimide (PDI), PTTE has a few notable advantages, including better solubility and raised LUMO level. As a proof-of-concept, we have successfully synthesized an alternating copolymer, poly([perylenetetracarboxylictetra(2-hexyldecyl)ester-1,7-diyl]-alt-5,5′′-(2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene)) (PPTTE-TerT), and carefully investigated its physical properties and the device characteristics of the all-polymer solar cells based on its BHJ blend with RR-P3HT. A power efficiency (PCE) of 0.76% was achieved for such all-polymer BHJs with a Voc as high as 0.83 V. This value is 0.3 V higher than that of the BHJ device based on blending RR-P3HT with the structurally related polymeric acceptor comprised of alternating PDI-terthiophene units. The rather small Jsc and FF were partly ascribed to the non-ideal morphology. In addition, with a band gap of 1.91 eV, PPTTE-TerT has a significant absorption overlap with that of the RR-P3HT which has a similar band gap. This also limits the maximum current that can be achieved from the RR-P3HT:PPTTE-TerT based BHJ cells. Nevertheless, EQE measurement indeed shows that the new polymeric acceptor does contribute noticeably to the current. All these results indicate that a much better efficiency can be projected if PPTTE-TerT is paired with a donor polymer with complementary absorption (e.g., smaller band gap). Alternatively, one can design new polymeric acceptors based on PTTE with complementary absorption and energy levels to those of RR-P3HT or low band-gap polymeric donors, which is currently under investigation in our laboratory.
