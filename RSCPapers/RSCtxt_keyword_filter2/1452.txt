    , Accepted 22nd December 2020First published on 18th January 2021AbstractTwo donor–π–acceptor type dyes, Zn[10,20-(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin] (Ko-1) and Zn[5,15-diphenylaminophenyl-10,20-(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin] (Ko-2), with two different donor units were designed and synthesized for solar cell applications. The Ko-2 dye contains the triphenylamine group as an electron donor group, the porphyrin unit acts as a π-bridge, and the carboxylic acid group acts as an anchoring group (electron acceptor unit). The Ko-2 dye has a red-shifted absorption maxima owing to the introduction of the dimethylaminophenyl moiety at the meso position of the porphyrin ring. The highly conjugated dimethylaminophenyl group efficiently donates electrons and the electronic interaction between the porphyrin and dimethylaminophenyl unit is better compared to hydrogen. A dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) was made using commercial P25 TiO2 material as a photoanode, the Zn–porphyrin derivatives as sensitizers, I−/I3− as an electrolyte, and platinum (Pt) as the counter electrode. The molar extinction coefficient, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) values of the Ko-2 dye are 1.73 × 105 M−1 cm−1, −5.82 eV, and −3.35 eV, respectively, which are more suitable for DSSC applications than those of the Ko-1 dye, which were 1.31 × 105 M−1 cm−1, −6.16 eV, and −3.60 eV, respectively. The solar cell performance of the Ko-2-based DSSC reached 3.3% efficiency with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.68 V, a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 9.69 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.49; the Ko-1-based DSSC reached 1.90% efficiency, a Voc of 0.67 V, a Jsc of 5.51 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.54 under AM 1.5 G irradiation.
1. Introduction
The increasing consumption of fossil fuels, inciting global warming and environmental pollution, has led to a greater focus on renewable energy sources and sustainable development. Increasing energy demand pushes us to find more and more renewable energy sources. Solar energy plays a key role as a renewable, clean and inexhaustible resource and the development of efficient novel molecules to capture and use solar energy more cheaply for solar cell technology is becoming more important. The sensitization of semiconductors with a significant number of dyes for light harvesting has been investigated over the past few years for the development of efficient solar cells.1–5 Porphyrin sensitizers were among the first natural types of dyes examined, and to this day they continue to be some of the most frequently studied sensitizers. Recently, the highest efficiency was achieved in the porphyrin sensitized solar cell field when a record efficiency of 13% was reported using a single push–pull porphyrin dye SM315.6–8 As many novel types of solar cells have been studied and developed since the breakthrough by Gratzel and co-workers, the research on dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has intensified in recent years. Recently, the first application of building integrated photo-voltaic technology (BIPV) was demonstrated which showed the potential of a more colorful and transparent solar cell technology.9–11 In this type of solar cell, the properties of the dye, such as the color, molecular extinction coefficient and robustness under illumination, are of most importance. However, ruthenium dyes are expensive owing to the cost of ruthenium and the typically lengthy purification steps involved in their preparation. Alternative low cost and readily accessible ruthenium dye replacements are under active investigation. The porphyrins have certain advantages over ruthenium sensitizers. Porphyrin sensitizers can be conveniently synthesized using well-established protocols. Unlike their ruthenium counterparts, these sensitizers are inexpensive, stable and durable. The porphyrin derivatives showed relatively higher molar absorption coefficients; in other words, they are good harvesters. Therefore, considering these advantages and the high efficiency we can say that porphyrins are indeed a good alternative to ruthenium dyes.12
The porphyrin based dyes have several advantages, such as a good photostability and rigid molecular structure with large absorption coefficients in the visible region. In addition, four meso and eight beta positions of porphyrins are available for functionalization which lead to fine tuning of their optical, physical and electrochemical properties and make them more feasible for use in DSSCs.13,14 Nature accomplishes increased light absorption by stacking of the chlorophyll-containing thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast to form a disc shaped structure that acts as a light harvesting antenna. This structure absorbs the incident light and then directs the excitation energy to the reaction centers, where light-induced charge separation takes place.15,16 Based on their primary role in photosynthesis, the use of porphyrins as light harvesters on semiconductors is particularly attractive. Owing to the delocalized macrocyclic structure and the strong, more intense absorption in the 400–450 nm region (Soret band) as well as the less intense absorption bands (2–4 times) in the 500–700 nm region (Q-bands), porphyrins have been studied extensively and proved to be promising components for molecular electronic and photonic devices.17,18 A great number of artificial photonic assemblies based on multi-porphyrin architectures have been designed to mimic photosynthetic solar energy transduction by converting the excitation energy to the chemical potential in the form of long-lived charge separation.19 Recently, Kim et al. reported the photovoltaic activities of various beta-functionalized porphyrin dyes.20 This work was motivated by the consideration that the functionalization of porphyrins at the pyrrolic beta-position with p-conjugative linkers could represent a possible strategy for the preparation of more efficient DSSCs. The resulting extension of the p-conjugation framework, along with the anchoring group (e.g., carboxylic acid) allows a more effective injection of electrons into the conduction band of the semiconductor, which acts as a photoanode. On this basis, the use of a porphyrin containing both the conjugated anchoring carboxyl groups and a donor group attached at a meso position was expected to give rise to highly effective DSSCs. Therefore, the rational design of efficient porphyrin dyes, having good light harvesting abilities in the visible and near IR regions is important to obtain a large photocurrent response. Appropriate donor–acceptor groups on the porphyrin ring can significantly broaden the Soret band, as well as the Q bands, which leads to their enhanced light absorbing properties, as well as the photovoltaic efficiency.
Herein, we have designed and synthesized two Zn–porphyrin dyes, Zn[10,20-(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin] (Ko-1) and Zn[5,15-diphenylaminophenyl-10,20-(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin] (Ko-2). The structures of the synthesized dyes were characterized using NMR spectroscopy. The dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) was made using commercial TiO2 material as a photoanode, Zn–porphyrin derivatives as a sensitizer, I−/I3− as an electrolyte and platinum (Pt) as a counter electrode. The highest power conversion efficiency of the two Zn–porphyrin derivatives was achieved using the Ko-2 based on DSSC and reached 3.35%, the Ko-1 based DSSC reached 1.90%. The optical, electrochemical, time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) and photovoltaic performance of these dyes have been analyzed and discussed.

3. Solar cell fabrication
Fluorine doped SnO2 glass (FTO 7 Ω cm−2) was washed with isopropanol, ethanol and deionized water using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. The TiO2 nanoparticles (Degussa P25 Solaronix) were ground for an appropriate time using Triton-X 100, acetyl acetone, ethanol and water to make a colloid blend. A 10 μm thick film of TiO2 nanoparticles was deposited onto the side of the conducting layer of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass using the doctor blade technique. TiO2 substrates were sintered at 450 °C for 30 minutes in air. The FTO glass (15 Ω cm−2) was washed with isopropanol, ethanol and deionized water using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. The FTO glass was treated with 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 40 min and then the substrates were sintered at 430 °C for 30 min.
After cooling to 80 °C the TiO2 electrodes were immersed in the 0.5 mM dye solutions in dimethylformamide and left for 24 h at room temperature. After dye adsorption, the dye coated TiO2 electrodes were cleaned. Pt (Platisol Solaronix) was deposited onto the side of the conducting layer of another FTO using doctor blading as the counter electrode and then the substrates were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min in air. The photovoltaic measurements were performed in a sandwich cell consisting of the porphyrin dyes sensitized TiO2 electrode as the working electrode and Pt as the counter electrode. The electrolyte consists of a I−/I3− (Iodolyte Solaronix) redox potential and the efficient irradiated area of the cell was 0.5 × 0.5 cm. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using an Oriel Class-AAA Simulator (Newport) with a xenon lamp as a light source having an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Prior to the experiment the light intensity was adjusted with a standard PV reference cell (2 × 2 cm monocrystalline silicon solar cell, calibrated at NREL, Colorado, USA) with a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit.
All photovoltaic properties such as the open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) were obtained from the J–V curve and used in the following equation to obtain the power conversion efficiency.

4. Characterization techniques
The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of all the synthesized compounds were recorded in DMSO-d6 on a Bruker AV III 500 MHz FT NMR spectrometer. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the dyes in different solvents and the diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV-Vis NIR spectrophotometer. The mass spectrometry of all the synthesized compounds were recorded on a gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometer. Cyclic voltametric studies were carried out with a ZAHNER IM66 Electrochemical Analyzer using glassy-carbon as the working electrode, platinum as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The redox potential of the dye was measured in DMF with 0.1 M TBAPF6 with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1.
The photovoltaic performance of the DSSC was evaluated using a Xenon lamp with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and integrated to an air mass (AM) 1.5 G filter (Sciencetech, Canada). The J–V curves were measured using a Keithley Model 2400 multisource meter. Prior to the experiment the light intensity was adjusted with a standard photovoltaic (PV) reference cell (2 × 2 cm monocrystalline silicon solar cell, calibrated at NREL, Colorado, USA). All of the photovoltaic properties, such as the Voc, Jsc, FF and power conversion efficiency (PCE) (η) efficiency were derived from the J–V curves. The active area of the cell was 5 × 5 mm.
5. Results and discussion
5.1 UV-Vis NIR absorption analysis
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of Ko-1 and Ko-2 in DMF solution are shown in Fig. 3 and the peak positions and molar absorption coefficients of the Soret and Q-bands of the porphyrin dyes are listed in Table 1. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of Ko-1 exhibits a strong Soret band at 421 nm. However, Ko-2 showed strong and moderate absorption peaks at 425 and 564 nm, respectively. The strong intense Soret band for the Ko-1 and Ko-2 dyes between 380 to 480 nm is due to the intramolecular π–π* electronic transition and the porphyrin species consist of a strong transition to the second excited state (S0–S2). The broad, less intense second Q-band of the Ko-2 dye between 580 to 650 nm is due the intramolecular n–π* electronic transition and this involves a weak transition to the first excited state (S0–S1).

As seen on the UV-Vis absorption spectrum, the Soret band of Ko-2 at 425 nm is 4 nm red-shifted compared with those of compound Ko-1 (421 nm).
In addition, the Ko-2 dye contains the Q-band at 564 nm. The Ko-2 dye has a long region of absorption. This is because the Ko-2 dye contains triphenylamine in the meso-position which has more conjugated double bands and also has an electron withdrawing nature compared to the Ko-1 dye, which is able to absorb the higher energy from the electromagnetic spectrum. The molar extinction coefficient (ε) of the Ko-1 Soret band is 1.31 × 105 mol L−1 cm−1 and the Ko-2 dye Soret band is 1.73 × 105 mol L−1 cm−1, which is higher than that of Ko-1. As a consequence of the extended π-conjugation, the molar extinction coefficient of Ko-2 is significantly higher than that of Ko-1. The molar extinction coefficient of the Ko-2 Q-band is 1.25 × 105 mol L−1 cm−1. This is because of the electronic interaction between the triphenylamine with the porphyrin group. This type of electronic interaction is not available in Ko-1. These results indicate that Ko-1 has a relatively weak light harvesting ability compared to Ko-2. From the above results we can conclude that the triphenylamine moiety has more phenyl-conjugated double bonds and therefore a greater light harvesting capability (Xiang et al. 2011).
5.2. Electrochemical analysis
Electrochemical studies were performed on the four dyes to elucidate the effect of the thienyl groups on the energy level of the porphyrin macro-cycle. The reduction potentials were measured using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and the oxidation potentials (Eox) corresponding to the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) energy levels of the porphyrin dyes were determined via cyclic voltammetry, as shown in Fig. 4. The Eox is the first oxidation potential (vs. NHE), and E0e0 is determined from the intercept of the normalized absorption and emission spectra. We then considered the potential levels of (Eox − Ered) corresponding to the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) level of the dyes. By the introduction of thienyl groups at the meso-positions of the porphyrin dyes, the energy level of LUMO is significantly shifted to the positive compared with the reference PZn21 and the HOMO energy levels are negatively shifted, indicating a decreased HOMO–LUMO energy gap. Furthermore, for dyes Ko-1 and Ko-2 with the introduction of electron donating groups into the porphyrin ring, a decrease of the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps relative to PZn is observed, which is consistent with the red-shift in the absorption and emission spectra. As shown in Table 2, the sufficiently low HOMO energy level of the dye will ensure that there is sufficient driving force for the dye regeneration reaction to efficiently compete with the recapture of the injected electrons using the dye cation radical. Although the LUMO energy level is more negative than the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE),22–28 indicating a sufficient driving force for electron transfer from the excited dye molecules to the conduction band of the TiO2 electrode.

Electrochemical studies were performed on the two dyes to elucidate the effect of the triphenylamine group on the energy level of the porphyrin macro-cycle. The Eox corresponding to the HOMO energy levels of the porphyrin dyes were determined via cyclic voltammetry. The cyclic voltammetry measurements for Ko-1 and Ko-2 in DMF were analyzed using TBAPF6 (0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 using a three electrode system. All of the potentials are quoted with respect to non-aqueous silver/silver chloride as a reference electrode, this electrode was externally calibrated with the Fc/Fc+ redox couple in dimethylformamide solution and has a potential of 0.558 V versus NHE and was calibrated with ferrocene. Eox is the first oxidation potential (vs. NHE) and E0–0 is determined from the intercept of the normalized absorption spectra. We then considered the potential levels of (Eox − E0–0) corresponding to the LUMO level of the dyes.29–32
The anodic and cathodic potentials of Ko-1 are 1.22, −0.33 and 1.51, −0.90 respectively. The anodic and cathodic potentials of Ko-2 are 1.17, −0.90 and 1.58, −1.56 respectively. The HOMO value of the Ko-1 is 6.61 eV and the LUMO value is −3.60 eV. The HOMO value of the Ko-2 is 5.82 eV and the LUMO value is −3.35 eV. By introducing the triphenylamine group in the Ko-2 dye at the meso-position the energy level of the LUMO is significantly shifted to the positive side compared to the Ko-1 dye (Xiang et al. 2011) and the HOMO energy level is negatively shifted, indicating a decreased HOMO–LUMO energy gap. Furthermore, upon the introduction of TPA into the porphyrin ring, a decrease in the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps relative to Ko-2 is observed, which is consistent with the red-shift in the absorption spectrum. The sufficiently low HOMO energy level of the dye will ensure that there is enough driving force for the dye regeneration reaction to compete efficiently with the recapture of the injected electrons by the dye cation radical. Although the LUMO energy level is more negative than the CB of TiO2 (Zhou et al. 2011), indicating sufficient driving force for the electron transfer from the excited dye molecules to the CB of the TiO2 electrode. The HOMO value of the Ko-2 dye is −5.82 eV which is lower than the redox potential of the I−/I3− value (−4.94 eV) and the LUMO value is −3.35 eV, which is higher than the CB value of TiO2 (−4.04 eV). These results indicate that the Ko-2 dye can easily inject the electron into the semiconductor and can easily gain electrons from the redox couple, therefore the Ko-2 dye is more suitable for DSSC applications compared to the Ko-1 dye.
5.3 Computational details
All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 W program. The B3LYP density functional with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set was used for geometric optimization. The electronic excitations were studied using TD-DFT. TD-DFT calculations were performed using CAM-B3LYP with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set.
The optimized molecular structure of Ko-1 and Ko-2 are presented in Fig. 5. The hydrogen atoms are omitted in the optimized structure and also the frontier molecular orbitals for clarity. HOMO−2, HOMO−1, HOMO, LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 for dyes Ko-1 and Ko-2 are shown in Fig. 6. The HOMO is mainly present in the central core of the porphyrin core for Ko-1 and Ko-2. The HOMO is mainly contributed by the central core and triphenylamine part of the dye sensitizers. The LUMO of the dye is mainly presented in the central core of the dye sensitizers. The HOMO energies are different owing to the triphenylamine part in Ko-2. The Ko-2 results show the reduced energy gap of the sensitizer. This is due to the donating ability of triphenylamine. The HOMO–LUMO energy gaps for Ko-1 and Ko-2 in the gas phase are 2.89 and 2.69 eV, respectively. The charge separated state is one of the factors that influences the solar cell efficiency. The HOMO energy levels and HOMO–LUMO energy gaps help to predict the efficiency of the solar cells.33–40

The simulated electronic absorption spectrum for Ko-1 and Ko-2 dye is depicted in Fig. 7. The corresponding molecular orbital transitions are presented in Table 3. The maximum wavelength was a result of the HOMO → LUMO (53%) for Ko-1 and the HOMO−1 → L+1 (43%) for Ko-2. The wavelength maximum were 545 and 561 nm for Ko-1 and Ko-2 respectively. From the spectra it can be seen that Ko-2 was red shifted compared to Ko-1. The red shift in the Ko-2 dye was due to the introduction of the triphenylamine group in the meta position. The reduced energy gap and maximum absorption wavelength was reflected in the efficiency. The Ko-2 dye shows a higher photo conversion efficiency than the Ko-1 dye.33–39

5.4 Photovoltaic performance of the DSSC
In order to study the influence of the donor units of Ko-1 and Ko-2 on the DSSC device performance, photovoltaic experiments were conducted. The devices were assembled using a layer of TiO2 in conjugation with an iodide–triiodide based electrolyte, as described above. Fig. 8 shows the J–V characteristics of the DSSC devices sensitized by Ko-1 and Ko-2 under a standard air mass 1.5 global spectral solar photon flux (AM 1.5 G with a light intensity of 100 W cm−2). The Jsc, Voc and FF of the two devices are summarized in Table 4. Although the spectral response of Ko-1 and Ko-2 is similar, as observed in Fig. 8, the overall PCE of the DSSC devices stained with dyes Ko-1 and Ko-2 appeared to be 1.90% and 3.35%, respectively. This implies the enhancement of the photo-induced charge collection of the Ko-2 dye based devices over Ko-1 dye based devices. It can be concluded from these preliminary results that the DSSCs sensitized with Ko-2 bearing the electron donating triarylamine core unit, achieved a better photovoltaic performance than those sensitized with the Ko-1 hydrogen unit.

Moreover, the lower PCE of the Ko-1 dye based DSSCs compared with that of the Ko-2 dye based DSSCs was mainly caused by a low Jsc that is attributed to the excessive electronegativity of the core unit, possibly reducing the efficiency of the electron injection from the Ko-1 molecules to TiO2. The dye Ko-2 gave the best performance. The conversion efficiency was 3.35% with a Jsc of 9.69 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.68 V and FF of 0.49. Dye Ko-1 gave a conversion efficiency of 1.90% with Jsc 5.51 mA cm−2, Voc 0.67 V and FF 0.54. The Ko-1 and Ko-2 dye based solar cell devices were fabricated under similar conditions.
The highest Jsc of Ko-2 compared with other devices in this study is attributed to the high extinction coefficient. As we know, the aggregation of the dye could decrease the Voc, the triphenylamine moiety, as a donating group, could effectively suppress the dye-aggregation (Sato et al. 2003; Sato et al. 2005). Otherwise, the increase in the intramolecular charge separation may benefit from the increase of the Voc (Ooyama et al. 2009). Accordingly, the dye Ko-2 gave the best performance, the conversion efficiency was 3.35% with a Jsc of 9.69 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.68 V and FF of 0.49, giving the largest Voc. Therefore, the performance of these dyes has improved owing to the increase in the photocurrent and open circuit voltage. We believe that the intramolecular charge separation and broad absorption bands with a high extinction coefficient are responsible for the significant enhancement of the conversion efficiency.
5.5 Dye adsorption measurements
To determine the amount of dye molecules adsorbed on the TiO2 surface we prepared 0.5 mM of Ko-1 and Ko-2 dye solutions, then analyzed these using the UV-Vis NIR spectrum. Using these absorption values the molar extinction coefficient of the initial dye solutions was calculated through the Beer–Lambert law. TiO2 films were immersed in the same dye solutions for 24 h, after that the TiO2 films were taken out. Dye desorption was carried out using 0.5 mM of NaOH in a mixed solvent (water:DMF = 1:9, v/v). Then, the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the resultant solutions were measured to estimate the amount of adsorbed dye molecules. The amount of Ko-1 and Ko-2 dye molecules adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface were 1.3 × 10−8 M cm−2 and 0.9 × 10−8 M cm−2. The Ko-2 based device gave a high dye adsorption, therefore the Ko-2 based DSSC gave a higher current (Jsc) which leads to a higher solar cell performance.
5.6 Photostability
The stability of the three kinds of dyes were analyzed using sunlight irradiated onto the photoanode, as shown in Fig. 9.
 Fig. 9  Photoanodes made of the three kinds of dyes (commercially available N719 dye, Ko-1 and Ko-2 dyes). 
After 0, 25, and 50 h the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrum of the dye molecules was analyzed and the spectrum is shown in Fig. 10 for Ko-1, Fig. 11 for Ko-2 and Fig. 12 for the N719 dye, respectively. The sunlight irradiated Ko-1 dye based photoanode FTIR spectrum remained stable for up to 25 h, after that the degradation started and continued up to 50 h. The Ko-2 based photoanode was stable up to 50 h because its FTIR spectrum remained similar up to 50 h. The N719 dye was not stable because its FTIR spectrum did not remain similar up to 50 h. Therefore, the present Ko-2 dye molecule revealed a very good photostability and the dye molecule is suitable for stable DSSC applications.

6. Conclusions
Two Zn–porphyrin dyes, Ko-1 and Ko-2, have been synthesized and applied in DSSCs. As a consequence of extended p-conjugation, both the Soret and Q bands of Ko-2 exhibit significant red shifts and a Soret band broader than that of Ko-1 is seen, because the electronic interaction with the porphyrins is more pronounced for triphenylamine than for hydrogen. The results clearly show that p-conjugation, with a highly conjugated arylamine unit, can improve the light-harvesting capabilities of porphyrin dyes; Ko-2 exhibits a greater power conversion efficiency of 3.35%. Further structural modification of the meso-substituted porphyrins and increasing the conjugated double bonds in their structure may improve the performance of the solar cells. Furthermore, their easy synthesis, low cost, and easy availability make these Zn–porphyrin-based dyes promising sensitizer materials that are suitable for the development of industrial DSSCs in the near future.
