We introduced silver trifluoromethanesulfonate (AgOTf), an inorganic chemical dopant, that tunes and controls the properties of single-layered GO films synthesized by chemical vapor deposition. The morphology, work function, mobility, sheet resistance, and transmittance of the GO film were systematically tuned by various doping concentrations. We further developed a solution-processable low-temperature hole interfacial layer (HIL) poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS):AgOTf-doped GO HIL in highly efficient perovskite solar cells. The PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO HIL grants the desirable charge-collection in the HIL allowing the entire device to be prepared at temperatures less than 120 °C. The fabricated perovskite solar cells utilize a rigid substrate and demonstrate compelling photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.90%. Moreover, flexible devices prepared using a polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/ITO demonstrate a PCE of 9.67%, while ITO-free flexible devices adopting PET/aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO)/silver (Ag)/AZO demonstrate a PCE of 7.97%. This study shows that the PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO HIL has significant potential to contribute to the development of low-cost solar cells.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells that employ an organolead halide have attracted huge attention due to their outstanding photovoltaic performance and inexpensive processing technology. Huge improvement has been made compared to the first attempt which used CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Br or I) in dye-sensitized liquid type solar cells. During the first trial in 2009, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.1–3.8% was attained by Kojima and co-workers.1 Two years later, Im and co-workers fully optimized the concentration of the CH3NH3PbI3 coating solution, thermal annealing temperature, and electrolyte compositions of their perovskite solar cell, leading to a PCE to 6.5%.2 Nonetheless, one major shortcoming of the liquid-type dye sensitized solar cell is that it easily dissolves in a polar liquid electrolyte. This issue has been overcome by substituting the liquid electrolyte with a solid hole conductor, and recently, all-solid state solar cells utilizing CH3NH3PbI3 which is coated on the compact titanium dioxide (TiO2) layer as demonstrated by the PCE of 9.7%.3 This highly efficient perovskite solar cell is also accompanied by a good lifetime.3 Previous reports established that a perovskite performs well not only on using a TiO2 film, but also on using aluminum oxide (Al2O3), in which it exhibited 10.9% PCE.4 Nowadays, the PCE of the perovskite solar cell has surpassed 20%,5 thanks to its high open-circuit voltage VOC which well exceeds 1 V, and fill factor FF above 70%. Such rapid progress since 2009 shows that the organolead halide is a very promising material for solar cells and have a predicted PCE of 20%.6,7 In one of the reported articles, the authors introduced a new material, yttrium-doped TiO2, as the electron transport layer to improve electron extraction and transport. In their study, they reported a significantly high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.13 V along with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 22.75, and a fill factor (FF) of 75.01%.6 To date, although many groups have reported high performance devices, unfortunately, high performance perovskite solar cells require a high quality condensed TiO2 layer which involves nearly 500 °C treatment. This will definitely hamper future prospects of flexible perovskite solar cells.
Alternatively, a solution-processable low-temperature approach provides an ample choice of probable substrates and electrode materials that could be utilized in such devices, including polymer-based flexible substrates, and solution processed interfacial materials that could thereby be integrated into perovskite solar cells. A few research groups have demonstrated all low-temperature processed perovskite solar cells using different transport layer processing techniques.8,9 Compared to that of the high-temperature compact TiO2, the performance of their devices is slightly poor. The poor performance of these low-temperature processed perovskite solar cells can be attributed to the charge combination at inadequate interfaces and structural or chemical defects in the perovskite films.
In the meantime, advancements in graphene research have led to various fundamental breakthroughs. Graphene is a two-dimensional single atomic material which is constructed with sp2 hybridized carbon atoms in the hexagonal form.10 It has exceptional electronic, optical, thermal and mechanical properties.11–14 Its derivative graphene oxide (GO) on the other hand has oxygen functional groups on the graphene plane. Therefore, it has aroused interest in applications for graphene-based HILs including batteries,15 supercapacitors,16 photochemical water splitting,17 photocatalysis,18 hydrogen storage,19 fuel cells,20 bio-fuel cells,21 photovoltaic devices,22 sensors,23 high frequency devices,24 electrochemical systems,25 spintronics26 and photonics and terahertz devices.27 Nowadays, introduction of various dopants has been used as the main strategy to use graphene as a transparent electrode as well as HIL to reduce the sheet resistance without sacrificing the transmittance. Hence, it is of importance to search for a suitable dopant for improving the conductivity without deteriorating the transmittance. In particular we have proposed that the poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) mixed GO HIL exploits the benefits of high conductivity and better electrical contacts of GO and GO-like materials for electron transport.28–31 To date, PEDOT:PSS:GO HILs have been widely used in many organic electronic devices including organic photovoltaic,32 and organic light emitting diodes.33
The objectives of this study are (i) to propose an alternative material to condensed TiO2 layers which does not need high temperature treatment, (ii) to propose a new dopant for graphene oxide and subsequently improve its optical and electrical properties, and (iii) to propose a new flexible substrate for our flexible perovskite solar cells. Thus, in this study, we demonstrated the first attempt to chemically dope GO with silver trifluoromethanesulfonate (AgOTf) as an inorganic dopant that uses a chemical approach to control the optical and electronic properties of single-layered GO, and demonstrates the effects of this approach in perovskite solar cells. The morphology, work function (WF), mobility, sheet resistance, and transmittance were successfully controlled by AgOTf inorganic chemical dopants with various concentrations. By using a WF tuned GO as the HIL, we demonstrated that the device performance can be modulated based on the perovskite solar cells. We observed a decrease in the series resistance (Rs) as well as a reduction in recombination losses with a low temperature HIL. More importantly, we achieved a PCE of 11.90% based on a glass/ITO substrate, which is comparable to what is obtained with high-temperature approaches. To access the applicability to flexible and ITO-free flexible cells, the polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/ITO and PET/aluminum were doped with zinc oxide (AZO)/silver (Ag)/AZO, and they respectively demonstrated 9.67% and 7.97% PCEs.
Results and discussion
Firstly, we carried out comprehensive thin film characterization of PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO in order to get details about the proposed PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO HIL. The GO films studied here were prepared using a modified Hummers method.34 2 g of graphite powder (Alfa Aesar, natural, universal grade, −200 mesh, 99.9995%) was stirred for 1 day in an ice water bath with 2 g of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and 100 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Afterwards, 12 g of KMnO4 were gradually added. The solution was further stirred at 35 °C until a highly viscous liquid was obtained. Later, 100 mL of pure water was added and the viscous liquid was heated in a water bath for 15 min at 90 °C. Then, it was further treated with warm water and H2O2 in sequence. The mixture was centrifuged at 6000 rpm and washed with hydrochloric acid (HCl) and water. The centrifugation and washing processes were repeated five times. Finally, GO was dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h at 50 °C. To evaluate the quality our newly synthesized GO, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging and profiling, and Raman spectroscopy characterization. The GO layers were prepared on silicon dioxide/silicon (SiO2/Si) substrates. The GO aqueous solutions were spin-coated and then soft baked on a hot plate for 5 min at 100 °C.
In order to dope GO, the dopant solution with various doping concentrations was dropped on the GO film. Fig. 1 shows the effects of doping concentration on the surface topographies of the PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO film. As shown in Fig. 1a according to the AFM height profile, the as-prepared GO film is a single layer. In addition, the roughness (Rq) and thickness (t) of PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO were found to be almost identical. As shown in Fig. 1b–f, white spots of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) (∼10–30 nm) were distributed on the surface of the GO films. As the doping concentration increases, the GO surface becomes rougher. This can be clearly seen from the Rq value that is proportional to the doping concentration (Fig. 1g). With the increase of the dopant concentration from 0 to 25 mM, the Rq and t increased to ∼2.72 and ∼3.2 nm respectively. Rs was measured as a function of doping concentration for the PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO films transferred onto 300 nm of SiO2/Si. The Rs of the as-prepared GO is around 228 Ω sq−1. Fig. 1h demonstrates Rs as a function of the doping concentration. As the doping concentration was increased up to 5 mM, the Rs sharply decreased to ∼140 Ω sq−1, but once it was above 5 mM it began to saturate, and finally reached 118 Ω sq−1 at a doping concentration of 25 mM. These results suggest that by controlling the doping concentration, Rs can be adjusted to the required values.

Raman spectroscopy is sensitive to the electronic structure, and has been established as a powerful tool for characterizing GO providing vital information on defects (D band), in-plane vibration of sp2 carbon atoms (G band), and the stacking orders (2D band).35Fig. 2a presents the effect of the doping concentration on the Raman spectra, which illustrates two dominant peaks corresponding to well documented G and 2D peaks at ∼1580 and ∼2700 cm−1, respectively, involving the in-plane optical vibration (degenerate zone center E2g mode) and second-order zone boundary phonons (structural defects and disorders that can break the symmetry and selection rule). A relatively small Raman D peak at ∼1350 cm−1 can be assigned as a disorder induced band. The shifted G- and 2D-peaks due to the phonon stiffening is evidence that doping induced the charge transfer.35 In general, other effects namely temperature, surface charge, and strain can also be responsible for the shifting of the G peak.36–38 However, we excluded these effects since measurements (before and after the doping process) were conducted under identical conditions. Fig. 2b summarizes the shifting of the G and 2D peaks. As illustrated in Fig. 2b, the increase in the doping concentration shifted both the G and 2D peaks of the PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO downward, which is in agreement with previously reported work.39,40 This corresponds to the charge transfer from the AgOTf dopant to GO, which resulted in phonon softening.40 The Raman intensity ratios of the G to 2D peaks, and D to G peaks were calculated and plotted as a function of doping concentration in Fig. 2c. The I(G/2D) of the as-prepared GO is 0.47, which is typical of single-layered GO.41 The I(G/2D) is initially proportional to doping concentrations and then saturated with a higher doping concentration. As shown in Fig. 2c, the increase in the I(D/G) with increased doping concentration can be attributed to the increased molecular bonds with impurities from AgOTf dopants. Fig. 2d demonstrates the work function (WF) of AgOTf-doped GO as a function of doping concentration. The WF monotonically decreases to ∼4.68 eV with the increase of the doping concentration to 25 mM, originating from the variations in the potential of the ionic charge and the host lattice. Since the work function of Ag (4.26 eV) is smaller than that of the as-prepared GO (∼4.9 eV), the hole transfer from the Ag NPs to the GO occurs during the doping process, resulting in a shift of the Fermi level above the Dirac point of GO. It has been verified that Ag0/Ag− based nanoparticles and GO might serve as donors and acceptors respectively; thereby inducing the p-type doping.42Fig. 2e shows the transmittance spectra of AgOTf-doped GO. At the highest AgOTf concentration, the transmittance with a wavelength of 550 nm was reduced by only about 5%, which is small compared to other kinds of dopants.43

To further understand the doping concentration effect, we fabricated a GO transistor on n+ Si/SiO2 substrates. The as prepared GO and doped GO were transferred onto the substrates followed by the deposition of Au as source/drain electrodes, while n+ Si was chosen to be the gate electrode. Fig. 3a exhibits the transfer characteristics (IDSversus VGS, VGS = 0 V) of the fabricated transistors under different conditions, where IDS is the channel current, VDS is the drain voltage, and VG is the gate voltage. We observed a p-type behavior of the GO due to the absorbed water since the Dirac point is located at ∼65.47 V VG, with the as-prepared GO transistors.

In contrast, the AgOTf-doped GO transistor demonstrates an increase in the current IDS at zero VG by a factor of 3. This is consistent with the decrease in Rs of about 48% (Fig. 1d) along with a clear p-type doping effect and the shift of the Dirac point to higher VG compared to that of the as-prepared GO transistor. It is generally accepted that PEDOT:PSS is a p-doped conducting polymer with a WF of ∼5 eV, which is a little bit higher than that of graphene (4.9 eV) (Fig. 2d); electrons will transfer from GO to PEDOT:PSS after the coating and thus the GO will be doped with holes. The decrease of sheet resistance is mainly due to the p-type doping by the AgOTf solution. The distribution of carrier concentration and mobility for the as-prepared and AgOTf-doped GO (at zero bias) is shown in Fig. 3b. The average mobility decreases from 1145 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 898 cm2 V−1 s−1 after a doping of 25 mM AgOTf due to the presence of additional charge impurity scattering.
Low temperatures for the PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO layer at ∼120 °C can be applied for flexible perovskite solar cells. The high quality GO layer may significantly contribute to Rs, as it has been previously observed in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells.44,45 In order to investigate the influence of the AgOTf concentration, we prepared and characterized a series of perovskite solar cells with varying concentrations. Fig. 4a depicts the device structure integrating the PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO HIL, and the photovoltaic properties of the PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO were investigated in conventional single-junction solar cells with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PCBM/Au. Fig. 4b shows the energy level of all the materials used in this study. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells measured under 1 sun, AM 1.5G illumination (25 °C, 100 mW cm−2). The perovskite solar cell with the 40 nm PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO HIL was deposited onto the ITO substrate from the spin-coated AgOTf on to the PEDOT:PSS:GO mixture at a spin-speed of 2500 rpm for 60 s, and then annealed for 15 min at 120 °C. Later, the organo metal trihalide perovskite absorber CH3NH3PbI3−xClx was deposited on top of the HIL by spin-casting at a spin-speed of 5000 rpm for 60 s, and later annealed for 15 min at 95 °C. We then deposit a 2% PCBM in a chlorobenzene solution onto the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx layer at a spin-speed of 1000 rpm for 60 s as the electron interfacial layer (EIL). This was done without any further heat treatment. Finally, devices were completed using thermal evaporation of the Au contacts. Glass/ITO substrates were used for rigid devices while PET/ITO and PET/AZO/Ag/AZO substrates were used for flexible devices. The device area is 0.1 cm2. It is worth noting that another type of perovskite solar cell without the presence of any HIL could also be fabricated according to the above mentioned procedures. We varied the doping concentrations of AgOTf in the PEDOT:PSS:GO HIL to find a suitable composition. From Fig. 4c, the presence of an efficient HIL is essential to obtain highly efficient devices. The perovskite solar cells fabricated with PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO presents the JSC and FF with around 14.76 mA cm−2 and 64.71%, respectively. The JSC and FF increase with the increased doping concentration of up to 15 mM to 19.18 mA cm−2 and 70.51%, respectively. However, further increase in the doping concentration to 25 mM led to a decrease in both the JSC and FF. It is worth noting that the average open circuit voltage (VOC) changed slightly with the realization of AgOTf in the PEDOT:PSS:GO with a VOC of around 0.88 V up to 15 mM. VOC plunges as the doping concentration further increases over 15 mM, probably due to bare Ag NPs coming in contact with the perovskite directly, resulting in a less selective electrode. Recombination took place directly between the electrons in the PEDOT:PSS:GO and holes in the perovskite. Accordingly, the values of the device Rs extracted from the inverse slopes of the dark J–V curves near the VOC decreased after the AgOTf-doped GO was incorporated into the PEDOT:PSS (not shown), indicating that the improved performance of the PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO perovskite solar cells resulted from a reduction of Rs in the device resistance. One should note that the increase of JSC is probably related to plasmonic effects since the Ag NPs are distributed on the surface of GO films. In general, the presence of Ag NPs triggers the local enhancement of the incident electromagnetic irradiation field in the vicinity of the small-sized Ag NPs as well as to multiple scattering by the Ag NPs.46 However, in this study we do not relate the increase in JSC to the presence of the plasmonic effect but trying to understand the doping behavior of the newly proposed HIL.

Fig. 5a displays the J–V characteristics of the perovskite solar cells measured under 1 sun, AM 1.5G illumination (25 °C, 100 mW cm−2), namely PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO (Device I), PEDOT:PSS (Device II), and GO (Device III), and no HIL (Device IV). As seen in Table 1, as expected, the perovskite solar cell without HIL exhibits the worst performance. The major drawbacks for the perovskite solar cells with ITO are both their JSC and FF. This is most likely due to an improper interface contact at the ITO/perovskite. Low FF and VOC in the perovskite solar cell without any HIL can be attributed to the increased recombination at the ITO surface and a correspondingly low shunt resistance (Rsh). The Rsh is due to the direct contact of ITO and perovskite material and no Ohmic contact forms, and this will eventually increase the carrier traps or unfavourable interface dipoles and thereby decrease the FF of the device. The perovskite solar cells with either GO or PEDOT:PSS experience the enhancement of the JSC and FF compared to that of perovskite solar cells without any HIL. The most prominent feature comes from the perovskite solar cells with pristine PEDOT:PSS HIL, where the JSC and FF increased from 11.00 to 18.68 mA cm−2, and 48.93 to 65.12%, respectively. Moreover, a distinct improvement in the photovoltaic parameters can be observed when the PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO HIL is sandwiched between the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx and ITO substrate. The highly efficient solution-processable low-temperature perovskite solar cells utilizing a PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO HIL measured at 100 mW cm−2 illumination demonstrates a JSC of 19.18 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.88 V, and a FF of 70.51% leading to 11.90% PCE. As seen from Table 1, it is clear that the presence of HIL is practically important to acquire a high JSC and FF.

The improvement in efficiency can be attributed to the improved JSC, VOC, and FF. It may rise from beneficial factors resulting from synergetic effects of PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO. This is supported by the reduction in the WF of PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf (Fig. 2d). The WF of PEDOT:PSS, GO, and PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO were measured with X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). The as-prepared GO has a work function of ∼4.9 eV, while the work function of PEDOT:PSS was calculated to be 5.0 eV, which means that it is suitable for use as a HIL. After depositing the AgOTf (25 mM)-doped GO onto the PEDOT:PSS film, its work function decreases to 4.68 eV, indicating a lower energy barrier for hole transport at the PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO/perovskite interface than the GO/perovskite or PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interfaces. As PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO has a WF between that of ITO and the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx conduction band, it may reduce the energy barriers at the interfaces. Therefore, it shows better hole transport than the PEDOT:PSS or GO when used alone. It is worth noting that many other groups have also reported high work function hole extraction materials and used it to align their energy level with the HOMO level of active layers in perovskite solar cells as well as in light emitting devices.47–53 Second, the higher mobility of PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO may yield improved electrical conductivity of the layer (not shown).
From the high FF, it is clear that the PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO composite reduces the Rs compared to the PEDOT:PSS or even the GO solar cells. We have achieved high device performance based on low-temperature (less than 120 °C) solution processed perovskite solar cells, suggesting that it is also possible to attain high device performance flexible solar cells based on which processing techniques are utilized. Here, we replaced the rigid glass/ITO substrate with a flexible PET/ITO substrate and fabricated the devices via the same procedures. A photograph of the flexible device is shown in inset Fig. 5c. The flexible device (PET/ITO) shows a VOC of 0.88 V, JSC of 15.58 mA cm−2, and FF of 70.50% (Fig. 5c, Table 2).

Furthermore, a PCE of 9.67% is achieved, keeping 80% of the rigid devices’ performance (Table 3). In comparison with the rigid devices, the loss in PCE arises from the decreased JSC and FF, which could be due to the higher Rs of the flexible devices, issues that can be resolved in the near future. For the ITO-free perovskite solar cells (PET/AZO/Ag/AZO), we demonstrated exceptional mechanical stability, in which the PCE degraded by 1.26% after 2000 bending cycles (Fig. 5d, Table 4). The results show that the device maintains its performance by mechanically bending up to 2000 times, indicating that both devices tolerate repeated mechanical deformation.

To systematically characterize the flexibility of the present devices, a series of controlled bending tests were performed. Fig. 6a shows the dependence of the PET/ITO and PET/AZO/Ag/AZO sheet resistances at various bending radii. Sheet resistances were measured by standard four-probe techniques after relaxing the PET/ITO and PET/AZO/Ag/AZO substrates. The sheet resistances before bending for both PET/ITO and PET/AZO/Ag/AZO are about ∼16 and ∼15.4 Ω sq−1, respectively. During the flexibility measurements, the conductivities of these two substrates did not illustrate any notable discrepancy with a decreasing bending radius (not shown).

(a) Dependence of the sheet resistance on the bending radius (measured after fully relaxing) of PET/ITO and PET/AZO/Ag/AZO electrodes. (b) Optical microscopic and SEM cross-sectional images of PET/ITO and PET/AZO/Ag/AZO substrates, collected after bending at a radius of 5 mm and 1.5 mm, respectively. (c) Dependence of the perovskite solar cell performance on the bending radius. 
The sheet resistances experienced slight changes after the substrates were bent at ∼2.5 mm. Usually, changes in RS are accompanied by microstructural changes resulting from the bending measurements; therefore, we carried out optical microscopic and cross-sectional SEM measurements for both substrates after bending at radii ∼5 mm and ∼1.5 mm (Fig. 6b). As seen from the optical microscopic images, one observes crack formation (Fig. 6b), whereas PET/AZO/Ag/AZO retains a continuous, and uniform morphology. To evaluate the effects of smaller radius, SEM images were obtained for substrates with a bending radius ∼0.5 mm. Note that the PET/ITO substrate shows higher crack densities, leading to incredible increments in the sheet resistance from 17.5 to 3 M Ω sq−1 (data not shown) compared to that of the PET/AZO/Ag/AZO substrate. It is also worth noting that under such extreme bending conditions, the PET/ITO image shows unique continuous “arc” features, implying that the PET/ITO has a tough structural continuity without detectable crack formations. At various bending radii from 100 to 1 mm, there were excellent perovskite solar cell (PET/AZO/Ag/AZO) performances with only modest PCE degradation from 7.97% to 7.65%, mainly due to reduced FFs (Fig. 6c). In contrast, perovskite solar cells (PET/ITO) exhibit significant mechanical degradation since the PCE dropped from 9.69% to 8.87% at various bending radii from 100 to 1 nm. The results illustrate that the PEDOT:PSS:AgOTf-doped GO is considered to be an excellent HIL for developing high performance flexible perovskite solar cells.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated the potential dopant for graphene oxide and also successfully integrated it into a highly efficient perovskite solar cell. We have obtained 11.90% and 7.97% efficiency in a rigid and flexible format of devices, respectively. This is among the best recorded efficiency for perovskite solar cells employing a graphene oxide hole transport layer and the best recorded efficiency for low temperature flexible perovskite solar cells to date. The present work demonstrates that a suitable dopant can be fully utilized for achieving high device performance especially in terms of flexible solar cells, where a high processing temperature should be avoided.
Experimental
Single layered graphene oxide sheets were grown on Cu foils by CVD and subsequently transferred onto SiO2/Si and quartz substrates. A layer of PMMA was spin coated onto the graphene oxide/Cu layer. The Cu foil substrate was removed by electrochemical reactions with aqueous 0.1 M ammonium persulfate solution NH4/2S2O8. After placing the PMMA/graphene oxide stack on the target substrate, the PMMA/graphene oxide/substrate stack was heated at 180 °C for 2 h to ensure close bonding of the graphene onto the substrate. The PMMA was then removed using acetone and deionized (DI) water, and the graphene oxide/substrate stack was annealed at 400 °C for 1 h under vacuum to remove the residual PMMA.
Devices were all fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates (14 Ω sq−1). Firstly, the substrates were cleaned in acetone and then isopropanol. The low-temperature processed hole collection layer of PEDOT:PSS:GO was spun at 1400 rpm for 60 s followed by a soft bake at 120 °C for 10 min. 200 μL of mixed AgOTf (Sigma Aldrich) in nitromethane (Sigma Aldrich) with different AgOTf concentrations was dropped on the PEDOT:PSS:GO film and spun at 2500 rpm for 60 s and annealed at 120 °C for 15 min. For the perovskite layer, a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx was deposited by spin-coating the precursor solution (40 wt%) on the PEDOT:PSS:AgOTF-doped GO at 5000 rpm for 60 s. After drying at room temperature for 10 min, the perovskite films were annealed on a hot plate at 95 °C for 15 min. After that, 2% of PCBM in chlorobenzene solution was coated onto the perovskite layer at 1000 rpm. Finally, the devices were completed by evaporating 1000 nm Au contact electrodes through a shadow mask.
The performance of the perovskite solar cells was obtained from J–V characteristics measured using a Keithley 2400 LV source meter. Solar cell performance was measured using a solar simulator with an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G) of an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. All measurements were carried out at room temperature, under a relative humidity of 60%. The EQE measurements were performed using the EQE system (Model 74000) obtained from Newport Oriel Instruments USA and HAMAMATSU calibrated silicon cell photodiodes as reference diodes. The wavelength was controlled with a monochromator of 200–1600 nm.
