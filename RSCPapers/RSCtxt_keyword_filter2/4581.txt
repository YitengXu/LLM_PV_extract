    , Accepted 6th June 2022First published on 6th June 2022AbstractThe electron transport layer (ETL) is an integral part of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to realize efficient carrier extraction and affect the growth of the upper perovskite layer in the n-i-p configuration. Adding substances is a common modification or engineering strategy to improve the quality of the solution processed SnO2 ETLs. Herein, a modification strategy of SnO2 ETLs by incorporating an organic ammonium chloride salt, propylammonium chloride (PACl), into the commercial SnO2 colloidal solution is presented. The corresponding engineering mechanisms including interaction between the organic salt and the alkaline colloidal solution and the following influences on the properties of the SnO2 layers, the ETL/perovskite interface, and the perovskite layers are investigated. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 22.27% is achieved in the n-i-p planar PSCs based on the PACl incorporated SnO2 ETLs. This work provides a reference for modification of the commercial SnO2 colloidal solution as well an understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have developed expeditiously because of their excellent performance such as adjustable band gaps, high absorption coefficients, long carrier diffusion lengths, and broad application prospects.1–4 In 2009, the first perovskite solar cell emerged with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%.5 Only after a dozen years, owing to the constant efforts of the researchers, the reported PCEs have increased at an astonishing rate to more than 25%.6–8 The electron transport layer (ETL) in planar PSCs is a very important function layer which plays the role of extracting electrons and blocking holes.9,10 Great efforts have been made to improve the extraction efficiency of photo-generated electrons through the study of ETLs, which promotes the improvement of the overall performance of PSCs.8,11,12 For n-i-p type PSCs, a high-quality electron transport layer is particularly important. Not only the electron extraction efficiency related to the hysteresis effect, but also the quality of the subsequently grown perovskite absorption layer will be affected.13,14
Tin dioxide (SnO2) has excellent characteristics of a wide band gap, high carrier mobility, an appropriate energy band structure, and good chemical stability, so it has been widely used as an efficient ETL in n-i-p type PSCs.15–18 Various methods have been used to fabricate SnO2 ETLs, such as chemical bath deposition, atomic layer deposition, vacuum thermal evaporation, spin-coating sol–gel or colloids, and so on.16,19–23 Spin coating commercial SnO2 colloids is a widely used method to fabricate SnO2 ETLs due to its simple process, low annealing temperature and high film quality.24–26 A commercial SnO2 colloid precursor was first employed by Jiang et al. to fabricate an ETL for PSCs with a PCE of close to 20% and with almost no hysteresis.16 The PCE was further increased to 23.3% by passivating the surface of the perovskite film with PEAI.27
A lot of research work related to spin-coated SnO2 electron transport layers has been carried out in recent years.28–30 A comprehensive analysis of the commercial SnO2 colloidal solution is necessary to further improve the device performance based on spin-coated SnO2 ETLs. Through investigating the Alfa–SnO2 colloidal solution in detail, Bu et al. demonstrated the existence of potassium ions mainly in water and not the SnO2 nanocrystals and concluded that potassium hydroxide (KOH) was added to the solution to stabilize the colloids.29 They also proved that the efficient interface passivation induced by potassium ions eliminates the hysteresis of PSCs based on an Alfa–SnO2 ETL. The existence of potassium ions was regarded as an important factor in improving the performance of PSCs by simultaneously passivating interface defects between the perovskite layer and the transport layer and intergranular defects between the perovskite grains.31
Adding other substances, like polymers, inorganic salts, organic salts, etc. into the commercial SnO2 colloidal solution is a common modification or engineering strategy to improve the quality of SnO2 ETLs, modify the ETL/perovskite interface, and thus enhance the performance of PSCs.13,32–35 You et al. introduced a biological polymer (heparin potassium, HP) into the SnO2 solution to regulate the arrangement of SnO2 nanocrystals and induce vertically aligned crystal growth of perovskites on top. The devices based on SnO2 HP demonstrate an average efficiency of 23.03%.35 Zhu et al. took into account the roles of potassium ions and chloride ions together and introduced potassium chloride (KCl) into the SnO2 precursor by dissolving KCl into the diluted SnO2 colloidal solution. The qualities of both the SnO2 ETL and perovskite layer were improved simultaneously leading to a PCE of 22.2%.13
Recently, a novel modification strategy of adding organic salts including perovskite precursors or additives into the SnO2 precursor solution was presented.28,30,36 By dissolving FAI in the SnO2 colloidal solution, an interpenetrating perovskite/ETL interface was considered to be synthesized between the SnO2 layer with excess organic halide (FAI) and the perovskite layer with excess lead halide, which led to a significant improvement in the performance of the PSCs for both rigid and flexible versions.28 Lin et al. added methylammonium chloride (MACl) or formamidine chloride (FACl) into the commercial SnO2 colloidal solution and observed the formation of the perovskite crystal nuclei in the SnO2 layer due to the reaction between MACl (FACl) and PbI2. They achieved an increase in the PCE from 20.12% for the blank device to 21.87% (21.72%) for the devices with MACl (FACl) incorporated in the SnO2 ETL.36
The above studies confirm the effectiveness of the precursor engineering of solution processed SnO2 ETLs with organic salt addition in promoting the performance of PSCs. However, whether other organic salts used to synthesize perovskite layers, such as propylammonium chloride (PACl) which was proposed recently as an alternative to MACl for stable and efficient FAPbI3-based PSCs,37 are suitable for precursor engineering of SnO2 ETLs needs to be further studied. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms including the interaction between the organic salts and the alkaline colloidal solution and the influences of the organic salt incorporation on the SnO2 films, the perovskite layers, and their interface need to be further investigated.
Herein, an in-depth study was performed with propylammonium chloride (PACl, a kind of primary alkylammonium chloride (CnH2n+1NH4Cl) with n = 3) incorporated commercial SnO2 colloidal solution. It was found that incorporating organic salt PACl in the SnO2 colloidal solution facilitates the improvements in optoelectronic properties of SnO2, crystallinity of the perovskite layer and interfacial quality between perovskite and the ETL. The performance of the perovskite solar cells based on PACl added SnO2 electron transport layers was greatly improved and the champion PCE increased from 20.17% to 22.27%. The mechanisms of the precursor engineering of solution processed SnO2 ETLs were deeply analyzed and discussed based on the detailed investigation of the reaction in the SnO2 colloidal solution, the properties of the SnO2 and perovskite films and the performances of the devices. The universal mechanisms of incorporating primary alkylammonium chloride with different alkyl chains into the SnO2 colloidal solution and the effectiveness of the organic salt engineering of the SnO2 ETL to significantly improve the performance of the PSCs were demonstrated. Our work provides a reference for follow-up research.
Experimental details
Sources of the materials
Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass purchased from Xiang Science & Technology was used as the substrate. SnO2 colloidal solution (15 wt% in water) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Dimethyl formamide (DMF, 99.8%) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%) were both purchased from Sigma Aldrich. PbI2 (99.99%), FAI (99.5%), MACl(99.5%), MABr (99.5%), PACl (99.5%), EACl (99.5%), BACl (99.5%), PEAI (99.5%) and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-dip-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD, 99.8%) were all purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. in China.
Solar cell fabrication
The ITO glass substrates were sequentially cleaned using detergent, deionized water, acetone, and alcohol for about 30 min. Then, the ITO substrates were treated with ultraviolet ozone for 20 min at room temperature. After that, SnO2 thin films were prepared on the ITO substrates by spin coating the SnO2 precursor (the original solution was diluted three times with deionized water) mixed with different quantities of PACl at a rotation speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s. Then the films were annealed at 150 °C for 30 min and treated with ultraviolet ozone for 10 minutes prior to spin coating with the perovskite precursor.
The perovskite absorption layer was prepared by a two-step method. The PbI2 (1.5 M) precursor dissolved in a mixture of DMF and DMSO (volume ratio = 9:1) was spin coated onto the surface of the SnO2 film at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 80 °C for 50 s. Then, a mixed solution of FAI/MABr/MACl (80:8:8 mg in 1 ml IPA) was spin coated onto the PbI2 surface at a rotation speed of 2000 rpm for 30 s. The annealing process was carried out at 150 °C for 15 min in ambient air (humidity: 30–35%) to form the perovskite layer. After that, organic salt PEAI solution (5 mg in 1 ml IPA) was spin coated onto the perovskite surface at a rotation speed of 5000 rpm for 30 s in a N2-filled glove box.
The spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer was prepared by spin coating spiro-OMeTAD solution (72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD powder in 1 ml chlorobenzene mixed with 17.5 μl Li-TFSI solution (520 mg in 1 ml acetonitrile) and 28.8 μl 4-tert butylpyridine) onto the PEAI/perovskite layer at a rotation speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s.
Finally, a silver electrode (about 200 nm thick) was deposited by thermal evaporation. The size of the planar perovskite solar cells is about 0.08 cm2.
Characterization
The morphological properties of the SnO2 film and the perovskite layer were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi SU8010). 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 500 MHz NMR spectrometer. The elemental composition of the SnO2 films was characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi). The transmittance of the SnO2 film was measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 750). The light current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells were obtained under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2, 25 °C, Newport Oriel class AAA solar simulator). The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL were measured on a fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh FLS-1000). Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry was measured using a TOF SIMS 5 (ION-TOF, Germany).
Results and discussion
First, it is necessary to learn what happens in the SnO2 colloidal solution after the PACl additive is added. In an alkaline solution of the SnO2 colloid, PACl can introduce Cl− and PA+, and then PA+ could be reacted to form a molecule of propylammonium (PA) as shown in the schematic diagram in Fig. 1(A).38 Although this is a reversible reaction, the reaction process tends to be in the direction of the formation of PA due to the strong alkalinity of the solution. As the amount of PACl addition increases, the gradually decreased alkalinity of the solution suggests consumption of the hydroxide (Fig. S1†) and proves the above point. To confirm the occurrence of the reaction denoted in Fig. 1(A), the pristine and the doped (mixed with PACl with a concentration of 14 mg ml−1) solutions were lyophilized in a vacuum environment at minus 45 °C to form a solid powder which can be used to reveal the composition of the SnO2 colloidal solution containing the PACl additive. The reason why heat drying was not taken was to avoid evaporation of PA during the drying process. XRD was used to analyze the crystallization of the powder as shown in Fig. 1(B). For the pristine powder, the XRD pattern shows three peaks at 26.6°, 33.8°, and 51.8° corresponding to the (110), (101), and (211) crystal planes of SnO2. Two more peaks at 28.3° and 40.5° corresponding to the (200) and (220) crystal planes of KCl appear in the XRD pattern of the PACl added powder. This indicates that, due to the existence of the pristine K+ and the Cl− in the PACl added SnO2 colloidal solution, KCl crystals are generated after evaporation of the solvent. No PACl related peaks (Fig. S2(a)†) appear in the XRD pattern, which implies a relatively complete reaction of PACl in the strong alkali solution. The existence of PA in the PACl added SnO2 colloidal solution can be determined from the weak signals in the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectrum of the powder sample dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO-d6) (Fig. S2(b)†). It can be concluded that the XRD patterns and 1H NMR measurement together confirm the proposed reaction in Fig. 1(A).

A schematic diagram of the preparation of the SnO2-PACl films by spin-coating is shown in Fig. 2(A). For convenience, the four SnO2 samples prepared using the precursors with 0 mg, 7 mg, 14 mg, and 21 mg PACl added in 1 ml SnO2 colloidal solution are denoted as SnO2, SnO2-7PACl, SnO2-14PACl, and SnO2-21PACl, respectively. The SEM images of the four SnO2 films incorporated with different concentrations of PACl after annealing are shown in Fig. 2(B). With the addition of PACl, visible particles appear on the surface of the SnO2 films, which is probably due to the crystallization of KCl. XPS was used to investigate the substances in the SnO2 films. Besides Sn, O, C and K related peaks, Cl 2p and N 1s core levels are detectable from the XPS wide scan spectra for the PACl incorporated samples (Fig. S3†). The Cl 2p, Sn 3d, K 2p, and N 1s core lines of the near-surface and bulk (etched with argon ions with an etching depth of about 6–8 nm) regions of the four SnO2 films are shown in Fig. 2(C) and (D), respectively. It can be found that Cl and K elements exist both at the surface and in the bulk of all the three SnO2-PACl films, whereas less distinct N peaks can be detected merely on the surface of the SnO2-14PACl and SnO2-21PACl samples. The results indicate that Cl from PACl served as a dopant and exists in the whole film, while most PA, also from PACl, is evaporated during the annealing process and only a small amount of PACl remains on the surface of the samples with more PACl addition, such as samples SnO2-14PACl and SnO2-21PACl. The Sn 3d XPS core lines show that, with the increase of the PACl addition, the Sn 3d double peaks gradually shift to higher photoelectron binding energies suggesting that the introduction of Cl in the films induced a negative charge in the vicinity of the Sn atom.39,40 The incorporation of PACl enhances the optical band gap (Fig. S4†) and improves the transmittance in the wavelength range of 380–600 nm (Fig. S5†) of the SnO2 films, which is more favorable to the light absorption of the perovskite layer. In addition, the increased conductivity of the SnO2 films caused by the PACl incorporation can also be determined from the I–V linear sweep measurement carried out on the SnO2 films with the structure of ITO/ETL/Ag (Fig. S6†).

The SnO2 thin films were then used as the ETL of the planar PSCs with the structure of Ag/Spiro-OMeTAD/PEAI/perovskite/SnO2/ITO. The PV parameters of the planar PSCs with SnO2, SnO2-7PACl, SnO2-14PACl and SnO2-21PACl films as the ETLs are shown in Fig. 3(A)–(D). Compared with the control PSCs based on pristine SnO2 ETLs, the average VOC and JSC of the PSCs based on PACl incorporated SnO2 ETLs are slightly increased. The average FFs of the PSCs based on SnO2-7PACl, SnO2-14PACl and SnO2-21PACl ETLs are 70.05%, 72.95% and 72.65%, respectively, which are significantly higher than that of the control PSCs (66.89%). Thanks to the remarkable improvement in the FF, the average PCE values increased from 18.51% for the control PSCs to 19.52%, 20.67%, and 20.34% for the PSCs based on SnO2-7PACl, SnO2-14PACl, and SnO2-21PACl ETLs, respectively. A champion PCE of 22.27% with a VOC of 1.20 V, JSC of 24.73 mAcm−2, and FF of 75.31% was achieved on a PSC with a SnO2-14PACl ETL. The light J–V curve of the champion device and the SEM cross sectional image are depicted in Fig. 3(E). Fig. 3(F) shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the 4 PSCs. Using PACl incorporated SnO2 as the ETL leads to the improvement of EQE in a wide wavelength range and the champion PSC based on SnO2-14PACl ETLs gives the highest integrated photocurrent density of 23.21 mA cm−2. In addition, the device based on the SnO2-14PACl ETL presents better stability than the control PSC as shown in Fig. 3(E). For stability investigation, the samples were kept in nitrogen gloveboxes except when tested in air. After 800 hours, the PCE of the device based on the SnO2-14PACl ETL retains more than 85% of the initial efficiency, while the PCE of the control device with the SnO2 ETL has decayed to below 70%.

To understand the improvement in the performance of the PSCs based on PACl doped ETLs, the perovskite layers grown on four different SnO2 ETLs were studied. Fig. 4(A) and (B) show the XRD patterns of the PbI2 layers and the perovskite layers based on different ETLs. The diffraction peak of the (001) crystal plane of the PbI2 layers based on PACl incorporated SnO2 shows greater intensity and a smaller full width at half maximum (FWHM) compared with the control one. Enhanced crystallinity of the PbI2 layer will be conducive to the subsequent perovskite film formation. The reduced peak intensity ratio of PbI2-(001) to perovskite-(110) for the perovskite layers based on SnO2-14PACl and SnO2-21PACl ETLs implies that more PbI2 is converted to perovskite for the samples with PACl than for the one without. The surface morphologies of the perovskite films based on SnO2, SnO2-7PACl, SnO2-14PACl and SnO2-21PACl ETLs were examined by SEM, as Fig. 4(D) shows, and the average grain size of 238 nm, 254 nm, 288 nm, and 305 nm can be respectively determined from the images (Fig. S7†). The enlarged grain size might be related to the facilitated nucleation of perovskite nuclei by chloride ions (from the residual PACl on the surface and KCl in the bulk of the SnO2 layer) diffused into the PbI2 layer. To prove this point, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) was employed to investigate the distribution of Cl, N and K in a PbI2/SnO2-14PACl/Si sample. As Fig. 4(C) shows, although Cl is mainly located in the SnO2 layer, a uniform Cl signal with fairly high intensity can be detected in the whole PbI2 bulk. The resolved signals of N and K, although the intensity is not high, show an even distribution in the PbI2 layer. The 3D depth profiles of the ToF-SIMS data (Fig. S8†) also elucidate the uniform distributions of Cl, N and K in the PbI2 bulk.

(D) SEM images of perovskites based on SnO2, SnO2-7PACl, SnO2-14PACl and SnO2-21PACl films. (E) SCLC of the electron-only devices based on SnO2, SnO2-7PACl, SnO2-14PACl and SnO2-21PACl ETLs. 
Space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) measurement was performed on the electron-only structure of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/Ag to estimate the bulk trap density in perovskite films based on different SnO2 layers, as shown in Fig. 4(E). The trap density Nt was calculated from the equation VTFL = eNtL2/2εε0 where VTFL is the trap-filled limit voltage corresponding to the bias value at the intersection of the two tangent lines in Fig. 4(E), L is the thickness of the perovskite layer (∼700 nm), and ε0 and ε are respectively the vacuum permittivity and the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite. The calculated Nt of the perovskite layers based on SnO2, SnO2-7PACl, SnO2-14PACl, and SnO2-21PACl ETLs are 8.1 × 1015 cm−3, 7.0 × 1015 cm−3, 6.3 × 1015 cm−3, and 6.4 × 1015 cm−3, respectively, demonstrating reduced defects of the perovskite films when grown on PACl incorporated SnO2 ETLs. The Urbach energy (Eu) related to the defects and a lack of long-range structural ordering of the perovskite layers was estimated based on transmittance spectra measurement (Fig. S9†). The perovskite layer based on SnO2-14PACl shows the lowest Eu value of 42.7 meV, which is indicative of fewer defects as compared to the control sample with the SnO2 ETL and confirms the SCLC results. The decrease in the defects of the perovskite films is partly due to the enlargement of the perovskite grain and also due to the presence of K+ and PA+ that could be able to passivate the grain boundary jointly.
The charge dynamics between the SnO2 ETLs and the perovskite layers can be understood from the steady-state PL and TRPL spectra of the samples with the structure of perovskite/SnO2/glass. As Fig. 5(A) shows, the PL intensities of the perovskite layers deposited on the SnO2-7PACl, SnO2-14PACl and SnO2-21PACl ETLs are significantly reduced in comparison to the control sample with the SnO2 ETL. This result suggests that adding PACl into SnO2 can enhance electron extraction at the interface between the ETL and the perovskite layer, which implies improved interface quality.41 This conclusion is also validated by the TRPL results shown in Fig. 5(B). The lifetimes of the perovskite films deposited on the SnO2, SnO2-7PACl, SnO2-14PACl and SnO2-21PACl ETLs are 232 ns, 195 ns, 126 ns and 127 ns, respectively, which indicates faster PL decay of the perovskite films on PACl incorporated SnO2 than that deposited on the SnO2 ETL.

The impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements of PSCs based on different SnO2 ETLs were carried out under dark conditions under a 0 bias. The Nyquist impedance plots and the fitting equivalent circuit are presented in Fig. 5(C). The R in the equivalent circuit is related to the series resistance of the whole test system. The charge transfer resistance (R1) and the recombination resistance (R2) are assigned to the high-frequency arc and the low-frequency arc, respectively. A smaller R1 implies more charge extraction and a larger R2 indicates less charge recombination. As the concentration of PACl increases from 0 to 21 mg ml−1, R1 reduces from 2.6 × 105 Ω cm−2 to 2286 Ω cm−2 and R2 increases from 8615 Ω cm−2 to 1.92 × 105 Ω cm−2 (Table S1†), respectively, which indicates that the electron extraction ability of the PACl incorporated SnO2 ETLs is significantly improved compared to the pristine SnO2 ETL.
Through the above study we can learn that, as an additive used in perovskite precursor solution, the organic salt PACl can be adopted to play an efficient role in the additive engineering of SnO2 colloidal solution. After the PACl additive is added into the SnO2 colloidal solution, the optoelectronic properties of the spin-coated SnO2 films are improved, which makes it a more excellent ETL for n-i-p type PSCs. At the same time, the optically active perovskite layer exhibits improved crystallinity and reduced defect density, and effective carrier extraction can be realized at the perovskite/SnO2 ETL interface with improved quality. It can be said that incorporating organic salt PACl in the SnO2 colloidal solution plays the three roles simultaneously, indicating that it is a promising modification strategy for the n-i-p type PSCs with SnO2 ETLs.
The underlying mechanisms of the precursor engineering of SnO2 ETLs can be elucidated by comprehensively considering the influences of the PACl additive on the commercial SnO2 colloidal solution and the subsequent film formation. The incorporated PACl introduces PA and chloride ions into the alkaline SnO2 colloidal solution. Most PA evaporates after the annealing process of the SnO2 film leaving a small amount on the surface region. The chloride ions provided by PACl combine with the inherent potassium ions in the commercial SnO2 colloidal solution to form KCl dispersed in the SnO2 film, which is beneficial for the improvement of the SnO2 film quality. On the one hand, KCl and the residual PACl effectively passivate the interface defects between the electron transport layer and the perovskite layer. On the other hand, they diffuse into the following PbI2 layer to enhance the crystallization of the perovskite and passivate the grain boundaries as well. Many additives of SnO2 ETLs have been investigated.10 Our research work indicates that PACl can be used as an effective additive with low toxicity for commercial SnO2 colloidal solutions, which would be more advantageous in mass production.
In addition, methylammonium chloride (CH3NH3Cl, n = 1), ethylammonium chloride (CH3CH2NH3Cl, n = 2), and butylammonium chloride (CH3CH2CH2CH2NH3Cl, n = 4) have also been added to the SnO2 colloidal solution (the concentrations were all set at 0.15 M). The formation of KCl can be determined for all of the samples (Fig. S10 and S11†) and all the PSCs based on the primary alkylammonium chloride modified SnO2 ETLs show improved PCE (Fig. S12†), which is consistent with the above PACl incorporation condition.
Conclusion
In conclusion, it is demonstrated that adding PACl to the commercial SnO2 colloidal solution is an effective method to modify the SnO2 ETL for application in PSCs. With the incorporation of PACl, KCl is found to be generated in the alkaline solution of SnO2 colloidal containing potassium ions. Then the generated KCl and the residual PACl (most PA has evaporated during the annealing process) together play a role in improving the optoelectronic characteristics of the SnO2 films, passivating the interface defects between the ETL and perovskite layer, and enhancing the crystallization of the perovskite films. As a result, the over-all performance of the devices based on SnO2-PACl ETLs is remarkably improved. A champion device based on the SnO2-14PACl ETL with a PCE of 22.27% is achieved. The PACl addition also significantly improves the stability of the PSCs. The efficiency of the PSC based on the SnO2-PACl ETL remains at 85% of the original value after 800 hours, while the control one is reduced to be below 70%. In addition to PACl, the addition of primary alkylammonium chloride with different alkylchains (CnH2n+1NH4Cl, n = 1, 2, and 4) to the SnO2 ETLs is demonstrated to have a similar effect on the PSCs.
