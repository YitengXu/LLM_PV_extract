All the random copolymers (PFtpTDTBT-a, b, c) were prepared via Stille polycondensations based on variable contents of DTBT and Ftp. The results of absorption spectra, fluorescence spectra and electrochemistry shows that increasing the ratio of fluorine units and decreasing the electron withdrawing groups of DTBT not only control the bandgaps but also the liquid crystallinity of the copolymers. The structural variation of mesomorphism behaviors induced by terphenyl pendants is characterized by POM, DSC, XRD and polarized absorption. When the polymers were blended with fullerene derivative as an electron acceptor, the photovoltaic performance reveals the good correlation between the Ftp and DTBT ratio in the main chain of the copolymers with desirable HOMO levels and the open circuit voltage (Voc). Therefore, the deepest HOMO energy level of polymer PFtpTDTBT-a leads to the highest Voc of 0.86 V, while the polymer PFtpTDTBT-c possesses a superior absorption coefficient resulting in the largest short current density (Jsc = 4.58 mA cm−2). Additionally, the packing alignments of the three polymers guided by the orientation of mesogenic pendants pose a significantly effect on the morphology with different microphase separation after annealing treatment. Nevertheless, the solar cell based on PFtpTDTBT-b shows the best performance among the thiophene incorporated polymers, which demonstrated the importance of designing materials with a balance in the properties of HOMO/LUMO energy levels, the absorption coefficient and morphological variations.
Introduction
One of the promising strategies for devising efficient polymer solar cells involves the use of interpenetrating network bulk heterojunctions (BHJ) based on a blend of electron-donating conjugated polymers and soluble fullerene acceptors as the active layer, with power conversion efficiency (PCE) now routinely surpassing 8%.1 For a polymer to serve as an effective donor material in BHJ solar cells, a number of properties are considered necessary, including: broad absorption from the solar spectrum for efficient light harvesting; efficient charge transfer to the acceptor material (typically fullerene derivatives); effective charge transport; relatively deep HOMO energies to yield a large short circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and open circuit voltage (Voc).2 The factors that limit the Voc in BHJ solar cells remain controversial. It has been commonly accepted that the open-circuit voltage in BHJ solar cells with ohmic contacts is linearly dependent on the magnitude of the built-in potential, defined as the difference between the HOMO level of a p-type polymer and the LUMO level of an n-type PCBM.3 The donor with the lower HOMO level will better reach the theoretically attainable Voc, whereas reduction in a polymer's band gap to broaden the absorption coverage by lifting up the HOMO level will inevitably result in a loss of Voc.
Frontier molecular orbital energies and optical band gaps of donor polymers have been tuned through the use of a variety of backbones and side chains in order to enhance OPV efficiency. In particular, the combination of electron-rich and electron-poor moieties has been successfully used to achieve low optical band gap polymers with suitable electronic energy levels, where the electron donor unit may provide a deeper HOMO level and the electron acceptor unit is used to manipulate the electronic band gap of the polymers. Benzothiadiazole (BT), or di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) is the commonly used acceptor units, while fluorene and carbazole are among the more commonly used donor units. Specifically, polymers containing BT and various donor units, such as cyclopentadithiophene and dithienosilole, have been shown to be very successful in BHJ solar cells with PCEs of greater than 5%.4 And preliminary studies on polyfluorene derivative blends have revealed interesting photovoltaic effects that make them suitable to be used as donor components in donor–acceptor segments.5 A large coverage of the solar spectrum is desirable to achieve high efficiency and the chemical modification of the conjugated backbone of polyfluorene derivatives help to modulate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels to achieve low-bandgap materials. Incorporating thiophene groups in π-conjugated systems is a further strategy that can be effective for tuning electronic and optical properties.6 The thiophene linkage serves to planarize the polymer backbone and extend the π-conjugation by further eliminating torsional strains between the donor and acceptor units, leading to a lower optical band gap and a more broadly absorbing material. Among polymers for PV applications, the hexyl group has a good balance between crystallinity and miscibility in the bid to achieve optimal morphology.
Besides the discovery of new materials, the development of organic semiconductor-based photovoltaic applications requires a much better understanding of the nature of electronic structure and charge transport properties, as well as polymer chain-chain interaction and alignment, in these unusual solids. To control the order and packing of organic donor materials and to suppress defect formation at the donor–acceptor (D–A) interface, high-mobility liquid crystalline (LC) polymer, with crystalline morphologies are introduced to control the phase separation between the two components in bulk. Particularly, as the pioneering work, we have firstly introduced the basic concepts of the functions, leading with the liquid crystalline characteristic in the active layer.7
In this work, the synthesis of random copolymers combining donor and acceptor and changing the ratio of liquid crystalline fluorene with terphenyl side chain and DTBT moieties in the polymer provides the opportunity to characterize the structure–properties relationships, by optical absorption, electrochemical spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Solar cell performance is also measured as a test of the effects of band gaps, absorption coefficients and morphology on the photovoltaic properties.
Results and discussion
Synthetic routes for the thiophene-linked copolymers are shown in Scheme 1. Alternating copolymer PFDTBT was synthesized via a Suzuki polycondensation reaction, where DTBT is used as the electron acceptor unit and fluorene was the electron donor unit. Unlike the alternating copolymer PFDTBT, the random copolymer of PFtpTDTBT was synthesized by a Stille polycondensation reaction in high yields between 9,9-bis[6-(4′-hexyloxy-terphenyloxy)-hexyl]-fluorene (Ftp), dibromo di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole (DTBT), and 2,5-bis(tributylstannyl)-3-hexylthiophene (T). Alkyl thiophene units were used to improve the solubility of the copolymers. Both polymers were purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexanes, acetone and chloroform. The ratio of m:n (Ftp:DTBT) in PFtpTDTBT was modulated by controlling the monomer ratios, using 2:1, 1:1 and 1:2, to get PFtpTDTBT-a, PFtpTDTBT-b and PFtpTDTBT-c, respectively. The m:n ratio was determined to be the ratio by the integral areas of –CH2– peaks of alkoxy groups at mesogen in fluorene and thiophene units in the polymers, which appear at 3.99 and 2.81 ppm, respectively, in the 1H-NMR spectra (Fig. 1). The resulting dark solids from the chloroform fraction exhibit high and nearly identical molecular weight distributions (Table 1). All the intermediate and final products have been thoroughly purified and fully characterized, and the chemical structures of the products are confirmed by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR (Fig. S1†) and elemental analysis (details in the ESI†). EA and integration of 1H-NMR signals revealed that the composition of the copolymers matched the feed ratios of fluorene and DTBT.

After checking the chemical structures of the polymers, we proceed to study their mesomorphic behaviors. Fig. 2 shows the POM microphotographs of the textures of three copolymers recorded in the heating-cooling cycles. And the thermal transition behaviors of the monomers are examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), shown in Fig. S2.† When PFtpTDTBT-a is cooled from its isotropic state, small batonnets emerged from the homotropic dark background, forming an anisotropic mesomorphic texture. We repeatedly tried to grow the liquid crystals with care but failed to obtain any readily identifiable characteristic textures (Fig. 2B). When PFtpTDTBT-b is cooled from its melt state, many anisotropic entities emerged from the background. For PFtpTDTBT-c, the POM observation gave a disappointing result that it may not liquid crystalline. This is probably due to the less mesogenic part in side chain and the rigid skeleton preventing the texture from further developing. This indicates that the polymer chain plays an active role in the alignment and packing of the mesogenic pendants.8 Those results are associated with the DSC thermogram, since no transition is observed in the polymer PFtpTDTBT-c during the second heating scans. The microstructures of the polymer PFtpTDTBT thin films at different phase are studied using X-ray diffraction (Fig. S3†). The diffractogram of a powder sample can be generally divided into the low-angle Bragg reflections at 2θ ∼ 5° corresponding to the lamellae spacing of molecular orientational order and the high-angle peaks at 2θ ∼ 20° associated with the liquid-like intermesogenic organization within the layers.9PFtpTDTBT-a and PFtpTDTBT-b show a sharp reflection in the low-angle region (∼5.1°) corresponding to a spacing of 17.8 Å, which is associated with the distance between the layers. The PFtpTDTBT-a containing more mesogen pendants is packed so well that a sharp peak is located at about 2°, probably ascribing to a bilayer packing arrangement, in which the alkyl tails are interdigitated in an antiparallel fashion.10 The pump peak located at 2θ = 20° (d = 4.44 Å) of samples is corresponded to the interside chain distance, that is, the distance between the mesogenic core of the side chains. However, for PFtpTDTBT-c, there is only a broad diffuse peak at high-angle, while the birefringence is difficultly observed by POM, indicative of the worse molecular stacking hardly generating the mesophase. From the XRD analysis we can see that the tendency of liquid crystallinity follows as the content of the mesogen. And the peaks of PFtpTDTBT-a and PFtpTDTBT-b in the low-angle under the temperature below mesophase transition (60 °C) are inconspicuous. Therefore, the effect of the LC state annealing on the molecular arrangement and intermolecular π–π lamella stacking is significant. In comparison, POM images of temperature below and above the LC transition (Fig. S4†) are shown in the ESI.† The results indicate that the molecular structures are sensitive to temperature and mesogens induce polymer packing in a more order structure, especially for PFtpTDTBT-a.

The absorption spectra of films of random polymers a–c are shown in Fig. 3. The polymers PFtpTDTBT-b and PFtpTDTBT-c incorporating more DTBT units have red-shifted absorptions of 17nm and 35nm respectively, compared to analogous copolymer containing more Ftp units (PFtpTDTBT-a). In the presence of more electron-withdrawing groups, the optical band gaps of PFtpTDTBT-c (1.88 eV) are smaller than PFtpTDTBT-a and PFtpTDTBT-b (2.03 and 1.96 eV, respectively). In addition, polymer PFtpTDTBT-c shows larger absorption coefficients of (details in Fig. S5†) 6.5 × 104 cm−1 at longer wavelength in thin films, compared to the absorption coefficients of PFtpTDTBT-a and PFtpTDTBT-b (4.9 × 104 and 5.6 × 104 cm−1, respectively).11 Importantly, the effects of thermal annealing on PFtpTDTBT films are investigated using UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 3b). The self-assembly of the mesophase pendant induced the ordered arrangement in polymers. As the annealing temperature of PFtpTDTBT-a falls into mesophase region (160 °C), the main absorption peak red-shifts to 516 nm (about 20 nm red-shift) due to more oriented π–π stacking generating from the high content of mesogens. However, these features are devastated for samples with less ordered samples (PFtpTDTBT-b, 15 nm red-shift and PFtpTDTBT-c, 7 nm red-shift). The red-shifted wavenumbers of the polymers are in agreement with the decreasing trend in ordering packing from PFtpTDTBT-a to PFtpTDTBT-c. Similar results with shift and enhanced emission have been observed in the photoluminescent spectra (Fig. 4a–c) for the films after annealed treatment. The PL emission peak at ca. 450 nm is attributed to the fluorene units and the additional long wavelength absorption bands at ca. 650 nm are attributed to the DTBT parts in main chain. The fact that the annealed samples have the peaks shifted to the red in the liquid crystalline phase is likely attributed to efficient intermolecular interactions inside the aggregates, favored by the soft nature of this phase.12 The increasing intensity in those PL spectra provides evidence of well ordered molecular structure after thermal annealing, at mesophase. In order to study the molecular orientation of the three polymers in thin solid film, the polarized absorption spectra (Fig. 4d) are performed with the samples inserted between two polarizers with parallel and perpendicular directions from 10 °C to 330 °C. As shown in the figure, the absorption difference, calculated by order parameter S, follows the order PFtpTDTBT-a > PFtpTDTBT-b > PFtpTDTBT-c. Again, the tendency shown in those spectra supports more LC groups favoring the better growth of the anisotropic domains and better-ordered molecular structure after thermal annealing. Table 1 summarizes these spectroscopic data.

Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S6†) was employed to examine the electrochemical properties and evaluate the HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymers. Typically, the combination of electron-rich and electron-poor moieties has been successfully used to achieve low optical band gap polymers with suitable electronic energy levels.13 And in this study, we found that increasing ratio of fluorine units and decreasing the electron withdrawing groups DTBT content not only lowered the HOMO energy level but also raised the LUMO. This variation is also predicted by DFT calculations for the HOMO energy levels of each material. Pictorial representations of the HOMO and LUMO wave functions of the PFtpTDTBTa-c dimers are shown in Fig. 5, evaluated by DFT at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. The trend in HOMO for the oligomer series follows the orderPFtpTDTBT-c > PFtpTDTBT-b > PFtpTDTBT-a, which corresponds well with the CV data. In particular, it is worth noting that the treatment of LC annealing can lower the band gap further than other heat processes and the results exhibit the same tendency as our previous report.14 The location of the HOMO and LUMO of the polymers and all the electrochemical data are presented in Table 2.

To illustrate the difference of the PFtpTDTBT derivates as the donor materials in the active layer, BHJ solar cells were fabricated with the device structure, based on glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM (1:2 w/w)/LiF/Al (Fig. 6a).15 The map of HOMO and LUMO orbitals and the energy level of the materials are also presented in Fig. 6b. Fig. 6c shows the I–V curves for solar cells under simulated AM 1.5 G radiation (100 mW cm−2); optimized photovoltaic properties are summarized in Table 3. As shown in curves, both short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) increase after annealing for all the three polymers, which can be explained by the thermally activated carrier transport. The hole mobility in the polymer is an important factor for the performance of polymer solar cells and the high hole mobility of the polymer allows thicker solar cell devices and can improve the efficiency of the polymer solar cells.16 The hole mobility of the blend was measured by the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM/Au.17 (The detailed hole mobility measurement is in the ESI.†) The hole mobility of PFtpTDTBT-a blend of PCBM before and after annealing are 5.43 × 10−5 and 6.46 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1, respectively; while for the polymer PFtpTDTBT-c the values are 4.56 × 10−5 and 4.61 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 S−1, respectively. It explains the reason that the photovoltaic performance of PFtpTDTBT-c almost remains unchanged after thermal treatment. Besides, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) remains almost unchanged. Note that a decreasing Voc from 0.860 V of PFtpTDTBT-a to 0.665 V of PFtpTDTBT-c are observed, together with significantly increasing the Jsc. However, the reasons behind the obvious improvement of Jsc for PFtpTDTBT-b and PFtpTDTBT-c, are the stronger absorption (with larger absorption coefficient) and red-shifted absorption in the UV-vis region of the solar spectrum than PFtpTDTBT-a, which leads to the generation of more excitons. Additionally, the results are associated with the EQE spectra of the devices (Fig. S7†).

As described above, the origin behind the Voc of BHJ OPVs is well correlated to the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbit level (HOMO) of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbit level (LUMO) of the acceptor.18 In order to understand the varying random donor–acceptor segments in the polymer main chain on the Voc, the measured Voc data are plotted versus the ratio of donor (Ftp) to acceptor (DTBT). As shown in Fig. 6d, Voc decreased almost linearly with increasing ratio of DTBT unit in the backbone, and vice verse. The voltage of PTDTBT (without fluorene in main-chain) is used as the reference (details structure and J–V characteristics in Fig. S8) and all the Voc values are obtained in the same conditions, although higher Voc values can be obtained with lower function cathodes. The highest Voc of those four materials is obtained from the PFtpTDTBT-a, with the lowest HOMO level. After a careful balance among the short circuit current density, fill factor and open-circuit voltage, the devices of PFtpTDTBT-b achieve the best photovoltaic performance (Fig. 6), with the highest PCE values (1.35%). According to the broad absorption response, the data of performance need further optimization. But from this data, it is evident that solar cell performance depends on a careful balance between the HOMO level, absorption coefficient and morphology of the active layers. For the main chain of the conjugated polymer, the increasing donor unit (fluorene) with the lower HOMO level will better reach the theoretically attainable Voc. However, the decreasing acceptor units (DTBT) in the backbone will inevitably result in a loss of the absorption coverage by broaden the band gap of the polymers. On the other hand, more mesogen (in the fluorene part) in the side chain guarantee the nano-phase separation of the active layer for favorable charge separation and transfer. A compromise is needed to balance the trade-off between the donor and acceptor ratio in the main chain (Fig. 7). Comparing PSC's with alternated polymer PFDTBT, the PCE of random polymers is still poor and need be improved. Thus it is expected that an alternated liquid crystalline polymer would enhance the photovoltaic performance.

It is worth mentioning that the morphology of the polymer:PCBM blend has a considerable impact on the efficiency of bulk heterojunction solar cells. A nanoscale, bicontinuous network of donor and acceptor materials is crucial to increasing the interfacial area and maximizing charge separation.19 The nanoscale morphologies of the polymer:PC60BM films are studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The matrix of PFtpTDTBT-a:PCBM annealed at liquid crystalline phase (160 °C) achieve the orientated (as the inset arrow in Fig. 8) nano-scale aggregated PCBM regions, which create phase separation interfaces for charge separation. Compared with the optimized morphology, the large phase separation domains in as-spun films leads to the poor performance devices with low FF and Jsc. However, the morphology enhancement through thermal annealing gets unconspicuous for copolymer PFtpTDTBT-b, due to the poor liquid crystallinity. And the thermal treatment exerts little on the morphology of PFtpTDTBT-c. This is as expected because the better arrangement resulting in the liquid crystal self-assembly leads to well-formed percolated network for each of the phase-separated components. The X-ray experiments (Fig. S9) of the polymer blending with PCBM have been performed to explanation on the morphology variation. When blending with PFtpTDTBT-a, the diffraction pattern of PCBM are suppressed and recrystallized in combination with polymer lamellae structure. While the situation for PFtpTDTBT-c is totally different, the PCBM crystallites are detected and domains in the blending films. Besides, the morphology change also reflected by atomic force microscope (AFM) height images (ESI, Fig. S10†), consistent with the FF and Jsc data of the corresponding devices. The oriented nano-scale phase separations with small root mean-square (rms) roughness (1.89) of the PFtpTDTBT-a:PCBM blend proves the high increasing FF (from 28.9% to 45.8%) and Jsc (from 1.16 to 2.74 mA cm−2). The interpenetration of two microphases in the film forms bicontinuous pathways for electron and hole transport in an efficient bulk heterojunction solar cell and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (Fig. 9) was performed to examine the phase-separation in the active layers.20 As expected, the optimized morphology of the PFtpTDTBT-a:PCBM after annealing facilitates the charge separation, leading to the shorter PL lifetime τ (738 ps). However, the measured PL lifetime τ of the pristine PFtpTDTBT-c:PCBM and annealed PFtpTDTBT-c:PCBM stay at the same level without much change, due to the unchanged morphology.

Conclusion
Three new thiophene-incorporating donor–acceptor copolymers were successfully synthesized for photovoltaic application. By tuning the donor (Ftp) and acceptor (DTBT) feed ratio in the preparation, the absorption spectra can be manipulated by the controlled HOMO/LUMO energy levels of copolymers, and the liquid crystallinity can be varied from smectic to nonmesomorphic with the mesogens contents. Particularly, donor/acceptor ratio dependant Voc variation provides an excellent opportunity to understand the origin of Voc in the donor–acceptor polymer of BHJ solar cells. Besides, by intramolecularly incorporating mesogenic terphenyl as side chain linked in 9,9-dialkyl-fluorene, the pendant endows the polymers and polymer:PCBM blends films with better ordered morphology, leading to the enhanced FF and Jsc. Especially for the copolymer smectic PFtpTDTBT-a, the annealed devices show a enhanced photovoltaic performance with the FF and Jsc increasing from 26.9% and 1.16 mA cm−2 to 45.8% to 2.74 mA cm−2, respectively. However, the devices of copolymer nonmesomorphic PFtpTDTBT-c exhibit similar J–V curves before and after annealing. Our results demonstrate that designing donor materials with balance in the HOMO/LUMO energy levels, the absorption coefficient of the absorption band, and crystalline properties of polymers is a compromise pathway toward high-performance OPV applications.
