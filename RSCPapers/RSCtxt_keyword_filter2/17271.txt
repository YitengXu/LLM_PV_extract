    , Accepted 13th August 2015First published on 14th August 2015AbstractSemi-transparent CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) planar sandwich solar cells could be fabricated by simply laminating an FTO (F doped tin oxide)/TiO2/MAPbI3/wet hole transporting material (HTM) with additives and PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid))/indium tin oxide (ITO). The best FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3/P3HT with additives/PEDOT:PSS/ITO planar sandwich structured solar cells exhibited a 12.8% (deviation: 11.7% ± 0.74%) average power conversion efficiency (ηavg) but poor visible transmittance due to strong absorption by P3HT. Meanwhile, the semi-transparent FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3/PTAA with additives/PEDOT:PSS/ITO planar sandwich solar cells exhibited a 15.8% (deviation: 14.45% ± 0.76%) ηavg without significant J–V hysteresis with respect to the forward and reverse scan directions. The average visible transmittance (AVT) was controlled from 17.3% to 6.3% and the corresponding ηavg changed from 12.55% to 15.8%. The unsealed sandwich planar perovskite solar cells exhibited great air and humidity stability over 20 days due to the self-passivated device architecture of the sandwich type device.

Broader context
Sandwich type semi-transparent planar perovskite thin-film solar cells with transparent top and bottom electrodes, like dye sensitized solar cells, are of great interest because they have a self-passivated device architecture due to the two transparent electrodes and good transparency, and are thereby readily applicable in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs). Here, we demonstrated stable 15.8% semi-transparent CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) planar sandwich solar cells by simply laminating an FTO (F doped tin oxide) substrate/TiO2/MAPbI3/wet hole transporting material (HTM) with additives and a PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid))/indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate. The average visible transmittance (AVT) was controllable from 17.3% to 6.3% by controlling the thickness of the MAPbI3 layer.

Solar energy has been considered as a promising candidate for replacing conventional fossil fuels because it is clean, abundant, and sustainable. Therefore, solar cells have been intensively studied for several decades and now crystalline Si solar cells are widely installed in remote areas for power generation. However, the power generation cost of crystalline Si solar cells is still more expensive than fossil fuels so there remains a strong requirement to develop cost-effective solar cells in order to expand their utilization in our daily life such as building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) and mobile power sources.
For this, organic photovoltaics, thin-film solar cells, and sensitized solar cells have been of great interest in order to meet the requirements of low cost and high device efficiency. Among them, sensitized solar cells have a unique device architecture of electron conductor, sensitizer, and hole conductor meaning that high efficiency can be achieved using relatively impure materials because the generated electrons (holes) are immediately injected into the electron conductor (hole conductor) thereby reducing backward recombination.
Recently Kojima et al.1 reported innovative sensitized solar cells utilizing organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite sensitizers with pertinent properties such as strong absorption by direct bandgap,2 high open circuit voltage (Voc) due to small exciton binding energy,3 and long diffusion length of charge carriers.4 Since then, all solid-state mesoscopic,5 planar,6 and meso-superstructured7 perovskite hybrid solar cells have been developed with the record efficiency reaching 17.9%8 under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G.
However, CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) or CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite hybrid solar cells composed of TCO (transparent conducting oxide)/electron conductor/perovskite/hole conductor/metal counter electrode often exhibit significant hysteresis in their power conversion efficiency with respect to the forward and backward scan directions9 and weak humidity stability.10 The origin of the J–V (current density–voltage) hysteresis with respect to the scan direction and scan rate is still under debate. The J–V hysteresis might occur through the capacitance element of the perovskite device which might be related to charge accumulation at traps6j,k,11 or the dielectric polarization12 due to ferroelectric properties. The weak humidity stability of perovskite materials is associated with the fact that they can be decomposed to MAI and PbI2 by humidity. Therefore, it is still challenging to develop sandwich type semi-transparent planar perovskite hybrid solar cells without J–V hysteresis with respect to the scan direction because the sandwich device architecture is analogous to dye sensitized solar cells and enables the demonstration of semi-transparent cells and better protection from invasion of water vapor owing to the two TCO electrodes.
Eperon et al.13 reported semi-transparent island-morphology-MAPbI3−xClx perovskite solar cells with neutral color composed of FTO (F-doped tin oxide)/compact TiO2/thickness controlled MAPbI3−xClx islands/spiro-MeOTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene)/Au. Ono et al.14 also reported semi-transparent thin-film-MAPbI3−xClx perovskite solar cells composed of FTO/compact TiO2/hybrid deposited MAPbI3−xClx thin-film/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag but they exhibited significant J–V hysteresis with respect to the scan direction. Roldán-Carmona et al.15 reported semi-transparent planar MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells consisting of ITO (indium tin oxide)/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid))/vacuum deposited MAPbI3/poly-TPD (poly[N,N′-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine])/PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methylester)/Au/LiF. Li et al.16 reported 6.87% semi-transparent MAPbI3 solar cells with a laminated metal-free carbon nanotube (CNT) network electrode with an efficiency that could be improved to 9.9% by using a composite electrode of a CNT network and spiro-MeOTAD. Guo et al.17 reported 8.49% semi-transparent MAPbI3−xClx solar cells with ZnO/Ag nanowire transparent electrodes. So far, to the best of our knowledge, sandwich type semi-transparent planar perovskite thin-film solar cells using transparent top and bottom electrodes like dye sensitized solar cells have not yet been reported, although the sandwich type device architecture has the advantage of self-passivation, thereby improving stability. Here we fabricated 15.8% semi-transparent planar MAPbI3 perovskite hybrid sandwich solar cells without significant J–V hysteresis with respect to the scan direction (forward scan efficiency = 15.7%, backward scan efficiency = 15.9% under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G, delay time = 200 ms).

Fig. 1 shows a schematic illustration of device fabrication and representative device architecture of a semi-transparent MAPbI3 planar sandwich solar cell. In a typical fabrication procedure (see Fig. 1(a)), we deposited a ∼50 nm-thick TiO2 electron conductor on a cleaned FTO substrate by spraying 20 mM of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution at 450 °C. A pin-hole free pure MAPbI3 thin-film was then deposited on the TiO2/FTO substrate by spin-coating with a 40 wt% MAPbI3 in DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide) solution containing an additional 10 vol% of HI solution at 3000 rpm for 200 s and subsequently drying at 100 °C for 2 min under an ambient atmosphere. A counter electrode was prepared by spin-coating a filtered PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid))/methanol (1:2 vol:vol) solution onto a cleaned ITO (indium tin oxide) glass substrate at 3000 rpm for 60 s and subsequently drying at 150 °C for 20 min. A P3HT (poly-3-hexylthiophene) or PTAA (poly-triarylamine)18 hole transporting material (HTM)/toluene solution with Li-TFSI (Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide):ACN (acetonitrile) solution and t-BP (tert-butylpyridine):ACN solution with additives (HTM/toluene/Li-TFSI:ACN/t-BP:ACN = 20 mg/1 mL/15 μL (170 mg:1 mL)/30 μL (1 mL:1 mL)) was drop-cast on the MAPbI3/TiO2/FTO substrate and the counter electrode of a PEDOT:PSS/ITO substrate was made to cover the wet HTM/MAPbI3/TiO2/FTO substrate. Then the two substrates were pressurized by double clipping and were subsequently dried (see Fig. S1, ESI†). Fig. 1(b) shows a SEM (scanning electron microscope) cross-sectional image of the semi-transparent MAPbI3 planar sandwich solar cell composed of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM with additives/MAPbI3/TiO2/FTO. The magnified images are the HTM with additives/MAPbI3/TiO2/FTO (Fig. 1(c)) and the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM with additives (Fig. 1(d)) parts in the sandwich solar cell. From the SEM cross-sectional image of the best device, the thicknesses of the TiO2, MAPbI3, HTM with additives, and PEDOT:PSS layers were ∼50 nm, ∼300 nm, ∼1200 nm, and ∼30 nm, respectively.

Fig. 2 shows the photovoltaic properties of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT with Li-TFSI and t-BP additives/MAPbI3/TiO2/FTO planar sandwich solar cells. The EQE (external quantum efficiency) spectrum in Fig. 2(a) reached up to ∼80% with a dip at a wavelength of ∼650 nm due to the absorption by P3HT HTM possibly due to partial reflection by the ITO electrode. The J–V curve of back illumination is shown in Fig. S2(a) (ESI†) and indicates that the average efficiency is greatly reduced from 12.8% to 10.0% by light absorption of P3HT because the Jsc is greatly reduced to 15.1 mA cm−2 compared to the case of front illumination (18 mA cm−2). The integrated value of the EQE spectrum is ∼18 mA cm−2, which is lower than that in MAPbI3 perovskite hybrid solar cells with an Au metal reflecting counter electrode,5f because the ∼300 nm-thick MAPbI3 can absorb ∼90% of the illuminated light due to the strong absorptivity of MAPbI3 having a direct bandgap.2 The J–V curves of the MAPbI3 planar sandwich cell in Fig. 2(b) demonstrate that a 0.94 V open circuit voltage (Voc), an 18 mA cm−2 short circuit current density (Jsc), a 75% fill factor (FF), and a 12.7% power conversion efficiency (η) were obtained under the forward scan direction and 0.95 V Voc, 18 mA cm−2Jsc, 76% FF, and 13% η were obtained under the reverse scan direction (see the Table 1), thereby showing a 12.8% average power conversion efficiency (ηavg). The planar perovskite sandwich solar cells with high quality MAPbI3 did not show significant J–V hysteresis with respect to the scan direction but the apparent transparency of the sandwich solar cell in the visible region was not good due to the strong absorption of visible light by the thick P3HT HTM with additives (see the 30 samples of MAPbI3/P3HT with additives planar sandwich solar cells in Fig. 2(c)). The deviation of ηavg of the 30 samples shown in Fig. 2(d) indicates that the MAPbI3 planar sandwich solar cells can be reproducibly fabricated by the simple lamination process.

The transparency of solar cells is very important to find applications for them in BIPVs. Therefore, we switched P3HT HTM with absorption in the visible region to transparent PTAA HTM. Fig. 3(a) shows the photographs of FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3 with thickness controlled by the spin-speed. The transmittance of the perovskite film at a wavelength of 750 nm gradually decreased from ∼40% (average visible transmittance (AVT) = 17.3%) for the 5000 rpm sample to ∼18% (AVT = 6.3%) for the 2500 rpm sample as shown in Fig. 3(b). A photograph of the full cell composed of FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3/PTAA with additives/PEDOT:PSS/ITO, of which the MAPbI3 film was deposited by spin-coating at 2500 rpm, shows its transparency as shown in Fig. 3(c). The EQE (external quantum efficiency) spectrum in Fig. 3(d) did not show a dip caused by absorption loss at a wavelength of ∼650 nm due to the lack of absorption by PTAA. The photovoltaic properties of the MAPbI3/PTAA planar sandwich cell are shown in Fig. 3(e) and Table 2. The semi-transparent planar sandwich cell exhibited values of 1.1 V Voc, 19.3 mA cm−2Jsc, 74% FF, and 15.7% η for the forward scan condition and 1.1 V Voc, 19.3 mA cm−2Jsc, 75% FF, and 15.9% η for the reverse scan condition, thereby showing a 15.8% ηavg (see the detailed deviation of Jsc, Voc, FF and ηavg in Fig. S4, ESI†) The J–V curve of back illumination is shown in Fig. S2(b) (ESI†) and indicates that the average efficiency is decreased from 15.7% to 13.8%. The deviation of the ηavg of the 30 samples in Fig. 3(f) confirms reproducible fabrication of MAPbI3/PTAA semi-transparent planar sandwich solar cells. To check the stability of the MAPbI3 planar sandwich solar cells, we measured ηavg and relative humidity every day for 20 days as shown in Fig. 3(g). The initial ηavg was 15.8% and the ηavg after 20 days was 15.0% so ∼5% of the ηavg was degraded. This implies that the MAPbI3 perovskite hybrid sandwich solar cells will have air and humidity stability if the cells are properly encapsulated. The current density variation with light soaking time under the applied voltage at the maximum power point was shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Here, the unsealed sandwich type solar cell was exposed to a continuous 1 Sun light by a solar simulator (100 mW cm−2) for 3600 s in ambient air conditions. During the continuous light illumination, the temperature of the device was gradually increased to ∼50 °C. It is apparent that the device efficiency declines with light soaking time but currently it is not clear whether the efficiency is reduced by degradation or elevated temperature. Further studies are required to check the photo- and thermal-stability of sandwich type perovskite solar cells under continuous light soaking conditions.

Fig. 4 shows the J–V curves of all the MAPbI3/PTAA planar sandwich solar cells with spin speed (rpm) under forward and reverse scan directions. Their photovoltaic properties are summarized in Table 2. The Jsc of MAPbI3/PTAA planar sandwich solar cell gradually decreases with the spin speed because transmittance gradually decreases as well. Therefore, the ηavg gradually decreases from 15.8% to 12.55%. This indicates that very efficient MAPbI3 perovskite hybrid sandwich solar cells can be fabricated with transmittances of ∼10% to ∼40% at a 700 nm wavelength. Therefore, the semi-transparent MAPbI3 planar sandwich solar cells might be applicable to BIPVs. It is noted that none of the MAPbI3/PTAA sandwich cells showed significant J–V hysteresis with respect to the scan direction, similar to the MAPbI3/P3HT sandwich cells. This might be attributed to the reduced trap density of the MAPbI3 perovskite layer, which is prepared with an MAPbI3/DMF solution with an HI additive6k, and the improved hole conductivity of HTMs due to the introduction of Li-TFSI and t-BP additives5f, because the HI additives can prevent the formation of PbI2 by decomposition of MAPbI3 during the deposition process thereby reducing the shallow trap density,6k and the added Li-TFSI and t-BP in HTMs act as a redox couple, thereby enhancing the regeneration of holes generated in MAPbI3 perovskite.5f Therefore, the capacitance elements of the traps in the MAPbI3 sandwich solar cells are reduced, thereby shortening the delay time caused by trapping and de-trapping of charge carriers, and the electron flux is fairly balanced with hole flux due to the improved hole conductivity even though the HTMs with additives are thick.

Conclusions
We could reproducibly fabricate semi-transparent MAPbI3 perovskite planar sandwich solar cells by laminating FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3/wet HTM with additives and PEDOT:PSS/ITO. The FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3/P3HT with additives/PEDOT:PSS/ITO planar sandwich cell exhibited a 12.8% ηavg without significant J–V hysteresis with respect to the forward and reverse scan directions and poor visible transmission due to strong absorption by P3HT. Meanwhile, the FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3/PTAA with additives/PEDOT:PSS/ITO planar sandwich cell exhibited a 15.8% of ηavg without significant J–V hysteresis with scan direction and good visible transparency. Moreover, the semi-transparent MAPbI3 planar sandwich solar cells exhibited great air and humidity stability over 20 days such that we believe that the sandwich type perovskite hybrid solar cells can be applicable in BIPVs.

Broader context
Sandwich type semi-transparent planar perovskite thin-film solar cells with transparent top and bottom electrodes, like dye sensitized solar cells, are of great interest because they have a self-passivated device architecture due to the two transparent electrodes and good transparency, and are thereby readily applicable in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs). Here, we demonstrated stable 15.8% semi-transparent CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) planar sandwich solar cells by simply laminating an FTO (F doped tin oxide) substrate/TiO2/MAPbI3/wet hole transporting material (HTM) with additives and a PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid))/indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate. The average visible transmittance (AVT) was controllable from 17.3% to 6.3% by controlling the thickness of the MAPbI3 layer.
