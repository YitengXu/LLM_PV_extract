    , Accepted 22nd July 2015First published on 24th July 2015AbstractThis work reports the design and synthesis of acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type low band gap hole transport materials (HTM) comprising S,N-heteropentacene central units for solid-state perovskite-based solar cells. The optical and electrochemical properties were tuned by the insertion of thiophene or ethylenedioxythiophene units in the molecular backbone. These HTMs showed strong absorption in the visible region and suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies with respect to the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. Mesoscopic solid state perovskite solar cells prepared by solution-processing using these HTMs generated power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 10.3–11.4% without the use of any additive or dopant. The charge transfer behavior between photoexcited perovskite and the HTMs was further investigated by photo-induced absorption spectroscopy.
Introduction
Recently, organometal halide CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskites1,2 have received considerable attention in solid-state photovoltaics due to their several interesting features, such as intense light absorption across the visible spectrum, high charge carrier mobilities, direct band gaps, longer carrier diffusion length, and small exciton binding energy.3–8 Miyasaka and co-workers were the first to report the incorporation of CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Br, I) perovskite as a sensitizer in liquid electrolyte-based dye-sensitized solar cells reaching a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%.9 Later, Park et al. reported efficient and stable solid-state CH3NH3PbI3-based perovskite solar cells with PCEs as high as 9.7%.3 Since then, by extensive optimization of the metal oxide scaffolds and device processing conditions PCEs have been improved to over 19% using state of the art 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) as the hole transport material.10–12 Seok and co-workers reported a series of spiro-MeOTAD derivatives showing an enhanced PCE of 16.7% for the o-OMe substituted derivatives compared to the conventional p-OMe counterpart.13 However, due to the low hole mobility and conductivity of spiro-MeOTAD in the pristine form, additives, such as lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI)14 and cobalt complexes as p-type dopants,15 are necessary to improve the device performance. Although PCEs up to 12.8% were reported for HTM-free perovskite devices,16–19 the most efficient solar cells usually employed organic HTMs which play a key role in hole transport and reduce charge recombination processes.20 In this respect, a wide range of material classes consisting of pyrene,21 thiophene,22,23 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT),24 butadiene derivatives,25,26 carbazole,27 star-shaped molecules,28–30 tetrathiafulvalene,31 triarylamines,32 and poly(triarylamine)11,33,34 have been developed as alternative organic HTMs showing excellent PCEs in the range of 10–15% by using various additives and dopants. All these HTMs have no absorption in the visible to near-infrared region, thus acting only as hole transporters while perovskite functions as a light absorber. Several low band gap polymeric semiconductors have also been tested in perovskite devices showing PCEs in the range of 5–9%.33,35–38 Despite having significant absorption in the visible region these polymers do not contribute to the photo-current and function only as a hole conductor.
In order to reduce the process and optimization time and thereby the overall device cost, several dopant-free low band gap HTMs, such as star-shaped,39 oligothiophene,40 phenoxazine,41 and phenothiazine42 derivatives were developed showing excellent PCEs in the range of 12–13%. The star-shaped HTM containing the quinolizino[3,4,5,6,7-defg]acridine core and oligothiophene branching units showed enhanced photocurrent in the blue region of the solar spectrum (400–600 nm).39 We have recently employed dicyanovinyl (DCV)-capped acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) oligomers comprising dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]thieno[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dipyrroles (S,N-heteropentacene) as hole transport materials in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite devices exhibiting PCEs up to 10.5%.43 Because of their strong absorption in the visible to near-infrared region, they also participate as light absorbers together with perovskite in the low energy region. D–A-type sensitizers containing the S,N-heteropentacene bridge and cyano acrylic acid anchoring group are currently used in dye-sensitized solar cells showing a moderate efficiency of 4–6%.44 By using smaller DCV-substituted S,N-heteropentacenes higher PCEs of up to 6.5% were obtained in vacuum-processed and up to 4.9% in solution processed organic solar cells.45,46
Acceptor-substituted S,N-heteroacenes combine the favourable properties of oligothiophenes, such as excellent stability due to a low lying HOMO energy level, and high charge carrier mobilities of oligoacenes.47 In continuation to our work on the development of heteroacene-based HTMs, in this report we introduced thiophene and EDOT linkers between the planar S,N-heteropentacene central unit and DCV acceptor groups in A–D–A oligomers 1 and 2 and investigated the influence of the linker on optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties. In order to improve their solubility in organic solvents octylnonyl chains were introduced at the heteroacene nitrogens. In perovskite solar cells, fabricated by sequential solution-based deposition, high PCEs of 11.4% and 10.3% were achieved using 1 and 2 as dopant free HTMs in comparison with 7.1% for devices without hole transport layers. Due to their strong absorption in the visible and near-infrared region they also contribute to the charge transport and enhance the photocurrent of the device which can be seen in the incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra.
Results and discussion

S,N-Heteropentacene-based hole transport materials 1 and 2 were synthesized by the Pd0-catalyzed Stille cross-coupling reaction of bis-stannylated derivative 5 and DCV-substituted bromo-ethylenedioxythiophene 7 and bromothiophene 8 in 70% and 60% yield, respectively (Scheme 1). Pd-catalyzed tandem Buchwald–Hartwig amination of 3,3′,3′′,4′-tetrabromo-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene 3 with heptadecan-9-amine gave S,N-heteropentacene 4 in 50% yield. Bis-stannylation of 4 was carried out by lithiation using n-butyl lithium and subsequent quenching with trimethyltin chloride in 93% yield. 2-[(7-Bromo-2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)methylene]malononitrile 7 was synthesized in 88% yield by a Knoevenagel condensation of 7-bromo-2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxine-5-carbaldehyde48,496 and malononitrile in the presence of β-alanine as the catalyst.

The UV-Vis absorption profiles of 1 and 2 in dichloromethane solution, coated on the TiO2 film and on top of the perovskite layer, are shown in Fig. 1. All data are listed in Table 1. HTMs 1 and 2 showed strong intramolecular charge-transfer absorption bands at 683 and 655 nm, respectively, with high molar extinction coefficients (ε) of 137500 M−1 cm−1 for 1 and 104500 M−1 cm−1 for 2. The red-shifted absorption (Δλ = 28 nm) and higher ε of HTM 1 can be ascribed to the more planar ground state geometry of the electron donating EDOT units caused by the lower degree of torsion due to S⋯O interactions. The strong absorption of the oligomers in the low energy region should serve the purpose of harvesting light transmitted through the perovskite layer.

In comparison to solution, a significant spectral broadening was observed for the absorption bands of 1 and 2 coated on the TiO2 surface. The absorption maximum of 1 was slightly blue-shifted (λmax = 674 nm) compared to that measured in solution. On the other hand, the absorption band of 2 was strongly red-shifted and became structured (λmax = 686 nm) indicating increased intermolecular interactions of the molecules in the solid state. The improved vibronic resolution on the absorption band of 2 might be arising from a better packing on the TiO2 surface. It is interesting to note that due to the absence of hexyl chains in the terminal thiophene units the absorption band of HTM 2 is broadened and the onset is red-shifted by about 25 nm compared to the HTM A reported earlier (see ESI, Fig. S1†).43 This could be ascribed to the improved packing of the molecule in the solid state. The optical energy gaps (Eoptg) for 1 and 2 on the TiO2 film were 1.47 eV, which were lowered compared to the gaps (Eg = 1.63 eV for 1 and 1.68 eV for 2) in solution. In order to further investigate the contribution of light absorption, thin films of HTM 1 and 2 coated on the perovskite layer were investigated. The absorption of HTMs 1 and 2 on perovskite films further resembles the film spectra on TiO2. As can be seen in Fig. 2b, in the presence of HTMs the absorption band of perovskite films is strongly enhanced, specifically in the spectral region beyond 550 nm, further supporting the contribution of possible light absorption of the HTMs. Similar to the film spectra on TiO2, the absorption band of HTM 2 on the perovskite film is slightly structured and red-shifted compared to that of 1. The enhanced absorption of these HTMs in the low energy region, exceeding up to 815 nm, could be beneficial for the overall photocurrent generation in the devices by absorbing the excess light that passes through the perovskite layer.
 Fig. 2  Cyclic voltammograms of HTMs 1 and 2 measured in dichloromethane at 25 °C, supporting electrolyte TBAPF6 (0.1 M), scan rate 100 mV s−1. 
Electrochemical measurements were performed in order to determine the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy levels. Fig. 2 shows cyclic voltammograms of HTMs 1 and 2 and the data are summarized in Table 1. Two reversible oxidation processes were observed for both oligomers, which are assigned to the formation of stable radical cations and dications delocalized over the conjugated backbone. In the negative potential regime an irreversible reduction wave was observed indicating simultaneous radical anion formation on the terminal DCV groups. The insertion of EDOT units in oligomer 1 resulted in a slight negative shift of the oxidation potentials (ΔEox = 60 and 110 mV) compared to 2. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of oligomers 1 and 2 were determined from the onset of the first oxidation and reduction wave, respectively. The HOMO energy level of oligomer 1 is increased by 0.08 eV compared to 2, while the LUMO energy level of both oligomers is very similar (∼−3.8 eV). The trends are reflected in the energy level diagram and compared with the energy level of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite (Fig. 3a). The LUMO energy of −3.8 eV allows sufficient offset to the conduction band of perovskite to ensure efficient electron transfer at the interface.

The hole transport properties of oligomers 1 and 2 were determined from hole-only devices using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model. The extracted hole mobilities for 1 and 2 are 4.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (see ESI, Fig. S2†).

Fig. 3b shows the schematic representation of the device architecture in which the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer was deposited on mesoporous-TiO2 (mp-TiO2) by a two-step sequential deposition method as described in the Experimental section. After annealing of the perovskite film, HTMs were deposited by spin-coating followed by deposition of a thin gold layer as the back contact. As can be seen from the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Fig. 3c, the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite penetrates into the mp-TiO2 and simultaneously forms an overlayer. Likewise, the HTMs infiltrate into the pores in the TiO2/perovskite layer and at the same time form a thin capping layer on the top.
Perovskite devices were fabricated using oligomers 1 and 2 as the HTM and TiO2 as the electron transport layer. For comparison a reference device without a HTM was also prepared. For the deposition of HTM layers different concentrations and film thicknesses have been tested. Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices are shown in Fig. 4a and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The best devices were obtained using an HTM concentration of 0.03 M deposited at a spin-speed of 2000 rpm. All photovoltaic data are listed in Table S1 (see ESI†). The best performing device without any HTM displayed a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 13.1 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 830 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.65, resulting in a PCE of 7.1%. The introduction of oligomers 1 and 2 as HTMs significantly increased the PCE to 11.4% and 10.3%, respectively, and the FF attaining values up to 0.72, without the use of any additives and dopants. The resulting increase of the PCEs due to the presence of HTMs results from an improvement of all photovoltaic parameters, such as JSC, VOC and FF. The fill factors of devices based on HTM 1 and 2 were significantly improved (FF ≳ 70%) compared to the device based on HTM A (FF = 65%) reported previously.43 This improvement could be ascribed to the better ordering of the molecule in the solid state. The average PCE values on a batch of five identical devices for HTM 1 and 2 are 11.24 ± 0.21% and 10.04 ± 0.27%, respectively. The results clearly showed the crucial role of HTMs in perovskite devices. Perovskite devices fabricated with different HTM concentrations and spin speeds are presented in Table S1 (see ESI†). This improvement in the device performance could be ascribed to the fact that the HTM layer acts as an electron blocking layer and improves the charge extraction process. Thus the direct contact between the gold and perovskite is prevented to reduce non-radiative charge recombination.

The incident photon to electron conversion efficiency of perovskite devices with and without HTMs is presented in Fig. 4b. As can be seen, the overall conversion efficiency obtained with 1 and 2 is higher compared to the HTM-free device over the whole spectral range of 400–800 nm suggesting improved charge collection and extraction. In addition, HTMs 1 and 2 produce a red-shift in the IPCE spectra (Δλ = 15–25 nm) which concurs with the absorption spectra of the films shown in Fig. 1a. Although the IPCE spectra of the HTM 2 device is red-shifted compared to those of HTM 1, the lower IPCE in the spectral region of 400 to 650 nm for 1 yields a slightly lower JSC values. The integrated current density from the IPCE spectra (16.14 mA cm−2 for 1, 15.65 mA cm−2 for 2, and 13.08 mA cm−2 for the device without the HTM) plotted in Fig. 4b is consistent with the value obtained from the J–V curve. The results indicate that besides acting as the HTM the low band gap molecules could also participate in the overall photocurrent generation.
In order to further explain the light absorbing ability and photocurrent generation of the HTMs we have fabricated devices with configuration of TiO2/HTM 1 or 2/Au without the perovskite layer. The devices showed very low JSC and VOC values (Fig. S3, Table S2, ESI†). The results indicated that both HTMs 1 and 2 could work as a light harvester and the charge separation occurs between TiO2 and the HTM. However, the lower performance is mainly due to the limitation of material loading and the possible fast charge recombination between TiO2 and the HTM. These results further support the contribution of the HTMs to the photocurrent generation together with the perovskite.
Further insight into the interfacial charge generation in the device was obtained from photo-induced absorption (PIA) measurements on the mp-TiO2 film coated either with perovskite or the HTMs 1, 2 or with both perovskite and HTMs (Fig. 5). The TiO2/perovskite film showed an intense negative band at around 780 nm which can be attributed to the fluorescence of perovskite. Measurements of the TiO2 film coated with HTM 1 in the absence of perovskite also showed a pronounced negative signal at around 850 nm in its fluorescence spectral range, while no absorption of the oxidized species could be observed in the near-infrared region. In the presence of perovskite a broad excited state absorption band appeared in the range of 1050–1400 nm with a maximum at 1190 nm assigned to the oxidized species of HTM 1.

For HTM 2 coated on TiO2, at shorter wavelengths a competition between negative and positive signals was revealed. The negative contribution below 850 nm is assigned to its fluorescence, while the positive signal at 930 nm can be attributed to the excited state absorption of the oxidized species. In the presence of perovskite the negative band attributed to the fluorescence of 2 is attenuated, while a new excited state absorption appears at longer wavelengths. The PIA results illustrate that efficient charge transfer takes place between the photoexcited perovskite and HTMs 1 and 2 under formation of long-lived charge carriers.
Conclusion
In summary, we have reported two new low band gap hole transporting materials 1 and 2 containing the S,N-heteropentacene core flanked by the EDOT/thiophene spacer and end-capped with dicyanovinylene acceptor units. The strong charge transfer absorption in the low energy region and suitable frontier orbital energy levels of the molecules allowed us to use them as an HTM in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells. A strong red-shift was observed for both oligomers in thin films coated on TiO2 as well as on perovskite. Specifically, oligomer 2 showed a structured absorption band in the low energy region which could be suitable for harnessing the extra light passing through the perovskite. Solar cells using HTMs 1 and 2 exhibited a high FF of up to 0.72 and PCEs of 11.4% and 10.3%, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the high performance of these devices was achievable even without the use of any additive and dopant. Additionally, the red-shifted IPCE spectra for the new HTMs in comparison to the devices without the HTM further envisage the role of these HTMs in photocurrent generation together with the perovskite. Photoinduced absorption studies demonstrated the occurrence of charge transfer between the photoexcited HTM and perovskite. The present results offer a new avenue for the fabrication of high efficiency and low cost perovskite solar cells by designing even more favourable hole transport materials with intense light absorption and tunable frontier orbital energy levels.
Experimental
Instruments and measurements
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX 400 spectrometer (1H NMR: 400 MHz, 13C NMR: 100 MHz). Chemical shift values (δ) are expressed in parts per million using residual solvent protons (1H NMR: δH = 7.26 for CDCl3; δH = 5.32 for CD2Cl2; 13C NMR: δC = 77.0 for CDCl3; δC = 54.0 for CD2Cl2) as the internal standard. The splitting patterns are designated as follows: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet) and m (multiplet). Elemental analyses were performed on an Elementar Vario EL. Melting points were determined using a Büchi Melting Point B-545. Thin layer chromatography was carried out on aluminum plates, pre-coated with silica gel, Merck Si60 F254. Preparative column chromatography was performed on glass columns packed with silica gel, Merck Silica 60, particle size 40–63 μm. High resolution MALDI-TOF mass spectra (HRMS) experiments were performed using a MS Bruker Reflex 2 (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) using trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]malononitrile (DCTB) as the matrix. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed with a computer-controlled Autolab PGSTAT30 potentiostat in a three-electrode single-compartment cell with a platinum working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. All potentials were internally referenced to the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple.
Optical measurements
UV-Vis absorption spectra in dichloromethane solution were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 19 spectrometer. Optical absorption spectra of all investigated materials in thin films spin coated on the top of amorphous glass, TiO2 and TiO2/perovskite were recorded with a CARY-5 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer in transmission mode within the 500–850 nm range.
Mobility measurements
In order to assess the potential of HTMs 1 and 2 as hole transport materials, hole-only devices were fabricated using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method with the device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM/Al. Hole mobilities were calculated using the Mott–Gurney law, by fitting eqn (1) to experimental data in the voltage range where the obtained slope in the double log plot is equal to 2. (1)
In eqn (1), J is the current density, ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), εr is the relative permittivity of the material (approaching 3 for organic semiconductors), μh is the hole mobility, V is the applied voltage and d is the thickness of the active layer.
The hole-only devices were fabricated by spin-coating PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P, VP Al4083) onto pre-cleaned, patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates (15 Ω per square) (Kintec). A film of the HTM was spin-coated on top from chloroform solution with a concentration of 8 mg mL−1. The film thickness was varied by using different spin-coating speeds. As a counter electrode Al was deposited on top by vacuum evaporation. The current density–voltage curves of the devices were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source.
Device fabrication
Devices were fabricated on plasma-cleaned conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates. A compact 50 nm thick titanium dioxide layer was deposited by spray pyrolysis of 9 mL ethanol solution containing 0.6 mL titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (75 wt% in 2-propanol, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.4 mL acetylacetone at 450 °C in air. On top of this compact layer, a 350 nm-thick mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO2) layer was prepared by spin-coating 30 nm sized nanoparticles (Dyesol 30NRT, Dyesol) diluted in ethanol (1:3.5 w/w) at 500 rpm for 20 s. The films were then gradually heated to 500 °C and sintered at that temperature for 1 h under an oxygen atmosphere. Afterwards, lead iodide (PbI2) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide by vigorous stirring at 130 °C to obtain a 1.2 M stock solution. Lead salt was spin coated on the top of the mesoporous TiO2 layer at 6500 rpm for 20 s and dried for 10 min at 85 °C. In order to assure better film coverage and pore filling, the deposition of PbI2 was performed two times. Subsequently, on the top of the lead salt a 0.05 M CH3NH3I solution in ethanol was sprayed and left for 20 s before spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The formed perovskite films were dried at 85 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, for devices with hole transporting materials, compounds 1 and 2 were dissolved in tetrachloroethane (0.03 M) and deposited on top of the perovskite layer by spin coating at 2000 rpm for 20 s while maintaining solutions at 70 °C degrees during the whole procedure. Device fabrication was completed by thermal evaporation of 60 nm thick gold layer on top of the pure perovskite and perovskite with HTMs. The active area of the devices is approx. 0.56 cm2

J–V characterization
The J–V characteristics of the devices were measured under 100 mW cm−2 conditions using a 450 W xenon lamp (Oriel) as a light source, equipped with a Schott K113 Tempax sunlight filter (Präzisions Glas & Optik GmbH) to match the emission spectra to the AM 1.5G standard in the region of 350–750 nm. The current–voltage characteristics of the devices were obtained by applying an external potential bias to the cell while recording the generated photocurrent using a Keithley (Model 2400) digital source meter. The J–V curves of all devices were measured by masking the active area with a metal mask of 0.16 cm2. The internal photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured by focusing light from a 300 W xenon lamp (ILC Technology, USA) through a Gemini-180 double monochromator (Jobin Yvon Ltd., UK) while chopping at 3 Hz before illuminating onto the photovoltaic cell. The monochromator was incremented through the visible spectrum to generate the IPCE dependence on the wavelength. Photoinduced absorption (PIA) spectra of the films were measured using home implemented setup as described previously.50
