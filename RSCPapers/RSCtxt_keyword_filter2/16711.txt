    , Accepted 10th July 2020First published on 17th July 2020AbstractIn the past decade, lead halide perovskites experienced impressive progress in photovoltaics with the certified device conversion efficiency over 25%, owing to their outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, the toxicity and environmental instability of the core lead halide materials would strongly limit their commercialization. Within this scenario, research investigations directed at assessing the properties and opportunities offered by emerging lead-free halide perovskites are becoming everyday more relevant to pinpoint new low-cost/low-toxicity solutions for solar-to-electricity conversion. In this review, group VA metal halide based perovskites, namely those of bismuth (Bi) and antimony (Sb), and their derivatives with different valence states are classified based on the formulae A3B2X9 and A2AgBX6, also known as double perovskites, and AgaBibXa+3b, called rudorffites (A = MA, FA, Cs, Rb, etc.; B = Bi, Sb; X = I, Br, Cl). Here, we summarize the recent progress in the exploitation of these materials, with special attention devoted to the description of the crystal structures, thin film preparation methods and performances in real devices, including both theoretical insights and experimental observations. With this survey, we are able to provide reasonable perspectives for the future development of high-performance photovoltaic devices based on lead-free bismuth/antimony halide based perovskites and their derivatives.Zhixin JinZhixin Jin received his PhD degree in condensed matter physics from Northeast Normal University in 2016.

1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskite solar cells (PvSCs) have attracted huge attention in the last decade as one of the most promising low-cost technologies with power conversion efficiency (PCE) overcoming the 25% threshold.1 Metal halide perovskites investigated the most have the formula APbX3, where A is a monovalent cation, e.g., methylammonium (CH3NH3+, MA+), formamidinium (HC(NH2)2, FA+), Cs+, and X is a halide anion such as I−, Br−, and Cl−. The APbX3 perovskite is an excellent photo-active material for photovoltaics due to the unique optoelectronic properties, including the direct and suitably narrow band gap,2 extremely high absorption coefficient,3 long charge carrier diffusion length,4 high defect tolerance,5 excellent ambipolar charge carrier transport properties6 and the possibility of undergoing solution-processing at low temperature.7
Lead-based PvSCs have been largely developed due to the above summarized advantages. However, two main bottlenecks that hinder future industrialization and commercialization of these solar technologies are the poor stability towards environmental factors (humidity, heat, UV-radiation etc.) and the high toxicity of lead. These disadvantages of Pb-based perovskites prompted many researchers to seek alternatives based on more stable and environmentally friendly elements. Lead-free halide perovskite-based light absorbers mainly include post-transition metal or metalloid elements like Sn,8 Ge,9 Sb,10 Bi,11,12 and others.13 Sn and Ge belong to the same group as Pb in the periodic table, but Sn2+ and Ge2+ can be easily oxidized into Sn4+ and Ge4+, resulting in the rapid degradation of the photovoltaic properties of the corresponding perovskites. In addition, tin compounds are also toxic and their effects on the environment and on humans are well known and documented. On the other hand, main group VA metals like Bi and Sb, also largely available from natural sources, are characterized by high chemical stability in their trivalent form and lower toxicity compared to Pb2+ and Sn2+. These ions have similar electronic configuration, electronegativity, and ionic radius to Pb2+. Capitalizing on their excellent stability and low-toxicity, research on solar cells fabricated using Bi- and Sb-halide based perovskites and their derivatives have emerged as a new, largely explored sector for solar cells. Nowadays, their excellent level of maturity allows us to make insightful considerations from data analysis.
Indeed, in recent years of photovoltaic research, group VA metal halide based perovskites and their derivatives have been tentatively developed. And many material combinations have been identified as emerging light absorbers, such as MA3Bi2I9, Cs3Bi2I9, MA3Sb2I9, Cs3Sb2I9 and more. However, relatively wide bandgaps, high exciton binding energies and heavy carrier effective masses ultimately limit their photovoltaic performance. Currently, the PCEs of VA metal halide based PvSCs lie far behind those of lead halide based PvSCs.
In this review, we provide a summary of the recent developments on VA metal halide based perovskites and their derivatives, mainly focusing on low dimensional A3B2X9, double perovskite and rudorffite structures. We further discuss the potential applications of these emerging species in photovoltaics with emphasis on theoretical and physico-chemical studies, thin film fabrication strategies, carrier extraction layer screening and device structure optimization. Accordingly, we also provide critical hints on future challenges encountered by these materials in becoming protagonists in the research on next-generation, ultra-cheap photovoltaics.
2. Structures and properties of group VA metal halide based perovskites and derivatives
As the neighboring elements of Pb, VA group metals (Bi and Sb) have been employed to replace lead in well-known lead halide perovskite light absorbers in photovoltaic devices. Since Bi and Sb have three valence electrons in the outmost shell, they exist as trivalent cations in their halide perovskites and derivatives. While replacing Pb2+, Bi3+ (Sb3+) would form a BiX63− (SbX63−) octahedron by bonding with halide anions, coordinating with amines or cesium cations to form different phase structures with different dimensionalities. In this section, typical A3B2X9 (A = MA+, FA+, Cs+etc.; B = Bi3+, Sb3+; X = I−, Br−, Cl−) polymorphs and other derivatives will be discussed. The multiple connection mode of BX63− leads to a large dimensional variability in the crystal structures of VA metal halide based materials. Generally, A3B2X9 is commonly adopted in bismuth halide or antimony halide based compounds, along with zero dimensional (0D) or two dimensional (2D) structures. In addition, double perovskite structures, with the general formula of A2BIBIIIX6, form three dimensional (3D) corner-sharing perovskite structures with monovalent metals (BI) and trivalent metals (BIII = Bi, Sb). Another family of photovoltaic perovskite derivatives of the formula AaBbXa+3b (A = Ag+, Cu+, etc.; B = Bi3+, Sb3+; X = I−, Br−, Cl−) can evolve into rudorffite structures which are 3D structures based on edge-shared [AX6] and [BX6] octahedra. Here we denote them as 0D, 2D, double perovskite (3D) and rudorffite (3D) structures (Fig. 1).

2.1 Bismuth halide based perovskites and their derivatives
From the viewpoint of electronic structure, the outstanding properties of lead halide based perovskites can be ascribed to the 6s26p0 electronic configuration of Pb2+, which allows the hybridization of the iodide 5p orbitals in the valence band with the 6p orbitals of lead in the conduction bands. The large absorption coefficient is mainly derived from the high density of states which are produced by the p-orbital-based interatomic transition and s–p-orbital-based intra-atomic transition. The existence of shallow defect states relies on the strong antibonding coupling between the 6s orbital of lead and 5p orbital of iodide in the valence band.14,15 Fortunately, Bi3+ and Pb2+ have very similar ionic radii, and also have the same 6s26p0 electronic configuration, which may make it easy for Bi to replace Pb in the perovskite lattice. Hence, Bi3+ is a good potential candidate for lead substitution.
Bismuth halide based perovskite derivatives A3Bi2I9 (A = K, Rb, and Cs) have been successfully synthesized and utilized in photovoltaics.16 The compounds can have two kinds of structures, namely 0D and 2D. Cs3Bi2I9 crystallizes in the space group P63/mmc with a 0D hexagonal close packing structure containing isolated Bi2I93− cluster dimeric units comprising pairs of face-sharing Bi–I octahedra (Fig. 2a). The reduced dimensionality of 0D A3Bi2X9 systems with respect to 3D ABiX3 materials can deliver better stability against phase degradation. On the other hand, compounds like K3Bi2I9 and Rb3Bi2I9 have 2D structures with corrugated layers based on the corner connected Bi–I octahedron (Fig. 2b). More importantly, lattice parameters in A3B2X9 can be tuned by A, B, X site substitutions. The band gaps can vary from 1.9 to 3.1 eV.17 By computing dielectric properties, anomalously large Born effective charge tensors on Bi3+ are found due to the proximal structural instabilities of the Bi3+ 6s2 lone pair. Defect screening and effective charge carrier transport are improved by these Born effective charges. The band positions of A3Bi2I9 are shown in Fig. 2c, as obtained by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental values.

MA3Bi2I9 is the most studied polymorph among all the bismuth halide based absorbers. The structure of MA3Bi2I9 comprising two face-sharing bismuth iodide octahedra, is a 0D dimer at room temperature. In contrast to MAPbX3, pure phase MA3Bi2I9 has been synthesized by solution and vapor methods and is air stable. MA3Bi2I9 has an indirect bandgap of 2.04 eV, with optical absorption coefficients approaching 105 cm−1. A long photoluminescence (PL) decay of at least 760 ps, with a bulk lifetime possibly closer to 5.6 ns, was measured by Hoye et al.18 Sulfur-doped MA3Bi2I9 have been obtained by in situ sulfur doping via the thermal decomposition of a Bi(xt)3 (xt = ethyl xanthate) precursor. Compared to MA3Bi2I9, sulfur doping can shrink its bandgap to 1.45 eV. Colors of the obtained films clearly changed from orange to black when annealed from 80 to 150 °C (Fig. 2d). Simultaneously, sulfur-doped MA3Bi2I9 exhibited a much higher carrier mobility and carrier concentration than pristine MA3Bi2I9.19
Other organic groups replacing MA+ have also been employed. MA3Bi2Cl9 is a one dimensional (1D) organic–inorganic hybrid bismuth compound with double chains of a distorted BiCl63− octahedral structure.20 1D thermally stable (H3NC6H12NH3)BiI5 was synthesized as a photoactive layer including organic 1,6-hexanediammonium groups. Compared to MAPbI3, (H3NC6H12NH3)BiI5 exhibited better thermal stability.21 A new organic–inorganic compound of formula C6H14NBi2I9 exhibiting a 0D structure has been synthesized by solvent evaporation. Thin films have also been prepared by spin coating.22 C5H6NBiI4 ([py][BiI4]) (py: pyridinium) and C6H8NBiI4 ([mepy][BiI4]) (mepy: 1-methylpyridnium) have been prepared containing 1D BiI4− anionic chains built by edge-sharing BiI6.23 Dark-red (NH4)3Bi2I9 was synthesized through a solution method and featured a 2D layered derivative structure, with a measured band gap of 2.04 eV.24
Bismuth based 3D double perovskites were also developed, as the 3D lead-based ones show the best optoelectronic performances. A 3D double perovskite with the chemical formula of A2BIBIIIX6 has been produced by incorporating a monovalent metal into the Bi3+ site. The total charge neutrality is maintained thanks to the presence of monovalent and trivalent cations occupying the BI and BIII sites (Fig. 3a). Giorgi and Yamashita theoretically investigated double perovskites of the type MA2TlBiI6, where Pb2+ cations in MAPbI3 are substituted by the Tl+/Bi3+ ionic pairs.25 Although it is predicted to have good photoelectric potential, monovalent Tl is highly toxic and therefore it is not suitable for practical applications. The double perovskite structure that currently attracts the largest attention is Cs2AgBiX6. Cs2AgBiBr6 is characterized by a long room-temperature PL lifetime of more than 600 ns and has an indirect bandgap of around 1.95 eV. This compound is characterized by a better stability to heat and moisture compared to MAPbI3.26 McClure et al. reported on the double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2AgBiCl6 synthesized via both solid state and solution routes.27 They were found to have indirect band gaps of 2.19 eV and 2.77 eV, respectively, by diffuse reflectance measurements and band structure calculations. When exposed to air these compounds are stable, but when exposed to both air and light for more than a week, Cs2AgBiBr6 starts to degrade. Finally, another family of photovoltaic halides based on two aliovalent metals is the one with the general formula AgaBibIx (x = a + 3b), based on edge-shared AX6 and BX6 octahedra. This structure is called rudorffite and has a 3D R3m trigonal lattice (Fig. 1). Several Ag–Bi–I rudorffite structures have direct band gaps in the range of 1.79–1.83 eV and feature high stability in air.28

2.2 Antimony halide based perovskites and their derivatives
Being a member of group VA, antimony, a metalloid, is also expected to exhibit optoelectronic behavior similar to Bi when integrated into perovskite derivative structures. Sb3+ ions have a similar structure to Bi3+ and ternary halide semiconductors such as Cs3Sb2I9 have been examined by computational and experimental approaches. The 0D dimeric form (space group P63/mmc) and the 2D layered form (Pm1) are two structural modifications in Cs3Sb2I9.
To achieve correct charge balance, the hypothetical perovskite compound CsSbI3 may produce the crystal structure of the 2D layered Cs3Sb2I9 after removal of one layer from every set of three Sb layers along the 〈111〉 direction (Fig. 3b).10 2D Cs3Sb2I9 has an optical band gap of 2.05 eV and enhanced stability in ambient air compared to MAPbI3. Cs can be replaced by other alkali metals such as Rb and K, providing compounds with the general formula A3Sb2X9. Experiments have proven that the A-site cation plays an important role in determining the structural and optoelectronic properties of these compounds. Rb3Sb2I9 and K3Sb2I9 have a direct bandgap and 2D structures due to the smaller ionic radius of Rb+ and K+ compared to Cs+, which stabilizes this type of structure.29 In addition, colloidal Cs3Sb2I9 and Rb3Sb2I9 nanocrystals have been synthesized.30 They also exhibit 2D crystal structures and a high absorption cross-section of 1015 cm2, standing out as good candidates for optoelectronic applications.
The hexagonal structure of methylammonium antimony iodide (MA3Sb2I9) is isomorphous with Cs3Sb2I9 at room temperature.31 Hebig et al. reported a MA3Sb2I9 compound produced by a solution process. Depending on photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS), amorphous MA3Sb2I9 shows an absorption coefficient α ≈ 105 cm−1 and an optical band gap of 2.14 eV, with a pretty large energetic disorder, as evidenced by an Urbach tail (Eu) of 62 meV and a weak PL emission shifted at 1.58 eV, likely originating from radiative recombination involving subgap states.32 So far, most synthesized antimony halide based double perovskites appear to have large bandgaps (>2 eV). As reported recently, Cu2+-doped Cs2SbAgCl6 has a reduced indirect bandgap of 1.02 eV compared to 2.65 eV for Cs2SbAgCl6.33 On the other hand, in the layered double perovskites Cs3+nM(II)nSb2X9+3n, [SnI6] and [GeI6] octahedral layers are introduced between [Sb2I9] clusters. Providing an increased electronic dimensionality (Fig. 3c), it has a smaller bandgap, smaller carrier effective masses, larger dielectric constants, lower exciton binding energies and higher optical absorption compared to Cs3Sb2I9.34 Vargas et al. have reported that the bandgap of Cs4Mn1−xCuxSb2Cl12 (x = 0–1) can be modulated from 3.0 eV to 1.0 eV by adjusting the ratio of manganese to copper in the mixed chlorides,35 as shown in Fig. 3d. Meanwhile, the magnetic properties of those antimony halide based perovskites and derivatives can also be systematically modulated by compositional engineering.
3. Theoretical studies on group VA metal halide based perovskites and their derivatives
Bismuth halide based PvSCs have been simulated using the general-purpose photovoltaic device model (GPVDM). The results show that the bismuth halide based photovoltaic device can deliver a PCE of 20% at an active layer thickness of 450 nm.36 At the same time, a series of theoretical simulations on VA metal halide based perovskites and derivatives were carried out. First principles DFT calculations can simulate the electronic structures of many semiconductor material systems from atomic level quantum mechanics. For example, the electronic structures of various perovskites were simulated by first principles calculations, providing meaningful information on their band gaps, defect distributions, charge carrier mobilities, absorption spectra and more.37,38
By theoretical simulation, all the elements of the periodic table which can be integrated into double perovskites with the general formula A2BB3+X6 are shown in Fig. 4a. The A+, B+, B3+, and X− sites can be occupied by 7, 8, 34, and 5 elements, respectively. These elements can yield nearly 10000 compounds. However, following Goldschmidt's rules on perovskite structure stability, majority of these compounds are unstable. By the most rigorous screening criteria, there are more than 600 compounds whose synthesis could be attempted.39 Double perovskites based on Bi and Sb have been analyzed through the first-principles calculations and experimentally as well.40 Their electronic band structures and effective masses have been calculated using the PBE0 hybrid functional and DFT/LDA (local density approximation), respectively (Fig. 4b). Most double perovskites were predicted to display an indirect gap from calculations, unless some new experimental strategies were developed for changing them into direct-gap. For example, the synthesized Cs2AgBiCl6 compound is a face-centered cubic double perovskite with an indirect gap of 2.2 eV. In general, eleven optimal double perovskite materials have been screened by first-principles calculations exploiting the strategy of cation-transmutation and are characterized by an intrinsic thermodynamic stability, relatively small band gaps and light carrier effective masses. Among them, Cs2InSbCl6 and Cs2InBiCl6, two materials with a 1.0 eV direct band-gap, show the greatest potential as photovoltaic materials (Fig. 4c).41 However, perspectives for perovskites based on low-toxicity bismuth ions might expand well-beyond the Cs2AgBiX6 motif, as predicted by first principles calculations.42

Compounds like MABiSeI2 and MABiSI2 could be prepared by introducing two anions for preserving the charge neutrality from the split-anion approach.43,44 These chalcogen element doped compounds have been identified to have a direct band gap of 1.3 eV to 1.4 eV, ideal for single-junction solar cells (Fig. 5).45 Other theoretical calculations on possible double perovskite structures were also carried out.46,47 Volonakis et al. theoretically investigated Cs2InBiX6 and the mixed-cation (Cs/MA/FA)2InBiBr6 halide double perovskites. A2InBiBr6 could be stabilized by employing MA and FA as the cations. The calculated bandgaps with DFT/PBE0 of MAPbI3 and MA2InBiBr6 are 1.9 eV and 2.0 eV, respectively. Bandgaps of 1.7 eV and 1.9 eV are calculated for mixed cation species such as [(Cs0.5MA0.5)2InBiBr6] and [(FA0.5MA0.5)2InBiBr6], respectively (Fig. 4d). This suggests that a certain tuning of bandgap is possible within a limited range for mixed cation double perovskites.48 Yang et al. found that the bandgap of Cs2AgBiBr6 can be changed systematically by tuning the lattice parameters. The bandgap of 1.93 eV of ordered Cs2AgBiBr6 is an indirect one and could be modified into a pseudo-direct disordered one of 0.44 eV through a tight control on doping and growth temperature.49 The difference between the pseudo-closed s2 orbitals of Tl and In could lead to different semiconducting behaviors of Tl–Bi and In–Bi bromide double perovskites, as evidenced by DFT calculations. Tl–Bi double perovskite shows p-type semiconducting properties, while In–Bi ones are p-type metallic ones. Therefore, this analysis suggests that In–Bi bromide double perovskites should be disregarded as light absorbers, but could be perhaps suitable as hole-transport layer (HTL) materials in PvSCs.50

Deng et al. synthesized double perovskite Cs2AgSbCl6via a solution method. This compound has a computed indirect bandgap of 2.41 eV by projected augmented wave (PAW) + HSE06 hybrid functional calculations. The result is comparable with the experimental value of 2.60 eV. In addition, Cs2AgSbCl6/TiO2 heterostructures show improved light absorption compared to the pure perovskite and a decreased interfacial bandgap due to the formation of interfacial states.51 The structures and electronic properties of Sb2S3, Cs2Sb8S13, and MA2Sb8S13 have been investigated by first-principles techniques. Their electronic band structures are predicted through DFT/HSE06 to have bandgaps of 1.72, 1.85 and 2.08 eV, respectively. Remarkably, the introduction of the A cations in the pristine Sb2S3 to yield Cs2Sb8S13 and MA2Sb8S13 leads to a significant decrease in bandgap depending on that specific A cation. Thus, it allows one to obtain good performances for solar harvesting applications.52
4. Group VA metal halide based perovskites and derivatives for photovoltaics
Due to their unique optoelectronic properties and structural stabilities, the low-toxicity Bi- and Sb-halide based perovskites and their derivatives are considered as promising absorbers to substitute the lead halide based counterparts in PvSCs and have done enormous progress in recent years in terms of improved PCE. In the following part of this review, we will provide a detailed summary of the main examples presented in the recent literature on the use of these compounds in photovoltaic devices.
4.1 Bismuth halide based solar cells

4.1.1 Photovoltaic devices based on perovskite-derivative structures. 
The recorded device performances of bismuth halide based PvSCs are summarized in Table 1. Park et al. first reported the use of A3Bi2I9 as a light absorber in solar cells.11 The synthesis of Cs3Bi2I9, MA3Bi2I9, and MA3Bi2I9Clx was realized through a simple one-step spin-coating method. The light absorption spectra and bandgaps for the three different materials are shown in Fig. 6a for comparison. Among them, Cs3Bi2I9 shows the highest absorption coefficient and the lowest structural disorder, which results from the morphology difference of films based on them. Doping with chlorides further changes the morphology of the film from interconnected and smooth to nanostructured. Comparison of the device data indicates that among the three materials the best performance was achieved by Cs3Bi2I9, with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 2.15 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.85 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.60 and an overall PCE of 1.09% in a mesoscopic solar cell architecture. In contrast, MA3Bi2I9 shows a Jsc of 0.52 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.68 V, FF of 0.33, and PCE of 0.12%, while MA3Bi2I9−xClx provides very poor figures of merit (PCE = 0.003%). Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of these devices are shown in Fig. 6b. The authors point out that the sub-optimal morphology, constituting MA3Bi2I9−xClx particles surrounded by amorphous BiCl3 is the major cause of the extremely low efficiency found for MA3Bi2I9−xClx. At the same time, the first inverted planar heterojunction device based on MA3Bi2I9 was reported. The bandgap of MA3Bi2I9 is as high as 2.9 eV, and therefore its PCE is very low, about 0.1% (Fig. 6c).53

Taking poly(3-hexylthiophene-2.5-diyl) (P3HT) to replace spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL material in PvSCs, Lyu et al. demonstrated a device PCE of 0.19% by substituting MAPbI3 with MA3Bi2I9.54 The morphology and crystallinity of the solution-processed MA3Bi2I9 film and photovoltaic properties of the resulting solar devices would be affected by the precursor solution concentration and substrate used for deposition. The efficiency of the PvSC was further improved to 0.42% on a mesoporous TiO2 electron transporting layer (ETL) scaffold.55 The MA3Bi2I9 devices were found to be very stable in ambient air, maintaining a stable 0.2% PCE for more than 10 weeks.56 Further studies indicate that the PCE of MA3Bi2I9 devices can be further increased by improving the thin film quality and optimizing the device structure.57
The bismuth halide based compounds crystallize directly and rapidly into a textured polycrystalline microstructure from a precursor solution without going through intermediate crystalline solvated phases, as determined by multi-probe in situ characterization methods.58 The maintenance of continuous polycrystallinity within MA3Bi2I9 films is crucial to the good performance of the resulting solar cells. Recently, some new methods have been applied to synthesize MA3Bi2I9 thin films. A highly compact, large grained MA3Bi2I9 film can be prepared employing a two-step approach based on the subsequent thermal evaporation of BiI3 and MAI. By employing this method, an excellent PCE of 1.64% was achieved.59 (Fig. 7a and b) The vapor assisted solution processing (VASP) method also allows the preparation of homogeneous MA3Bi2I9 films by exposing solution processed BiI3 films to MAI vapors. Given the very good film quality obtained by applying this method, hysteresis-free J–V curves were recorded with an overall PCE of 3.17% on mesoporous TiO2 ETLs, with excellent reproducibility (Fig. 7c and d).60 This is one of the highest performances found among MA3Bi2I9-based lead-free PvSCs. The uniform and compact MA3Bi2I9 thin film was prepared in two steps (evaporation and spin-coating) and the inverted planar PvSCs exhibited a PCE of 0.39%. More excitingly, the value of Voc of the inverted MA3Bi2I9 devices is up to 0.83 V.61

For thin-film solar cells, the film morphology plays an important role in device performance. Hence, a lot of work has been done to optimize the morphology of MA3Bi2I9 thin films. Uniform film of MA3Bi2I9 was successfully produced by adding 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) into the MA3Bi2I9–DMF precursor solution. This leads to an optimal device with a top PCE of 0.31% and high reproducibility. Devices also maintained stable figures of merits for up to 30 days in a relative humidity of 50–60%.62 MA3Bi2I9 cuboids can also be synthesized by an antisolvent assisted crystallization method, and the MA3Bi2I9-based mesoscopic devices showed a top PCE of 0.356% and excellent stability in air for more than 60 days.63
By tuning the ratio of the DMSO/DMF solvent couple, Shin et al. obtained compact thin films of MA3Bi2I9, Cs3Bi2I9, and FA3Bi2I9 (Fig. 8a–e). Depending on the control of nucleation and growth rates, a film formation mechanism was proposed by the authors, which suggested that the existence of three different regions was essential for the film growth as shown in Fig. 8f. PIF8-TAA, a co-polymer of triarylamine and benzo-fused difluorene units, was used to replace the classical spiro-OMeTAD HTL material, obtaining a device PCE of 0.71% for the MA3Bi2I9 based PvSC.64 More excitingly, the highest value of Voc to date was reported for the MA3Bi2I9 photovoltaic devices, namely 0.85 V.65 Dense and uniform MA3Bi2I9 films can be obtained by employing ethanol as the solvent, differently from the porous and rough ones obtained with DMF (Fig. 8g). The PvSC based on ethanol treated MA3Bi2I9 films showed a high Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 0.17 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.35, and a PCE of 0.053%.66 A dense and smooth MA3Bi2I9 active layer can also be obtained by a gas-assisted deposition method.67 By further applying a fluorinated perylene diimide (FPDI) as the ETL in a MA3Bi2I9 PvSC, a limited PCE degradation (−0.06%) was recorded when the devices were maintained in an ambient environment for 17 days.68

Lan et al. designed a (BiI3)1−x(MA3Bi2I9)x mixed species to improve its photovoltaic output. The (BiI3)0.8(MA3Bi2I9)0.2-based PvSC showed indeed an increase in Voc from 0.44 to 0.57 V compared to the one based on pristine MA3Bi2I9, with a PCE of 0.08%.69 Song and coworkers compared the conventional one-step solution processing for MA3Bi2I9 with a two-step method based on the interdiffusion of solution-processed BiI3 and CH3NH3I stacking layers, achieving a higher PCE with the latter approach in a mesoscopic PvSC compared to the use of the former (0.29% vs. 0.15%).70 MA3Bi2I9 PvSCs have also been fabricated by Chen et al. employing a two-step solution process method on rutile TiO2 nanorod array ETL. Although the tested PCE was still very low, the devices didn't suffer any degradation of performance after 67 days of storage under ambient conditions.71 A cation displacement approach was also employed to improve the morphology of the MA3Bi2I9 film. It was realized by depositing first a film from the solution containing ethylammonium iodide and BiI3 by spin coating method, and then transforming the resulting hybrid material into MA3Bi2I9 by keeping the film in a methylamine atmosphere. The MA3Bi2I9 film has a smooth, uniform, and compact surface morphology. By employing it as a light absorber in a mesoporous PvSC architecture, a PCE of 0.33% was achieved, about two times higher than the value (0.15%) obtained with a one-step spin-coating method.72
High-quality ultrathin Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheets have been developed by Zhang and coworkers employing a dissolution–recrystallization process and applied as light absorbers in PvSCs, obtaining an impressive PCE value of 3.20% when CuI was used as the HTL.73 In order to optimize the photoelectric performance of Cs3Bi2I9, Johansson et al. investigated a new type of cesium bismuth iodine compound, CsBi3I10. Compared to the band gap of 2.03 eV found for Cs3Bi2I9, the CsBi3I10 film achieved a value of 1.77 eV, with absorption maximum shifting from 610 nm to 700 nm (Fig. 8i). The absorption coefficients for CsBi3I10 increased as well by an order of magnitude compared to Cs3Bi2I9. At last, the PCE of a PvSC based on CsBi3I10 was 0.4% higher than that reported in ref. 74. Subsequently, the group conducted further research on this material. By using dopant-free hole-transporting polymers, the energy mismatch between the CsBi3I10 film and the HTL materials was alleviated. Hence, a higher PCE was obtained for the modified device.75 However, Khadka et al. fabricated solution processed Cs3Bi2I9 and CsBi3I10 thin films via a solvent vapor annealing step. They found that the Cs3Bi2I9 film has a wider bandgap (2.08 eV) than the CsBi3I10 one (1.8 eV), but it is more stable under annealing conditions. The Cs3Bi2I9 film achieved a PCE as high as 1.26% for the resulting device. For comparison, the CsBi3I10 based PvSC exhibits only poor efficiency.76 Hence, we believe that there are still many problems to be solved when CsBi3I10 is employed as a light absorber in PvSCs.
The layered polymorph of Cs3Bi2Br9 was studied by Melot and coworkers experimentally and via DFT. The structure of this compound is a corrugated layer of corner sharing BiBr63− octahedra. An exciton binding energy of 940 meV is found, substantially higher than values found in other halide perovskite derivatives and closer to values seen in alkali halide crystals. This indicates a strongly localized exciton character and it is also the cause of a highly structured emission. Such a large exciton binding energy, coupled to a large band gap of 2.64 eV, is of course detrimental for a photovoltaic material and the compound requires further compositional engineering to be applied in this regard.77 Single crystals of MA3Bi2Br9 have been studied by Leng et al. and the compound displayed a trigonal symmetry (Pm1 space group), characterized by metal halide octahedral layers (Fig. 9a). MA3Bi2Br9 has a direct bandgap of 2.5 eV and a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) up to 12% when the material is in the form of quantum dots (λem max = 430 nm).78 FA3Bi2Br9 quantum dots also exhibit a bright blue emission at 437 nm with a high PLQY of 52%.79

Four more organic–inorganic bismuth halide perovskite derivatives were also synthesized through a solvothermal method (see Fig. 9b for details of the crystal structures). Halogens appear to change configurations in these bismuth halide derivatives. For example, (TMP)[Bi2I5] (with TMP indicating the di-cationic molecule tetramethylpiperazine) with one single halide species shows a 1D chain structure, while (TMP)1.5[Bi2I7Cl2], with mixed halogens (I and Cl) is a rare case of a 2D structure. This compound is a potential light harvesting material because of the band gap of 2.10 eV, promising photoconductivity and high stability under prolonged exposure to humid air or light.80
The properties of bismuth halide based perovskite derivatives can be partially regulated through halogen doping. MA3Bi2I9 has been doped with Cl− and a series of MA3Bi2I9−xClx films were prepared. The mixed anion MA3BiI5.22Cl3.78 employed as an absorption layer also provided a maximum PCE of 0.18%, with a high FF of almost 60% and excellent long term stability of more than 700 days for devices stored in an inert atmosphere.81 In addition, the PCE of MA3Bi2I9−xClx was found to rise with the increase of Cl− doping content.82 The low-pressure VASP method was applied to obtain MA3Bi2I9−2xSx perovskite films. The sulfur incorporated in the perovskite derivative films leads to a reduced bandgap of 1.67 eV and a compact morphology. The optimal PCE for the PvSC based on this species reaches 0.152%.83 We have also carried out some innovative studies on the Cs3Bi2I9 system.84 Cs3Bi2I9−xBrx was prepared by doping Cs3Bi2I9 with bromide. By systematically comparing the crystal structure, the band structure and absorbance of the Cs3Bi2I9−xBrx materials (Fig. 10), we found that Cs3Bi2I6Br3 is the compound with the lowest bandgap (2.03 eV, with that of Cs3Bi2I9 being 2.20 eV). More importantly, a novel phase transition from space group P63/mmc to Pm due to the alloying of three bromide atoms was first discovered. Simultaneously, a champion device with PCE of 1.15% was obtained with Cs3Bi2I6Br3 as the light absorbing layer.

It is widely accepted that defects in A3B2X9 are responsible for low device PCE. In a relevant solid-state physics study, Pal and coworkers introduced the scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) method to understand the nature of defects in bismuth trihalide perovskite derivative material systems. The bandgap of Cs3Bi2I9 prepared with the BiI3-rich precursor decreases from 2.01 eV employing the exact stoichiometric ratio to 1.81 eV, due to the formation of mid-gap deep defects, as evidenced by such STS studies.85 Hence, it is promising that the device PCE can be further improved by passivating these defects.
Another 1D chain-like structure, (H3NC6H12NH3)BiI5 (HDABiI5), was synthesized from a non-toxic trivalent bismuth iodide and thermally stable 1,6-hexane diammonium groups. HDABiI5 shows better thermal stability than lead-based perovskites (up to 200 °C), although still providing a very low PCE in PvSCs, due to the relatively large band gap.21
Similar 1D chain-like organic–inorganic iodobismuthates, namely C5H6NBiI4 ([py][BiI4]) (py: pyridinium) and C6H8NBiI4 ([mepy][BiI4]) (mepy: methylpyridinium), have been prepared by Sun et al. The organic moieties, constituted of protonated aromatic heterocycles, ensure charge carrier transport in [py][BiI4] and [mepy][BiI4]. These compounds have band gaps of 1.78 eV and 2.38 eV, respectively. The efficiency of an HTL-free PvSC approached 0.9%, which is a good result for bismuth halide based perovskite derivative photovoltaic materials (Fig. 9c and d).23 Additionally, a series of 1D chain-like Sb/Bi halide based organic–inorganic hybrid alloys of formula [4ApyH]SbxBi1−xIyBr4−y, where 4ApyH stands for the 4-aminopyridine cation, were synthesized. Among these systems [4ApyH]Sb0.8Bi0.2I4 and [4ApyH]SbI4 provided detectable light to electricity conversion efficiencies of 0.29% and 0.30%, respectively.86 Finally, a dense and pinhole-free (C6H5NH3)BiI4 film was fabricated using an eco-friendly gas pump treatment technique by Yang and coworkers. The material can tolerate continuous moisture exposure for 334 days in ambient air, without significant degradation.87


4.1.2 Photovoltaic devices based on double perovskite structures. 
A2BIBIIIX6 perovskites are characterized as a 3D structure with two kinds of B cation (BI and BIII) dominated octahedral cells, which are adjacent to each other in the cubic phase. These A2BIBIIIX6 double perovskites usually show a high tolerance to defects, due to the strong ionic nature of the basic constituents. On the other hand, they unfortunately have large bandgaps compared to the lead-based reference, which limits the amount of light they can absorb from the solar spectra, coupled to high exciton binding energies. The performances of bismuth halide based double perovskite PvSCs reported until now are summarized in Table 2.

Due to the large bandgap, reports on double perovskite solar cells are rather limited, but their promising optoelectronic properties make us optimistic of their future and fruitful implementation in photovoltaics. Reports disclosing the optoelectronic properties of halide double perovskites of formula A2BIBIIIX6 demonstrate the excellent features of these materials, similar to those of their 3D APbX3 counterparts. Bi3+ is the most commonly used trivalent cation in double perovskites, because it has the same isoelectronic configuration as Pb2+ (6s26p0) as mentioned above, and its toxicity is significantly reduced. For the B site, Ag+, K+, Na+, In+ and Tl+ are the main monovalent cations that have been used so far, making them suitable for octahedral coordination.
The main breakthroughs obtained with double perovskite absorbers in PvSCs are summarized in the following lines. A low-pressure assisted solution method was used to prepare high-quality Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite for the first time. Excitingly, a device based on such a lead-free absorber showed excellent thermal and environmental stability without any encapsulation. An annealing temperature of 250 °C is required to achieve full conversion of the precursors to Cs2AgBiBr6. The corresponding planar heterojunction device based on Cs2AgBiBr6 reached an optimal PCE value of 1.44%.88 Another reported photovoltaic device exhibited a PCE close to 2.5%, with Jsc of 3.93 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.98 V, and FF of 0.63 (Fig. 11a and b). Furthermore, compared to MAPbI3, the light soaking test result shows high stability in an ambient environment, and no detectable PCE degradation was found after 25 days.89 A uniform Cs2AgBiBr6 thin film fabricated by a simple one-step spin coating method enabled high performance planar PvSCs featuring long electron–hole diffusion lengths (more than 100 nm). An average PCE over 1% was achieved by employing a planar TiO2 ETL.90 Pantaler et al. also reported hysteresis-free mesoporous double PvSCs based on the Cs2AgBiBr6 absorber. A maximal PCE of 1.26% was recorded using PTAA as the HTL material.91

New ideas have been developed to improve the performance of double perovskite-based devices. Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films were prepared through a sequential vapor deposition procedure (Fig. 11c). The obtained films exhibited large grain sizes and uniform, smooth surface properties. The solar cells with a planar structure showed a PCE of 1.37% and excellent stability under standard environmental conditions (Fig. 11d).92 High quality Cs2AgBiBr6 film was further realized via an anti-solvent quenching process, followed by an annealing step. An inverted planar heterojunction PvSC based on this film exhibits a PCE of 2.23%.93 Recently, a multifunctional N719 dye interlayer was introduced in Cs2AgBiBr6 PvSCs for improving the PCEs and stability.94 The device showed a PCE of 2.84%, which was the highest value reported for Cs2AgBiBr6 PvSCs so far. Moreover, a new lead-free double perovskite material of formula Cs2NaBiI6 was synthesized and applied in PvSCs. A narrow band gap of 1.66 eV and excellent stability have been found in such a shuttle-like 3D Cs2NaBiI6 material. The Cs2NaBiI6 based PvSCs achieved an optimal PCE of 0.42%.95
Composition engineering has also been performed to decrease the band gap of double perovskite materials. Recently, Tl was added to Cs2AgBiBr6 as an impurity to form opaque black crystals with the formula Cs2(Ag1−aBi1−b)TlxBr6. The content of Tl varied from 0.03% to 0.75%. Tl cations can replace both Ag+ (as Tl+) and Bi3+ (as Tl3+) sites, as evidenced by theoretical and experimental studies. At higher concentrations of Tl, its substitution of Ag+ is preferable. Reflectivity measurements clearly show that the experimental bandgap decreases with an increase of Tl content, with a minimum value of 1.57 eV at x = 0.075. When Tl3+ replaces Bi3+, a new lower energy conduction band with Tl 6s and Ag 4d character is formed, which reduces the band gap energy and leads to an indirect transition, as predicted by DFT. When Tl+ substitutes Ag+, the Tl 6p states together with Br 4p and Bi 6p states form a new conduction band with lower energy that generates a direct transition, as shown in Fig. 11e.96 A similar bandgap engineering of Cs2AgBiBr6 was also carried out by introducing Sb3+via a versatile solution method. The Sb-substitution enables an obvious reduction of bandgap by 0.25 eV.97 In addition, two other hybrid double perovskites, (MA)2TlBiBr6 and (MA)2AgBiBr6 have been synthesized, with interesting optoelectronic properties. Both perovskites were prepared through the hydrothermal method and crystallized in the same cubic space group Fm3m. In agreement with DFT calculations, the direct band gap of (MA)2TlBiBr6 was experimentally found to be 2.16 eV.98 Tl does not change the crystal momentum of the valence and conduction bands, hence maintaining the same strong absorption ability of APbX3 materials. However, (MA)2TlBiBr6 contains Tl, a highly toxic element that may limit its use as a substitute for lead based perovskite materials. On the other hand, similar to Cs2AgBiBr6, (MA)2AgBiBr6 has an indirect band gap of 2.02 eV.99
The indirect character of the electronic transitions of the double perovskites leads to the initially discussed significant drawbacks of these materials, namely the low absorption coefficient and high exciton binding energy. The orbital interaction between monovalent BI and trivalent BIII species in the marginal zone generally involves the movement of the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM), leading to an indirect gap. By band gap engineering, indirect semiconductors can be converted into direct semiconductors by adjusting the relative proportions of the trivalent BIII cations.100
Other main disadvantages of the double perovskites seem to be related to the difficulties in employing solution-processing to fabricate highly crystalline films. More systematic studies are required to fabricate dense films. It is well-known that thermal evaporation under vacuum conditions is a good choice compared to spin coating. Powder or single crystals of the double perovskite compound synthesized by the hydrothermal method can be used as the starting material.
Recently, our group successfully produced large-area, single-crystalline Cs2AgBiBr6 films by use of the so-called capillary-assisted dip-coating method.101 The fabrication process of highly oriented Cs2AgBiBr6 films is shown in Fig. 12a, and this method can be applied to various substrates. The thus obtained optimized films are nearly single crystalline, as verified by φ-scan XRD (Fig. 12c and d). The substrate lifting speed is responsible for the final crystal growth habit of the films (Fig. 12e–g). By changing the substrate growth temperature, the bandgap of the thin films can be tuned from 2.65 to 2.25 eV. By DFT calculations, it was further highlighted that the band structure of these films displayed a typical n-type characteristic. Our results show that the deep defects derived from Cs interstitials and Br vacancies fix the Fermi level there. This method offers new directions for the preparation of double perovskite thin films, which may bring a step-change in overall device performances.

According to the synthetic conditions used, Cs3Sb2I9 can form different solid-state structures. When prepared from solution, Cs3Sb2I9 prefers to form a 0D structure with isolated dimers of face sharing octahedra (P63/mmc). The formation of 2D layered structures takes place during solid or gas reactions (space group Pm1). Cs3Sb2I9 thin film preparations and characterizations were first reported in 2015, together with the first solar cell employing this compound as the light absorber. Cs3Sb2I9 thin film prepared via a two-step deposition method has a red colored layered structure, differently from the orange color of 0D Cs3Sb2I9. The bandgap of the 2D Cs3Sb2I9 thin film was determined to be 2.05 eV, with an absorption coefficient of 105 cm−1 and an ionization potential of 5.6 eV, as reported by Saparov et al.10 The stability of the thin films in ambient air is better than that of MAPbI3 films. Due to nonradiative recombination caused by deep defects, the device PCE of Cs3Sb2I9-based PvSCs is very low (below 1%) and the Voc is between 0.25 and 0.3 V. The 0D Cs3Sb2I9 structure with a band gap of 2.0 eV was also applied in planar PvSCs. When HI was employed as an additive, the devices showed a champion PCE of 0.84%, with a Voc of 0.60 V.103 Correa-Baena et al. reported that the 0D Cs3Sb2I9 is an indirect bandgap semiconductor with a large exciton binding energy, which explained the low photocurrent and PCE.29 A layered polymorph and a dimeric form of Cs3Sb2I9 were prepared via vapor-assisted solution processing. The measured exciton lifetime and binding energy for the layered Cs3Sb2I9 were found to be 6 ns and 100 meV, respectively. The layered and the dimeric Cs3Sb2I9 forms used in PvSCs achieved device PCEs of 1.5 and 0.89%, respectively.104 Meanwhile, Zhou et al. also prepared high-quality films composed of layered phase MA3Sb2ClxI9−x by adding methylammonium chloride into the precursor solutions.105
As mentioned above, Cs3Sb2I9 films prepared through solution processing are more inclined to organize in the dimeric form. To solve this problem, we have also carried out pioneering investigations in the area.106 Hydrochloric acid (HCl) as an additive was introduced into the precursor solution. In this way, chloride acted as an inhibitor in the reaction, slowing down the formation of the Sb–I–Sb bond. Hence, a layered Cs3Sb2I9 film was developed from an intermediate coordinated phase using this HCl-assisted strategy (Fig. 13a). From a series of characterizations, the bandgap of the layered compound was found to be 2.05 eV, smaller than that of the dimeric one, 2.47 eV (Fig. 13b). The all inorganic layered Cs3Sb2I9 device showed a top PCE value of 1.21%, while the dimer-based device only acquired a PCE of 0.43% (Fig. 13c). The PCE improvement in the layered Cs3Sb2I9 thin films is due to lower trap density, doubled carrier mobility and improved junction quality, as determined by space-charge-limited-current measurements (Fig. 13d and e). Through the addition of HCl, the problem of facile formation of the dimeric form by the solution method can be effectively solved. We believe that this novel method will greatly promote the fast progress of Cs3Sb2I9-based lead-free PvSCs.

In addition to our HCl-assisted method, the introduction of alkalis can also regulate the electronic structure of the Cs3Sb2I9 film. A lot of work in this respect has been done. Harikesh et al. found that this compound can easily form layered structures via solution methods when Cs is replaced by Rb (Fig. 14a). With the help of DFT, they compared the formation energies of the dimeric and layered forms of A3Sb2I9 with A = Cs and Rb. Compared to the ionic radius of Cs (1.88 Å), that of Rb (1.72 Å) is smaller and therefore Rb3Sb2I9 is more prone to feature the layered phase. In addition, Rb3Sb2I9 has better heat resistance compared to the analogous Cs compound, a favorable property for an efficient solar cell operation. Unfortunately, the Rb3Sb2I9 semiconductor has an indirect bandgap of 2.1 eV, and PvSCs based on it employing poly-TPD as the HTL were found to provide poor figure of merit, namely, a Jsc of 2.11 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.55 V and PCE of only 0.66%.107 A3Sb2I9 thin film in which the A site cation was Cs, Rb, and K was prepared by solution-processing to be used for photovoltaics. The A-site cation has a significant effect on the structural and optoelectronic properties of these thin films. The large exciton binding and carrier effective masses of A3Sb2I9 give rise to low photocurrents. A maximum PCE of 0.76% was recorded when Rb3Sb2I9 was employed as the absorber.29 Weber et al. found that the crystalline lattice does not change when the smaller bromide is used to substitute iodide. On the other hand, the absorption onset appears blue shifted, with the band gap rising from 2.02 to 2.46 eV. In this work, solar cells based on the Rb3Sb2I9 absorber displayed a PCE of 1.37%, the top efficiency recorded for an Rb3Sb2I9 based PvSC.108

Unlike the inorganic A3Sb2I9, which often forms two different structures (the layered and dimeric ones), when an organic cation such as MA+ is used, the antimony halide based perovskite derivatives of formula MA3Sb2I9 only form a 0D dimeric structure, with MA+ cations surrounded by octahedral anionic metal halide units (Sb2I9)3−. Hebig et al. first reported MA3Sb2I9 as an absorber material in PvSCs. MA3Sb2I9 has an optical band gap of 2.14 eV and an absorption coefficient α ≈ 105 cm−1. Experiments indicate the presence of a large energetic disorder in MA3Sb2I9 film. Furthermore, due to the low photocurrent, the device achieved a PCE of only 0.5%.32 The single step method was used to prepare MA3Sb2I9 films through solution processing. It is worth noting that HI as an additive may improve the quality of antimony halide based perovskite derivative film. The molar ratios of precursors and the concentration of HI were optimized, to reach a PCE of 2.04% on a planar architecture device.103 The fabricated MA3Sb2I9 PvSC prepared by the two-step procedure also shows good performance with a remarkable Voc of 740 mV.109 MA3Sb2I9 surface morphology significantly influences the recorded PCE. Recently, large grain MA3Sb2I9 crystals were prepared by inserting a hydrophobic scaffold, such as perylene and pyrene, into the precursor solution (Fig. 14b). Films with improved quality and decreased number of voids were obtained. Using these films as absorbers, a record efficiency of 2.77% was obtained (Fig. 14c).110 Dai et al. produced high-quality two-dimensional MA3Sb2I9−xClx film by introducing bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium (LiTFSI) to control the dimensional transformation. By this method, antimony halide based PvSCs further achieved a PCE of 3.34%, which is the highest recorded PCE for pure antimony halide based PvSCs.111
Currently, some efforts have been made to reduce the band gap of MA3Sb2I9 through elemental doping or replacing the cation or anion. Pal et al. reported the lowered optical bandgap of MA3Sb2I9 from 2 eV to 1.55 eV by introducing Sn4+ in the MA3Sb2I9 structure. In addition, the conduction band edge of the perovskite gradually shifts towards the n-type, due to the hetero-valence substitution in MA3Sb2I9. With an increase in the tin content, STS and density of state spectra indicate that the type of electronic conductivity can be tuned from p-type to n-type. However, the decrease of bandgap is at the expense of an increased surface roughness for the films. The tin content was optimized to find a trade-off between low bandgap and surface roughness of the thin films. In this way, a planar heterojunction PvSC achieved an excellent Jsc of 8.32 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 2.69%.112 By doping sulfur in that system, MASbSI2 was fabricated for the first time as a light harvester for photovoltaic application.113 The MASbSI2 compound was prepared by a sequential reaction involving chemical bath deposition of Sb2S3, then multiple cycles of spin coating of SbI3 and MAI and finally thermal annealing in an argon atmosphere (Fig. 14d). The MASbSI2 based device shows an optimal PCE of 3.08% (Fig. 14e).114 New perovskite derivative materials of formula (NH4)3Sb2IxBr9−x (0 < x < 9) were also developed. The light absorption edge of these materials can vary from 558 to 453 nm. A single crystal of (NH4)3Sb2IxBr9−x has a hole mobility of 4.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobility of 12.3 cm2 V−1 s−1. A high Voc of 1.03 V and a PCE of 0.51% were obtained for the (NH4)3Sb2IxBr9−x PvSC.115
Antimony halide based double perovskite materials are a viable platform for the development of lead-free PvSCs and for this reason have attracted a significant attention for the past five years. Sb partial substitution has also been explored, as in the case of a layered perovskite of formula Cs4CuSb2Cl12, where one Sb3+ ion was substituted with Cu2+. The material has a direct bandgap of 1.0 eV and a high photo- and thermal-stability.116 Karmakar et al. also reported Cu2+ doped Cs2SbAgCl6, showing a decreased optical indirect bandgap from 2.6 eV to 1.0 eV. The Cu-doped material exhibited long term structural and photophysical stability up to one year, when it was maintained under thermal and moisture stress conditions.33 Based on the principles of increased electronic dimensionality, by inserting [MIIX6] octahedral layers into Cs3Sb2X9, a layered double perovskite family of Cs3+nM(II)nSb2X9+3n (M = Sn, Ge) can be designed. Compared to Cs3Sb2X9, the double perovskites have smaller bandgaps and smaller carrier effective masses. These parameters can be tuned by inserting octahedral layers of different thicknesses.34 Recently, the FA4GeSbCl12 double perovskite has also been demonstrated to be a stable and efficient semiconductor with a direct bandgap of 1.3 eV. FA4GeSbCl12 based PvSCs were prepared to achieve PCE up to 4.7%, without the use of any additive.117
4.3 Photovoltaic devices based on rudorffite structures
3D materials are more favorable for photovoltaic applications than 2D species, in view of the lower bandgaps, smaller exciton binding energies and longer exciton diffusion lengths. Silver iodobismuthate compounds have been investigated as lead-free semiconductors in PvSCs in recent years.118 Sargent and coworkers reported a new solution-processed material of formula AgBi2I7. AgBi2I7 has a cubic structure, which introduces monovalent silver cations into an iodobismuthate structure. The thin films have a dense and pinhole-free surface morphology and a bandgap of 1.87 eV. In PvSCs, this material allows reaching a PCE of 1.22% and excellent environmental stability.119 Ag–Bi–I rudorffites are indeed promising non-toxic photovoltaic materials and for this reason have been investigated.120 When Ag3BiI6 was used as the light absorber, the resulting solar cell provided a top PCE of 4.3%.28 The optoelectronic properties of AgaBibIa+3b have been further tuned by partial substitution with disulfide anions. AgaBibIa+3b was modified with sulfur, reducing the bandgap by 0.1 eV and upshifting the valence band edge by 0.1–0.3 eV (Fig. 14f). The resulting solar cells exhibited a PCE of 5.51% and good stability under ambient conditions for over 1 month (Fig. 14g).121 Ag2BiI5 PvSCs with PCE above 2.5% were also fabricated in air by a dynamic hot casting technique.122
A copper bismuth iodide (CuBiI4) was prepared via a solution method. The material has a wide bandgap of 2.67 eV and its PvSC provides a low PCE of 0.82%, but shows excellent long-term stability when maintained for over 40 days under ambient conditions.123 Zhang reported a highly facile route for the in situ production of CuBiI4 with a favorable band gap of 1.81 eV. Its PvSC displayed good photovoltaic performance with a top PCE of 1.119%.124 Device performance parameters for the light absorbers discussed in this paragraph are summarized in Table 4.

5. Conclusions and outlook
In this review, we have summarized the structures, theoretical prediction, preparation methods and photovoltaic performances of several lead-free group VA metal (Bi and Sb) halide based perovskites and their derivatives, especially A3B2X9, rudorffite and double perovskites.
As for A3B2X9 halide, it is worthy to remind here that the photovoltaic performance is closely related to the chameleonic structural and electronic dimensions. 0-D dimeric species or vacancy-ordered perovskite derivatives (2D) are generally unfavorable for optoelectronic applications. Their exciton binding energies are indeed relatively large and exciton diffusion lengths are short. Some new materials may have great potential to solve these problems. For example, compounds like 2D Rb3Sb2I9 and Cs3BiI6Br3 can undergo an increase in lattice dimension via a strategic compositional engineering, generally a doping of the anion or cation sites. Hence, we believe that the development of new active species of this kind by employing different ion doping strategies is a rational choice to attempt the improvement of A3B2X9-type material based photovoltaic performances.
Another strategy to promote progress in this direction is through the improvement of the quality of the thin films based on these species. Bismuth halide based compounds crystallize directly and rapidly into a textured polycrystalline microstructure. New preparation methods need to be developed or more widely implemented to exert a tight control on the crystallization process, for example those like two-step solution processing, thermal evaporation, dip-coating and vapor assisted solution processing methods, to cite a few. All of these deposition methods have been shown to have potential to form denser films compared to the traditional one-step solution processing.
Rudorffite structures are considered competitive candidates to lead halide based perovskites for the realization of well-performing photovoltaic devices. However, as an excess of defects introduced during thin films processing makes the photoelectric performance weak, they still have difficulties in competing with the classical perovskite structures.
As for the case of the double perovskites, we can state that the large, indirect bandgaps of the currently fabricated Ag–Bi halide based materials are the cause of their limited photovoltaic performance. The alloying/doping can help in reducing the optical band gap. The synthesized Cs2TlBiBr6 compound has a similar energy band structure to that of lead-based perovskites, but its application is limited by the high toxicity of Tl. A new double perovskite of formula FA4GeSbCl12 has a smaller bandgap of 1.3 eV. Hence, it is necessary to further explore other double perovskite structures or to apply complex compositional engineering strategies in the search for species with energy band structures similar to those of lead-based materials. This field is undoubtedly very challenging and wide open to new exciting discoveries.
Generally, research on group VA-based lead-free perovskites and derivatives has witnessed good achievements in some aspects, but mechanisms of film formation, charge separation and recombination at interfaces and grain boundaries need to be studied more deeply, especially for gaining more information on the defect nature, in comparison with the lead-based counterparts, for which scientists have now gained a high level of understanding of these aspects. Therefore, further research should focus on developing new group VA metal-based materials with suitable bandgaps and benign defect characteristics. At the same time, the investigation of novel film fabrication strategies needs to be boosted, to obtain high quality light absorbing films and to improve the quality of the interfaces with the charge extracting ancillary layers (ETL and HTL). We believe that, if these investigations will be systematically implemented, a fast and significant improvement of the photovoltaic performances will be achieved employing the new group VA metal-based compounds in PvSC light harvesting systems.
