    , Accepted 2nd April 2009First published on 6th May 2009AbstractAn inverted polymer solar cell geometry comprising a total of five layers was optimized using laboratory scale cells and the operational stability was studied under model atmospheres. The device geometry was substrate-ITO-ZnO-(active layer)-PEDOT:PSS-silver with P3HT-PCBM as the active layer. The inverted devices were compared to model devices with a normal geometry where the order of the layers was substrate-ITO-PEDOT:PSS-(active layer)-aluminium. In both cases illumination was through the substrate which requires that it is transparent. Both device types were optimized to a power conversion efficiency of 2.7% (1000 W m−2, AM1.5G, 72 ± 2 °C). The devices were operated under illumination while being subjected to different atmospheres to identify the dominant modes of degradation. Dry nitrogen (99.999%), dry oxygen (99.5%), humid nitrogen (90 ± 5% relative humidity) and ambient atmosphere (20% oxygen, 20 ± 5% relative humidity) were employed and both device types were found to be stable in a nitrogen atmosphere during the test period of 200 hours. The devices with a normal geometry where an aluminium electrode is employed gave stable operation in dry oxygen but did not give stable device operation in the presence of humidity. The inverted devices behaved oppositely where the less reactive silver electrode gave stable operation in the presence of humidity but poor stability in the presence of oxygen. The inverted model device was then used to develop a new process giving access to fully roll-to-roll (R2R) processed polymer solar cells entirely by solution processing starting from a polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) substrate with a layer of indium-tin-oxide (ITO). All processing was performed in air without vacuum coating steps and modules comprising eight serially connected cells gave power conversion efficiencies as high as 2.1% for the full module with 120 cm2 active area (AM1.5G, 393 W m−2) and up to 2.3% for modules with 4.8 cm2 active area (AM1.5G, 1000 W m−2).
Introduction
The polymer solar cell1–5 relies on a thin active layer sandwiched between two electrodes where at least one of them is transparent or semitransparent allowing light to access the active area. In the best performing devices charge carriers are formed throughout the bulk of the active layer and the directional flow of oppositely charged carriers is granted through judicious choice of electrodes that selectively allows for transport of the preferred carrier. The state-of-the-art is well represented by a mixture of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and [60]PCBM as the active layer.2
The geometry of the typical polymer solar cell device is shown in Fig. 1 as the normal geometry and employs frontface illumination. The choice of the normal geometry is mostly historical and has not been developed rationally but has rather evolved from the contemporary understanding and the means available. Traditionally devices have been prepared on glass substrates with ITO as the transparent conductor and later developments include transparent hole transporting layers that operate well with ITO as the anode. As a consequence the electron accepting electrode was typically a metal with a low work function (e.g. aluminium or calcium) that has sometimes been employed in conjunction with an electron transporting layer (or tunnel barrier) such as LiF.6 In order to form a good contact between the active layer and a low work function metal this type of electrode has been prepared exclusively using physical vapour deposition techniques (i.e. by evaporating the metal onto the active layer). The realisation of the normal geometry has been refined and high performing devices can be prepared. In the context of operational stability4 and large scale solution processing5 without vacuum coating steps the normal geometry is far from ideal and other device geometries are worth pursuing. Some of the different possibilities are outlined in Fig. 1. The construction of the multilayered polymer solar cell structure is assumed to start with the substrate and one has a choice of whether light should be entering the active layer of the device through the substrate (i.e. through the substrate and all the layers processed before the active layer is applied) or whether light should enter the active layer through the back electrode (i.e. through all the layers processed after the active layer is applied). It should be emphasized that there might be other possibilities of device fabrication where a part of or the entire solar cell structure is transferred after the multilayer structure (or part of it) has been prepared. There are however no reported examples of this approach. The traditional manner in which polymer solar cell devices are prepared has introduced severe limitations and it would seem that a typical laboratory report would have great difficulty in finding new approaches that differ significantly from ITO on rigid glass, evaporated electrodes and spincoating. There have been a few recent reports that deviate convincingly from the traditional methods with success in both achieving a similar performance7 and even alleviating the use of ITO.8,9 ITO is currently viewed as a material that has proven useful for the development of polymer and organic solar cells while it does not share a commercially viable future with polymer solar cells. One of the unmet challenges that has limited the possibilities that have been explored is that there are very few available transparent conductors. Aside from using a material that is inherently transparent in the visible region (e.g. ITO, AZO) composite electrodes have been developed where a non-transparent metallic grid is used in conjunction with semitransparent electrode material9 that will not allow for efficient charge collection on its own (e.g. a silver grid used in conjunction with PEDOT:PSS). The inverted geometry has been explored with success in two generically different instances. The most explored is the one that falls closest to the normal geometry where frontface illumination and ITO substrates are still used but the flow of charge has been inverted by addition of a selective electron transport layer on top of ITO. This allows for collecting holes at the back electrode and from an operational point of view more stable devices can be prepared because no reactive electrode materials need to be involved. The second approach, known as the “ITO free wrap through” approach, was reported by Zimmermann et al.8 This truly novel approach avoids the use of both ITO and any metal back electrode. It would be classified as an inverted geometry that employs backside illumination according to Fig. 1. The purpose of all these developments is to establish a process that allows for transfer of the laboratory polymer solar cells to a large scale processed industrial polymer solar cell product and this has proven far easier said then done. There are few examples of preparation of large area polymer solar cells10 and even fewer examples of polymer solar cells produced on a reasonable scale (i.e. more than 100 individual devices and more than a square metre of active area).11
 Fig. 1  An illustration of the four possible device geometries for multilayer polymer solar cells assuming charge transport in a direction perpendicular to the substrate surface. Frontface illumination requires that the substrate is transparent whereas backside illumination does not forcibly require this. Illumination is assumed to take place from one preferred side. Bifacial illumination is possible and requires transparency of both electrodes (not shown in this diagram). The hole flow is in a direction opposite to the electron flow. 
In this report we demonstrate the development of an inverted device that for laboratory devices is brought to the same level of performance as devices in a normal geometry. We subsequently demonstrate how some of the problems with operational stability for the devices with a normal geometry can be solved through stability studies using model atmospheres. We finally transfer the process to a full R2R process entirely using solution processing on a flexible plastic substrate using slot-die coating and screen printing. We obtain a performance for the R2R processed modules that is acceptably close to the performance obtained for the laboratory cells in terms of both power conversion efficiency and operational stability.
Results and discussion
The device types explored in this work are illustrated in Fig. 2. The normal device geometry comprises four layers on the substrate where the inverted device type has five layers to enable selective transport of electrons to ITO and holes to the metal electrode.
 Fig. 2  The Normal geometry employed for the model devices (left) comprise spincoated PEDOT:PSS and P3HT-PCBM layers and evaporated aluminium. The inverted geometry employed for both model devices and fully R2R coated modules (right). The model devices employed spincoated ZnO, P3HT-PCBM and PEDOT:PSS and evaporated silver whereas the fully R2R coated modules employed slot-die coated ZnO, P3HT-PCBM and PEDOT:PSS with the silver electrode being applied using screen printing (slot-die coating would also have been possible). 
The use of the inverted geometry enables the use of silver as the hole collecting electrode. While the work function of silver is similar to that of aluminium and does not qualify as a metal with a high work function the advantage of using silver as the metal electrode is that printable silver formulations are commercially available making solution processing of the silver electrode a possibility. The power conversion efficiency that can be reached for devices based on P3HT and PCBM has been reported in the range of 3.5–5%.12 The short circuit current density (Isc) that can be reached is practically limited to be around 11 mA cm−2 and the open circuit voltage (Voc) obtained with an aluminium cathode is in the range of 0.5–0.6 V (the use of LiF or calcium may improve this number slightly).
The remaining possibility for improving performance is through maximizing the fill factor. High fill factors in excess of 60% are possible and naturally yield high performance. These high fill factors are however difficult to achieve when employing large area devices and poorly conducting contacts. In order to make a fair comparison we prepared model devices with an active area of 1 cm2 and dimensions expected to approach those of an upscaled version of the final device on flexible substrates. The reference devices in the normal geometry gave the expected short circuit current and open circuit voltage. The power conversion efficiency was 2.7%. The fill factor was up to 52% which is lower than commonly observed for high performing devices and we ascribe this to the thick active layer in the device (due to the high concentrations of the compounds used in the active blend). The inverted device was optimized to perform as well as the device with normal geometry when employing an evaporated aluminium electrode. IV-curves for devices with the normal and inverted geometry are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1.

 Fig. 3  A comparison of IV-curves for devices with a normal geometry (glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT-PCBM/aluminium) and an inverted geometry (glass/ITO/ZnO/P3HT-PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/silver). Both devices were prepared by spincoating the layers and evaporating the back electrodes. 
The next step was to develop an R2R compatible process for preparing the inverted devices employing solution processed silver electrodes on flexible substrates. A previous study demonstrating production of several thousand polymer solar cell modules prepared entirely by screen printing techniques11 presented a well established process for patterning the ITO. This involves the screen printing and UV-hardening an etch resist on an ITO-covered PET material in a full R2R process followed by etching using aqueous copper chloride, stripping the etch resist using sodium hydroxide, washing the substrate using demineralised water and drying in a full R2R process (shown as steps 1 and 2 in Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  An illustration of the process and the six different processing steps employed during fabrication of the R2R coated modules. 
The next challenge was to coat the zinc oxide in an R2R process and this was achieved by development of an ink for slot-die coating that is stable in the atmosphere until the layer has been dried.11,13,14 Slot-die coating proceeded smoothly by employing a modified slot-die coating technique described earlier.14 The ITO pattern is shown in Fig. 5 and the ZnO was coated as 9 mm wide stripes coated on top of the ITO with an offset of 1 mm to the right (as shown in Fig. 5) to allow for contact between the printed silver and the ITO in the serial connection. The active layer was subsequently coated on top of the ITO–ZnO again with an offset of 1 mm to the right with respect to the ZnO. Coating of the P3HT:PCBM mixture proceeded smoothly with good wetting behaviour. Finally the PEDOT:PSS layer was slot-die coated on top of the active layer offset by 1 mm to the right to avoid contact with ITO and ZnO. The wetting of P3HT:PCBM by PEDOT:PSS is not very good and the use of corona treatment is not possible since this destroys the surface of the active layer and thereby device function is impaired. To solve this problem it was useful to mix isopropanol into the PEDOT:PSS and also wet the active layer with isopropanol immediately before the slot-die coating head. Coating proceeded smoothly in this manner. These coating steps are shown in Fig. 4 as steps 3, 4 and 5.
 Fig. 5  An illustration of the pattern employed for the R2R processed cells. The ITO pattern is shown (top left). The ZnO, active layer and PEDOT:PSS layers had the same outline but were continuous lines running along the substrate since they were slot-die coated. The silver pattern was screen printed as shown (top right) with a grid pattern over the active area having an aperture loss of 20% (middle). An exploded side view is shown (bottom left) along with a schematic of a one stripe cell emphasizing the overlap of the different layers and their juxtaposition (bottom right). 
To complete the device the silver back electrode was screen printed on top of the active layer in step 6 as shown in Fig. 4. The overlap between the silver grid lines and the ITO is nominally 6 mm giving an active area for a 25 cm long stripe of 15 cm2. While printing of the final silver electrode could easily have been performed in a full R2R process it was performed in-house on a manual screen printer after having cut the continuous roll into sheets. This was done to minimize the time between coating the PEDOT:PSS layer and completing the device.
After having dried the silver electrode the 1, 2, 3 and 8 stripe modules were cut into individual modules and either characterised without encapsulation or after back lamination with a simple PET foil using an acrylic adhesive suitable for cold lamination.
The performance of the individual lines was quite close to the model device in terms of voltage and current while the fill factor was quite poor as shown in Fig. 6. The data have been summarized in Table 2. The serial connection of the cells was additive in terms of voltage as expected and each stripe gave 0.47–0.50 V and 100–120 mA whether on its own or connected in series (values as high as 160 mA were observed). In terms of performance it was found that the devices were limited by extraction problems when operating under full sunlight. By decreasing the incident light intensity higher performances were reached and a PCE of more than 2% on the active area and 1% on the module was achieved as shown in Fig. 7. This is still significantly below the performance of the model cells and this was tested by decreasing the active area thus giving a PCE of 2.33% (1000 W m−2, AM1.5G, 72 °C) which is sufficiently close to the model devices to be acceptable (Fig. 7).
Table 2 Typical performance of the modules prepared by slot-die coating as shown in Fig. 5, 6 and 7. The nominal active area of each stripe is 15 cm2. The module performance is also shown corresponding to the total aperture of the printed module including the silver bus. The module areas for the 1, 2, 3 and 8 stripe modules are 57.5, 87.5, 117.5 and 267.5 cm2, respectively. The measurement conditions were 1000 W m−2, AM1.5G, 72 ± 2 °C unless otherwise stated.

 Fig. 6  Typical performance of the individual 1, 2, 3 and 8 stripe modules. The module voltages correspond well to the sum of voltages for the individual cells in the module and the module currents are only slightly affected by the serial connection. The individual modules are shown on the photograph from the backside. The measurement conditions were 1000 W m−2, AM1.5G, 72 ± 2 °C. 
 Fig. 7  
IV-curves for a full 8 stripe module with a nominal active area of 120 cm2 as a function of incident light intensity (top left) and for an 8 stripe module with a length of 1 cm giving a nominal active area of 4.8 cm2 (top right). The device is also responsive to light entering the device through the printed silver grid back electrode albeit with lower performance due to the aperture loss from the grid and transmission loss in the PEDOT:PSS (top right). A photograph of the 8 stripe module from the back electrode highlighting the printed silver grid is also shown (bottom). Data are shown in Table 2. 
The use of the silver grid served several purposes. Firstly it reduces the amount of silver needed and secondly it made the devices more flexible with less delamination problems. A third aspect was that the modules became bifacial and thus responding to illumination from both sides. The backface illumination was less efficient than frontface illumination by a factor of around 5. The module efficiency for an 8 stripe serially connected module with a length of 1 cm (nominal active area = 4.8 cm2) was, as mentioned above, 2.33% with frontface illumination and only 0.43% with backface illumination and performance decreased in terms of a lower voltage and current while the fill factor increased to 49%. While it is most likely that the reduced performance is due to the thick PEDOT:PSS layer one factor which may contribute to the higher fill factor is the photoconductivity of PEDOT:PSS which is illuminated directly when illuminated from the back. For the current devices the thick PEDOT:PSS layer was required for successful device function. It would be a simple matter to reduce the PEDOT:PSS thickness and thus increase transmission of light when illuminating from the backside. Thin PEDOT:PSS layers however led to short circuit which we ascribe to solvent in the silver paste destroying the active layer. A thick PEDOT:PSS layer solved this problem but naturally led to poor transmission from the backside.
In terms of operational stability4 the electron-collecting electrode is problematic because this implies that the electron carriers travel at high energy levels (LUMO). This is incompatible with operation in the presence of molecular oxygen and water molecules. The hole carriers do not have the same problems associated with transport in the presence of water molecules and molecular oxygen. It should thus in principle be possible to gain stability through an inverted device geometry towards both oxygen and water and to establish this model studies were performed using different atmospheres. The general view of stability of polymer and organic solar cells is that they are an inherently unstable technology with many different degradation processes contributing to the overall decay of the device during operation and in the dark.4 There are methods to identify and remove (or reduce) the most preponderant mechanisms leaving the less dominant ones. The largest culprits are atmospheric components such as oxygen and water and from the point of view of preparing a functioning device with some level of stability the removal of these by using a suitable barrier material can improve the performance in terms of stability. It is of use to evaluate the stability of the device under four different atmospheric conditions:
1) Nitrogen (water < 1 ppm, oxygen < 1 ppm)
2) Humid nitrogen (water ∼90 ± 5% relative humidity, oxygen < 1 ppm)
3) Oxygen (water < 1 ppm, oxygen ∼100%)
4) Ambient atmosphere (water ∼20 ± 5% relative humidity, oxygen ∼20%)
There are many more conditions that could be tested such as varying light intensity, temperature, mechanical flexing, cyclic testing, etc. For the purpose of getting a picture of the stability of the device towards the major atmospheric reactants the conditions outlined above are efficiently employed. The normal devices degraded as expected in the presence of humidity15 but were quite stable in the presence of molecular oxygen (even in pure oxygen). This has been observed earlier for devices based on a low band gap copolymer of thiophene and thienopyrazine.16 In contrast, devices with a normal geometry based on PPV degrade rapidly in the presence of either water15 or oxygen.17 Humidity (water) reacts efficiently with aluminium at unprotected interfaces leading to rapid degradation as shown in Fig. 8 and as summarized in Table 3.

 Fig. 8  Curves showing the degradation as a function of illumination time under different atmospheric conditions for device models with normal geometry (A) and inverted geometry (B) and R2R processed inverted devices without encapsulation (C) and with simple encapsulation (D). 
In the inverted device this was then expected to be efficiently solved as silver should not react with water at the metal-organic interface. Good operational stability in the presence of humidity was also observed confirming this hypothesis. However, the device presented poor stability towards oxygen. While it is problematic that we did not achieve stability towards both oxygen and humidity simultaneously it is reassuring that it is possible to make devices that are stable in the presence of oxygen (normal geometry) and in the presence of humidity (inverted geometry). This does hold promise for the possibility of developing a materials and device combination that exhibits stability in the presence of both oxygen and humidity.
It is unfortunate that it was not possible to arrive at a situation with stability towards both oxygen and water simultaneously for the system explored here whereas this had been observed earlier albeit for devices with significantly lower performance.13,18 One complication is associated with the fact that suppliers of printable silver formulations understandably do not give full chemical detail of their formulations. This however makes it difficult to ascertain whether the observed instability towards oxygen for the devices prepared with silver paste electrodes is due to degradation in the active layers or whether it is the silver paste formulation that is not stable towards oxygen and illumination. This warrants further study. Simple cold back lamination with PET and an acrylic resin as the binder improved the operational stability significantly as shown in Fig. 8. It is interesting that the inverted devices that are based on zinc oxide work well in the absence of oxygen since this has been shown to be problematic earlier in bulk heterojunctions based on PPVs and metal oxide semiconductors including zinc oxide19 and also for poly-3- carboxydithiophene-ZnO bulk heterojunctions.13,18 From this point of view dependence on the presence of oxygen for device function was expected. It should however be noted that the charge carrier separation processes in these devices are assumed to take place in the bulk of P3HT and PCBM and that zinc oxide in these devices only work as an electron transport layer. We ascribe the indifference of device function with respect to the presence of molecular oxygen to be due to this fact.
Experimental
Materials employed

          Poly(3-hexylthiophene) was prepared according to the McCullough route20 and was purified by extensive Soxhlet extraction procedures employing in turn methanol, acetone, hexane and finally chloroform. The product was precipitated from chloroform using methanol. The procedure was repeated twice giving a material with a regioregularity >97% and Mn = 18700, Mw = 36600, Mp = 33900, PD = 1.9. [60]PCBM was purchased from Solenne BV with a purity of 99%. Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO np) were prepared and stabilised with methoxyethoxyacetic acid (MEA) as described earlier.13 The thermocleavable solvent WS-1 was obtained as described in the literature.21,22PEDOT:PSS was purchased as an aqueous dispersion from Aldrich or as a screen printing paste from Agfa (Orgacon EL-P 5010, http://www.agfa.com). The silver electrode was purchased from Dupont as a screen printing paste (Dupont PV410, http://www.dupont.com). The substrates for the model devices comprised 25 mm × 50 mm ITO covered glass substrates with a nominal sheet resistance of 5–8 Ohm square−1. The flexible substrate was purchased as ITO covered poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) (175 µm) in rolls having a roll width of 305 mm and a length of 100 m. The material was used as received from Innovative Specialty Films (ISF, T-MOX). The nominal sheet resistance was 60 Ohm square−1. The material was trimmed to a web width of 290 mm and reference holes were punched along the edges. Cold lamination with a mechanical protection layer was carried out on top of the silver back electrodes, using a 25 µm thick Fasson overlaminating polyester material from Avery Dennison.
Model device preparation

Normal geometry. 
The ITO covered glass slides for the model devices were ultrasonically cleaned in 2-propanol and distilled water for 10 min followed by spincoating an aqueous dispersion of PEDOT:PSS (purchased from Aldrich) at a rotational speed of 2800 rpm. The samples were annealed at 150 °C and transferred into a glovebox (oxygen and water <0.1 ppm), where an active layer of P3HT:PCBM (25 : 22 mg mL−1 in m-xylene) was spincoated at 800 rpm, followed by drying. Subsequently an aluminium electrode was evaporated on top and the final device was annealed at 150 °C for 5 min.


Inverted geometry. 
After the same procedure of ultrasonic cleaning the glass/ITO slides were transferred into a glovebox, where a layer of unstabilized ZnO nanoparticles (50 mg mL−1chlorobenzene) was spincoated at a rotational speed of 1000 rpm, which followed by spincoating of the active layer consisting of the same compound used for the normal geometry device and subsequent drying in dichlorobenzene vapour. Finally, a layer of PEDOT:PSS (Agfa 5010) was applied by firstly wetting the surface of the P3HT:PCBM with isopropanol followed by spincoating the PEDOT:PSS solution at 3000 rpm followed by annealing at 130 °C for 5 min and final evaporation of silver. Model devices had an active area of 1 cm2, while the decay studies were carried out on devices with 3 cm2 active area.

Coating and printing equipment
The patterning of ITO was performed on a Klemm line at Mekoprint A/S.11 The slot-die coating was performed on a BC30 basecoater from Solar Coating Machinery (Germany) comprising unwinder, corona treater, edge guide, double faced contact cleaning, antistatic system, coating station, oven and winding station.14 The manual screen printing was performed on an AT701 from Alraun Technik (Germany). The screens were mounted with a 120 mesh screen for printing the silver paste.
R2R processing

Step 1 (screen printing etch resist). 
The desired striped pattern of the ITO (Fig. 5) was prepared by printing a UV-curable etch resist in the areas of the ITO pattern on a Klemm line in a full R2R process (Fig. 4). The printing speed was 180 prints h−1. The pattern is shown to the left in Fig. 5 and comprises stripes with a width of 9 mm spaced by 3 mm and a length of 250 mm along the direction of the web. The repetition distance was 275 mm since it is not possible to print continuous lines with a reversing screen printer. The distance of 25 mm between the stripes allowed for a sufficient margin between prints. The processing speed for printing and UV-curing the etch resist was 49.5 m h−1.


Step 2 (etching and stripping). 
The ITO was subsequently etched using a full R2R etching machine comprising etching baths (CuCl2), stripping baths (NaOH), washing baths (demineralised water) and drying sections (hot air). The etching speed was 40 m h−1. The thickness of the ITO was 80 nm.


Step 3 (slot-die coating of ZnO). 

            ZnO
            nanoparticles in chlorobenzene solution were stabilized with MEA and mixed with WS-1 followed by evaporation of chlorobenzene and methanol to give ZnO nanoparticles in WS-1. This stock solution was diluted with 4 volumes of o-xylene to give the final ink that was microfiltered through a 0.45 micron Teflon filter immediately prior to coating. The concentration of ZnO nanoparticles in the final coating ink was 30 mg mL−1. The typical coating speed was 54 m hour−1. The material was dried at temperatures up to 140 °C with a residence time in the oven of around 1 minute. This gave insoluble films of zinc oxide.


Step 4 (slot-die coating of P3HT:PCBM). 
P3HT was dissolved in dichlorobenzene followed by addition of PCBM. When making up the final ink one volume of chloroform was added giving a final concentration of 22 mg mL−1 P3HT and 20 mg mL−1 PCBM. The typical coating speed was 24 m h−1. The material was dried at temperatures up to 140 °C with a residence time in the oven of around 2–3 min.


Step 5 (slot-die coating of PEDOT:PSS). 

            PEDOT:PSS was used as a screen printing formulation (Agfa 5010) that was diluted with isopropanol (100 g PEDOT:PSS was mixed with 60 g isopropanol) and shaken vigorously for 1 h. The desired viscosity was around 200 mPa s. The typical coating speed was 12 m h−1 and involved wetting of the active layer with isopropanol immediately prior to coating in order to avoid dewetting of the PEDOT:PSS layer prior to drying. The material was dried at temperatures up to 140 °C with a residence time in the oven of around 5 min.


Step 6 (sheet fed screen printing of the silver back electrode). 
The material was unwound and cut manually into sheets. Registry holes were punched along one of the edges to allow indexing of the silver grid structure on the screen with the coated pattern on the substrate. The silver paste (PV410) was printed using a small laboratory screen printer with a printing speed of 550 mm s−1. The drying was carried out immediately after printing at 140 °C in a hot air oven. The total drying time was 15 min.


Post treatment. 
The finally processed material was cut into 1 stripe, 2 stripe, 3 stripe and 8 stripe modules that were either used as is or back-laminated using a thin PET based 25 micron foil material. Contacts were applied using alligator clips to the silver bus.

Device and module characterisation

Model devices. 
When characterising devices with an inverted device geometry care has to be taken to avoid overestimation of the PCE due to a larger effective overlap between electrodes. This is due to the fact that PEDOT:PSS conducts significantly well to allow for harvesting light in areas outside the evaporated silver back electrode. In order to avoid this the devices were illuminated through a shadow mask such that only the active area was illuminated. In order to be consistent the masking was also performed for the devices with a normal geometry.


R2R coated devices. 
The effective active area for each stripe is typically 250 mm × 6 mm. The width varies a little depending on the alignment and therefore the overlap between the ITO electrode and the PEDOT:PSS-silver back electrode also varies. The nominal active areas, aperture areas and geometric fill factor for the modules were as follows: single stripe modules (15 cm2, 57.5 cm2, 26%), two stripe module (30 cm2, 87.5 cm2, 34%), three stripe module (45 cm2, 117.5 cm2, 38%) and the eight stripe module (120 cm2, 267.5 cm2, 45%). The IV-characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter. The conditions of the characterization under simulated sunlight were KHS 575 solar simulators from Steuernagel Lichttechnik operating at 1000 W m−2, AM1.5G, 45 ± 5% relative humidity, 72 ± 3 °C. The spectrum of the solar simulator was checked using an optical spectrum analyzer calculated for measuring irradiance. The incident light intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated bolometrically using a precision spectral pyranometer from Eppley Laboratories (http://www.eppleylab.com). The incident light intensity was monitored continuously during measurements using a CM4 high temperature pyranometer from Kipp & Zonen (http://www.kippzonen.com).

Stability studies
The devices were mounted using silver epoxy and inserted into atmospheric test chambers as described earlier.23 After introduction of the devices in the test chamber the chamber was evacuated to a pressure of 10−2 mBar and the desired atmosphere was introduced. This evacuation and refilling procedure served to quickly reach the desired levels of humidity and oxygen in the chamber. Light was hereafter admitted to the device and the IV-curves were recorded every 5 min during the experiment. The experiments were carried out for 200 h and the illumination of the devices was constant. The temperature of the devices during the stability experiments was 40 ± 3 °C.
Conclusion
Inverted model devices comprising glass/ITO/ZnO/P3HT-PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/silver were optimized to exhibit the same performance as model devices with a normal geometry (glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT-PCBM/aluminium). The active area of the model devices was 1 cm2 and illumination was through the glass/ITO (frontface). The power conversion efficiency that could be obtained for both devices as tested under ambient conditions was 2.7% (AM1.5G, 1000 W m−2, 72 ± 2 °C, 40 ± 5% relative humidity). The devices were tested in different model atmospheres and the normal device geometry was found to be sensitive to moisture but stable in dry oxygen. This effect is ascribed to interaction with aluminium at the interface between the active layer and the aluminium electrode. In contrast the inverted devices were stable in the presence of humidity but were sensitive to oxygen. The process leading to the inverted model device was subsequently transferred to a full R2R process employing a flexible PET substrate covered with ITO as the source material. The ITO was processed into stripes by screen printing an etch resist, etching away the ITO as desired followed by stripping of the etch resist. Subsequently, a zinc oxide layer, the active layer and a PEDOT:PSS layer were juxtaposed and coated on top of the ITO layer using slot-die coating. Finally the device was completed using a screen printed silver paste. All the device preparation for the R2R processed devices was performed in air without special precaution. Several different modules were explored in the R2R process and single cell modules and serially connected modules comprising 2, 3 and 8 cells in series were explored. The best performance that was obtained for the modules comprising 8 serially connected cells was 1.7% for the active area of the full module that was limited by extraction of carriers. The performance for a small area device where the Ohmic losses had been reduced amounted to 2.3% for an active area of 4.8 cm2 which is similar to the performance obtained for the model devices.

 	Fig. 1  An illustration of the four possible device geometries for multilayer polymer solar cells assuming charge transport in a direction perpendicular to the substrate surface. Frontface illumination requires that the substrate is transparent whereas backside illumination does not forcibly require this. Illumination is assumed to take place from one preferred side. Bifacial illumination is possible and requires transparency of both electrodes (not shown in this diagram). The hole flow is in a direction opposite to the electron flow.	 

 	Fig. 2  The Normal geometry employed for the model devices (left) comprise spincoated PEDOT:PSS and P3HT-PCBM layers and evaporated aluminium. The inverted geometry employed for both model devices and fully R2R coated modules (right). The model devices employed spincoated ZnO, P3HT-PCBM and PEDOT:PSS and evaporated silver whereas the fully R2R coated modules employed slot-die coated ZnO, P3HT-PCBM and PEDOT:PSS with the silver electrode being applied using screen printing (slot-die coating would also have been possible).

 	Fig. 3  A comparison of IV-curves for devices with a normal geometry (glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT-PCBM/aluminium) and an inverted geometry (glass/ITO/ZnO/P3HT-PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/silver). Both devices were prepared by spincoating the layers and evaporating the back electrodes.	 

 	Fig. 4  An illustration of the process and the six different processing steps employed during fabrication of the R2R coated modules.	 

 	Fig. 5  An illustration of the pattern employed for the R2R processed cells. The ITO pattern is shown (top left). The ZnO, active layer and PEDOT:PSS layers had the same outline but were continuous lines running along the substrate since they were slot-die coated. The silver pattern was screen printed as shown (top right) with a grid pattern over the active area having an aperture loss of 20% (middle). An exploded side view is shown (bottom left) along with a schematic of a one stripe cell emphasizing the overlap of the different layers and their juxtaposition (bottom right).

 	Fig. 6  Typical performance of the individual 1, 2, 3 and 8 stripe modules. The module voltages correspond well to the sum of voltages for the individual cells in the module and the module currents are only slightly affected by the serial connection. The individual modules are shown on the photograph from the backside. The measurement conditions were 1000 W m−2, AM1.5G, 72 ± 2 °C.

IV-curves for a full 8 stripe module with a nominal active area of 120 cm2 as a function of incident light intensity (top left) and for an 8 stripe module with a length of 1 cm giving a nominal active area of 4.8 cm2 (top right). The device is also responsive to light entering the device through the printed silver grid back electrode albeit with lower performance due to the aperture loss from the grid and transmission loss in the PEDOT:PSS (top right). A photograph of the 8 stripe module from the back electrode highlighting the printed silver grid is also shown (bottom). Data are shown in Table 2.
