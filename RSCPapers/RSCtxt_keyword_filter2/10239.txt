    , Accepted 20th May 2019First published on 21st May 2019AbstractHybrid quasi-two dimensional perovskites (2D) have attracted significant scientific interest, because they have been demonstrated to be excellent light absorbing materials in photovoltaic devices. However, quasi-2D perovskites still perform poorly in high humidity, even though they have exhibited greatly improved stability compared to their three-dimensional (3D) counterparts. This is the biggest obstacle for the practical implementation and commercial viability of perovskite solar cells. Herein, we used hexylamine (CH3(CH2)4CH2NH2, HA) for a quasi-2D, HA(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) perovskite, which had sufficiently long alkyl chains to maintain the chemical stability of the perovskite. As the number of layers of quasi 2D HA(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites was increased, they exhibited an appropriate band gap as a light absorber to be applied in solar cells. The perovskite solar cell based on the 2D HA(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites showed an excellent power conversion efficiency of 5.90% with a short circuit current density of 13.61 mA cm−1, an open circuit voltage of 0.72 V, a fill factor of 60.10%, and stability in ambient air. The long alkyl chain of the hexylamine cation prevented the degradation of the solar cell in the atmosphere with passivation of the perovskite films due to their high hydrophobic properties. This investigation highlights the role of the organic cation in maintaining the quality of the perovskite film and provides a critical solution for the poor stability of perovskites in ambient air.
1. Introduction
The emergence of three-dimensional (3D) hybrid perovskites with the chemical formula AMX3, [A = CH3NH3+(MA) and HC(NH2)2+ (FA), M = Pb2+, Sn2+, Cu2+, Bi3+, and Sb3+, X = Cl−, Br−, and I−], has attracted considerable attention within just a few years, and unprecedented photovoltaic performance has been achieved due to their intriguing properties, including a high absorption coefficient, excellent ambipolar charge mobility, long-range electron–hole diffusion length, and small exciton binding energy.1–5 The first reported MAPbI3-based perovskite solar cell yielded a PCE of 3.8% using a liquid electrolyte in a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC).6 After MAPbI3 was introduced as a light absorber in a solid state solar cell, it boosted the power conversion efficiency up to 22.1% within less than five years of development.7 However, though the progress in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSC) has been remarkable, PSCs are accompanied by stability concerns due to decomposition of the initial precursors8 and intrinsic halide segregation,9–11 with ambiguous long-term consequences. This issue has motivated tremendous efforts to improve device stability,12–14 including the development of novel device architectures.15 Recent reports have shown promising results with the use of additives (Cs+ and Rb+) in MA/FA mixture perovskites, which has led to complex triple16 and quadruple17 compositions with an efficiency of over 20%. Due to the optimum band gap and large absorption coefficient, triple cation perovskites exhibit a low Schottky barrier height, which allows the photogenerated holes to be in the surface trap state. This leads to more unpaired electrons toward the electrode, resulting in a significant increase of the photocurrent density.18 Liu et al.19 demonstrated a hole transport layer (HTL) doped with spiro-(TFSI)2, which showed high moisture resistance compared with the conventional Li-TFSI doped HTL material. It maintained an initial efficiency (19.1%) of 76% under humid conditions for 23 days. To improve the resistance to humidity and thus the stability, MAPbI3 films on TiO2 were passivated with an assistant layer. Zhang et al.20 modified an electron transporting layer with an ultrathin AlOx interlayer to improve the long-term environmental stability of perovskite solar cells. In addition, all inorganic perovskites have drawn increasing attention because they show a broadband absorption spectrum from ultraviolet to visible light and significantly better thermal stability compared to organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites. Recently, a low-temperature fabricated CsPbBr3 perovskite demonstrated high light capability, mechanical flexibility, and long-term environmental stability.21 Meanwhile, it was reported that low dimensional perovskite structures are very stable, because excitons in these structures have a high binding energy (0.36 eV) even at room temperature.22,23 Notably, two-dimensional (2D) perovskite structures, which consist of inorganic layers bearing electronic functionality and organic layers that act as a template for the structure, also offer a tunable band structure and are soluble in a wide range of solvents. 2D perovskites have been introduced as light absorbers in photovoltaics due to the higher moisture resistance of their bulky group.24,25 However, since they have a dielectric mismatch between the organic and inorganic layers and spatial confinement due to the organic spacer, a stable exciton with high binding energy was formed, which results in decreased mobility of the carrier.
One way to achieve high electrical properties and long-term stability associated with a good solar-cell absorber is to employ 2D derivatives of a three-dimensional (3D) perovskite, where the framework of the 3D perovskite was sliced with long spacer cations along the (100), (110), and (111) crystallographic planes. The most common quasi-2D perovskite for a solar cell is the 2D Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite (RPP), which is the most oriented (001) type perovskite. 2D RPP has the generic chemical formula (RNH3)2(A)MnX3n+1, where RNH3 represents the more hydrophobic long alkyl chain or an aromatic group that acts as a spacer between the 3D perovskite layers, A is the small molecule cation, M is the divalent metal cation, X is a halide, and n is the layer thickness. Since RNH3 was introduced at the crystallographic A-site of the 3D perovskite framework (AMX3), it can be regarded as a multiple quantum well (MQW) structure, which consisted of an alternating structure of inorganic and organic layers. The insulating organic layer acts as a barrier layer, whereas the semiconducting inorganic layer acts as a quantum well, which determines the material stability, electro-optical properties, quantum confinement, and the degree of dielectric properties. The dielectric properties and quantum confinement are well known phenomena in the quasi-2D perovskite MQW structure and determine the exciton binding energy and charge transport within the MQW. The thickness of the inorganic layer and interlayer separation can be controlled by the type of organic cation and the stoichiometric ratio between the precursor compounds: (PEA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (PEA is phenylethylammonium, MA is methylammonium and n = 2, 3),24,26 (BA)2(MA)n−1SnnI3n+1 (BA is butylammonium and n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5),27,28 (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4),29 (C(NH2)3)(MA)nPbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3),30 (C4H3SCH2NH3)2(MA)Pb2I7,31 (HO2C(CH2)3NH3)2(MA)Pb2I7,32 Cs2[C(NH2)3]Pb2Br7,33 and Cs2AgBiBr6.34 The first report is on the layered perovskite (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10, and it showed a PCE of 4.73%.24 It exhibited stability for 46 days under a relative humidity of 52%. A quasi-2D lead iodide perovskite, (BA)2(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1 series, was applied to a solid-state solar cell, which yielded a PCE of 4.02% from the n = 3 compound with notable moisture resistance.29 Tsai et al.35 reported a photovoltaic efficiency of 12.52% with a quasi 2D perovskite ((BA)2(MA)3PbI4I13) using hot casting. It exhibited greatly improved stability compared to its 3D counterpart under subject light, humidity, and heat stress.
Herein, we chose hexylamine (CH3(CH2)4CH2NH2, HA) for quasi-2D perovskite preparation (HA(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1), which has an alkyl chain long enough to maintain the chemical stability of the perovskite. The HA(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) perovskites were explored using the substitution of CH3NH3+ (MA+) instead of HA+, and the crystal structure, electrical and optical properties, and the morphology of thin films were carefully analyzed. We demonstrated a different crystal structure and crystal orientation in quasi 2D HA(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites as they approach the 3D (n = ∞) perovskite from the simple 2D perovskite. We found that these intermediate phases (n = 2, 3, 4) exhibited an appropriate band gap to apply in solar cells as a light absorber, and they had high hydrophobic properties due to the organic spacer, which was the HA+ cation. We believe that this approach will also enable further improvement in the stability of related perovskite materials. Furthermore, these materials have a high solubility and can be easily processed in a solution, and thus show promise as a new class of tunable semiconductors for future solar cell technology.

CH3NH3I(MAI) was synthesized by neutralizing equimolar amounts of 57% w/w aqueous HI and 40% w/w aqueous methylamine (CH3NH2). A white precipitate was collected by evaporating the solvent using rotary evaporation at 60 °C under reduced pressure.
2.2 Materials synthesis

(HA)2PbI4. 
A 100 mL two-necked round-bottom flask was charged with 5.0 mL of stabilized hydriodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in H2O) and 1 mL of hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2, 50 wt% in H2O). The mixture was degassed with nitrogen for 1 minute, and the flask was kept under nitrogen for the duration of the experiment. The flask was heated in an oil bath to 120 °C, PbO (0.6696 g, 3 mmol) was added, and then it was stirred vigorously until the solid dissolved completely. In a separate beaker, HA (792.6 μL, 6 mmol) was neutralized with HI 57 wt%/H2O (2 mL, 15 mmol) in an ice bath. HAI was then added into the bright yellow solution, and the reaction was kept under constant heat and stirred for a few hours until about 20% of the above solution was evaporated. Stirring was discontinued, and the hot solution was slowly quenched to room temperature. Orange plate-like crystals precipitated after the solution was allowed to stand for 3 hours. The precipitate was separated using vacuum filtration, washed with diethyl ether, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. A yield of 65% was estimated relative to Pb.

The flask was heated in an oil bath to 120 °C, PbO (0.6696 g, 3 mmol) was added, and then it was stirred vigorously, forming a bright yellow solution. Subsequently, solid MACl (0.4769 g, 3 mmol) was then added into the hot PbI2 solution. When a black precipitate initially began to form, the solution was rapidly re-dissolved while stirring vigorously to obtain a bright clear yellow solution. In order to obtain the pure layered perovskite structure, HA, which is the organic cation of the 2D perovskite, was used as a limiting reactant, following Stoumpos'report.36 In a separate beaker, HA (396.3 μL, 3 mmol) was neutralized with HI 57 wt%/H2O (2 mL, 15 mmol) in an ice bath. The HAI solution was slowly added one drop at a time into the PbI2 solution while stirring continuously. A black precipitate was initially formed, which was redissolved by heating the combined solution to a boil. The stirring was then discontinued, and the hot solution was slowly quenched to room temperature, and during that time cherry red rectangular-shaped plates started to precipitate. After the solution was allowed to stand for 3 hours, the crystals were separated using suction filtration, washed with diethyl ether, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. A yield of 62% was estimated relative to Pb.

The flask was heated in an oil bath to 120 °C, PbO (0.7440 g, 3.33 mmol) was added, and then it was stirred vigorously, forming a bright yellow solution. Subsequently, solid MACl (0.1501 g, 2.22 mmol) was added into the hot PbI2 solution. When a black precipitate initially began to form, the solution was rapidly redissolved while stirring vigorously to obtain a bright clear yellow solution. In a separate beaker, HA (146.6 μL, 1.11 mmol) was neutralized with HI 57 wt%/H2O (2 mL, 15 mmol) in an ice bath. The HAI solution was slowly added one drop at a time into the PbI2 solution while continuously stirring. A black precipitate was initially formed, which was redissolved by heating the combined solution to a boil. The stirring was then discontinued, and the hot solution was slowly quenched to room temperature. During this time, deep-red/purple rectangular-shaped plates started to precipitate. After the solution was allowed to stand for 3 hours, the crystals were separated using suction filtration, washed with diethyl ether, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. A yield of 57% was estimated relative to Pb.


HA(MA)3Pb4I13. 
A 100 mL two-necked round-bottom flask was charged with 5.0 mL of stabilized hydriodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in H2O) and 1 mL of hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2, 50 wt% in H2O). The mixture was degassed with nitrogen for 1 minute, and the flask was kept under nitrogen for the duration of the experiment. The flask was heated in an oil bath to 120 °C, PbO (0.7440 g, 3.33 mmol) was added, and then it was stirred vigorously, forming a bright yellow solution. Subsequently, solid MACl (0.1688 g, 2.50 mmol) was added into the hot PbI2 solution. When a black precipitate initially began to form, the solution was rapidly redissolved by stirring vigorously to obtain a bright clear yellow solution. In a separate beaker, HA (55.05 μL, 0.42 mmol) was neutralized with HI 57 wt%/H2O (2 mL, 15 mmol) in an ice bath. The HAI solution was slowly added one drop at a time into the PbI2 solution while continuously stirring. A black precipitate was initially formed, which was redissolved by heating the combined solution to a boil. Stirring was then discontinued, and the hot solution was slowly quenched to room temperature. During this time, black rectangular-shaped plates started to precipitate. After the solution was allowed to stand for 3 hours, the crystals were separated using suction filtration, washed with diethyl ether, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. A yield of 51% was estimated relative to Pb.

2.3 Characterization

Single crystal X-ray diffraction. 
The single crystal X-ray diffraction data of HA(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3) series were measured using synchrotron radiation (λ = 0.61000 Å) on an ADSC Quantum-210 detector at BL2D SMC with a silicon (111) double crystal monochromator (DCM) at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory, Korea. A PAL BL2D-SMDC program37 was used for data collection (detector distance is 63 mm, omega scan; Δω = 3°, exposure time is 1 s per frame), and HKL3000sm (Ver. 703r)38 was used for cell refinement, reduction, and absorption correction. The crystal structure of the perovskite was solved using the direct method with a SHELXT-2014 program,39 and it was refined using full-matrix least-squares calculations with the SHELXL-2014 program package.40


Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL). 
Steady-state PL spectra were measured by dividing and guiding the PL signal through an optical fiber using a HORIBA LabRAM HR Evolution confocal RAMAN microscope. A 532 nm laser (0.01% power) was used to excite all samples at 50× magnification.
A time-resolved PL (TRPL) study was performed using an inverted-type scanning confocal microscope (MicroTime-200, Picoquant, Germany) with a 60× (air) objective. The lifetime measurements were performed at the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), Daegu Center, Korea. A single-mode pulsed diode laser (470 nm with a pulse width of 30 ps) was used as an excitation source. A dichroic mirror (490 DCXR, AHF), a long-pass filter (HQ500lp, AHF), a 75 μm pinhole, and a single photon avalanche diode (PDM series, MPD) were used to collect emissions from the samples. A time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique was used to count fluorescence photons. The TRPL images that consisted of 200 × 200 pixels were recorded using the time-tagged time-resolved (TTTR) data acquisition method. Exponential fittings for the obtained PL decays were performed using Symphotime-64 software (Ver. 2.2) with the exponential decay model, I(t) = ∑Aie−t/τi, where I(t) is the time-dependent PL intensity, A is the amplitude, and τ is the PL lifetime.


Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). 
UPS measurements were carried out using an AXIS ultra-delay line detector (DLD) (Kratos inc.) at KBSI, Daejeon, and the He I (21.22 eV) emission line was employed as a UV source.


Optical absorption spectroscopy. 
The optical diffuse reflectance spectra were measured using an Agilent (Cary-5000) UV-VIS-NIR system. Polytetrafluoroethylene was used as a nonabsorbing reference material with 100% reflectance. The reflectance versus wavelength was converted to absorption data to calculate the band gap (Eg) using the Kubelka–Munk equation:41α/S = (1 − R)2(2R)−1, where R is the reflectance and α and S are the absorption and scattering coefficients, respectively. Field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM) images were obtained using a high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (JEM-2100F, JEOL Ltd., Japan).


Powder X-ray diffraction. 
Power XRD patterns were recorded using an Empyrean PANalytical instrument with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 30 mA, λ = 1.54056 Å), an Ni filter, and a graphite monochromator.


Hall effect measurement. 
Hall effect measurement was conducted in air using four contacts. The Hall bar method utilized DC current flowing through a perovskite pellet applied using a Keithley Model 2400, and the Hall voltage was recorded using a Keithley Model 4200. A field strength of 0.533 T was applied.

2.4 Solar cell fabrication
N type TiO2 layer formation was carried out using the following method. A high-quality blocking layer plays a vital role in preventing the charge recombination and rapidly extracting photoelectrons from the interface perovskite active layer. A compact TiO2 blocking layer was prepared by spin-coating a mildly acidic solution of titanium isopropoxide in ethanol (350 μL in 5 mL of ethanol with 0.013 M HCl) at 2000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 550 °C for 30 min. The pH of the TiO2 precursor solution significantly affects the crystal structure and surface morphology of the TiO2 nanostructures.42 Herein, to make the 20 nm thick TiO2 compact layer, the pH of the precursor solution was adjusted to 5. As we can see below Fig. S1(a),† it was observed that the TiO2 blocking layer consisted of compact grains and well distributed on the FTO without defects and pinholes. For an electron transporting layer, a mesoporous TiO2 layer composed of 20 nm particles was deposited on the TiO2 blocking layer with a diluted TiO2 paste (DYESOL-30NRD) with ethanol at a ratio of 1:3.5 w/w at 500 rpm for 5 seconds, 3000 rpm for 10 seconds, and 6000 rpm for 30 seconds. The substrate was further treated with a 20 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 minutes, rinsed with deionized water and ethanol, and then sintered at 500 °C for 30 minutes. Fig. S1(b)† shows the TiO2 mesoporous layer on the TiO2 blocking layer. 40 wt% perovskites were dissolved in DMF and DMSO solvent. The solution was spin coated on an N type TiO2 layer at 4000 rpm for 30 seconds followed by an annealing process at 100 °C for 30 minutes. A solution for spiro-MeOTAD coating as a hole transporting layer (HTL) was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg spiro-MeOTAD in 1 mL of chlorobenzene, to which 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 17.5 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide solution (520 mg Li-TSFI in 1 mL acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%)) were added.43 Spiro-MeOTAD was deposited at 4000 rpm for 30 seconds on the perovskite layer. A gold layer of 800 Å for the counter electrode was deposited on the perovskite layer with thermal evaporation at 1.5 Å s−1.
3. Results and discussion
We synthesized pure 2D homologous HA(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) perovskites from an optimized stoichiometric reaction between HA, MAI, and PbI2 using an H3PO2 stabilized HI solution. To form a layered perovskite structure, the 2D perovskite must be incorporated into a 3D perovskite structure. Thus, a homogeneous 3D precursor solution was formed initially by mixing a stoichiometric amount of PbO and MACl in concentrated I2-free HI solution, which formed a clear, bright yellow solution in the HI/H3PO2 solvent medium. Subsequently, the HA neutralized in the HI solution was added to the above clear yellow solution under vigorous stirring to a boil. The continuous stirring was maintained to produce a clear solution, and upon cooling to room temperature, a rectangular plate-like precipitate was produced (Fig. 1). Herein, we prepared MAPbI3 using MACl and PbO, because they easily dissociated in the HI solution and changed into MA+ and Pb2+. It is well known that the use of PbI2 as the Pb2+ source versus PbO or MAI as opposed to MACl leads to the same products, indicating that the synthesis is robust to changes in precursors. Especially, Oswald et al.44 reported this method in detail. They demonstrated the general reaction pathway to make 2D Ruddlesden–Popper hybrid perovskites by using the same method as this study. In addition, previous reports30,36,45 demonstrated the synthesis of pure perovskite crystals using this method. This can be ascribed to the common-ion effect, which provides the selective controlling of molar solubility to precipitate the pure compound as indicated by Oswald et al.44
 Fig. 1  Photographs of HA(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) perovskite crystals in HI solution with H3PO2 (top image). Optical images of (HA)2PbI4, (HA)2MAPb2I7, (HA)2(MA)2Pb3I10, and (HA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite crystals (bottom image). The scale bar is 100 μm. 
For the HA(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1 series, as the layers become thicker, the color of the crystal gets progressively darker from n = 1 (orange) to n = 4 (black). Accordingly, if the perovskite is not pure, crystals with different colors and shape are produced. We found that if we used a large excess of MAI and PbI2, which was previously recommended,46 the product (n) was contaminated with multilayer mixtures. The prepared sample needed to be isolated from the different crystal structures. These phenomena were already well explained in the previous report of Mitzi.47 To avoid this problem, we chose Stoumpos' method,36 in which we could easily isolate the pure layered perovskite by controlling the proportion of the long alkyl chain amine (HA) incorporated in the 3D perovskite (MAPbI3). As Stoumpos36 has mentioned, as shown in Fig. S2,† when we used an excess amount of MAI and PbI2, the (HA)2MAPb2I7 (n = 2) and (HA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (n = 3) perovskites are generated including n = 3 and n = 4, respectively (Fig. S2a–S2c†), whereas, it was found that the use of HA as a limiting reagent results in pure n = 2 and n = 3 compounds (Fig. S2d–S2f†). This can facilitate the study of the electrical and optical properties of pure layered perovskites, and the characteristics could be seen when a layered perovskite was applied in each solar cell.
The single crystals of HA(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3) perovskites were analyzed using a single crystal X-ray diffractometer. Detailed crystallographic data and structural refinement for layered perovskite reported here are provided in Table 1. The orthorhombic crystal system of the (HA)2PbI4 perovskite (Fig. 2a) consisted of an infinite PbI42− sheet of corner-sharing octahedral [PbI6]4−, which propagated in the ac plane direction along the b axis to form a 3D structure. Since this structure was preferentially grown along the (110) direction, the (00l) reflection was exclusively revealed in the XRD measurement (Fig. 4a). The inorganic layer was separated with a bilayer of HA cations, where the ammonium group bonded to the halogens of inorganic sheets, and the HA chain was oriented into the space between the layers.48 The long alkyl chains interacted with each other due to the van der Waals force, which provided a highly 2D structure. (HA)2PbI4 crystallized in the orthorhombic space group Cmc21. The asymmetric unit consisted of the Pb0.5I2 and HA cation chains. The coordination geometry around the Pb atom was characterized by the short and long Pb–I atoms. The bond distance to the trans iodides was the greatest at 3.2114 (98) Å, and the bond distance of the bridging iodides and the trans iodides was the shortest, 3.1822 (84) Å and 3.1950 (61) Å. The trans angles of I–Pb–I in the octahedra all deviated from 180° with a cis angle in a range from 84.777 (128) Å to 95.222 (129) Å. In a perpendicular direction to the layer, crystal cohesion was achieved by the N–H⋯I hydrogen bond due to the NH3 polar group of the HA cation. The hydrogen bond lengths between N–H on the HA groups and the terminal halide (I3) were 2.8532 (156) Å and 2.8627 (66) Å and for the bridging halide (I1) it was 3.1246 (22) Å (Fig. 2b). These hydrogen bonding modes induced an offset between the inorganic layers49 and stacked the inorganic layers in a staggered motif (Fig. 2c). The crystal structure of the (HA)2PbI4 phase changed from the monoclinic space group P21/a to an orthorhombic phase depending on the temperature.50 The phase change caused the perovskite structure to convert from a K2NiF4 to a RbAlF4 structure type. This increased the interlayer spacing distance. However, the HA conformation was not changed during the phase transitions. It maintained the position of an ammonium group with hydrogen bonding.

For the HA(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskite series, the n = 2 and n = 3 compounds crystallized in the monoclinic space group C2/c and P21/c, respectively. The (HA)2MAPb2I7 compound (n = 2) consisted of two inorganic layers and two organic bilayers, where the inorganic layer defined the ac plane, and the organic layer was intercalated along the b-axis (Fig. 3a). For n = 2, (0k0) reflections corresponding to (001) reflections in the 2D compound decreased, and (111) and (202) reflections began to appear. This corresponded to the vertical growth of the compound with respect to the substrate. The same tendency was also shown for the n = 3 ((HA)2(MA)2Pb3I10) compound. It exhibited exclusively (111) and (202) reflections, which reflected the vertical growth of the perovskite compounds (Fig. 3b). The n = 3 compound substituted the HA cation instead of the MA cation in all three inorganic layers by slicing the basic tetragonal parent 3D compound (n = ∞) along the (110) crystal plane. The octahedral sheet was disconnected by the intercalated organic bilayers, where the MA cations were fully or partially substituted by the organic layer between the 3D connected octahedral metal frameworks, [MI6]4−.
The HA(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskite series had a different configuration structure from their parent structures ((HA)2PbI4 and MAPbI3), since the MA and HA cations were arranged competitively in the preferred configuration to maintain their stereochemical structure. Because the unique situation of the multilayered compound followed the same trend for n = 2, 3, and 4, we only describe the n = 3 compound in detail for the sake of simplicity. The most obvious difference arose due to the fact that HA cations were positioned in the center with respect to the perovskite slab, whereas the MA cations were located slightly off center from the their ideal alignment (Fig. 3d).36 As shown in Fig. 3c, the HA cation distorted the perovskite on the b-axis (blue layer), and the MA distorted on the ac-plane (yellow layer). It formed an intermediate 2D perovskite, which was opposite to (HA)2PbI4 and MAPbI3, because it distorted across two different directions. Therefore, the configuration of the cation greatly affected the tilting pattern of the perovskite and the degree of distortion of the inorganic framework. For example, in (HA)2(MA)2Pb3I10, the angle was (Pb–I–Pb)101 = 153.053 (123)° and (Pb–I–Pb)100 = 155.296 (134)°, while the Pb–I–Pb angle in MAPbI3 was 163.345(64)° (Fig. 3d).

Fig. 4a and d show the crystal morphology of the HA(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1 and 3) perovskites. The crystal shape is a rectangular plate and has a layer-by-layer shape on the side. As the number of layers (n) increased, the thin plate shape overlapped. Fig. 4b shows the lattice distance of the (800) plane of (HA)2PbI4. The corresponding crystal structure of the (800) plane is presented in Fig. 4c. For comparison, a HR-TEM image of the (111) plane of (HA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 is shown in Fig. 4e; this created a (222) plane along the ac-plane and reflected the vertical growth of the perovskite structure. The (222) plane of (HA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 is shown in Fig. 4f. Fig. 4g and h show the EDAX results of the elemental mapping for (HA)2PbI4 and (HA)2(MA)2Pb3I10, respectively. They confirmed the uniform distribution of the elements without any phase segregation or secondary phase formation.
Additional low angle reflections were observed in the XRD results (Fig. 5). In the XRD region between 2θ = 2–15° (Fig. 5b), it was observed that the n = 2 analogue showed two evenly spaced reflections, and similar analogues were observed at n = 3 and n = 4. They showed three and four reflections, respectively. This was ascribed to the matching of d-spacing to the discrete perovskite layer between the 2D perovskite [(111) reflection] and the 3D perovskite [(110) reflection].36 In addition, as the number of layers (n) was increased, the crystal structure of the perovskite became similar to that of the 3D perovskite. This result could be seen from the peaks at around 14° and 28°, which were attributed to the (002)/(110) and the (004)/(220) crystal plane due to the vertical growth direction of the 3D perovskite (Fig. 5a and b).51

Fig. 6a and b display the absorption edge and PL of HA(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) perovskites at room temperature, respectively. Most of the samples exhibited a sharp absorption edge that reflected the direct band gap materials. The absorption edge decreased with an increase of the thickness of the inorganic slabs from 2.37 eV (n = 1) to 1.73 eV (n = 4) because of the quantum confinement effect from the dimensional reduction of the 3D perovskite into a lower dimensionality perovskite. A secondary sharp peak was observed above the absorption edge, which corresponded to the excitonic absorption. The intensity of the second peak was the strongest for the HAPbI4 compound (n = 1). As the thickness of the inorganic slab was increased, the second peak progressively subsided. It almost disappeared for the n = 4 compound. These secondary peaks were similarly observed in the 3D perovskites CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and MAPbI3, which indicated the presence of stable excitons at room temperature. The PL maximum emission energy of the 2D perovskites exhibited the same tendency as a result of the band gap. The PL emission showed a single peak due to the direct radiative recombination of an exciton, which is typically observed with excitonic materials. Fig. 6c shows a summary of the absorption and PL maximum emission energy. From Fig. 6d, the energy difference between the absorption and the PL maximum emission energy slightly increased with the thickness of the inorganic slab.

Fig. 7 shows the emission lifetime of HA(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) perovskites, which was obtained by the measurement of the transient photoluminescence decay curve. Carrier lifetimes were obtained by fitting the single wavelength PL decay (λex = 470 nm) using a three exponential decay model. The fastest decay process (τ1) was related to the radiative recombination of excitons, while the slower decay process (τ2 and τ3) corresponded to the trap states due to the perovskite crystal structure.49,52 The carrier lifetimes are summarized in Table 2. Compared to the 3D MAPbI3 (τavg = 2.85 ns) and the 2D (HA)2PbI4 (τavg = 1.78 ns) perovskites, the layered (HA)2MAPb2I7 and (HA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 perovskites exhibited longer averaged emission lifetimes, which were 5.90 ns and 3.61 ns, respectively. This result can be assigned to the decrease of the nonradiative recombination in the layered crystal structure. However, the (HA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite has a shorter average lifetime of 2.60 ns compared to other layered perovskites, which suggests that nonradiative recombination predominantly occurred as the crystal structure approached a 3D perovskite structure. These results can be seen clearly in Table 2. The average lifetime of (HA)2MAPb2I7 and (HA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 was mostly contributed by the radiative recombination of excitons (τ1), whereas the emission lifetime in the (HA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite was contributed by the formation of the trap state (τ2). To assess the effectiveness of carrier transport, we measured the mobility of the HA(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) perovskite using the Hall effect measurement. The calculated carrier mobility is 2.97, 3.10, 5.01 and 6.62 cm2 V−1 s−1 for n = 1, 2, 3 and 4 compounds, respectively. Previous reports demonstrated that 3D MAPbI3 thin films have charge-carrier mobility in the range from 1 to 11.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ref. 53) and it was improved up to 36.0 cm2 V−1 s−1 by the thermal annealing process.54 The 2D layered perovskite, MAn−1PEA2PbnI3n+1, has mobility in a range from 6 to 11 cm2 V−1 s−1.55 Thus, even though (HA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 has a long alkyl chain as an insulator layer in its crystal structure, it shows comparable mobility to previous hybrid 3D and 2D perovskites.

We investigated the electronic structure of HA(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) perovskites using UPS (Fig. 8). Fig. 8b shows that the valence band onset shifted toward the Fermi level from the MAPbI3 to the HA(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 sample, which led to a decrease of ionization energy. However, a larger amount of HA (n = 4) resulted in a shift of the valence band onset away from the Fermi level. This is because the amount of Pb0 on the surface increased as the amount of HA increased, and also the valence band onset due to HAPbI4, which had a high band gap, moved to high binding energy.11 The work function (WF) of the layered perovskite was determined from the secondary-electron cutoff region (Fig. 8c). The value of WF decreased as the HAPbI4 content increased. To explain the charge transport in the hybrid perovskite system, a multiquantum-well structure was regarded as a predominant model, where the electronic properties of the organic and inorganic layers are considered separately. In particular, the organic layer mainly served the band structure of the perovskite. However, the present study indicated that the organic moiety also affected both the structural and electronic functions of the hybrid perovskite. Fig. 8d shows the alignment of the energy level of the HA(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskite series when it was applied in a FTO/TiO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au solar cell configuration. All of the perovskites had valence band maximum (VBM) energy closer to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the HTL, which indicated that there was no hole extraction barrier. However, since the HOMO level of the HTL was in a position 100 meV higher than the perovskite VBM, the built-in field and collection of the hole were constrained, and this caused the Voc to decrease from the device point of view.

Fig. 9 shows SEM images of the HA(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) perovskite series. The morphological difference between the samples was evident. The perovskite film made from (HA)2PbI4 was uniform and compact. However, as shown in Fig. 9g, the color of the (HA)2PbI4 film is yellow, which indicated that a material with a high band gap is not suitable for high efficiency solar cells. As 3D MAPbI3 was introduced into the 2D perovskite, the grain size of the thin film increased, and with an increase of the MAPbI3 ratio, the features of the grain sizes gradually decreased in the n = 4 compound. The film was also dark and was suitable as a solar cell light absorber (Fig. 9g). A uniform surface without large grain boundaries was observed from the SEM images for the (HA)2PbI4 and (HA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 cases. However, a closer examination of the AFM images (Fig. 9e and f) suggested there were substantially different surfaces between them. The (HA)2PbI4 film had a very smooth feature (root-mean-square roughness (RMS) = 9.17 nm). In contrast, the features were quite large for (HA)2(MA)3Pb4I13, which had considerably higher roughness (RMS = 85.06 nm) than the (HA)2PbI4 film. This implied that the 2D film formation mechanism was different from that of the RP perovskite film when it was prepared from its precursors without the formation of intermediate phases.

We provide the IPCE results for the (HA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 perovskite. The measured external quantum efficiency and corresponding integrated Jsc of the device of (HA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 are presented in Fig. 10b. The IPCE spectrum of (HA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 features saturation around the band gap of the perovskites, which exemplifies the contribution of the 2D perovskite to the current density. The measured Jsc is consistent with the integrated Jsc of 12.71 mA cm−2, which was estimated from IPCE in Fig. 10b. Furthermore, both forward and reverse scans show a negligible difference in the J–V curves, indicating low hysteresis (Fig. 10c). Fig. 10d shows the PCE histogram with a Gaussian distribution from 25 devices based on the (HA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 device. The histogram of average PCEs shows that 87.5% of the cells exhibit PCEs exceeding 5.4% under one sun illumination, leading to an average PCE of 5.66 ± 0.29% with a Voc of 0.72 V ± 0.02 V, a Jsc of 12.54 ± 0.65 mA cm−2, and an FF of 62.32 ± 2.49% (Table S1†).

Environmental humidity is the biggest cause of decomposition of the perovskite film. Thus, the hydrophobicity of the film can protect against degradation of the perovskite under humid ambient air conditions, leading to long-term stability under environmental factors. In this regard, we measured the water contact angle of films of HA(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) perovskites to verify the hydrophobicity. Fig. 11a compares images of the water contact angle for the corresponding films including a MAPbI3 film. The angle of a water droplet on the HA(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) perovskites indicates a decreased wetting character compared to the MAPbI3 film. In addition, it was noticed that as the n number was increased, the water contact angle increased and the highest contact angle was observed for the (HA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 film. This is because the contact angle on a substrate significantly depends not only on the chemical properties of the surface but also on its physical properties.56,57 As we can see in Fig. 9, as 3D MAPbI3 was introduced into the 2D perovskite, the grain size of the thin film increased initially, and then, with further increase of the MAPbI3 ratio, the features of the grain sizes gradually decreased in the n = 4 compound. Since the contact angle represents the physical properties of the surface and affects the quality of the films, herein, the contact angle was increased as the 2D layered perovskite approached the 3D perovskite due to the stable homogeneous film surface. As shown in Fig. 11b, we evaluated the photovoltaic performance upon storage in ambient air with relative humidity at 30–50% without encapsulation. The (HA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 device maintained 81.57% of its initial efficiency after 30 days. It was noted that a relative humidity of 30–50% does not decrease the Voc and FF of the 2D layered perovskite solar cell, but the Jsc was slightly decreased. The superior enduring stability of the (HA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 device in air indicates that long alkyl chain HA cations significantly retard the degradation of the perovskite resulting from moisture and oxygen under ambient air conditions.

To assess the photovoltaic effect of the HA(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) perovskites, we fabricated and comprehensively tested solar cells with a configuration of FTO/TiO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au. First, these solar cells were made in the atmosphere to overcome the problems of very sensitive perovskites to humidity and oxygen. Fig. 11 shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) results of the HA(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskite series cells. The photovoltaic parameters of the devices are shown in Table 3. The optimal device based on HA(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 3) demonstrated remarkably improved performance compared with the HAPbI4-based device. The improvement of the HA(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 3) perovskite device stems mainly from the increase of Jsc, which extended the solar spectrum absorption of the HA(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 3) perovskite film. We investigated the stability of the perovskite film under ambient oxygen and humidity. A remarkable long-term stability was maintained for the HA(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 3) based solar cells, while the bare MAPbI3 film lost its initial brown color and considerably degraded after 5 hours. The film became pale brown, which indicated decomposition of PbI2.

4. Conclusions
We introduced a long alkyl chain compound, hexylamine, into a 3D MAPbI3 perovskite to realize a high hydrophobic perovskite film, which is highly resistant to oxygen and moisture in ambient air. The hexylamine cations incorporated in the 3D perovskite retained the structural and electrical properties of the 3D structure, which resulted in remarkable device performance compared to the corresponding 2D perovskite. During the crystallization of the mixed perovskite, the hexylamine cations were disordered in the perovskite framework, which resulted in good penetration of the MAI cations into the space between the inorganic layers. This resulted in hydrophobic passivation, which added a hexylamine cation into the 3D perovskite produced PSC. It exhibited high stability under considerably humid conditions. We expect that through the inclusion of a hydrophobic compound into the 3D perovskite our approach will open up industrialization of perovskite based PV technology with high production as well as long-term stability.
