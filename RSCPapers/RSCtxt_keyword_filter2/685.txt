    , Accepted 29th April 2019First published on 3rd May 2019AbstractSix push–pull sensitizers (MD1 to MD6) having rhodanine-3-acetic acid acting as an electron withdrawing group and N-alkyl/aryl amine as a donor moiety were planned and prepared to rationalize the influence of donor alteration on absorption/emission properties and photon to current conversion efficiency (η). The structures of all the sensitizers were ascertained by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, mass spectroscopy and CHN analysis. The photophysical parameters of these sensitizers were recorded in nine solvents having different polarities to study the solvatochromic behavior of these dyes. Nanocrystalline mesoporous TiO2 based DSSCs were constructed by employing MD1 to MD6. The overall photon to current conversion efficiency was obtained in the range from 2.75% to 5.06% where the MD2 chromophore shows the highest efficiency of 5.06%. All efficiencies were correlated with the structural modification of the donor moiety to establish a structure–property relationship. The improved light to power conversion efficiency of MD2 is because of its high short circuit current Jsc (12.70 mA), high resistance in electron recombination and longer lifetime of injected electrons. The rigidity of the donor moiety (MD1) results in stabilization of the HOMO energy level, which increases the band gap and shows a decrease in efficiency along with a blue shift in the photophysical properties. N-Alkylation of the donor moiety (MD4–MD6) causes an increase in the molar absorptivity but affects the conjugation and shows a negative impact on efficiency. Lack of planarity in the pi-conjugation (MD3) has a negative impact on the photophysical and photovoltaic properties. An extensive DFT study reveals that the experimental absorption of all the dyes has very good correlation with theoretical vertical excitation obtained by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT).
Introduction
Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs), an encouraging profitable substitute for silicon-based traditional solar cells, have achieved vital significance due to their potential applicability.1–3 The first generation DSSCs described by Grätzel and co-workers contain four main parts – a light absorbing sensitizer, a TiO2 based working electrode to collect the electrons from the excited sensitizer, a counter electrode composed of a platinum layer on conducting glass and a hole transporting electrolyte.4 A sensitizer traps the light energy and plays a substantial part in determining the photon-to-electricity conversion efficiency.5–10 Ideally, the LUMO energy level of a good sensitizer is higher than the conduction band of TiO2 for effective injection of electrons into the TiO2 electrode and the HOMO energy level is lower than the redox energy level of the electrolyte for efficient regeneration of the dye. The absorption spectrum of a good sensitizer covers the visible region extending to the near-IR.11,12 In the past few decades many researchers have utilized ruthenium,13–18 porphyrin19–21 and various organic based dyes in DSSCs.22–25 A wide range of ruthenium centered dyes have been synthesized and explored in the past and their efficiency lies in the range of 6–12%.11,26–28 The practical applicability of these dyes is very limited due to low absorptivity, harmful environmental properties, exertion in purification, scarcity of ruthenium metals and cost.11,22 In recent years, sensitizers with a porphyrin core have achieved more value as they have very high efficiencies. The porphyrin dyes show an intense absorption Soret band due to S0–S2 transition at 400 nm and a weak Q band due to S0–S1 transition at 550 nm, which leads to a broad absorption spectrum which is good for high conversion efficiencies.29–31 The alteration in the optical properties of porphyrin is achieved by changing the central metal atom and peripheral structural modification.21,32–35 In spite of having high light to electricity conversion efficiency, the tedious synthesis and purification make the porphyrin dyes less popular for commercialization. Along with the development of metal based sensitizers, many metal-free donor–π–acceptor based organic sensitizers have been developed concurrently in recent years.10,36–38 The ease of synthesis, accessibility of the starting materials, simple structural modification, ease of optical property alteration and high molar extinction coefficients11 make them a very popular alternative as a sensitizer. In metal free sensitizers, the donor plays a crucial role in enhancing the light to current conversion efficiency.39 Various donors have been reported, out of which coumarin, indoline, phenothiazine, phenoxazine, hemicyanine, squaraine, alkoxy, N-alky amine, N-aryl amine, especially triphenylamine, and carbazole based sensitizers have played a vital role in DSSCs.40–49 Many researchers have effectively used triphenylamine based sensitizers to achieve 3–9% light to current conversion efficiency, whereas a modified carbazole group has been explored to get 2–9% light to current conversion efficiency. In recent years, many N-alkylated and N-arylated dyes have been used to achieve better efficiency.50–53 Due to the higher light to current conversion ratio, aryl amines are used as suitable candidates for organic sensitizers. A small modification in the donor can result in a significant variation in the properties and efficiency of the donor. In this paper, we have used six different arylamine based (1a–1f) donors for the synthesis of six (MD1–MD6) DSSC chromophores in order to correlate the effect of donor modification on light to current conversion efficiency (Scheme 1). These molecules have been extensively studied to determine the influence of donor modification on photophysical behavior in different solvents. All of these molecules have been optimized using density functional theory with a view to understand the charge transfer in the ground and excited state. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations were performed to correlate the observed absorption maxima with theoretical vertical excitation.

Results and discussion
Molecular design and synthesis
The role of a donor moiety as an organic sensitizer is vital in determining the total light to electricity conversion efficiency. In this paper, we have modified the donor to study the effect of donor rigidization and substitution of the N-aryl group with an N-alkyl chain on the structural properties, HOMO–LUMO band gaps, photophysical properties and conversion efficiencies. We have synthesized six different aldehydes with modified donors. They were condensed with a rhodanine-3-acetic acid anchoring group by Knoevenagel condensation to get final compounds MD1–MD6. All the dyes were purified by column chromatography and successfully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, mass spectroscopy and elemental analysis techniques. Molecular structures of the chromophores were optimized in the gas phase and in solvents using DFT calculations. Detailed characterization data and optimized structures are provided in the ESI† in the Synthesis section.
In the case of MD1, N-phenyl carbazole is used as a fused rigid donor which has a freely rotatable phenyl ring attached to nitrogen. To this rigid N-phenyl carbazole anchoring group, rhodanine-3-acetic acid is directly attached to obtain MD1. Compound MD2 contains a triphenylamine group as a donor where all three phenyl rings rotate freely, which leads to steric hindrance. MD2 having triphenylamine as a donor was synthesized and compared with MD1 to rationalize the influence of donor rigidization on the properties. In the case of MD3N-phenyl carbazole is used as a donor where the anchoring group is attached to the phenyl ring, which is free to rotate and the carbazole group will act as a bulky group. Comparison of MD3 with MD1 is done to evaluate the effect of free rotation and extended conjugation. Introduction of an N-alkyl group is easier than N-arylation, which in turn requires either metal catalysts or harsh reaction conditions. MD4 and MD5 were synthesized from N-hexyl carbazole and N-hexyl biphenyl amine whereas, for MD6N,N-dihexylaniline has been used. Comparison of MD4 with MD1 and MD5 with MD2 is done to streamline the effect of N-alkyl and N-aryl modification, whereas MD6 is compared with MD2 to highlight the effect of N,N-dialkylation.
Photophysical properties
The absorption and emission spectra of MD1–MD6 recorded in nine solvents are shown in Fig. S1–S6 in the ESI† and the photophysical data are tabulated in Tables S1–S6 in the ESI† respectively. MD1 shows the lowest absorption maximum of 433 nm in ethyl acetate. An increase in the solvent polarity leads to positive solvatochromism in the case of MD1. MD1 shows exceptional behavior in non-polar MDC (dichloromethane) where the absorption maximum shows the highest value of 446 nm. The lowest emission maximum at 482 nm was observed in 1,4-dioxane whereas in the case of DMSO and MDC the highest emission maximum of 528 nm was observed. The Stokes shifts are calculated by taking the difference between the absorption and emission maxima on the wavenumber scale. The lowest Stokes shift of 42 nm is observed in 1,4-dioxane whereas the highest Stokes shift of 86 nm was observed in acetonitrile and DMSO solvent. The large Stokes shift might be due to the effective charge transfer from the electron donating carbazole moiety to the electron withdrawing rhodanine-3-acetic acid which is further proved by the pictorial presentation of the HOMO–LUMO electron density as shown in Fig. 3. Nearly the same trend has been observed for MD2 to MD6. The comparison of the experimental absorption along with the vertical excitation obtained by TD-DFT in the respective solvents is replicated in Tables S7–S12 (ESI†). The vertical excitation of all the compounds that arises due to the HOMO to LUMO electronic transition in different solvents is comparable with the observed absorption. The orbital contribution for all the vertical excitation lies in the range of 98.8 to 99.5%. Photophysical data and vertical excitation obtained from the TD-DFT calculation of compounds MD1 to MD6 in acetonitrile are shown in Table 1 and the normalized absorption and emission spectra of MD1 to MD6 in acetonitrile are shown in Fig. 1. By comparing the absorption and emission of all six dyes in acetonitrile it is evident that structural modification plays a very crucial role in determining the photophysical properties. In the case of MD1, in which two phenyl rings are fused, the absorption maximum lies at 437 nm and the emission maximum is at 523 nm. In the case of MD2 where rigidization is absent the absorption maximum shows a significant redshift, and lies at 468 nm while the emission maximum remains unaffected at 523 nm. Rigidization leads to a blue shift in the absorption maxima, which clearly suggests an increase in the band gap of MD1, which is further proved by DFT. For MD3, in which the acceptor lies on the free phenyl ring, the absorption lies at 401 nm and the emission lies at 586 nm. By comparing the absorption of MD3 with that of MD1 we can conclude that the position of the acceptor plays a very crucial role in determining the absorption and emission maxima. The blue shifted absorption of MD3 can be explained based on DFT. The optimized geometry of MD3 (given in ESI†) shows a rigid carbazole ring that is out of the plane with respect to the acceptor and that breaks the extended conjugation resulting in a blue shift. MD4, in which N-hexyl carbazole is used as a donor, shows absorption at 438 nm and emission at 524 nm. By comparing the absorption values of MD1 and MD4 in acetonitrile we can conclude that the single N-alkylation instead of N-arylation does not have a significant impact on the absorption maxima. The same can be concluded for MD2 and MD5 where the absorption maxima are at 468 nm and 464 nm respectively and both differ in the substituent at the nitrogen. MD6, in which two phenyl rings are replaced by two long hexyl chains, showed an absorption maximum at 480 nm. Fig. S7 in the ESI† shows the absorption spectra of MD1–MD6 on a titania surface. From Fig. S7 (ESI†) it is quite evident that MD2 shows the highest absorption intensity among all the dyes while MD3 shows the lowest absorption intensity when adsorbed on the TiO2 surface. All the dyes show a slight blue shift in the absorption maxima in comparison with MD2. The absorption intensities of these chromophores were in the order of MD2 > MD1 > MD4 > MD5 > MD6 > MD3. The geometry and orientation of the groups in the sensitizer at the ground and excited states are reliant on solvent polarity. The structures at the ground and excited states play a crucial role in determining the optical properties. An exhaustive analysis of the impact of the surrounding solvent on the absorption and emission of the molecules was carried out to correlate the role of the ground state and excited state geometries in the optical properties. Here, we have tried to explore the effect of solvent polarity on the molecules having an alteration in the donor. Polarity plots have been explored to evaluate the solvatochromic behavior of MD1–MD6. The solvent polarity function (Kirkwood–Bauer–Magat function), solvent polarizability function (Lorentz–Lorenz function), Lippert–Mataga function,54 McRae function,55 Weller function,56 Rettig's function,57 Bakshiev's function58 and Reichardt–Dimroth function (ETN)59 were employed to analyse these molecules. The Kirkwood–Bauer–Magat function reflects the correlation of the solvent dielectric constant (ε) and the excited state of the molecule, while the Lorentz–Lorenz function is utilized to obtain the solvent polarizability plot which reflects the correlation between the solvent refractive index (n) and the excited state of the properties of the sensitizer. The Kirkwood–Bauer–Magat function (solvent polarity function) and Lorentz–Lorenz function (solvent polarisibility function) are given in eqn (1) and (2) respectively.

 Fig. 1  Normalised absorption and emission spectra of MD1–MD6. 
Solvent polarity equation: (1)
Solvent polarizability equation: (2)Lippert Mataga function, McRae function, Weller's function, Rettig's function and Bakshiev's function explores the combination of solvent polarity f(ε) and solvent polarizability functions f(n).
The equations are as follows:
In the Lippert–Mataga equation, Stokes shift is represented by: (3)where, μg and μe are the dipole moments in the ground and excited states respectively; h is Plank's constant; c is the velocity of light in a vacuum. The equation is further modified as follows: Stokes shift = mfLM(ε,n) + constant(4)Here, m is the slope of the graph obtained by plotting fLM(ε,n) versus Stokes shift and the Lippert–Mataga polarity function fLM(ε,n) is defined as: (5)In the McRae equation, Stokes shift is represented by: (6)This equation can be written as, Stokes shift = m1fMR(ε,n) + constant(7)where, the McRae polarity function fMR(ε,n) is defined as: (8)
Emission maxima estimated in cm−1 are utilized for Weller and Rettig's functions. The Weller equation is given as follows, (9)where fw(ε,n) is Weller's function which is defined as: (10)
The geometry of the molecule and charge distribution at the excited state play a vital role in governing the twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT). Rettig's function is utilized to explore the possibility of TICT in the molecules. The equation for Rettig's function is as follows: (11)where fR is Rettig's function which is given as follows: (12)According to the Bakhshiev equation, Stokes shift is given as (13)

Eqn (13) is further modified to; Δ = m2fBakhshiev(ε,n) + constant(14)

f
Bakhshiev(ε,n) is Bakshiev's polarity function and is defined as, (15)m2 is the slope of the graph obtained by plotting, fBakhshiev(ε,n) vs. Stokes shift (Δ).
According to the Reichardt–Dimroth function (ETN), Stokes shift is given as: (16)

Eqn (16) can also be written as; (17)where, (18) (19)The solvent polarity plots of MD1–MD6 are shown in Fig. S8–S13 (ESI†) respectively. The nonlinear solvent polarizability plots (Lorentz–Lorenz function) of MD1–MD6 suggest that the refractive index of the solvents is not playing a major role in determining the ground and excited state properties of the molecules whereas the linearity of the solvent polarity plot for MD1 to MD6 underlines the importance of dielectric polarizability of the solvent in determining the optical behavior of the molecules. MD1 to MD6 show good linear correlation for the Lippert Mataga, and McRae equations. This linearity suggests that the polarizability of the solute is also affecting the optical and solvatochromic behavior of these molecules. Weller's plot is utilized to evaluate the charge transfer from the donor to acceptor while Rettig's plot is explored to determine the possibility of twisted intramolecular charge transfer. The ETN correlation is utilized to describe solvatochromic behaviour based on microscopic solvent polarity. Except for MD5, all the other molecules show good linear correlation with Weller and Rettig's Plots which suggests the possibility of having pronounced twisted intramolecular charge transfer in these molecules and during charge transfer both the absorption maxima and emission maxima are dependent on solvent polarity. All the molecules under study show good linear correlation with the ETN function which explains the positive solvatochromic behaviour. The Bilot–Kawski function,60,61 Bakhshiev function58,59 and Liptay function62 were explored to estimate the ratio of dipole moment which is shown in Table S13 (ESI†). The ratio is more than unity for all the molecules, which suggests that the excited state of MD1 to MD6 is more polar than the ground state.
Multiple linear regression analysis has been utilized to determine various types of interactions present between the solute and solvent which in turn are responsible for governing the photophysical properties of the molecules. It is also explored to understand the mechanism of the electronic transition from the ground state to the excited state. The shape, position and intensity of the excitation spectra are utilized to explain the correlation between the spectral shift calculated by Kamlet–Taft parameters and the solvent–solute interaction. The photophysical properties in wave numbers i.e. absorption (νabs), fluorescence (νemi) and Stokes shift (ν0) of the dyes were correlated with Kamlet–Taft parameters alpha (α), beta (β), and pi star (π*) using multiple linear regression analysis. Alpha and beta determine the hydrogen bond donor acidity and hydrogen bond acceptor basicity of the solvent, respectively. π* is explored to determine the dipolarity and polarizability of the solvent. The data obtained using multiple linear regression are explored to understand the mode of transitions between the ground and excited states using solute–solvent interactions. The Kamlet–Taft equation is represented as follows. V = V0 + aα + bβ + cπ*(20)where V is the outcome of a solvent dependent property which is to be correlated while V0 represents the value of the reference system and a, b and c are the solvent independent coefficients for alpha, beta and π* which are characteristic for a particular compound.
A four-parameter based Catalan solvent scale, which considers the polarizability, dipolarity, acidity and basicity of a solvent, was also studied to get a better fit than the three-parameter Kamlet–Taft scale. The equation for the Catalan solvent scale is represented as follows. V = V0 + aSA+ bSB + cSPP + dSP(21)where SA, SB, SP and SPP represent acidity, basicity, polarizability and dipolarity of the solvent. The results obtained by performing multiple linear regression analysis using the Kamlet–Taft equation and Catalan equation for MD1 to MD6 are shown in Table S14 (ESI†). Multiple linear analysis of the dyes was carried out in different solvents using absorption, emission and Stokes shift data. The multiple linear regression analysis of absorption and emission of MD1 using the Kamlet–Taft equation shows positive values of regression coefficients with increasing basicity (bβ) of the solvent but the Stoke's shift of MD1 is majorly affected by solvent acidity (aα) and the combination of dipolarity and polarizability (cπ*). Meanwhile, the Catalan equation shows the positive impact of increasing basicity (bSB) on absorption and emission while Stoke's shift is affected by increasing acidity (aSA) and dipolarity (dSPP) of the solvent and independent of solvent basicity (bSB) and polarizability (dSP). For MD2, multiple linear regression analysis of the absorption and emission maxima shows positive values of regression coefficients with increasing basicity (bβ) of the solvent and a good regression coefficient while Stoke's shift of MD2 is majorly affected by all the Kamlet Taft parameters. According to the Catalan equation, for MD2, the absorption and emission maxima show a linear relationship with increasing solvent basicity (bSB), while Stoke's shift is affected by dipolarity (cSPP) of the solvent and independent of other parameters. For MD3, the multiple linear regression analysis of absorption using the Kamlet–Taft equation shows positive values for solvent acidity (aα) and solvent basicity (bβ) with a poor regression coefficient. While the emission maxima show a linear relationship with solvent basicity (bβ). The Stoke's shift of MD3 is affected by all three Kamlet–Taft parameters. The Catalan analysis of MD3 shows that absorption of the molecule is affected by solvent acidity (aSA), solvent basicity (bSB) and solvent dipolarity, while the emission maxima are affected by solvent basicity (bSB) and solvent polarizability (dSP). In the case of MD4, absorption maxima show linearity with solvent acidity and solvent basicity according to the Kamlet–Taft and Catalan equation, while emission shows linearity with solvent basicity and solvent polarizability according to the Catalan equation. In MD4, Stoke's shift is affected by all the Kamlet–Taft parameters while only solvent acidity and solvent dipolarity show linear behaviour according to the Catalan equation. For MD5, solvent basicity affects the absorption and Stoke's shift according to the Kamlet–Taft equation while the Catalan equation suggests the impact of solvent basicity on absorption, emission and Stoke's shift. For MD6, absorption and Stoke's shift are largely affected by solvent acidity and solvent basicity according to the Kamlet–Taft equation while according to the Catalan equation, solvent basicity affects largely absorption and emission.
Electrochemical properties
Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) analysis was carried out by employing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in acetonitrile as the supporting electrolyte in the three-electrode cell. A glassy carbon electrode acting as the working electrode, platinum wire working as the counter electrode and Ag/Ag+ working as the reference were immersed in the dye solution prepared by the supporting electrolyte solution. The oxidation wave seen in all the dyes is attributed to the removal of an electron from the lone pair present on the nitrogen atom of the donor segment. The oxidation potential values are shown in Table 2 while the DPV is shown in Fig. 2. The HOMO–LUMO energy values obtained from the optimized structures of the sensitizers are given in Table 3 while the electron density distribution at the HOMO and LUMO level is reproduced as shown in Fig. 3. At the HOMO level the accumulation of electron density is maximum on the electron rich donor nitrogen atom and the sulphur atom present in rhodanine-3-acetic acid while it shifts to the electron withdrawing carbonyl group at the LUMO level. This shifting of electron density represents the charge separation upon excitation. From Table 2, the oxidation potentials (EHOMO) are more positive than the redox potential of the (I/I3)-redox couple. This indicates the thermodynamic feasibility for reduction of the oxidized dye by an I− ion present in the electrolyte. The reduction potentials (ELUMO), which correspond to the LUMO level of the dyes, are obtained from the following equation:ELUMO = EHOMO − E0onsetE0onset is the excited state energy of the dye, which is estimated from DPV. The higher value of ELUMO than the conduction band potential of TiO2 suggests the thermodynamic feasibility of electron injection from the LUMO level of the dye to the conduction band of TiO2. The HOMO–LUMO energy levels obtained by DFT and the band gap are comparable with experimental cyclic voltammetry data and show a similar trend. On comparing the HOMO–LUMO values of MD1 having a rigid carbazole group with MD2 having a triphenyl group it is clear that rigidization leads to the stabilization of the HOMO level with slight destabilization of the LUMO level increasing the band gap whereas free rotation of the phenyl group or alkyl chain results in destabilization of the HOMO level resulting in ease of electron excitation from the HOMO to LUMO level which is more favourable for DSSCs.

Photovoltaic performance
The photophysical and electrochemical results suggest that the sensitizers MD1 to MD6 have appropriate light absorption properties and ground/excited state oxidation potentials for their use in DSSCs. From the DFT and electrochemical studies it is evident that all sensitizers under study have their LUMO energy levels higher than the conduction band of TiO2 essential for smooth electron injection on the working electrode while the HOMO level is sufficiently lower for dye regeneration by accepting an electron from the electrolyte. The photovoltaic characteristics of the cells are measured under AM1.5 solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2) and the J–V spectra are shown in Fig. 4(a). The photovoltaic parameters such as short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and overall conversion efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 4. The results show the impact of donor moiety alteration on the light to current conversion efficiency. Taking MD2 as a prototype we have synthesized MD1 to MD6 in order to understand the impact of donor moiety modification on the performance of the dye-sensitized solar cells. Several groups have reported the power conversion efficiency of MD2 at around 2.5%63–65 which is much less as compared to the efficiency of 5.05% which we have obtained under improved conditions. Furthermore, we have compared the performance of these dyes with their close analogues reported in the literature.45,48,49,66–72 A comparative table is given in Table S15 (ESI†) which suggests the excellent performance of these dyes under improved conditions. Under the same conditions MD1, MD3, MD4, MD5 and MD6 sensitized solar cells gave overall power conversion efficiencies (η) of 4.09%, 2.65%, 3.80%, 2.93% and 2.75%, respectively. Hence it is clear that the photovoltaic performances of DSSCs can be affected by altering the donors in sensitizers. MD2 showed the highest PCE among the synthesized chromophore dyes. The PCEs of these chromophores are in the order of MD2 > MD1 > MD4 > MD5 > MD6 > MD3, respectively.

MD1 and MD2 having a carbazole and triphenylamine donor group show excellent charge separation and good absorbance coefficient but the HOMO–LUMO band gap of MD1 is slightly higher than that of MD2. The slightly larger short circuit current (Jsc) of MD2 over MD1 may be attributed to relatively easy electron transfer from the donor (D) moiety to the anchoring (A) moiety which may be due to the lower band gap. On comparing MD1 with MD2 it is quite evident that rigidization at the donor moiety leads to an increase in the band-gap due to the stabilization of the HOMO level. MD1 and MD3 are positional isomers having a difference in the position of the acceptor, which shows a drastic change in efficiency.

MD1 shows an efficiency of 4.16% where the acceptor group is present on the rigid ring, while MD3, where the acceptor is attached to the phenyl group and can rotate in space, shows an efficiency of 2.65%, which is almost half in comparison to that of MD1. From the optimized structures, given in the ESI† it is quite evident that for MD3 the phenyl ring to which the acceptor is linked remains out of the plane with respect to the donating carbazole moiety resulting in poor delocalization of donating electron pairs of nitrogen. This is attributed to lower light absorbance maxima (λmax = 401 nm) and a low molar extinction coefficient (15200 M−1 cm−1); hence MD3 shows poor PCE with the lowest Jsc of 7.17 mA. The above results imply the significance of orientation in space and planarity for higher efficiency. In the case of the N-alkyl substituted chromophores MD4–MD6, though the absorbance maxima and molar extinction coefficients are high, the PCE is low due to the poor charge separation between the donor (D) moiety and anchoring (A) moiety. The N-alkylation instead of N-arylation leads to poor delocalization of electrons and it also affects the donating capacity of the donor moiety due to the poor inductive effect. This results in slower regeneration kinetics of dyes with an alkyl substituent on the donor moiety.45N-Alkyl substituted MD4 to MD6 showed lower Jsc and PCE with respect to their N-phenyl substituted homologs MD1 and MD2. To further elucidate the performance of DSSCs containing modified donors, the EIS was measured in the two-electrode configuration under a forward bias in the dark. Fig. 4(b) shows the equivalent circuit that is fitted with the impedance of the device. The DSSC Nyquist plot has three arcs and each arc represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the platinum FTO/I−/I3− redox electrolyte interface, recombination resistance (Rrec) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface and ion diffusion in the electrolyte.73–75 The impedance results (given in Table S16, ESI†) revealed that the electron transport properties of the MD2 chromophore dye based device are quite enhanced, which has been reflected by the mid-frequency range and the recombination is higher than that of the other remaining chromophoric dye devices. The radius of the mid-frequency semi-circles decreases in the order MD2 > MD1 > MD4 > MD5 > MD6 > MD3. The Rct at platinized CEs is quite comparable in all the chromophoric dye based devices but a huge difference has been observed in the recombination resistance (Rrec). The recombination resistance, Rrec of the MD2 based device is higher than that of the other remaining devices, which supports the better performance of MD2 over other dyes. Furthermore, to investigate the electron recombination in the MD series dye based DSSCs, open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) is measured as the performance of DSSCs completely depends on the kinetics of the electron transfer process. We have measured the transient Voc, as a function of time upon turning off the illumination. Fig. 5(a) shows the OCVD curves and electron-carrier lifetime (τn) of the DSSCs, which is derived from the following equation.49,76  where, KB, T, e and (dVoc/dt) are the Boltzmann constant, absolute temperature, electron charge and derivation of the open circuit voltage, respectively. From the OCVD curve it is quite evident that MD2 has the highest Voc and shows steady decay while for MD3 the decay is sharp. The τn of the MD2 device is approximately two times greater in comparison with the other remaining devices at all voltages, which indicates that the device with an MD2 sensitizer has better electron injection in the titania layer compared with other molecules of the MD series. The Tafel polarization measurement was carried out by using a CHI660E electrochemical workstation to determine the catalytic activity on the TiO2 electrode–electrolyte surface and the spectra are shown in Fig. 5(b).
 Fig. 5  (a) Open circuit voltage decay curve (inset: electron carrier lifetime). (b) Tafel polarization plot. 
All DSSC devices were swept with DC potential from ±0.65 V with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in the dark. The Tafel polarization plot is used to determine the charge transfer of the I−/I3− redox couple on the TiO2 surface.77 The rate of cathodic (αc) and anodic (αa) reaction at the titania electrode and the I−/I3− electrolyte interface can be described by the equation.78,79  where, j is the total current density, Eeq is the equilibrium potential of electrolyte, j0 is the current exchange density, E is the applied voltage and α is the transfer coefficient, while a and c are the anodic and cathodic rate transfer coefficients. In dark conditions, j = j0 as E = Eeq, where the j0 value depends on the electrolyte concentration and active titania surface area. The j0 value is calculated from the intersection of a linear branch of the anodic and cathodic curve obtained in the polarization spectra. The slope of the cathodic (βc) and anodic (βa) branch is given in Table 4. The anodic slope values for all the dyes are lower than the cathodic slope values, which corresponds to the recombination reaction at the dye + titania electrode/electrolyte interface between the electron from the conduction band of TiO2 and I3− in the electrolyte. The anodic slope for MD2 is 154.25 mV per decade which is the lowest among the series and suggests the increased reaction of I− ions at the dye TiO2 electrode–electrolyte interference. As the anodic slope increases for other dyes increases, the reaction of I− ions at the dye TiO2 electrode–electrolyte interference decreases.
Experimental
Chemicals and instruments
All technical grade solvents and reagents needed for chemical reaction and purification were obtained from Sigma Aldrich and Merck and utilized without additional purification. 3-Methoxypropionitrile (MNP), titanium(IV) isopropoxide, lithium iodide, iodine, 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (<25 nm), ethyl cellulose and α-terpineol were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used as they are. The transparent conducting glass plates (FTO, 12 Ω, thickness 2.22 mm, Solaronix) and Meltronix tape (20 μm) were utilized for the fabrication of the DSSC device. The reaction was monitored using percolated silica gel TLC plates in a chloroform:methanol (95:5) solvent system. 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR analyses of the sensitizer were carried out using a VARIAN 500-MHz (USA) by employing tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. The absorption spectra in various solvents for all the chromophores were measured using a PerkinElmer Lambda 25 spectrometer while fluorescence spectra were measured using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded on Solartron 1260 + 1287 interfaces, while the CorrView and Zplot software were utilized for interpretation of Electrochemical Impedances that were measured under dark conditions at −0.6 V bias along with a sweeping frequency from 120 kHz to 0.1 Hz having an AC amplitude of 10 mV. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) was recorded using the electrochemical workstation CHI660E, USA. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) analysis was carried out by employing an external potential bias to the cell and the generated photocurrent was measured using a Keithley 2450 digital source meter. A xenon lamp (solar simulator, PET, USA) calibrated with the light intensity 100 mW cm−2 under AM 1.5G solar light conditions by a certified silicon solar cell were utilized as a light source. Open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD), lifetime curves and Tafel polarization were obtained by using a Solartron (1260) electrochemical analyser with a sweeping potential at ±0.65 V in the dark with a 25 mV s−1 scan rate.
Computational methods
Density functional theory was employed to carry out optimization of the sensitizers in the gas phase and solvents. Well-known functional, B3LYP80 which combines Becke's three parameter exchange functional (B3)81 and the nonlocal correlation functional by Lee, Yang, and Parr (LYP)82 have been explored for optimization. The local minima at the ground state and excited vibration frequencies were computed using DFT calculation by employing B3LYP83 and 6-31G++(d) basis sets. The polarizable continuum model (PCM)84,85 is used for optimization in solvents as implemented in Gaussian 09. All the calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 program.86
Cell fabrications
A sandwich DSSC cell was fabricated by using a nano-crystalline TiO2 photoelectrode as the working electrode and a platinized FTO glass plate as the counter electrode.73 A transparent layer of TiO2 (obtained from Dyesol, 18 NR) having 9 μm thickness (measured by using the Veeco Dektak 150 Stylus surface profiler) was applied on the FTO glass plate. The adsorption of the dye on the photoelectrode was done by immersing the photoelectrode overnight in 3 mM solution of the dye in ethanol. A solution of 0.5 M lithium iodide (LiI), 0.05 M iodine (I2), 0.5 M tert-butyl pyridine (TBP), and 0.5 M guanidium thiocyanate (GSCN) in 3-methoxy propionitrile is employed as the I−/I3− electrolyte. The electrolyte was introduced into the cell through the predrilled back holes onto the Pt-counter electrode. Holes were sealed using an epoxy adhesive and the DSSCs were stored in the dark at room temperature for 12 h prior to measurements. Active areas of the DSSCs were set to 0.16 cm2 and were maintained constant using the same screen for coating.
Conclusions
To conclude, here we have described the synthesis and photovoltaic applications of six chromophores MD1 to MD6. The photophysical parameters and solvent polarity plots of these sensitizers were studied in nine solvents with different polarities and correlated with donor alteration. The theoretical vertical excitation estimated by employing Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) shows very good agreement with experimental absorption maxima. The photophysical properties of all the sensitizers are sensitivite towards donor alteration and solvent polarity. Donor alteration plays an important role in determining photophysical and photovoltaic properties. The observed photovoltaic properties were successfully correlated with structural modifications. Rigidization of the donor core leads to the stabilization of the HOMO level significantly which leads to an increase in the band gap and shows an adverse effect on efficiency. Proper orientation in space and planarity in conjugation has a positive impact on efficiency by improving the charge separation. N-Alkylation leads to an increase in the molar extinction coefficient, but poor delocalization and poor charge separation lead to a decrease in the efficiency.
