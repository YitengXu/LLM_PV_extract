    , Accepted 30th January 2014First published on 30th January 2014AbstractA new thiazolothiazole based small molecule (DTTz-DTBTT) has been designed and synthesized. The small molecule exhibited good thermal stability and excellent solubility. The optical gap of DTTz-DTBTT was estimated to be 1.65 eV. The solution-processed photovoltaic device based on DTTz-DTBTT and PC61BM exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 1.64%.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been extensively investigated due to their unique features, such as low energy consumption, mechanical flexibility, large area coverage and low-cost manufacturing.1–3 In the past decade, intensive interdisciplinary efforts have been dedicated to improving the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of solar cells.4,5 Solution-processed solar cells based on π-conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives have reached over 9% PCEs,6 and the perovskite-sensitized solar cells have shown exciting 15% PCEs.7 Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure, which increases the donor–acceptor (D–A) interface areas for photo-induced exciton dissociation in the active layer by forming an interpenetrating network of electron donor and acceptor components, has become one of the most successful device structures developed to date.8,9 More recently, the PCEs have been rapidly increasing in solution-processed small molecule OSCs.10–12 One main advantage of small molecule OSCs over polymeric counterparts is their facile characterization and purification.13 The purification of semiconducting materials has recently been proven to be crucial to achieve high PCEs in “small molecule” OSCs.14 However, solution-processed small molecule OSCs containing low-molecular-weight compounds as donors showed relatively low efficiencies due to the unmatched sizes of donors and acceptors.15 At this point, the small molecular design strategies for new donor materials with appropriate physical properties such as low band-gap and suitable energy levels have been employed to improve the performance of OSCs. Among them, a large number of small molecules with donor–acceptor (D–A) architectures have been successfully applied as solar cell donors and exhibited excellent device performances.16,17 By varying D–A segment chemical structure, these D–A type organic small molecules exhibited a wide absorption spectrum and suitable energy levels which could contribute to the open circuit voltage (VOC) and efficient exciton dissociation in solar cell devices.16,17 The PCEs of solution-processed OSCs based on D–A low band-gap small molecules as donors have exceeded 8%, as reported by groups of Y. S. Chen and G. C. Bazan, respectively.18,19 In order to obtain a broad absorption spectrum and lower energy levels of small molecules, the introduction of two different acceptors into the conjugated small molecule backbone may be a good choice. However, there were very few small molecule OSC donor materials, based on two different acceptors units, exhibiting remarkable success.20 Recently, the small molecule donor materials with two acceptor units have achieved PCEs of 3.07–5.5%, which are promising donor materials for solution-processed OSCs.16–20 A further study on this type of solution-processed small molecule OSCs is underway.
Thiazolothiazole (Tz) has a rigid and coplanar fused ring, thereby ensuring a highly extended π–electron system and strong π–π stacking. As a result, conjugated small molecules and polymers based on Tz units exhibited high charge carrier mobilities.21,22 Recently, several thiazolothiazole-based copolymers and small molecules have been successfully applied in organic solar cells.23 Among the variety of developed acceptor units, benzothiadiazole (BT) has attracted much attention because of its special properties of controlling the energy levels in D–A conjugated molecules.24–26 High performance OSCs were achieved by blending BT-based copolymers and fullerene derivatives, such as benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-BT,27 diketopyrrolopyrrole-BT,28 and carbazole-BT.29 Thus, Tz and BT units could be employed in the design of semiconductive small molecules for solution-processed OSC applications.
In this work, we reported a new conjugated small molecule, DTTz-DTBTT, using the Tz unit as the central core, thiophene as the π-bridge, and BT as the acceptor unit (Scheme 1). The targeted molecule has good solubility in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), chloroform (CH3Cl) and tetrahydrofuran (THF). The optical gap of DTTz-DTBTT estimated from the absorption onset of thin film was 1.65 eV with a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of around −5.05 eV. The solution-processed OSCs based on DTTz-DTBTT were investigated in typical BHJ devices using PC61BM as an acceptor.

NMR spectroscopy was carried out on a Bruker Advance III 600 spectrometer using tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. High resolution mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker Maxis UHR TOF spectrometer in APCI mode. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was carried out on a Hitachi U-4100 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammograms were measured on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation. Surface roughness and morphology of thin films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) on an Agilent 5400.

Devices fabrication
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated by a simple spin-coating process, with a general device structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DTTz-DTBTT:PC61BM/Ca/Al. The ITO-coated glasses were ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, toluene, methanol, and isopropyl alcohol, subsequently. Oxygen plasma treatment was done for 10 min as the final step of substrate cleaning to improve the contact angle just before film coating. Onto the ITO glass a layer of polyethylenedioxythiophene–polystyrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) film was spin-coated from its aqueous dispersion with a thickness of 40 nm. PEDOT:PSS film was dried at 160 °C for 30 min in the vacuum oven. The solution of the DTTz-DTBTT and fullerenes in CHCl3 was prepared in a nitrogen-filled dry box (Vacuum Atmosphere Co.) and spin-coated on the top of the ITO/PEDOT. The typical thickness of the active layer was 100 nm. Typical concentration of the small molecule/PC61BM blending solution used in this study for the spin-coating active layer was 10 mg ml−1. Subsequently Ca (10 nm) and Al (100 nm) were thermally evaporated under a vacuum of 2 × 10−4 Pa on the top of the active layer as a cathode. Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured under illumination of the AM 1.5G solar simulator with 100 mW cm−2 power. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a source meter, silicon photodiode and a computer-controlled light source-monochromator-Lock-in system.12b
Result and discussion
Synthesis and thermal stability
The synthetic route for preparation of small molecules, DTTz-DTBTT, is outlined in Scheme 1. Compound (5) was synthesized through a four-step reaction of compound 4,7-dibromo-benzo[1,2,5]thiadiazole (1) using Stille coupling and bromination reactions. The targeted molecule was synthesized by Stille coupling between compound (5) and 2,5-bis(trimethyltin-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (6).23 All the synthesis process and the purification procedure were all well repeated with moderate and high yields. The purity of the targeted compound for the device fabrication was guaranteed by repeated column purification. The small molecule was soluble in common organic solvents, which was a prerequisite for solution-processed small molecule OSCs. The thermal properties of DTTz-DTBTT were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). This molecule exhibited good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) of 419 °C and a DSC melting point at 170 °C in nitrogen (Fig. 1). The high thermal stability of the small molecule decreases the possibility of molecule degradation and morphology deformation in solar cells.31,32

Optical properties

Fig. 2 showed the normalized UV-vis absorption of DTTz-DTBTT in dilute CHCl3 solution and in thin solid film. The UV-vis optical spectrum of DTTz-DTBTT in chloroform presented an absorption peak at 535 nm. The thin film of DTTz-DTBTT showed intense absorption throughout the visible region (300–700 nm). The film exhibited an obvious red-shifted λmax = 587 nm absorption. Compared to that in solution, the absorption spectrum of the film as well as its red-shift (52 nm) suggested that strong intermolecular interaction and aggregation existed in the film. The optical gap of DTTz-DTBTT was estimated to be 1.65 eV from the absorption onset (752 nm) in the thin film.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of DTTz-DTBTT were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) as film on a glassy carbon working electrode in 0.1 M [nBu4N]+[PF6]− CH3CN solution (nBu = n-butyl) at a potential scan rate of 100 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 3, DTTz-DTBTT exhibited a couple of reversible reduction wave and quasi-reversible oxidation wave. The redox potential of the Fc/Fc+ internal reference was 0.38 V vs. SCE.
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammogram of DTTz-DTBTT molecules. 
The HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the molecule were determined by the empirical formula of EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.8 − E1/2,(Fc/Fc+)), ELUMO = −e(ERed + 4.8 − E1/2,(Fc/Fc+)). The onset oxidation and reduction potentials of DTTz-DTBTT were 0.63 V and −1.35 V, thus the corresponding HOMO and LUMO energy levels were −5.05 eV and −3.07 eV, respectively.
Photovoltaic properties
BHJ OSCs were fabricated with a device structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DTTz-DTBTT:PC61BM/Ca/Al, and tested under a simulated AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The blends of the DTTz-DTBTT and PC61BM at different weight ratios of 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1 were used to optimize the device performances and their current density versus voltage (J–V) curves were shown in Fig. 4, and for all the optimized conditions, we had averaged the performance over 5 devices and the data were given in Table 1. Finally, the PCE of 1.64% for DTTz-DTBTT was obtained with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.66 V, a short circuit current density (JSC) of 5.11 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 48%, when the device was made at a donor–acceptor weight ratio of 1:1 in chloroform with a concentration of 10 mg ml−1, spun cast at 1500 rpm. The devices fabricated with DTTz-DTBTT exhibited moderate performance that could be caused by a low VOC of 0.66 V. The VOC was governed by the gap between the HOMO level of DTTz-DTBTT and the LUMO of PCBM (−3.9 eV to −4.2 eV).12c,23 Thus, the high HOMO level (−5.05 eV) of DTTz-DTBTT caused lower VOC in this case.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve of the optimized BHJ device based on DTTz-DTBTT/PC61BM (w:w, 1:1) is shown in Fig. 5. The EQE curve exhibits a monochromatic EQE maximum of 28% at 442 nm and a broad response covering at 350–750 nm, consistent with the absorption spectrum. This EQE value indicates that the photoresponse is moderate for this small molecule based BHJ device. The JSC calculated from the integral of EQE curve based on DTTz-DTBTT with an AM 1.5G reference spectrum is 5.02 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the JSC value obtained from the J–V measurement (5.11 mA cm−2).

The morphology of the film is important for the performance of small molecule/PCBM BHJ solar cells. In order to investigate the relationship between solar cell performance and morphology, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) of the DTTz-DTBTT/PC61BM (w:w, 1:1) blend film was performed. The active layer was spin coated from CHCl3 solution onto the glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate for AFM measurements, and the topography and phase images were shown in Fig. 6. The blend film had a root mean square (rms) roughness of 0.948 nm. The smooth surface of blend film implied good miscibility between the small molecule and PC61BM, but it did not form an effective nano-scaled phase-separated interpenetrating donor–acceptor network. This may be the main reason for the low PCEs of solar cells.

Conclusions
A solution-processed small molecule DTTz-DTBTT, using a thiazolothiazole (Tz) unit as the core, has been synthesized through the Stille reaction and employed as an electron donor for small molecule organic solar cells. The small molecule exhibited good thermal stability, excellent solubility and film forming properties. The optical gap of DTTz-DTBTT was estimated to be 1.65 eV. The photovoltaic properties of DTTz-DTBTT were investigated in typical BHJ devices using PC61BM as an acceptor. A PCE of 1.64% was obtained with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.66 V, a short circuit current density (JSC) of 5.11 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 48%. The results indicate that the molecule based on two different acceptors is an effective strategy for the design of small molecule donor materials.
