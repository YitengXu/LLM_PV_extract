    , Accepted 22nd January 2019First published on 22nd January 2019AbstractHerein, we demonstrate the potential of a DBU-appended perylene bisimide (PDIDBU) in solution processed bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJOSCs). This molecule exhibits intense absorption in the visible to near infra-red region (300–1000 nm). The conventional BHJOSCs show a power conversion efficiency of up to 6.96% with an open circuit voltage of 0.75 V and a record low energy loss of 0.54 eV. A notable incident photon to current conversion efficiency was observed in the visible to NIR region of the solar spectrum.
Recently, the development of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) garnered much attention due to their light weight, low cost fabrication, flexibility and easy solution-processability.1–5 In a conventional BHJ photoactive layer, blending a large band gap donor polymer with a complementary narrow band gap acceptor is considered an effective approach for obtaining a broader solar spectrum and achieving a high short-circuit current density (JSC) and a high power conversion efficiency (PCE).6 Tuning the energy levels in both the components can also improve the open circuit voltage (VOC) and reduce the energy loss (Eloss).7 In the last two decades, significant breakthroughs have been made in improving the PCE of BHJ-OSCs. Currently, the PCE of small molecule-based solar cells has reached over 13% by continuous efforts in device engineering and materials design.8–10 Small molecule donors are drawing much attention for photovoltaic applications owing to their broad absorption, better solution processability, high charge mobility, and definite molecular weight with easily tunable structures.11–14 Especially, the molecules with a donor-π-acceptor kind of framework have been much exploited for such applications. These molecular frameworks often have broad and extended absorption partially due to intramolecular charge transfer.15,16 A plethora of small molecule based non-fullerene acceptors have been developed in this regard.17–20
On the other hand, the best efficiencies in OSCs could be achieved by incorporating conjugated polymers as donors and fullerene derivatives as acceptors.6 Polymer based donors have certain inherent drawbacks associated with their uncertainty in molecular weights, tedious purification etc. This justifies the need for their replacement in OSCs by molecules having a definite structure and composition with mechanical and electronic flexibility.21,22 Therefore, the focus has now been shifted towards developing small molecular donors as promising alternatives to the conventional polymer based donors in OSCs.23,24
Perylene bisimides are a popular class of dyes that are well exploited as non-fullerene acceptors due to their inherent electron-deficient nature, coupled with their strong absorption in the visible region.25–29 Their characteristic thermal and photochemical stability, combined with their excellent charge transport properties make them good candidates for organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications.30–32 As mentioned earlier, the main focus has always been on utilizing these dyes as non-fullerene acceptors and little research has been done on utilizing these dyes as donor materials in OSCs.15 Therefore, the extended π-backbone of these novel dyes can also be exploited as donor motifs if appropriately functionalized.
In the current work, we have used a PDI derivative, namely PDIDBU (Chart 1) in which annulation of a DBU unit leads to lateral π-extension of PDI. The resulting molecule exhibits broad absorption in the solid state with a narrow band gap of 1.29 eV. A BHJ solar cell was fabricated by employing PDIDBU as the donor and fullerene derivative PC71BM as the acceptor. After optimising the morphology and crystallinity of the active layers by solvent vapour annealing (SVA), a PCE of 6.96% was achieved.
 Chart 1  . Chemical structure of PDIDBU (donor) and PC71BM (acceptor). 
The PDI derivative (PDIDBU) was synthesized by refluxing PDI and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) in toluene as per the procedure recently reported by our group.33 Complete details of the synthesis and characterization are given in the ESI.†
The solution and thin film absorption spectra of PDIDBU are shown in Fig. 1. The absorption spectrum displayed wide absorption in the range of 300–1000 nm with the absorption maximum at 816 and 840 nm in chloroform and thin film, respectively. The solution spectrum exhibited strong absorption in the range of 620–940 nm (λmax at 816 nm with ε = 23800 M−1 cm−1) and relatively weak absorption in the 300–600 nm wavelength region (λmax at 478 nm with ε = 13900 M−1 cm−1). The thin film absorption spectrum showed a similar pattern with a notable redshift of 24 nm ((λmax = 840 nm) compared to that of the solution. In addition to this, a slight increase in the intensity with broadening of spectra was also observed. The acceptor PC71BM (Fig. 1) absorbs strongly in the wavelength ranging from 300–450 nm compared to PDIDBU in thin film. All the optical details are summarized in Table 1. The optical band gap calculated from the onset of absorption in solution and thin film spectra is 1.33 and 1.29 eV, respectively.

Electrochemical properties were measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and energy levels were calculated from redox potentials (Fig. S2 ESI†). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PDIDBU were found to be −4.92 and −3.63 eV from CV(See ESI†). The PDIDBU exhibited a higher energy LUMO as compared to PC71BM and the same has been depicted in Fig. 2. The HOMO/LUMO offset between PDIDBU and PC71BM is more than 0.3 eV which is beneficial for efficient charge transport. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the Gaussian 09 suite program34 with the B3LYP/6-31G* basis set were applied to analyse the distribution of electron density at the donor. The electron density in the HOMO was found to be delocalized over the whole molecule whereas in the LUMO the electron density mainly located over the PDI core with contribution from the core extending the 5-membered pyrrolic ring33 as demonstrated in Fig. 2.

In order to exploit the potential application of the above system, photovoltaic devices were fabricated using PDIDBU small molecule as the donor along with PC71BM as the acceptor in the photoactive layer. The photoactive layer has been optimized by varying the ratios of the donor to acceptor. The donor to acceptor ratio of 1:1.5 was found to be the optimum. Subsequently, the optimized devices with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT(poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)):PSS (poly(styrenesulfonate))/PDIDBU:PC71BM/PFN (poly[9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene])/Al were constructed. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of these BHJ-OSCs are listed in Table 2. Fig. 3(a) represents the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2.

(d) Variation of VOC with the illumination intensity. All the OSCs are based on as-cast and SVA-treated PDIDBU:PC71BM active layers. 
The devices based on PDIDBU:PC71BM as cast in the photoactive layer yielded a PCE of 3.28% with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 10.18 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.79 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.41. The photovoltaic performance of the devices was further improved by employing a solvent vapour annealing (SVA) technique.14,35,36 We have employed the SVA treatment since it is more effective than other treatments i.e. solvent additive and thermal annealing. The SVA treatment was done using tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent for 40 s. The SVA treated photoactive layer showed a distinctly enhanced PCE of 6.96% with a JSC of 14.97 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.62 and a VOC of 0.75 V. The photovoltaic parameters of the OSCs fabricated with different ratios of the donor and acceptor are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.† The J–V curves for SVA treated devices are shown in Fig. 3(a) and related photovoltaic details are summarised in Table 2. Despite the significant improvement in the PCE, JSC and FF, the VOC is slightly compromised after the SVA treatment.
The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves based on PDIDBU:PC71BM as cast and with SVA treatment exhibited a broad and efficient photo-response ranging from 300 to 1000 nm as shown in Fig. 3(b). The SVA treated devices exhibited IPCE values of 55% in the region 700–900 nm which are higher than the devices as cast (35%).
To gain deeper insight into the charge recombination dynamics of the OSCs, the light-intensity dependent JSC was studied. In general, the JSC and light intensity follows the relation: JSC ∝ (Pin)α, where Pin is the light intensity and α is the exponential factor related to charge recombination. For weak bimolecular recombination, JSC shows linear dependence on Pin and α approaches unity, while α < 1 indicates the possibility of charge recombination.37 The α values obtained from the slope of the straight line in the plot of log JSCversus log Pin (Fig. 3(c)) are 0.88 and 0.95 for untreated and SVA treated devices, respectively. This ascertains that the bimolecular recombination was effectively suppressed with the SVA treatment.
We further investigated the recombination mechanism by studying the variation of VOC with light intensity (Pin) as depicted in Fig. 3(d). The slope of the curve VOCversus lnPin at 1kBT/q (where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and q is the elementary charge.),38 implies that charge recombination is predominant. However, slope = 2kBT/q points towards the Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination mechanism. Also, if the surface recombination mechanism dominates, the slope reaches 0.5 kBT/q. Our devices depicted slopes at 1.42 and 1.16 respectively, for untreated and SVA treated layers. These results further corroborate that the SVA treatment of the photoactive layer significantly suppressed both bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination processes and hence, improved Jsc.
The charge carrier mobility of photoactive materials plays an important role in governing Jsc of photovoltaic devices. Therefore, hole/electron mobilities (μh/μe) of the photoactive layers before and after the SVA treatment were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The hole mobility was measured from the hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and electron mobility was measured from the electron-only devices having a structure ITO/Al/active layer/Al. The J–V curves in the dark for the hole only and electron only devices are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), respectively. For the device as cast, μh and μe were measured to be 6.89 × 10−5 and 2.34 × 10−4 cm2/Vs, respectively. The SVA treated photoactive layers showed considerable increase in μh (1.07 × 10−4 cm2 Vs−1) and μe (2.43 × 10−4 cm2Vs−1). The ratio of electron to hole (μe/μh) mobility was decreased from 3.39 to 2.27 after the SVA treatment. The increased μh and μe and reduced μe/μh ratio of the SVA treated devices might result in more balanced charge transport, thus enhancing JSC, FF and PCE.

(c) Variation of photocurrent (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff) of the OSCs. All the OSC based on the as-cast and the SVA-treated PDIDBU:PC71BM active layer. 
To understand the exciton dissociation and charge collection properties of the devices, the photocurrent density (Jph) dependence on the effective voltage (Veff) was determined. The Jph is defined as JL–JD, where JL is the current density under illumination and JD is the current density in dark.39
The Veff is defined by V0–V, where V is the applied voltage and V0 is the voltage at which Jph = 0. The curve for the Jphvs. Veff is shown in Fig. 4(c). The device as cast does not show a saturation regime within the whole measurement region indicating a bimolecular recombination which may be due to the unfavourable active layer morphology and also, due to low charge mobility. In contrast, the SVA treated device shows a linear dependency at lower Veff and gradually saturates at high Veff, explaining that most of the photo-generated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and the collection of charge carriers at the electrodes is relatively efficient. For a quantitative explanation, the exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) can be calculated from the following equation: Pdiss = Jph/Jsat, under short circuit conditions, where Jsat is the saturation current density at high Veff (2 V). The Pdiss values under the short circuit and maximum power output conditions for as cast and with the SVA treatment were 0.88 and 0.96, respectively. Moreover, the charge collection probability (Pcoll): Pcoll = Jph/Jsat has been estimated under maximum power conditions and was 0.69 and 0.78 for as-cast and SVA-treated active layers, respectively. These findings show that the exciton generation and charge collection both are promoted by the SVA treatment. Moreover, the Jsat value is higher for the OSCs based on the SVA-treated active layer when compared to the as-cast counterpart. We estimated the exciton generation rate from the expression Gmax = Jsat/qL where q is the elementary charge and L is the active layer thickness. The Gmax values are found to be 0.83 × 1028 m−3 S−1 and 1.11 × 1028 m−3 S−1 for as-cast and SVA-based OSCs, respectively. The higher Gmax value for the SVA-treated OSC is suggestive of more exciton generation in the devices. Further, the increased exciton generation augments the corresponding JSC value. These outcomes are further confirmed by the higher light harvesting efficiency as evidenced from the absorption spectra of the active layer in (Fig. 1).
The energy loss (Eloss) in OSCs is one of the most important factors governing the photovoltaic performance.40 The value of energy loss estimated from Eloss = (Egopt − qVOC), where Egopt is the optical bandgap is 0.54 eV. This lower value of Eloss for our optimized OSC may be one of the reasons for the high value of VOC.
To analyse the change in molecular ordering and crystallinity in the PDIDBU:PC71BM active layer after the SVA treatment, we have recorded the X-ray diffraction pattern. The PXRD patterns of the as-cast and SVA-treated films are shown in Fig. 5. Both, the as-cast and SVA-treated films showed identical (100) diffraction peaks at 2θ = 5.32° corresponding to a lamellar stacking distance of 1.61 nm. It should be noted that a much stronger (100) diffraction peak for the SVA treated film was visualized. Further, the (010) diffraction peaks representing π-π stacking were located at 2θ = 22.36° and 23.08° for as-cast and SVA-treated films, respectively.
 Fig. 5  The X-ray diffraction patterns of as-cast and SVA-treated PDIDBU:PC71BM active layers. 
The π–π stacking distance extracted from the (010) diffraction peak is 0.35 nm and 0.32 nm for as-cast and SVA-treated films, respectively. The stronger lamellar and π–π stacking features along with compact intermolecular packing is indicative of higher crystallinity of SVA treated films than the as-cast counterpart and is better suited for charge transport as demonstrated in SCLC measurement. It is also beneficial for the improvements of Jsc and FF of corresponding OSCs.
In order to establish a relationship between active layer morphology and device performance, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 6) was used. TEM analysis reveals large morphological changes upon the SVA treatment. It is clearly evidenced that at a magnification of 100 nm, the SVA treated PDIDBU:PC71BM active layer appears sharper implying a better phase separation.
 Fig. 6  The TEM images of the as-cast and SVA-treated PDIDBU:PC71BM thin films, scale bar is 100 nm. 
In the case of the active layer as cast, poor phase separation hampers the charge transport in the devices resulting in poor values of FF. On the other hand, favourable phase separation and relatively clear interpenetrating pathways formed after the SVA treatment reduce bimolecular recombination and enhance charge transport efficiency, improving the solar cell parameters such as JSC and FF.41
Conclusions
In summary, for the first time an ortho-π-extended PDI based NIR absorbing small molecule has been utilized as the donor for BHJSC. This molecule exhibits an excellent absorption spectrum which covers the complete visible range and NIR region in solution as well as the solid state. Noteworthy to mention here that NIR absorption is a key factor for an efficient solar cell. Further, PDIDBU was used as the donor along with PCBM as the acceptor in the active layer of BHJSCs. The SVA optimized devices showed promising PCE of 6.96% together with VOC of 0.75 V and JSC of 14.97 mA cm−2. These results can be attributed to a successful design strategy, better light harvesting and good charge transport. Our work opens up a new direction for structurally robust rylene bisimides that can be used as efficient donors by appropriate functionalization, which had been otherwise known as only acceptors.
