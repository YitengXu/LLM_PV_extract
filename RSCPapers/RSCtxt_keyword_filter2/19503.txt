1. Introduction
With the depletion of fossil fuels and exacerbation of pollution problems, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted extensive attention as promising photovoltaic devices owing to their high power conversion efficiency, ease of fabrication and potential low cost compared with traditional silicon-based solar cells.1–5 It is well known that DSSCs are principally composed of dye-sensitized working electrodes (WE), electrolytes, and counter electrodes (CEs) where the dyes play a crucial role in determining the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the devices. In the past two decades, Ru polypyridyl sensitizers with PCEs of over 11%6–9 have been demonstrated to be very efficient due to their broad absorption spectrum through metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT), longer exciton lifetime, and long-term chemical stability.2,5,10 However, several drawbacks, which include the high cost of noble metal ruthenium, the requirement for careful synthesis, tricky purification steps and low molar extinction coefficient,10–12 restrict Ru polypyridyl sensitized DSSCs towards commercial viability. Seeking alternative sensitizers seems to be a solution to these problems, which is an intensive research topic of high priority.
As a promising substitute for the Ru polypyridyl dye in DSSCs, porphyrins have been widely investigated because of their low cost, high molar extinction coefficients and structural diversity.13–19 Great progress has been made in the past few years and a record efficiency of as high as 12.3% has been achieved using a molecular engineering methodology based on cosensitization of porphyrin YD2-o-C8 with the organic dye Y123 and a cobalt(II/III) redox electrolyte.20 Additionally, the solar cell cosensitized by organic dye C1 and the porphyrin XW4 with an extended conjugation framework and a carbazole donor exhibited a high PCE of 10.45% with an improved current density (Jsc) and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) values.21 Recently, through the insertion of a benzothiadiazole unit between the porphyrin ring and benzoic acid accepter, a structure-optimized dye SM315 was obtained and produced a world record efficiency of 13% in the field of DSSCs.22
Similar to the structures of most organic dyes, the porphyrin dyes are designed according to the basic structures donor–π-conjugated bridge–acceptor (simplified as D–π–A), which are beneficial for intramolecular electron transportation. In the case of organic dyes, the donor is of great importance in determining the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs through influencing the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the sensitizers. Hence, various kinds of organic groups, such as triphenylamine,23,24 carbazole,25,26 coumarin,27,28 indoline,29,30 phenothiazine,31–33 and so on, have been extensively applied as donors in organic dyes for DSSCs over the past two decades. In contrast, the literature investigating the influence of different donors on the photovoltaic performance of porphyrin-sensitized DSSCs is limited.34
In order to further improve the performance of porphyrin sensitized solar cells, more insight should be devoted to the structure–property relationships of this kind of dye. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of porphyrin dyes through incorporation of different electronegative organic moieties (2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine, triphenylamine and carbazole) onto the dye molecule. Accordingly, the influence of different donors on the photophysical and electrochemical characteristics of porphyrin sensitizers was systematically investigated. It was found that different electronegative organic moieties significantly influence the HOMO, LUMO levels and molar absorption ability of porphyrin molecules. To further scrutinize the relationship between the electronegativity of organic moieties and the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs sensitized by the corresponding porphyrin dyes, a fully printable low-cost monolithic architecture with mesoscopic carbon counter electrodes was utilized to fabricate the complete DSSC devices. Thereby, utilizing the porphyrin dye molecule (coded as WH-C5) attached with triphenylamine as the donor afforded DSCs exhibiting an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 633.84 mV, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 11.43 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 0.69 and the best PCE of 5%.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis
In the present work, three porphyrin dyes with different electronegative moieties (2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine, carbazole and triphenylamine) attached at the meso-position opposite to the anchoring benzoic acid group were designed and synthesized for monolithic DSSCs based on carbon/graphite counter electrodes, coded as WH-C3, WH-C4 and WH-C5, respectively. The structures of the dyes and the synthetic scheme are shown in Fig. 1 and in Scheme 1, respectively. The detailed synthetic procedures are presented in the Experimental section. The molecular structures of all target porphyrins and intermediates were confirmed using 1H NMR, 13C NMR and APCI/ESI-MS, which are given in the Experimental section.

2.2. Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of WH-C3, WH-C4 and WH-C5 in THF solution are depicted in Fig. 2. The corresponding peak positions and molar absorption coefficients (ε) of the Soret and Q bands are listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2, the three sensitizers exhibit typical porphyrin absorption characteristics with a strong Soret band appearing in the range of 400–500 nm and mild Q bands appearing in the longer wavelength range of 600–700 nm, which is attributed to π–π* charge transfer transitions of the conjugated molecule and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions of the D–π–A conjugated backbone.35 According to the absorption data in Table 1, it is obvious that the Soret band and Q band peak positions for WH-C4 and WH-C5 are red-shifted in comparison with WH-C3, which may be ascribed to the stronger electron-donating ability of carbazole and triphenylamine corresponding to the band gap (E0–0) of three porphyrin dyes. Compared with WH-C3 and WH-C5, it is clear that the maximum molar extinction coefficients of the Soret band of WH-C4 are the highest, reaching 444300 M−1 cm−1, which is roughly double that of WH-C5. Meanwhile, Fig. 3 presents the UV-visible absorption spectra of the sensitizers adsorbed on TiO2 films. In comparison with the absorption spectra in solution, the trend of the Soret and Q bands in the absorption spectra is similar to that when the sensitizers are adsorbed on TiO2 films. Nevertheless, the Soret and Q absorption bands are broadened and conspicuously red-shifted. This phenomenon is proposed to result from the formation of J-aggregation.13,27,36 Additionally, the fluorescence emission spectra were measured in THF and are shown in Fig. 4. For the fluorescence spectra, major emission bands are observed at 668, 671 and 673 nm for WH-C3, WH-C4 and WH-C5, respectively, which are similar to the trend of the Soret band absorption spectra. Therefore, it can be concluded that porphyrin dye molecules with different kinds of donors possess significantly different optical properties.

2.3. Electrochemical properties
In order to investigate the feasibility of electron injection and dye regeneration processes in DSSCs, cyclic voltammetry measurements for the three dyes were performed in water-free THF containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte at room temperature and cyclic voltammograms are presented in Fig. 5. It is observed that the electrochemical data for the three dyes display quasi-reversible couples. The highest-occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of dyes corresponding to the first redox potential were calculated to be 0.956, 0.861 and 0.660 V for WH-C3, WH-C4 and WH-C5, respectively. Practically, it has been confirmed that ηinj with unit efficiency requires approximately 0.2 V of overpotential (−ΔG) between the TiO2 conduction band (CB) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the dye, and 0.3 V of −ΔG between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the dye and the redox potential of the electrolyte, to create a sufficient driving force for the electron injection from the dye to the CB of TiO2 and the regeneration of the oxidized dye.5,37 It is observed that the HOMO levels of the three porphyrin dyes are sufficiently more positive than the iodine/iodide redox potential value (0.4 V vs. NHE),38 guaranteeing the efficient regeneration of oxidized dye through the I− present in the electrolyte of the DSSCs. The zero–zero excitation energies (E0–0) were calculated to be 1.985 V (WH-C3), 1.920 V (WH-C4) and 1.915 V (WH-C5) upon the intersection of the normalized UV-vis absorption spectrum and steady-state fluorescence emission spectrum. The lowest-unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) levels of all porphyrin sensitizers were determined according to the expression LUMO = HOMO − E0–0 and the corresponding level values are summarized in Table 1. Obviously, the LUMO levels of all dyes are sufficiently more negative compared with the conduction band edge level (Ecb) of the TiO2 electrode (−0.5 V vs. NHE), which means that electron injection from the excited dye into the conduction band of TiO2 is thermodynamically feasible. Therefore, the three dyes are appropriately used as sensitizers for DSSCs.

2.4. Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
In this work, we have synthesized three porphyrin dyes with the incorporation of three different donors to investigate the effect of different donors on the photovoltaic performance of monolithic dye-sensitized solar cells with mesoscopic carbon counter electrodes. Compared with the conventional DSSC, this monolithic DSSC permits fabrication of printing paste layer by layer on a single FTO glass substrate using a screen-printing technique, which makes large scale commercial production possible. Furthermore, the carbon black–graphite composite used as the counter electrode in this study is an abundantly available and low-cost material compared with the high cost metallic CE, which has been applied successfully in DSSCs.39–41
The monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for DSSCs is expressed as follows:5,42IPCE(λ) = ηLHEηinjηcc where ηLHE is the light harvesting efficiency, ηinj is the electron injection yield from the photo-excited dye into TiO2, and ηcc is the charge collection efficiency at the electrodes. Among them, ηLHE and ηinj contribute greatly to the improvement of IPCE. In the past, it has been demonstrated that the molecular structures of sensitizers have a significant influence on the photovoltaic performance of ηLHE and ηinj through influencing their photophysical and electrochemical properties. The IPCEs for DSSCs based on the three dyes are presented in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 6, it is obvious that two peaks are located in the range of 400–500 nm and 600–700 nm, respectively, which is consistent with that observed in the UV-visible absorption spectra of the three dyes.

It is clear that WH-C4 and WH-C5 possess two nearly strong IPCEs values corresponding to the Soret and Q absorption bands. In contrast, the maximum IPCE value of the Soret band of WH-C3 is approximately three times as large as that of the Q absorption band. It was explained by the fact that the introduction of strong electron-withdrawing 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine is unfavourable for intramolecular charge transfer from HOMO to LUMO. As a matter of fact, the conclusion was demonstrated through the utilization of a similar acceptor–π–donor–π–acceptor structure. LW12 and LW13 with the symmetrical acceptor–π–donor–π–acceptor structure showed inferior power conversion efficiencies compared to LD14 with the D–π–A structure.43 Compared with WH-C3, the maximum IPCEs of Soret bands of WH-C4 and WH-C5 dyes were increased by 291% and 229%, respectively. Additionally, although the WH-C5 dye has the weakest absorption at Soret and Q absorption bands in comparison with WH-C3 and WH-C4, the DSSCs based on WH-C5 exhibit optimal IPCE. It may be caused by the higher ηinj resulting from a higher LUMO level.
The current density–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the DSSCs sensitized by WH-C3, WH-C4 and WH-C5 are displayed in Fig. 7 with the corresponding detailed photovoltaic performance parameters listed in Table 2. Under standard global air mass 1.5 solar conditions, the WH-C3 sensitized cell had a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 2.50 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 514.57 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.75, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 0.97%. The low Jsc of WH-C3 might be attributed to the following three reasons: firstly, the low dye absorbed amount for WH-C3 should be mainly responsible for the low IPCE and Jsc. Secondly, the WH-C3 molecule with the planar 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine moiety is liable to aggregate and undergo self-quenching, leading to the low ηLHE and IPCE. Finally, the acceptor–π–donor–π–acceptor structure of WH-C3 with electron-withdrawing groups on both sides of the porphyrin ring was thought to be detrimental to intermolecular charge transfer and eventually influence electron injection efficiency, which resulted in the low IPCE and short circuit current. Actually, the fact that the D–π–A structure is superior to the A–π–A structure in porphyrin dye molecules has been demonstrated through theoretical calculations at the density functional B3LYP level.44,45 Under the same conditions, the DSSCs for WH-C4 and WH-C5 with the incorporation of carbazole and triphenylamine as additional donor at the meso-position opposite to the anchoring benzoic acid group showed Jsc values of 10.07 and 11.43 mA cm−2, Voc of 609.81 and 633.84 mV, and FF of 0.72 and 0.69, corresponding to η of 4.40% and 5.00%, respectively. Apparently, Jsc of DSSCs based on the three sensitizers increases with electron-donating ability of groups suspending at the meso-position opposite to the anchoring group in the order of WH-C3 < WH-C4 < WH-C5, which is consistent with the trend of IPCEs.46 In comparison with WH-C3, the Jsc of WH-C4 and WH-C5-sensitized solar cells is enhanced by 303% and 357%, respectively. So it has been well documented that the incorporation of electron-donating donor is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer and improves the short circuit current dramatically. At the same time, the higher dye loading amount of WH-C4 and WH-C5 could be another cause for their higher Jsc. In additionas seen from Table 2 and Fig. 7, the Voc of the devices sensitized by the three porphyrin dyes follows the order VocWH-C5 > Voc(WH-C4) > Voc(WH-C3).

From the perspective of molecular structure, the different Voc values may be ascribed to vast differences between donor structures. Planar 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine in WH-C3 not only aggregates easily, but also weakly suppresses charge recombination between the electron injected into the conduction band of TiO2 and I3− in the vicinity of TiO2. By contrast, carbazole and triphenylamine have a larger steric hindrance, preventing electron recombination, which results in their higher Voc.
2.5. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
To further investigate and elucidate the photovoltaic results and obtain more interfacial charge transfer information of the DSSCs with the different dyes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also performed in the dark under a forward bias of −0.6 V. The Nyquist and Bode plots for WH-C3, WH-C4 and WH-C5 are shown in Fig. 8. From the Nyquist plots (Fig. 8(a)), in the high frequency range over 106 Hz, the impedance is dominated by the ohmic serial resistance (Rs) of the dummy cell owing to the square resistance of the FTO glass substrate, where the phase is zero.5,40 As seen in Fig. 8(a), the first semicircle is assigned to impedances related to charge transport at the electrolyte/counter electrode interface. In the middle frequency range, the large semicircle is ascribed to the electron recombination resistance (Rrec) and chemical capacitance at the working electrode/electrolyte.47,48 It is obvious that the semicircle based on different dyes is in the order of WH-C3 < WH-C4 < WH-C5, indicating that the electron recombination resistance augments from WH-C3 to WH-C5.5 It is well known that the photovoltage of a DSSC is intrinsically determined by the potential difference between the quasi Fermi level of TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte.49 As a matter of fact, the Voc can be affected by the following two factors: (a) the shift of the TiO2 conduction band edge; and (b) the degree of the electron recombination reaction.49 Based on the above conclusions, the order of the Voc (WH-C3 < WH-C4 < WH-C5) could be attributed to different electron recombination resistances caused by different donors. The larger the semicircle, the slower the recombination kinetics. It is observed that the WH-C5 with the classical triphenylamine donor presented the highest recombination resistance. In the Bode phase plots Fig. 8(b), the middle-frequency peak stands for the charge-transfer process of injected electrons in TiO2 corresponding to the first semicircle in Nyquist plots. The Bode phase plots likewise demonstrate the differences in the Rrec. Electron lifetimes calculated through the relation τe = 1/(2πf) (f is the peak frequency of middle-frequency range in EIS Bode plot)50 can effectively explain the higher Voc for WH-C5-sensitized solar cells compared with that for WH-C3 and WH-C4. The electron lifetime τe was determined to be 2.04, 27.99 and 37.97 ms, for WH-C3, WH-C4 and WH-C5, respectively. The higher electron lifetime τe observed from WH-C5 indicated more effective repression of the charge recombination back reaction, which could be reflected in the improvement in the values of Voc, resulting in improved device efficiency. To summarise, it has been demonstrated that the incorporation of the triphenylamine donor can act as a blocking layer through the suppression of the recombination reaction between the electron injected into the conduction band of TiO2 and the I3− at the vicinity of TiO2.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, three push–pull porphyrins with donors of different electron-donating abilities were designed and synthesized for monolithic dye-sensitized solar cells based on carbon/graphite counter electrodes. We have systematically investigated the influence of different electron-donating ability organic groups on the photovoltaic performance of the porphyrin-sensitized solar cells through photophysical, electrochemical, photocurrent–voltage curves, monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy characterization methods. The open circuit voltage and short circuit photocurrent density of the devices sensitized by the three porphyrin dyes follows the order WH-C5 > WH-C4 > WH-C3. Under standard global air mass 1.5 solar conditions, the highest power conversion efficiency was achieved for the WH-C5 sensitized solar cell, which gave a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 11.43 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 633.84 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.69, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 5.00%. In a word, it has been demonstrated that the incorporation of different donors can have a profound impact on the photovoltaic performance of the porphyrin-sensitized solar cells. The present study could provide guidance for the rational design of highly efficient porphyrin sensitizers.
4. Experimental
4.1. Materials
All reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial sources and were used without further purification unless otherwise noted. THF and toluene were dried over sodium/benzophenone and freshly distilled before use. DMF used for formylation was dried over enough P2O5 for several hours and distilled under reduced pressure. Column chromatography of all the products was performed on silica gel (Kanto, Silica Gel 60N, spherical, 200–300 mesh), and some were further purified via recrystallization.
4.2. Preparation of platinized carbon paste
Platinized carbon paste was prepared as described elsewhere.40 2 g carbon black powder (particle size: 30 nm) and H2PtCl6 (Sigma) with a predetermined Pt/carbon black weight ratio were added into 20 ml isopropanol solution (Sigma) under continuous stirring for 30 min, and then the paste was sintered for 30 min at 380 °C in a furnace to thermally deposit the Pt nanoparticles on the surface of carbon black, followed by mixing with graphite powder (particle size: 1.3 μm) with a predetermined graphite/carbon black weight ratio. Finally, 1 g of 20 nm ZrO2 nanopowder (Sigma) and 1 g of hydroxypropyl cellulose (Sigma) were added into a 30 mL terpineol solution. The platinized carbon material paste was obtained after stirring vigorously using ball milling for 2 h.

4.4. Spectral and electrochemical measurements
UV-visible spectra were obtained on a PerKinElmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker-AV400 400 MHz spectrometer. The chemical shifts were recorded in parts per million (ppm) with TMS as the internal reference. ESI mass spectra were measured on a Finnigan LCQ Advantage mass spectrometer. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out using a three-electrode system in an argon-purged electrolyte solution on a PARSTAT 2273 Electrochemical Workstation. Cyclic voltammograms for porphyrin dyes were conducted with a three-electrode cell equipped with a BAS glassy carbon (0.07 cm2) disk as the working electrode, platinum wire as the auxiliary electrode, and a Ag/AgCl (saturated) reference electrode. The working electrode was polished with 0.03 μm alumina on felt pads (Buehler) and treated ultrasonically for 1 min before each experiment. The potential of the reference electrode was adjusted by recording the cyclic voltammogram for 0.01 M ferrocene in THF containing 0.1 M TBAPF6.
4.5. Device fabrication
A compact layer of TiO2 was deposited on the FTO-coated glass via spray pyrolysis deposition with di-isopropoxytitanium bis(acetyl acetonate) solution. Subsequently the mesoporous TiO2 (particle size, 20 nm, PASOL HPW-18NR TiO2 nanopowders, JGC Catalysts and Chemicals Ltd, Japan) transparent electrodes, the spacer layer composed of 40 and 90 nm-sized zirconia particles, and a mesoscopic platinized graphite–carbon black electrode were prepared through screen printing onto FTO-coated conducting glass layer by layer, which were sintered at 500 °C, 500 °C and 400 °C for 30 min, respectively. Then the working electrode was prepared by immersing TiO2 films into the 0.2 mM dye solution (in toluene/EtOH = 1/1, v/v) containing chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, 0.4 mM) at 25 °C overnight. The cell was encapsulated by a 100 μm thick spacer of a thermo-bonding polymer (Surlyn, DuPont) with sheet glass. After sealing, the liquid electrolyte was injected into the cell through the hole predrilled in the sheet glass, and then the hole was sealed with Surlyn polymer and cover glass. The liquid electrolyte consisted of 1.0 M 1,2-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.03 M iodine, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in a mixture of acetonitrile/valeronitrile (85:15, v/v).
4.6. Photovoltaic measurements
Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source/meter and a Newport solar simulator (model 91160) providing light with AM 1.5 G spectral distribution, which was calibrated using a certified reference solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE) to an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. A black mask with a slightly smaller circular aperture (0.07 cm2) than the active area of the square solar cell (0.25 cm2) was applied on top of the cell. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a 150 W xenon lamp (Oriel) fitted with a monochromator (Cornerstone 260) as the monochromatic light source. The illumination spot size was chosen to be slightly smaller than the active area of the DSSC test cells. IPCE photocurrents were recorded under short-circuit conditions using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The monochromatic photon flux was quantified by means of a calibrated silicon photodiode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the symmetric cell was measured using PARSTAT 2273 Electrochemical Workstation in the frequency range 0.1 to 106 Hz with 10 mV AC amplitude. The electrolyte used was the same as that used for the fully functional DSSCs. The distance between two electrodes was 45 μm and the active area was 0.8 cm2.
