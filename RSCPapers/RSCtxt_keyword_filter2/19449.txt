    , Accepted 6th November 2017First published on 6th November 2017AbstractA small molecule non-fullerene acceptor based on a fluorene core having a furan π-spacer and end capped with rhodanine (FRd2) is developed for solution processable bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs). The simplistic synthetic protocol reduces several reaction steps and hence production cost. Extended π-conjugation via furan units and the presence of electronegative rhodanine groups result in a power conversion efficiency of 9.4% in OSCs, which is the highest so far among these categories of molecules.
Small molecule non-fullerene acceptors (SMNFAs) are being used as potential alternatives to conventional fullerene derivatives for fabrication of solution processable organic solar cells (OSCs). These molecules have advantages of easily tunable frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels, strong and broad spectral absorption, good thermal and photochemical stability, low production cost and easy purification.1 To date, considerable research efforts have been made towards developing varieties of SMNFAs and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 13% have been achieved from OSCs made with these molecules.2 Fluorene, which is a weak electron donating moiety, is widely used for the synthesis of a broad range of materials for applications in organic electroluminescent devices, thin film transistors and solar cells due to the advantages of their high fluorescence quantum yield, excellent hole transport mobility and good thermal and chemical stability.3 More recently, the fluorene moiety has been introduced as an excellent building block to synthesize p-type semiconductors for solution processable organic photovoltaics (OPVs).4 Two side alkyl chains at the 9th position of fluorene improve the solubility of the resultant molecule, whereas the deeply lying HOMO energy level of fluorene derivatives helps in achieving high open circuit voltages (Voc) in OSCs.5 The optical band gap of these molecules can be easily tuned by extending linear π-conjugation.6 Usually calamitic type SMNFAs contain a central donor unit (D) flanked with a second donor or acceptor (D/A) unit and truncated with acceptor groups (A). Significant progress has been made in the past few years in the development of high performance SMNFAs with an A–D/A–D–D/A–A structural configuration. However, most of the reports were focused on changing the central core to improve the photovoltaic performance of acceptors. It is well known that incorporation of π-spacers such as thiophene, benzene, and furan also plays an important role in increasing π-conjugation through the molecular backbone and thus enhances the performance of the molecules.7 Among the previously reported SMNFAs, fluorene core based acceptors were found to be most frequently explored due their effective light harvesting properties in the visible range of 300 to 650 nm, easy synthesis and purification, and chemical and thermal stability. Many fluorene based materials, using benzothiadiazole and thiophene as π-spacers flanked with different dye end groups, have been developed as small molecule acceptors for organic solar cell applications and achieved a power conversion efficiency of up to 8.4%.8 To design highly efficient SMNFAs, integration of appropriate electron deficient groups, such as malononitrile,9 rhodanine,10 dicyanorhodanine,11 diketopyrrolopyrrole,12 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone,13 and perylene diimide,14 is also very important, which improves the light absorption properties, lowers the energy of the LUMO level, increases the probability of exciton dissociation at the donor–acceptor interface and consequently enhances the performance of an electron acceptor. Benzothiadiazole is an easily synthesizable electron withdrawing group, which is widely used not only for the design of donor and acceptor polymers, but also for the synthesis of small molecules. Incorporation of the benzothiadiazole moiety increases electron deficiency in the resultant molecule. Introduction of furan units in the π-conjugated backbone extends conjugation and lowers the energy bandgap of the final molecule. Therefore the absorption spectrum of the molecule is expected to shift towards longer wavelengths (red shift). Rhodanine is an electron withdrawing moiety, increasing the electron deficient properties at the end of the molecule via its ketone and thioketone groups. The ethyl group at the nitrogen of rhodanine increases the solubility and inhibits the hydrogen bonding of the molecule.
Hence, our group designed and synthesized an SMNFA (FRd2) with extended π-conjugation using furan as a spacer and rhodanine as terminal units associated with the fluorene core for solution processable OPVs (Fig. 1). The synthetic protocol of the final product, i.e.FRd2, and intermediates is outlined in Scheme S1 (ESI†). A detailed synthetic procedure and characterization results are also provided in the ESI.† The dialdehyde intermediate (F2CHO) was synthesized by the Suzuki cross coupling reaction between the 2,7-diboronic ester of fluorene (BAF-BA2) and 5-(7-bromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4-yl)furan-2-carbaldehyde (BT-F-CHO). The final molecule FRd2 was prepared by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction of the dialdehyde intermediate (F2CHO) with 3-ethylrhodanine. All intermediates and the target molecule were fully characterized using NMR, FT-IR and MALDI-TOF spectroscopy (Fig. S1–S8, ESI†). The new molecule exhibits good solubility (10 mg mL−1) in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, chlorobenzene and tetrahydrofuran.

The normalized absorption spectra of FRd2 in chloroform solution and thin films are exhibited in Fig. 2. Broader absorption profiles were observed in the thin films compared to that in solution because of higher delocalization in the solid state. The new SMNFA showed a strong and broad absorption in the 300–620 nm range with the highest molar extinction coefficient of 4.9 × 104 mol−1 cm−1 at 509 nm. The absorption profile of FRd2 shows two peaks at 414 and 509 nm due to the π–π* transition and internal charge transfer from the central fluorene molecule (donor) to terminal acceptor units, respectively. It is noteworthy to mention that the absorption ranges of PTB7-Th and FRd2 are complementary to each other. Hence both of them are expected to contribute to photocurrent. The PTB7-Th:FRd2 blend also showed a broad absorption profile extending up to 870 nm.

The electrochemical properties of FRd2 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry using an Fc/Fc+ redox couple as the internal standard (Fig. S9, ESI†). The HOMO energy level of the acceptor molecule is calculated from the onset oxidation potential and found to be −5.67 eV. The optical band gap of FRd2 is 2.09 eV as measured from the onset of the absorption spectrum. The LUMO energy level of the molecule, estimated from the equation ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg,opt, is found to be −3.58 eV (Table S1, ESI†). Introducing a furan π-spacer in the acceptor molecule extends π-conjugation, and thus reduces the band gap and lowers the LUMO energy level, which in turn are expected to help in device performance.
The theoretical calculation of FMO energy levels (Section S5, Fig. S10, ESI†) reveals that the HOMO is evenly distributed on the entire molecule, whereas the LUMO is more concentrated at the periphery of the molecule. This configuration helps in accepting electrons easily from the donor molecule.
The photovoltaic properties of the new acceptor were studied by constructing BHJ OSCs in an inverted device structure – ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:FRd2/MoO3/Ag. A detailed fabrication process is provided in the ESI†. The schematic representations of the device structure and energy level diagrams are depicted in the insets of Fig. 3a and b, respectively. During the optimization of fabrication steps, the effects of thermal annealing (TA), solvent vapor annealing (SVA) and solvent additives on device performance were also investigated. Chloronaphthalene (CN) and diiodooctane (DIO) were primarily chosen as additives in order to check the compatibility with the new acceptor. Fig. 3a presents the characteristic J–V curves of the OSCs measured under 1 Sun illumination (1000 W m−2) using an AM 1.5G filter. Solution processed BHJ OSCs made from the ‘as cast’ PTB7-Th:FRd2 blend showed a PCE of 6.4% with a Voc of 0.835 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 13.3 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 57.8%. The PCE increased to 6.9% with TA treatment of the photoactive layer without using any solvent additive. The devices made from ‘thermally annealed’ PTB7-Th:FRd2 blends using CN as an additive yielded a PCE of 7.2% with a Voc of 0.836 V, a Jsc of 13.9 mA cm−2 and an FF of 62.2%. However, the DIO additive appeared to be more compatible with the FRd2 molecule than CN. OPV devices fabricated from thermally annealed PTB7-Th:FRd2 blends demonstrated a maximum PCE of 8.1%. As can be seen from Fig. 3a and Table 1, a noticeable improvement in the photovoltaic performance of BHJ OSCs was achieved upon SVA treatment of the DIO added photoactive layer. This category of devices showed the highest PCE of 9.4% with an increased Jsc of 15.7 mA cm−2, FF of 72.3% and Voc of 0.833 V.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of OPV devices fabricated under different conditions are presented in Fig. 3b. The photon to current response curves of PTB7-Th:FRd2 based devices exhibited a strong photo-response in the 350–750 nm wavelength range. BHJ solar cells made from a thermally annealed PTB7-Th:FRd2 active layer using DIO as an additive showed an EQE over 70% at 710 nm. The EQE value further increased to 75% with SVA treatment of blend films.
The charge carrier mobilities in blend films were investigated by constructing ‘hole only’ (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend/Au) and ‘electron only’ (ITO/ZnO/blend/Al) devices (Fig. 4a, Fig. S11 and Table S3, ESI†). The charge carrier mobility values are estimated using Mott–Gurney's space charge limited current (SCLC) model at higher voltages.15 The electron mobility (μe) of FRd2 in the blend is calculated to be 2.5 × 10−4 and 4.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TA and SVA treated films, respectively. The hole mobility (μh) of PTB7-Th in the blend also increases with SVA treatment. Interestingly, μe and μh become more well-balanced with SVA treatment. The μe/μh ratio improves from 1.92 for TA to 1.79 for SVA treatment, which helps in achieving a higher FF in the latter case.

The photoluminescence quenching efficiency (PLQE) is estimated from the PL spectra of pure PTB7-Th and blend films in Fig. 4b. A high PLQE value of 86.5% indicates an efficient charge transfer from the donor to acceptor. The Stern–Volmer quenching coefficient (KSV) is calculated from the slope of Stern–Volmer plots using the equation ηo/η = 1 + KSVc, where η and ηo are emission efficiencies in the presence and absence of quenchers, respectively.16 A KSV value of 9.92 × 104 M−1 is achieved for PTB7-Th:FRd2 blend films (Fig. S12, ESI†), which is higher than reported KSV values for fullerene based acceptors.
Atomic force microscopic (AFM) measurements in tapping mode were performed to examine the nanoscale morphology of photoactive layers (Fig. 5). The ‘thermally annealed’ PTB7-Th:FRd2 films show a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 3.8 nm. After SVA treatment, the film morphology of the PTB7-Th:FRd2 film becomes smoother and the RMS roughness of the film surface is found to be 2.3 nm only. Because of its smoother morphology, charge transport and collection are expected to be higher in SVA treated devices, which are in agreement with our device results.

The micro-structural features of pure FRd2 and blend films prepared under different experimental conditions were studied using two-dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD). The additive added blend films showed two weak peaks at q ∼ 0.14 and 1.7 Å−1 due to lamellar (h00) and π–π stacking (010), respectively, which marginally improves with SVA treatment as shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†). While it is difficult to draw any conclusion from GIXRD results, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images provide more clear information regarding the evolution of the PTB7-Th:FRd2 blend morphology before and after annealing treatments and with or without solvent additives. Fig. 6 shows TEM images of PTB7-Th:FRd2 blend films prepared under different conditions. No distinct feature was found in the ‘as cast’ and ‘thermally annealed’ blend films without any additive. However, the addition of the DIO additive induces some ordering features, which are most prominent in the case of SVA treated blend films.

In conclusion, we have designed and synthesized a new non-fullerene acceptor (FRd2) containing a central electron donating fluorene core attached to the rhodanine end groups via benzothiadiazole and furan π-spacers for use in OSCs. FRd2 has good solubility, a strong absorption profile ranging from 300 to 620 nm with a high molar extinction coefficient, suitable FMO energy levels and a good quenching ability. Its photovoltaic performance was studied in inverted structured BHJ OSCs. PTB7-Th:FRd2 based OPV devices treated by solvent vapor annealing exhibited the highest PCE of 9.4% with a Jsc of 15.7 mA cm−2 and an FF of 72.3%. The deeply lying LUMO energy level of FRd2 resulted in a high Voc of 0.83 V. As PTB7-Th and FRd2 have absorption profiles complementary to each other, both contributed to the photocurrent significantly, which is one of the possible reasons to achieve a high PCE. A high EQE value of 75% was also observed in SVA treated devices. To the best of our knowledge, 9.4% is the highest PCE reported ever for fluorene core based fullerene-free OSCs. S. Holliday et al. earlier reported one fluorene core based SMNFA coded as FBR end capped with rhodanine, which demonstrated good photovoltaic performance.8 We synthesized FRd2 using the same core and chromophoric groups by incorporating furan units to examine the effect of π-spacers on the opto-electronic properties of the SMNFA. It is seen that FRd2 has deeper FMO energy levels and a lower band gap compared to FBR. Hence, introduction of a furan π-spacer appears to be a good strategy to develop efficient SMNFAs by extending π-conjugation through the molecular backbone. This work demonstrates that fluorene based SMNFAs have potential to achieve high PCE by suitable molecular engineering and proper optimization of device fabrication steps.
