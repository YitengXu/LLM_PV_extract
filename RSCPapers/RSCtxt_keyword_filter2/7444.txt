    , Accepted 18th September 2015First published on 18th September 2015AbstractIn this study, two donor–acceptor polymers, P(QP-TT) and P(QP-TT-Zn), were synthesized based on the 2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene (TT) donor unit and quinoxalino[2,3-b′]porphyrin (QP) or quinoxalino[2,3-b′]porphyrinatozinc (QP-Zn) acceptor unit. Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated. An alternative strategy for optimizing the photovoltaic devices by using a linear bidentate ligand additive, 4,4′-bipyridine (Bipy), is reported. The Bipy additive is totally different from the most widely used solvent additives in that it can form a coordination effect with metalloporphyrin-based polymers and leads to more ordered arrangements of polymers. Photovoltaic devices based on P(QP-TT-Zn) showed a notable improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) when a small amount of Bipy was added to the blend solution. Further optimization combined with thermal annealing and methanol treatment showed a significant improvement of PCE from 0.85 to 3.51%, which is the highest value among PSC devices based on porphyrin-based conjugated polymers. However, application of the same optimization methods to devices based on P(QP-TT) showed no improvements of photovoltaic performance. Morphology analysis revealed that blend films of P(QP-TT-Zn):PC71BM showed desired interpenetrating networks with some ordered packing in the thin film after adding the Bipy additive. The results suggest that the improvements of the photovoltaic performance are potentially due to the coordination effect between the nitrogen of Bipy and central zinc of P(QP-TT-Zn).
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted an increasing amount of attention in recent years because of their significant advantages of low cost, light weight and easy fabrication compared with conventional inorganic solar cells.1 Great progress has been made in improving the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of photovoltaic devices since the inception of BHJ in 1995.2 Until now, the encouraging PCEs have exceeded 9% for single cells3 and 10.6% for tandem cells.4 However, current efficiencies and stabilities of the devices still require further improvements to truly compete with their inorganic counterparts.
Porphyrins and their derivatives have been intensively studied for many years in the fields of photochemical and biological applications.5 Porphyrins are derived from chlorophylls which are critical to the natural photosynthetic systems in green plants, but they are more stable and synthetically accessible than chlorophylls.6 Porphyrins contain an extensively two-dimensional π-conjugated system that is suitable for light-harvesting and efficient electron transfer.7 They absorb light strongly in the blue and moderately in the green regions with a high molar absorbtion coefficient. Also, the optical, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of porphyrins can be systematically tuned by metal insertion into the core and by modification at the peripheral positions. Therefore, porphyrin molecules and polymers have been applied in organic electronic devices, such as light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors, and solar cells. Unfortunately, most solar cells based on porphyrins showed inferior performance mainly because of the narrow absorption spectra and insufficient conjugation in the main chains.8
In our previous studies, we reported the design and synthesis of a series of donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) conjugated polymers based on quinoxalino[2,3-b′]porphyrin (QP) as a novel acceptor unit, where the porphyrin was edge-fused with a pyrazine ring to the polymer backbones rather than directly introduced in a meso-linkage form to the main chains. The ingenious structure of QP not only possesses the extensively π-conjugated system, unique photophysical and electrochemical properties, and good thermal stability of porphyrin9 but also diminishes the steric hindrance between porphyrin macrocycles and neighboring units. Moreover, efficient photoinduced charge separation and transfer occurs between porphyrins and fullerene derivatives, which can lead to a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) and PCEs.10 The resulting polymers showed broadened and enhanced Q band absorptions with no absorption blanks between the Soret band and Q bands. A PCE of 2.53% was obtained for the polymer composed of QP, terthiophene, and carbazole. This PCE value was the highest one among porphyrin-based conjugated polymers at that time.11 However, this PCE value was still low compared with the PSCs based on other high efficiency polymers. In order to further improve the photovoltaic performance of QP-based PSCs, many studies were attempted to optimize the devices. Unfortunately, none of the conventional optimization strategies, including using solvent additives or thermal annealing of the photoactive layers, worked on these devices. Inspired by the report on the axial coordination of metalloporphyrins with multidentate ligands,12 here, we develop a new strategy to control the morphology of the donor/acceptor blend film by using an appropriate multidentate ligand as an additive, therefore inducing ordered arrangements of QP-based polymers.
The multidentate ligand additives differ from the solvent additives in the principle of affecting the blend film morphology. Fig. 1 shows some widely used solvent additives for processing photovoltaic cells, such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO),13 1,8-octanedithiol (OT),14 hexadecane (HD),15 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP),16 1-chloronaphthalene (CN),17 triethylene glycol (TEG),15 diethylene glycol dibutyl ether (DEG-DBE),16 and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).18 Generally, a solvent additive has selective solubility towards the donor and acceptor materials. In most cases, the solvent additive is a poor solvent for the polymer donor and can only dissolve the PCBM acceptor during casting the photoactive layer and thereby control the morphology and improve the photovoltaic performance of the devices. However, the principle of selecting appropriate solvent additives remains relatively unclear. The same solvent additive sometimes shows totally different effects on the photovoltaic devices based on different materials. In some cases, the effective solvent additive for one donor/acceptor system did not affect another system or even deteriorated the device performance, but the reasons for the negative effects were hard to completely explain. This unclear guideline for choosing solvent additives brings a lot of difficulties in searching for the appropriate additives for different material systems. For example, the most widely used additive, DIO, which was proved to be a successful additive in improving the photovoltaic performance based on a lot of donor/acceptor systems,13 did not show any desirable effects on some material systems, especially on the porphyrin-based polymers that we recently studied. Therefore, it would be of great importance to find a more controlled way to search for the appropriate additives according to the structure of materials rather than by blindly selecting various solvent additives. Unlike solvent additives, multidentate ligand additives affect the morphology by forming axial coordination with metalloporphyrin-based polymer donors rather than by utilizing different solvencies for donor and acceptor materials. It should be mentioned that, because metalloporphyrins are capable of forming noncovalent intermolecular bonds based on axial coordination of multidentate ligands containing nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur atoms with central metals,19 attempting to utilize this axial coordination between metalloporphyrins and multidentate ligands is expected to be feasible to induce ordered arrangements of metalloporphyrin-based polymers. This strategy can further be applied to other systems based on metalloporphyrins and multidentate ligands containing nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur atoms. Moreover, the improved morphology and ordered arrangements caused by coordination are more stable than those by simple different solvency. Therefore, optimized devices processed with multidentate ligands are expected to have better stability than those processed with solvent additives.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of some widely used additives in processing photovoltaic cells. 
In order to understand the effect of multidentate ligand additives on QP-based PSCs, in this study, two D–A polymers, P(QP-TT) and P(QP-TT-Zn), based on 2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene (TT) as the donor unit and QP or quinoxalino[2,3-b′]porphyrinatozinc (QP-Zn) as the acceptor unit were designed and synthesized. The following systematic optimization of photovoltaic devices by using 4,4′-bipyridine (Bipy) as the additive combined with thermal annealing and solvent treatment was performed. It should be noted that the Bipy additive used as a ternary composition in the polymer:PC71BM active layer plays an important role in improving the photovoltaic performance of PSCs based on polymers containing QP-Zn (Fig. 2). Because Bipy is a kind of linear bidentate ligand, two exo-bidentate nitrogen atoms of Bipy can form coordination bonds with the central zinc of QP-Zn,20 inducing the assembly and ordered packing of the polymers, which leads to a more optimal morphology of the blend film and improved photovoltaic performance of the devices. Based on our study, we can find that the incorporation of 1% Bipy into the P(QP-TT-Zn):PC71BM blend is sufficient to induce ordered packing and improve the morphology of the film. The PCE increased from 0.85% for the device fabricated without Bipy additive to 2.17% for the device containing 1% Bipy. Subsequent processing approaches such as thermal annealing and solvent treatment further controlled the morphology and increased the PCE to 3.51%, which is the highest value among the PSC devices based on porphyrin-based conjugated polymers. However, adding Bipy into the zinc-free polymer, P(QP-TT), did not show any observable improvements of the device performance. The results demonstrated that using a small amount of linear bidentate ligand additive Bipy combined with thermal annealing and solvent treatment can significantly enhance the PCEs of the BHJ solar cells. This study provides a new strategy for optimizing the photovoltaic performance of PSCs based on metalloporphyrin-based polymers by using the coordination effect between multidentate ligands and metalloporphyrin-based polymers.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and thermal stability
The syntheses of P(QP-TT) and P(QP-TT-Zn) are shown in Scheme 1. 5,10,15,20-Tetrakis(4-tert-butylphenyl)-5′,8′-dibromo-quinoxalino[2,3-b′]porphyrin (QP) and 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-tert-butylphenyl)quinoxalino[2,3-b′]-5′,8′-dibromoporphyrinatozinc (QP-Zn) were prepared according to our previous report.11b 2,2′:5′,2′′-Terthiophene-5,5′′-bis-(trimethylstannane) (TT) was prepared similar to the reported procedures.21 The polymers, P(QP-TT) and P(QP-TT-Zn), were synthesized by the palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction with an equivalent molar ratio of monomer QP or QP-Zn to TT. Detailed procedures can be found in the Experimental section. The resulting polymers were obtained as black solids with good yields of 68% and 67%. Both P(QP-TT) and P(QP-TT-Zn) can be readily dissolved in common solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and tetrahydrofuran. The molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The number-average molecular weight (Mn), weight-average molecular weight (Mw), and polydispersity index (PDI) of P(QP-TT) and P(QP-TT-Zn) are listed in Table 1. Fig. 3 shows the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) plots of P(QP-TT) and P(QP-TT-Zn) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under an inert atmosphere, reflecting that the polymers have good thermal stability up to 472–489 °C with 5% weight loss. It should be noted that 489 °C is almost the highest 5% weight loss temperature among QP-based conjugated polymers, which may be mainly ascribed to the abundant porphyrin skeletons in the polymer.

Optical properties
UV-vis absorption spectra of P(QP-TT) and P(QP-TT-Zn) in chloroform solution and in thin films are shown in Fig. 4. Compared with the absorption of P(QP-TT), the absorption of P(QP-TT-Zn) showed a slight blue-shift, which is consistent with the absorption features of the monomer QP and QP-Zn.11b In both solution and film, P(QP-TT-Zn) showed one strong absorption peak at around 425 nm and two weak absorption peaks at around 600–650 nm, which was much similar to the absorption feature of porphyrin derivatives. In chloroform solution, P(QP-TT-Zn) showed an absorption peak wavelength (λabs) at 425 nm and two weak peaks at 585 and 645 nm. In thin films, all the three absorption peaks red-shifted due to the aggregation of polymer chains in the solid state. The λabs red-shifted to 428 nm and the other two weak peaks red-shifted to 591 and 651 nm. Compared with the absorption of the two polymers in solution, the absorption in films was observably broadened and enhanced, indicating that an effective intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect along the polymer chains was formed. The absorption edge wavelengths (λonset) of P(QP-TT) and P(QP-TT-Zn) in films were 726 and 735 nm, corresponding to the optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.71 and 1.69 eV calculated according to the equation: Eoptg = 1240 nm eV/λonset.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to investigate the electrochemical properties of the polymers. The cyclic voltammograms of the polymer films are shown in Fig. 5. The onset oxidation potential (Eox) and onset reduction potential (Ered) of P(QP-TT) and P(QP-TT-Zn) are listed in Table 2. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, and the electrochemical bandgap (Eecg) of the polymers can be calculated according to the following equations:22 HOMO = −e(Eox + 4.71) (eV)(1) LUMO = −e(Ered + 4.71) (eV)(2) Eecg = e(Eox − Ered) (eV)(3)

The calculated HOMO, LUMO and Eecg of P(QP-TT) are −5.34, −3.57, and 1.77 eV, and those of P(QP-TT-Zn) are −5.20, −3.54, and 1.66 eV, respectively. It can be noted that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P(QP-TT-Zn) are higher than those of P(QP-TT), which may be ascribed to the weaker electron affinity of QP-Zn than QP.23 The electrochemical bandgaps of the polymers agree well with the optical bandgaps within experimental error. Here, the HOMO energy level of the polymer is mainly dominated by the TT unit, and the LUMO energy level of the polymer is mainly dominated by the QP unit. Compared with other QP-based conjugated polymers,19 both HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers are located at reasonable positions to provide enough open circuit voltage of the photovoltaic devices as well as sufficient driving force for photoinduced charge separation and transfer between the polymer donor and fullerene derivative acceptor without too much loss.24
Theoretical calculations
The molecular geometries and the electron density of states distribution for P(QP-TT) and P(QP-TT-Zn) were simulated using density functional theory (DFT). The DFT calculations were performed by the Gaussian 09 program package with the B3LYP functional and a 6-31G(d,p) basis set. Compounds containing one repeating unit were taken as the models for calculations and the 4-tert-butylphenyl groups at 10- and 15-positions of QP were replaced by phenyl groups, as shown in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Molecular geometry sketches used for the computational data. 
The optimized molecular geometries of the polymers are shown in Fig. 7, and the dihedral angles between the repeating units are listed in Table 3. The relatively small dihedral angles of the two polymers indicated good planarity of the backbones of both the polymers, which benefits π–π stacking of their backbones in the solid state and charge transfer. The slight difference of the dihedral angles between P(QP-TT) and P(QP-TT-Zn) also indicated that the complexing of zinc did not affect too much on the molecular geometry of the polymer. Fig. 8 shows the frontier orbital energy levels of the polymers. The HOMO wave function is delocalized over the whole π-conjugated polymer backbones, while the LUMO wave function is mostly localized on the QP or QP-Zn group, indicating the formation of well-defined D–A structures and the occurrence of an effective ICT behavior of the materials.

Photovoltaic properties
Photovoltaic properties were investigated by fabricating polymeric BHJ solar cells with a conventional configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive layer/Ca/Al. Photoactive layers were spin-coated from 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) solutions of the polymers and PC71BM. In order to optimize the device performances, the weight ratio of polymers to PC71BM and the amount of the linear bidentate ligand additive, Bipy, were carefully adjusted. Also, thermal annealing and methanol treatment were applied to achieve better device performances. The current density–voltage characteristics of the PSCs based on the polymers:PC71BM under illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 9. The performance parameters of the PSCs fabricated under different optimized conditions are summarized in Table 4. Unfortunately, for PSCs based on P(QP-TT):PC71BM, no distinct improvements of the devices were obtained whatever kind of optimization approaches were applied, such as using the Bipy additive, thermal annealing, or methanol treatment. For PSCs based on P(QP-TT-Zn):PC71BM, we first varied the weight ratio of P(QP-TT-Zn) to PC71BM and the result turned out that photovoltaic devices with the D/A weight ratio of 1:3 showed the best PCE of 0.85% under illumination of AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2) with a cell area of 4 mm2. Then, a different amount of Bipy was added to the blend solution as the linear bidentate ligand additive. Interestingly, when 0.5% Bipy was applied, the PCE of the device remarkably improved from 0.85 to 1.56% with a general increase of the open-circuit voltage (Voc), Jsc, and fill factor (FF). Increasing the amount of Bipy to 1% further improved the PCE to 2.17%. However, further increasing the amount of Bipy to 1.5% degraded the performance of photovoltaic devices (see Fig. S3 and Table S1, ESI†). The effect of the Bipy additive on the photovoltaic performances can be potentially ascribed to the coordination effect between two exobidentate nitrogen atoms of Bipy and the central zinc of P(QP-TT-Zn), resulting in the ordered packing and improvement of morphology of the blend films, as discussed in the following film morphology section. When an excessive amount of Bipy additive was added to the blend solution, Bipy molecules significantly interfered with the miscibility between P(QP-TT-Zn) and PC71BM, leading to the reduced D/A interfacial area where exciton separation and transfer occurs. Therefore, PSCs with 1.5% Bipy additive showed degraded photovoltaic performance with decreased Jsc and FF. It is believed that the amount of 1% is the best amount for Bipy additive because it provides both the efficient coordination effect between Bipy and P(QP-TT-Zn) for inducing the optimization of film morphology and good miscibility between P(QP-TT-Zn) and PC71BM for ensuring sufficient exciton separation and transfer.

In order to further optimize the photovoltaic performances of P(QP-TT-Zn)-based PSCs, thermal annealing was applied to the devices. The device with P(QP-TT-Zn):PC71BM (1:3, w/w) as the photoactive layer and 1% Bipy as the additive showed a largely improved PCE of 2.73% with increased Voc of 0.77 V and Jsc of 8.50 mA cm−2 after 110 °C thermal annealing for 10 min. Inspired by recent work on methanol treatment,25 we used methanol to further optimize the photovoltaic performances. Cheerfully, further improvement of photovoltaic performances was achieved after methanol treatment. The PCE of the device with methanol treatment increased to 3.51% together with increased Voc of 0.79 V, Jsc of 8.85 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.50. To the best of our knowledge, this PCE is the highest value in the PSC devices based on porphyrin-based conjugated polymers. It should be noted that the simultaneous enhancement of Voc, Jsc, and FF in the PSC devices was very significant to obtain the higher PCEs. Because there exists a trade-off between Jsc and Voc, many other approaches usually can only improve one or two key parameters of the photovoltaic performance at a time.26 Although a complete mechanistic understanding needs to be further investigated, it is evident that the Voc, Jsc, and FF of P(QP-TT-Zn)-based PSCs can be simultaneously enhanced when the Bipy additive was used while those of P(QP-TT)-based PSCs remained unchanged under the same optimized conditions. The simultaneous enhancements of Voc, Jsc, and FF were also found in the PSCs based on nitrogen-containing polymer donors with incorporation of a polyfluorene interlayer (PFN), where N–N interactions between the polymer donor and the PFN interlayer were considered to be the main reason that caused the recovery of Voc loss and the improvements of Jsc and FF.27 We suspect similar Zn–N interactions between the polymer donor and the Bipy additive could be the origin of the enhancement of Voc, Jsc, and FF. Based on the above results, we can conclude that using Bipy as a linear bidentate ligand additive combined with thermal annealing and solvent treatment can significantly enhance the PCEs of QP-based PSCs for over 4 times higher than the PCEs of the original devices without any additives.

Fig. 10 represents the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices fabricated under the optimized conditions for each polymer. All the devices showed a broad EQE response ranging from 300 to 750 nm. As observed, P(QP-TT-Zn) showed the highest EQE value of 57% at 456 nm, while P(QP-TT) showed the highest EQE value of only 28% at 459 nm. The device of P(QP-TT-Zn) showed large improved quantum efficiencies in the whole response, especially in the range of 400–550 nm, after the use of Bipy additive combined with thermal annealing and methanol treatment, indicating that these optimization approaches facilitate the generation of photocurrent, which conformed to the large increase in Jsc of the photovoltaic devices.

Film morphology
In order to reveal the effect of Bipy additive and the optimized conditions on photovoltaic performances of QP-based PSCs, atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements were performed. Fig. 11 shows the height and phase images of P(QP-TT-Zn):PC71BM (1:3, w/w) blend films under different optimized conditions recorded by tapping mode AFM. All blend films showed nanoscale phase separation. The blend film without additive showed large D/A domains with a high average surface roughness (Ra) of 4.51 nm, indicating that PC71BM showed a significant aggregation which was unfavorable to charge separation and transport. Interestingly, when 1% Bipy was used as additive, the aggregation of PC71BM disappeared and the surface morphology of the blend film became smoother and more uniform with a Ra of 0.63 nm. It is believed that the coordination effect between Bipy and P(QP-TT-Zn) played a critical role in optimizing film morphology. After annealing at 110 °C, clear nanoscale phase separation was formed and the Ra of the blend film increased to 1.67 nm. The increased roughness can be ascribed to the enhanced ordered packing of the polymer after thermal annealing. After methanol treatment was applied to the blend film, the roughness further increased to 1.89 nm and larger domain sizes were observed compared with the morphology without methanol treatment. The effects of methanol treatment on the optimization of film morphology and corresponding enhancement of photovoltaic performances of PSCs were also presented in previous studies.15,28 Among the above processing conditions, it can be noted that using Bipy as the additive is the most critical way to optimize the morphology of the blend film, leading to some ordered arrangements of the polymer potentially because of the coordination effect of Bipy and more efficient exciton separation and transfer at the D/A interface.

TEM measurements were performed to investigate the effect of different optimized conditions on the nanostructures of P(QP-TT-Zn):PC71BM (1:3, w/w) blend films. As shown in Fig. 12, the TEM images of the blend films correlate well with the surface morphologies observed by AFM. The blend film without the additive showed clear phase separation in nanoscale, and PC71BM-rich domains appeared to be the isolated dark regions, which could be not good for charge separation and transport. After adding 1% Bipy, the PC71BM-rich domains became blurred with finer phase domains, indicating that Bipy played an important role in controlling the film morphology. After annealing at 110 °C, apparent donor/acceptor nanoscale interpenetrating networks were formed, indicating that annealing is likely to facilitate the coordination effect between Bipy and P(QP-TT-Zn) and resulted in a more ordered nanostructure. After methanol treatment was applied to the blend film, the interpenetrating networks became clearer with a feature size of about 20 nm, which was reported to be the most suitable size for efficient charge separation and transport.1c,4,29 From the TEM investigations, we can generally conclude that the improvements of the PSC performance were mainly because of the forming of better morphology of the blend films after using the Bipy additive together with annealing and methanol treatment.

GIXRD measurements were performed to study the crystallinity and molecular organization of the polymer films after adding Bipy as the additive. For the thin films of P(QP-TT), no diffraction peaks were observed under all these optimized conditions, as shown in Fig. S4.† Neither adding Bipy alone or adding Bipy combined with thermal annealing as well as methanol treatment influences the crystallinity or molecular organization of P(QP-TT) films. For the thin films of P(QP-TT-Zn), the out-of-plane and in-plane XRD patterns of P(QP-TT-Zn) films under different optimized conditions are shown in Fig. 13. No diffraction peaks were observed in the film without the additive, indicating that the original film stayed in the amorphous form. After adding 1% Bipy, weak diffraction peak (100) appeared at 2θ = 5.20°, corresponding to the lamellar distance of 16.97 Å. Compared with other common conjugated polymers, the relatively short lamellar distance of P(QP-TT-Zn) was probably due to the lack of long alkyl chains attached to the polymer backbones. Another weak diffraction peak (010) at 2θ = 15.90° can also be observed, corresponding to the π–π distance of 5.56 Å. We suggest that adding Bipy as additive would induce the coordination effect with the polymer backbones, leading to the formation of some ordered packing in the polymer. After annealing at 110 °C, the diffraction peaks showed a slight enhancement, and the diffraction peak (010) shifted to 2θ = 16.89°, corresponding to a shorter π–π distance of 5.24 Å. The shorter π–π distance of the polymer chains may be attributed to the more efficient coordination effect of Bipy assisted by thermal annealing, which induced the polymer to form more ordered arrangements. After methanol treatment was applied, the diffraction peaks showed further enhancements and the diffraction peak (100) became sharper. It demonstrated that methanol treatment can also facilitate formation of a more ordered thin film. In addition, the (100) diffraction peak corresponding to the lamellar stacking structures observed from the out-of-plane scattering also appeared in the in-plane pattern, indicating no preferential orientation between edge-on and face-on structures.

In addition, it has been reported that formation of a coordinative complex is always accompanied by a red shift of the Soret band in the UV-vis absorption of the porphyrin compound.12 Therefore, we measured the UV-vis absorption spectra of both the pristine P(QP-TT-Zn) thin film and P(QP-TT-Zn):PC71BM blended film with and without Bipy as additive to see whether this phenomenon occurs in this system. As shown in Fig. S6,† red shifts of the Soret band were observed in both absorption spectra after 1% Bipy was added, which suggested the formation of coordination between P(QP-TT-Zn) and Bipy. Interestingly, the extent of the red shifts was almost the same (about 7 nm), indicating that the existence of PC71BM has little influence on the coordination effect. However, when giving insight into the exact structure of the coordination complex, the situation is far more complicated than expected. For example, to small molecules, the complex would exist as 2:1 type (a dimeric porphyrin with one ligand) in most cases. But a 3:2 complex (a porphyrin trimer with two ligands) would also be formed in the presence of excess of the ligand.20 When it comes to polymers, the situation becomes more complicated which needs further studies to figure it out. We suppose that there exists a limit of the coordination. While the majority of P(QP-TT-Zn) molecules were coordinated by Bipy in a bidentate fashion, some of the molecules may be coordinated in a mono-dentate fashion or even free from the Bipy bidentate ligand. But at least in the current circumstance, adding Bipy as a bidentate ligand additive is still an effective way to optimize the film morphology and thus improve the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs.
Conclusions
In conclusion, a strategy using a linear bidentate ligand additive, Bipy, to optimize the morphology of the active layers and improve performance of the relative photovoltaic cells has been successfully demonstrated. By using the Bipy additive, a 4 times improved PCE of 3.51% for the PSC based on P(QP-TT-Zn):PC71BM was achieved due to simultaneous enhancement of Voc, Jsc, and FF, which is the highest PCE value in the PSC devices based on porphyrin-based conjugated polymers. However, the same strategy did not work on similar devices based on the free-base porphyrin polymer. The effect of the Bipy additive on the improvement of device performance based on P(QP-TT-Zn):PC71BM can be potentially ascribed to the coordination effect between the nitrogen of Bipy and central zinc of P(QP-TT-Zn), leading to a more ordered arrangement of the active layer film, which was confirmed by the morphology analysis. This paper provides an effective way to enhance the photovoltaic performance by using additives according to the structure of materials rather than by blindly selecting various solvent additives. Similar multidentate ligands are expected to be helpful to optimize the photovoltaic devices based on other metalloporphyrin-based polymers.

Measurements and characterization

1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV 600 spectrometer in CDCl3 at room temperature. The molecular weight and polydispersity index were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) performed on Waters 515-2410 with polystyrene as a standard and THF as an eluent. Elemental analyses were performed on a varioELcube analyzer. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed on a NetzschTG209C instrument under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu spectrometer model UV-3150. Absorption spectra measurements of polymer solutions were performed in chloroform at room temperature. Absorption spectra measurements of polymer films were performed on quartz plates with polymer films spin-coated from polymer solutions in chlorobenzene at room temperature. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted on a Chenhua Shanghai CHI660A electrochemical workstation with a Pt disk coated with the polymer film, Pt plate, and Ag/Ag+ electrode as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively, in a 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6)–acetonitrile solution. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements of the surface morphology of the photoactive layers were carried out on a Dimension 3100 from Veeco Instruments and operated in a tapping mode. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed on a Hitachi H-800 transmission electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Thin films were floated on deionized water, transferred onto a copper grid, and dried for 2 h before use. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements of thin films were performed by illuminating on the drop-cast films at a constant incidence angle of 0.2° (λ = 2dsinθ = 1.54 Å).
Fabrication of photovoltaic devices
PSCs with the simple conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive layer/Ca/Al were fabricated, where ITO glass is the positive electrode, Ca/Al is the negative electrode, and the blend film of the polymer and PC71BM between them is the photoactive layer. The ITO glass was pre-cleaned and a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution was spin-cast on the ITO substrate. The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer was about 60 nm. Blend solutions were prepared in DCB at a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 (polymer/solvent). The polymer:PC71BM blend solutions were stirred at 60 °C for about 6 h to ensure full dissolution. A small amount of additive can be added to the blend solution as needed. Then the blend solution was spin-coated on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode. Thermal annealing was applied to the devices as needed. Before the evaporation of the Ca/Al cathode, a small amount of methanol can be used to treat the PSC devices as needed. The thickness of the photoactive layer was about 100 nm, measured on an Ambios Tech XP-2 profilometer. The effective area of one cell was 4 mm2. The current–voltage (J–V) measurements of the devices were performed on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit in a dry box under an inert atmosphere. A xenon lamp with an AM1.5 filter was used as the white light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2.
