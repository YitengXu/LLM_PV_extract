Over the last few years p-type dye sensitized solar cells (p-DSCs) have attracted substantial attention, since their incorporation with n-type DSCs could potentially lead to more efficient tandem cell pn-DSCs. Moreover, new research has been devoted to dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells (DSPECs), in which solar energy is utilized to generate hydrogen via water splitting. This article provides a summary of recent sensitizers employed in dye-sensitized NiO photocathodes for DSC and DSPEC, discussing approaches to enhance their overall performance. In particular, we intend to provide new directions through molecular design of new dyes and stimulate additional research development in the fields of DSCs and DSPECs.Vasilis NikolaouVasilis Nikolaou was born in Rhodes (Greece) in 1990.

1. Introduction
Handling the constant depletion of fossil fuels, as well as the world's increasing energy demand, is one of the most vital challenges in our society. A great number of environmental issues are derived from fossil fuel consumption causing severe global warming.1,2 In addition, the resources of fossil fuels will be exhausted in the near future, hence there is a necessity to exploit alternative energy sources.3–5 Solar energy appears as one of the most advantageous candidates being inexhaustible, clean and abundant.6–9 In this context, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are attractive photovoltaic devices because of their easy fabrication, inexpensive production and low dependence both on the angle of incoming light and solar irradiance regarding power conversion efficiency (PCE). Notably, these features are essential advantages of DSCs over traditional crystalline silicon solar cells.10–12
Over the last few decades n-type DSCs based on a TiO2 semiconductor (SC) have dominated the scientific interest, however, the best photo-conversion efficiency is yet lower than 15%.13–15 In order to improve this conversion efficiency, a possible approach is to pair a conventional TiO2-based photoanode with a dye-sensitized photocathode to create a tandem device.16–18 Even though theoretically pn-type DSCs could reach energy conversion efficiencies of about 40%,19,20 the maximum photo-conversion efficiency is yet only 4.1%.18,21 The low efficiency of the tandem devices is predominantly attributed to the weak performance of the p-type photocathode. Specifically, the poor PCEs of p-DSCs are due to the low photocurrent density and low voltage produced by the photocathode. Consequently, the most critical step for the development of efficient tandem cells is improving the photovoltaic performance of p-type DSCs. Until now, the most frequently used p-type SC for the development of p-DSCs is nickel oxide (NiO),20,22 while delafossites (CuMO2, where M = Al, Ga, Cr, Fe, In, etc.)19 and other inorganic materials such as CuO23–26 have only been investigated recently.
The operation principle of a representative p-DSC is illustrated in Scheme 1. The primary step in such devices involves the light excitation of the sensitizer (S) which is chemisorbed on the NiO surface. Subsequently, the excited state of the sensitizer (S*) is formed, followed by immediate hole injection into the valence band (VB) of nickel oxide. Then, the reduced dye (S−) is restored to its ground state by a redox shuttle, which is simultaneously oxidized (typically dye+ + I− → dye + I2−˙). The final step is the diffusion of the redox mediator to the counter electrode (CE) to deliver the electron into the external circuit. The maximum achievable voltage of the device (VOC) is the difference between the redox couple potential and the Fermi level of NiO, which is the conduction band edge.
 Scheme 1  Operation principle of a NiO DSC. Dashed arrows represent the two recombination processes between: (i) the dye and NiO, (ii) the redox couple and NiO. Straight blue arrows stand for electron transfer processes, while TCO stands for transparent conductive oxide. 
To estimate the PCE of a photovoltaic device we need to consider, apart from the VOC, two additional major factors, namely, the short circuit photocurrent density (JSC) and the fill factor (ff). Maximizing one of these terms will lead to enhanced power conversion efficiency, a difficult task considering the important charge recombination processes that are involved in the operation of the cell. To date, the best NiO p-DSC exhibits power conversion efficiency of 2.51%, with VOC = 724 mV, JSC = 4.11 mA cm−2, ff = 0.44, using the redox couple [Fe(acac)3]0/1− as the electrolyte.27 Nevertheless, in most devices using iodide/triiodide based electrolytes the PCE values often ranges between 0.1 and 0.5%.18,28,29
The low photovoltaic performance of p-DSCs, is associated with the fast charge recombination (CR) reaction between the injected holes and: (a) the reduced dye (so called geminate charge recombination) or (b) the reduced form of the redox mediator (interfacial charge recombination). The origin of these damaging charge recombination processes was elucidated mostly due to the studies of Hammarström and co-workers.30–33 Initially, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies demonstrated that NiO contains an intragap state. This is an accessible electronic level (i.e. density of state) situated between the valence and conduction bands (∼−0.1 V vs. Ag/Ag+) and 200 mV above the valence edge potential.31,33,34 These intragap states can act as traps for the injected holes, commonly corresponding to Ni3+ cations located onto the NiO surface that are oxidized into Ni4+ after hole injection.31 These states can facilitate geminate charge recombination via overlapping with the LUMO of the dye32 as well as diminish the charge recombination Gibbs free energy that passes into the normal Marcus region.30 It is worth mentioning that in TiO2 based Grätzel cells this is not the case, since these states are in the inverted region. Nonetheless, both of these two processes accelerate the CR reactions in NiO based DSCs. Unfortunately, these surface trap states also have a profound impact on the interfacial CR, since they also assist charge recombination of the holes with the electrolyte. The use of a chemical reductant or heat31 reduces the number of Ni3+ cations, thus preventing the approach of the electrolyte to the NiO surface. This can be improved by introducing a compact layer of chenodeoxycholic acid35 leading to solar cells with much higher VOC values. The function of the electrolyte is to transfer electrons from the counter electrode to the reduced dye. Notably, essential requirements for an efficient working electrolyte are its high mobility and the redox potential to maximize the VOC. Furthermore, the role of the redox shuttle is to regenerate the reduced dye quantitatively and consequently its redox potential must be more positive than that of the sensitizer (S/S−).
The purpose of this review is to summarize recent sensitizers utilized for p-DSCs and p-DSPECs, providing guiding strategies in order to develop better performing devices. This manuscript is divided into two main sections: sensitizers utilized in (a) p-DSCs and (b) DSPECs. In the first section (part 2), the major classes of chromophores employed as sensitizers in p-DSCs are presented, discussing their key properties as well as their impact on the photovoltaic performance. The second section (part 3) is devoted to sensitizers utilized in NiO-based dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells (DSPECs) for hydrogen production and carbon dioxide reduction. Furthermore, a collection of the performances regarding all recently reported dyes is summarized in the two tables provided (Tables 1 and 2). It is well-accepted that the performance of a solar cell is not only dependent on the active material, but also on the fabrication method, the skills of the experimentalist and the photovoltaic measurement method.36 Consequently, the reported photovoltaic parameters cannot be taken as absolute values. Moreover, in regular Grätzel cells the optimal thickness of TiO2 can vary regarding the extinction coefficient of each dye. However, in p-DSCs the optimal NiO thickness is only 2–3 μm since the hole diffusion length is very short owing to charge recombination.20,37,38 Accordingly, the majority of the p-DSCs are constructed within this range of thickness (2–3 μm). In the last section (part 4), new directions that can stimulate additional research development in the fields of DSCs and DSPECs are discussed.

2. Sensitizers employed in p-DSCs
2.1 Porphyrin, phthalocyanines and Bodipy dyes
Porphyrins and their analogues are ideal candidates for DSC applications since they exhibit photo-, electrochemical and thermal stability.39–42 Notably, their key merits such as the intense spectral absorption as well as the appropriate HOMO and LUMO orbitals have led them to stand among the most efficient dyes in n-type DSCs to date.15,43 Porphyrinoids have a decisive role in photosynthesis on account of their unique absorption and photoredox properties.44–47 The first example that stands as the proof of the p-DSC concept was reported by He et al. in 1999 (Fig. 1).48 In this work, a NiO electrode was dyed with tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP), generating a very low power conversion efficiency of 0.01%. A few years later, a phosphorus porphyrin (PPorph) was investigated, which exhibited stronger oxidizing power compared to zinc porphyrin in the excited state (Fig. 1).49 Although the photovoltaic performance of PPorph was very low, this was the first report in which the mechanism of the hole photo-injection has been characterized. The photo-physical studies revealed that PPorph induces rapid hole injection into the valence band of NiO. The overall low photovoltaic performance was attributed to the fast recombination reaction between the reduced PPorph and the injected hole.
 Fig. 1  Structures of the first two porphyrins used as sensitizers in a NiO based DSC.48,49 
In 2004, Tian et al. presented a porphyrin moiety that was applied in p-type DSCs.50 Specifically, this was the first effort in which a supramolecular assembly between an electron donor zinc tetra(carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (ZnTCPP) and an electron acceptor fullerene C60 (C60PPy) was developed (Fig. 2). The supramolecular structure (ZnTCPP/C60PPy) showed improved photovoltaic performance in comparison with the ZnTCPP alone. Essential parameters for the device performance, such as the photo-current and the photo-voltage were increased as a result of the electron transfer from ZnTCPP to C60PPy derivative. In addition, different electrolytes were employed to investigate the impact of the electron lifetime and the charge extraction on the device performance. It is noteworthy that the highest efficiency (0.13%) as well as the maximum voltage of the device (VOC = 260 mV) was measured with Co2+/3+(dtbp)3 as the electrolyte.
 Fig. 2  The supramolecular assembly between ZnTCPP and C60PPy on the NiO surface of the DSC.50 
Push–pull dyes have extensively been studied for DSC applications owing to their efficient charge transfer transitions.51–54 Porphyrins suitably modified to act as push–pull dyes have widely been used as chromophores in n-DSCs, providing undoubtedly highly efficient results.40,55–59 On the other hand, the first push–pull porphyrin example for p-DSCs was reported only recently by Odobel, Jacquemin and coworkers.60 They explored a series of push–pull zinc porphyrin derivatives as sensitizers in p-DSCs (Fig. 3) using various electron withdrawing groups, namely the nitrophenyl unit, benzyl-viologen and naphthalene diimide (ZnP-eCO2H-eNO2, ZnP-CO2H-eNDI and ZnP-CO2H-BV2+, respectively). Moreover, the influence of a spacer on the device performance was examined by using an ethynyl unit. The ethynyl spacer was either introduced between the nitrophenyl or/and the carboxylic acid unit at the trans meso position of the porphyrin ring (ZnP-eCO2H-NO2 and ZnP-CO2H-eNO2). In addition to the above mentioned study, Odobel, Hammarström and coworkers have also synthesized one porphyrin moiety (ZnP-TPA-NO2) with significant charge transfer character (Fig. 3).61 Overall, the charge separation lifetime of all reported dyes was not considerably increased compared to the synthesized reference compounds (ZnP-CO2H-NO2 and ZnPref). Hence, the results regarding the photovoltaic performance of the developed DSCs were relatively poor despite the favorable charge transfer mechanisms that emerge in all push–pull dyes. In conclusion, the best performing dye (ZnP-CO2H-eNDI) exhibited 0.056% PCE, with VOC = 127 mV, JSC = 1.38 mA cm−2, ff = 0.32 using I−/I3− as the electrolyte, most likely because in this case the electron shift from the zinc porphyrin to the NDI moiety was greater, decelerating the charge recombination.

Guldi, Costa and co-workers synthesized three nickel porphycenes as chromophores in a p-type DSC (Fig. 4).62 Porphycenes are suitable for p-type DSCs due to their strong electron accepting ability, in contrast to porphyrins and phthalocyanines which are mainly electron donating dyes.40,44 Particularly, they explored the influence that the position of the anchoring group on the porphycene ring exerts on the DSC performance. Despite the great photo-stability of the porphycenes adsorbed onto NiO electrodes, the prepared DSCs resulted in moderate performances and showed low stability. The highest efficiency (0.028%) was found for the porphycene that featured two carboxylic acid units at the ethylene bridges (PORPHYC2), while porphycenes PORPHYC1 and PORPHYC3 displayed 0.019 and 0.021%, respectively.
 Fig. 4  Porphycenes PORPHYC1, PORPHYC2 and PORPHYC3 as chromophores in a p-type DSC.62 
Another class of sensitizers that have attracted considerable attention in DSCs are 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (Bodipy) derivatives.63 Bodipy dyes display relatively long fluorescence emission lifetimes, great photo-stability with a narrow but intense absorption band (∼500 nm) and large fluorescence quantum yields.64–66 To this end, a great number of Bodipy sensitizers have been tested in n-DSCs,67,68 solid-state DSCs69 and in bulk heterojunction solar cells.70–72 Lefebvre et al. published the first Bodipy sensitizer that was designed for promoting a long and efficient charge-separated state in p-DSCs.73 They synthesized a chromophore with two Bodipy dyes that were coupled with a triphenylamine thiophene bridge functionalized with a carboxylic acid unit (1) for efficient attachment on the NiO surface (Fig. 5). The NiO DSCs that were prepared with I3−/I− as the redox shuttle resulted in 0.08% efficiency with cell parameters: JSC = 3.15 mA cm−2, VOC = 79 mV, ff = 0.31. Furthermore, the calculated IPCE was 28%, which was at that moment the best reported value in comparison with previously published triphenylamine-based dyes.74,75 Based on the triphenylamine motif, Gibson and coworkers have recently synthesized several Bodipy sensitizers for p-DSCs (Bodipy-CO2H, 4, 5 and 7).76 They prepared three new chromophores comprised of a triphenylamine donor attached to different substituted Bodipy moieties. In all reported cases, the triphenylamine donor unit was functionalized with an anchoring group (carboxylic acid). Sensitizers that consist of less hindered Bodipys displayed improved electronic communication between the donor and acceptor units, leading to greater device performance. Furthermore, the enhanced electron donating properties of the thiophene spacer, compared to phenyl, increased the device efficiency. The best performing dye 7 (Fig. 5) generated a very promising IPCE of 53% and a PCE of 0.20%, since the electronic communication between the NiO and the Bodipy chromophore was favored in contrast to the more hindered dyes.

Phthalocyanines are very efficient photon harvesting dyes exhibiting high extinction coefficients in the red or near-infrared region.77 Such dyes are suitable chromophores for photo-induced applications, thus many phthalocyanine-based donor–acceptor compounds were successfully employed as sensitizers in TiO2 based DSCs78,79 and have also been studied in artificial photosynthesis schemes.44 In addition, their thermal and chemical stability along with the appropriate redox features makes phthalocyanines ideal chromophores for DSCs.79–81 Although there are plenty of studies that tackle the employment of phthalocyanines in n-DSCs,82 there are only few concerning p-DSCs and the most recent was reported in 2015 by Langmar et al.23 Two electron accepting zinc phthalocyanines (ZnPc1 and ZnPc2) functionalized with alkyl sulfonyl groups (Fig. 6) were tested as sensitizers in CuO-based p-DSCs with both iodine- and cobalt-based electrolytes. In ZnPc1 the carboxylic acid group was directly linked to the macrocycle, whereas in the ZnPc2 derivative a conjugated carboxylic acid anchoring unit was attached to facilitate charge injection. The devices resulted in maximum efficiencies of 0.103% and 0.191% for ZnPc1 and ZnPc2 respectively, using the cobalt-based electrolyte. It is noteworthy that the performance of the ZnPc2 derivative is still the highest reported for CuO p-DSCs. Charge injection and recombination processes were optimum in the case of ZnPc2, due to the enhanced electronic communication in the presence of the ethynyl bridge (Fig. 6).

2.2 Diketopyrrolopyrrole and indigo dyes
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) is another family of dyes that present very attractive properties for their employment as sensitizers in p-DSCs. They are indeed reported to be highly photostable and possess electron withdrawing character that is exploited in applications such as organic solar cells83–87 and organic field effect transistors.88,89 Moreover, push–pull dyes based on DPP proved to be particularly efficient sensitizers in conventional Grätzel DSCs.86,90–98 These valuable features prompted Odobel and co-workers to investigate the potential of DPP dyes for p-DSCs (Scheme 2).
 Scheme 2  Schematic representation regarding the key units of DPP sensitizers as well as their roles. 
Towards this goal, a series of 11 different dyes was prepared and their photovoltaic performance in NiO based p-DSCs was assessed along with a comprehensive study via detailed transient absorption spectroscopy performed by Hammarström and co-workers (Fig. 7).21,95,99,100

The first investigated structural variation concerns the nature of the electron accepting moiety placed at the extremity of the sensitizer (DPP-Br, DPP-CN2 and DPP-NDIFig. 7).95 Without any surprise, the presence of a strong electron acceptor unit leads to higher photovoltaic performance. In addition, when the electron acceptor is electronically decoupled from the dye (the case of NDI) the corresponding dyad (DPP-NDI) resulted in quite high PCEs, mostly due to the fact that the charge recombination reaction with the injected hole in NiO was slowed down by several orders of magnitude.99 Then, it was decided to probe the impact of the anchoring group100 by replacing the thienyl carboxylic acid in DPP-Br and DPP-NDI by a N,N-di(4-benzoic acid)phenylamine group (such as in TPA-nPh-DPP or TPA-nPh-DPP-NDI (n = 1 or 2)), because this moiety gave quite good results with push–pull dyes (see Section 2.4). Surprisingly, the visible absorption band of DPP is not significantly red shifted upon changing the thienyl carboxylic acid by a TPA unit in contrast to what was previously observed with DPP dyes for organic solar cells.101,102 This is attributed to the presence of the two carboxylic acid withdrawing groups that most certainly decrease the electron donating ability of TPA. However, the substitution of the phenyl group by a thienyl unit had a favorable impact on the absorptivity of the dye, since a large bathochromic shift and an almost two-fold enhancement of the extinction coefficient were observed between dyes DPP-NDI and Th-DPP-NDI or between DPP-Br and Th-DPP chromophores.21 The above mentioned feature improved the photovoltaic performance, as indicated by the IPCE spectra (Fig. 8). It is worth mentioning that Th-DPP-NDI is considered not only as the best DPP dye but also as one of the best performing sensitizers ever reported. This enhanced photovoltaic performance is due to the high short circuit photocurrent density, which can even reach 8.2 mA cm−2 when applied in a champion cell. The high activity of Th-DPP-NDI was fruitfully used to build a tandem solar cell with a photoanode sensitized with the D35 push–pull dye that displays a quite complementary absorption spectrum. This combination of dyes was indeed successful, because the resulting solar cell gave the highest PCE ever reported in a tandem cell (JSC = 6.73 mA cm−2, VOC = 910 mV, ff = 66%, PCE = 4.1%) with photovoltaic performance that surpasses those of the individual sub-cells (TiO2 DSC gave PCE = 3.91% while NiO DSC gave 0.35%). The reason for these high values of the photovoltaic parameters regarding the aforementioned pn-DSC is the complementary absorption spectra of the two used dyes, since they do not absorb in the same region of the visible spectrum.
 Fig. 8  IPCE spectra of DPP dyes recorded with an iodine based electrolyte. 
Detailed photophysical studies by transient absorption spectroscopy conducted on phenyl based DPP dyes shed light on the deactivation behavior. Firstly, all measurements revealed ultrafast hole injection from the dyes to the NiO valence band (200 fs–10 ps) leading to high injection quantum yields.99,100 However, when the DPP is substituted with either bromide, hydrogen or dicyanovinylene, the charge recombination is also very fast (50–100 ps). The former reaction is the major pitfall of most sensitizers and explains the low JSC and VOC generally encountered in p-DSCs. On the other hand, when the DPP is substituted with a NDI unit, the latter plays the role of a secondary electron acceptor and the hole injection is accompanied by an ultrafast electron shift reaction (NiO+/DPP−-NDI → NiO+/DPP-NDI−) that leads to an extremely long lived charge separated state. Interestingly, when the DPP is connected to NiO via a longer spacer, particularly N,N-di(4-benzoic acid)phenylamine, the average lifetime is substantially increased from 140 μs (DPP-NDI) to 227 μs (TPA-1Ph-DPP-NDI) and to 304 μs (TPA-2Ph-DPP-NDI). These charge separated state lifetimes for NiO+/dye− are among the highest measured on NiO and are comparable to the values of regular sensitizers in TiO2-based DSCs. Despite the very fast charge recombination reaction observed in many dyes, the modification with a secondary electron acceptor moiety appended to the sensitizer could possibly lead to even longer lived charge separated states. Overall, this study has revealed the potential employment of DPP dyes in dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical devices (DSPECs) due to their unique features such as high photostability and easy functionalization.
Another class of compounds with a similar structure to DPP, which were also successfully implemented as sensitizers in p-DSCs are isoindigo dyes (Fig. 9).103 The introduction of a NDI acceptor (ISO-NDI), similar to other cases, enhances the photovoltaic performance compared to the analogue ISO-Br dye. These indigoid dyes show relatively lower photovoltaic performance than the corresponding DPP dyes, however their IPCE spectra extend up to 700 nm. For instance, the photovoltaic parameters recorded for the NiO based p-DSC sensitized with ISO-NDI (JSC = 1.27 mA cm−2, VOC = 96 mV, ff = 33%, PCE = 0.040%) were similar to those of the TPA-1Ph-DPP-NDI chromophore (JSC = 1.72 mA cm−2, VOC = 76 mV, ff = 32%, PCE = 0.041%). Consequently, isoindigo dyes can be considered as another promising class of efficient sensitizers for NiO photocathodes.

2.3 Squaraine dyes
Another class of dyes that have been used in p-type DSCs are squaraines which absorb in the red to near-IR (NIR) region (700–850 nm) therefore exploiting the low energy region of the visible spectrum. They also present a low-lying LUMO and are very photostable compounds. Due to these characteristics such dyes have been widely used in numerous applications, such as organic real-time colorimetric sensors,104 chemosensors,105 bulk-heterojunction solar cells,106 n-type DSCs107–109 and bioimaging.110 In 2012, Lin et al. reported the first squaraine-based donor–acceptor sensitizers used in p-type DSCs, which contained a triphenylamine donor bearing one or two anchoring groups along with a squaraine moiety as the acceptor: p-SQ1 and p-SQ2 (Fig. 10).111 In both dyes the LUMO orbital was located above that of the iodine redox couple meaning they could efficiently reduce the electrolyte. The VOC and JSC of the two p-DSCs were found in the range of 120–140 mV and 1.22–1.92 mA cm−2, respectively, leading to an overall PCE of 0.053 and 0.113% for p-SQ1 and p-SQ2, respectively.
 Fig. 10  Squaraine–arylamine dyes reported by Lin and co-workers.111 
In 2014, Warnan et al. designed three squaraine based sensitizers: an iodo-squaraine (SQ), a squaraine-perylene monoimide (SQ-PMI) and a squaraine-perylene monoimide-naphthalene diimide (SQ-PMI-NDI), in an effort to produce panchromatic systems and also test the possibility that an acceptor moiety (perylene monoimide: PMI) could play the role of a light harvesting antenna (Fig. 11).112 In both the dyad and the triad, the squaraine moiety plays the role of the sensitizer, that is a hole injector into the NiO valence band. The PMI was used not only as the light harvesting unit but also as the secondary electron acceptor in order to potentially enhance the lifetime of the photo-reduced dye. The three sensitizers were tested in NiO based DSCs using either the conventional triiodide/iodide electrolyte or a cobaltIII/II electrolyte. The photophysical study by transient absorption spectroscopy revealed an ultrafast hole injection into the semiconductor's valence band from the squaraine excited state, which is unfortunately followed by an ultrafast recombination, making SQ an inefficient sensitizer. The photovoltaic performance of the cells sensitized by the dyad and the triad was significantly improved due to the presence of a second light harvesting unit (PMI) and a terminal electron acceptor (NDI) in those systems. Odobel, Hammarström and co-workers observed that the PCEs of the three sensitized cells increased in the following order: SQ < SQ-PMI ≪ SQ-PMI-NDI, with the triad reaching a 25% IPCE (λ = 620 nm).
 Fig. 11  Iodo-squaraine (SQ), squaraine-perylene imide (SQ-PMI) and squaraine-perylene imide-naphthalene diimide (SQ-PMI-NDI) dyes reported by Odobel, Hammarström and co-workers.112 
Another example was published in 2015, by Dini, Barolo and co-workers, presenting the study of three new squaraine-based dyes in NiO-based DSCs: VG1C8, VG10C8 and DS2/35 (Fig. 12).113 The three squaraines are symmetrical, while they mainly differ in terms of the electronic conjugation and the total number of anchoring groups: VG1C8 and VG10C8 bear two carboxylic groups, whereas the DS2/35 sensitizer possesses four acidic anchoring groups. Naponiello et al. presented a novel preparation method of mesoporous NiOx thin films for p-DSCs based on the screen-printing technique. The photo-electrochemical performance of the corresponding p-DSCs was influenced by the sensitization conditions of the semiconducting layer and by the NiOx surface pre-treatment. These factors have been thoroughly analyzed leading to the best photo-electrochemical performances, in terms of overall conversion efficiency, using VG1C8 and VG10C8. More specifically, the highest overall conversion efficiency within this set of organic sensitizers was achieved with VG1C8 and VG10C8 as dyes (0.025%) when the NiOx surface was pre-treated with alkali. Furthermore, the alkaline pre-treatment of the NiO surface led to the highest incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies of the p-DSCs based on the three squaraine sensitizers (IPCEMAX = 11%, λ = 390 nm). However, the high observed photoresponse at this wavelength points to photoactivity of the triiodide anion rather than that of the squaraine itself.114,115
 Fig. 12  Squaraine dyes developed by Dini, Barolo and co-workers.113 
A year later, a supplementary study was published by the same group in which a new squaraine dye (VG11C8) was applied in a p-DSC and compared with dyes VG1C8 and VG10C8.116 Bonomo et al. have used the three symmetric squaraines, VG1C8, VG10C8 and VG11C8, which bear octyl groups as pending N-substituents of the indolenine moiety, to sensitize screen-printed NiO films for p-DSCs (Fig. 13). The photo-electrochemical performance of the three sensitized p-DSCs was evaluated in terms of the structural differences among the three squaraine dyes. VG11C8 dye has been intentionally designed for application in a p-type DSC by introducing a dicyano-vinyl substituent on the central squaric ring as the electron withdrawing moiety. The dicyano-vinyl substituent is located far away from the two carboxylic anchoring groups, which connect the dye to the NiO surface. The p-DSC with VG11C8 as the sensitizer was the most efficient cell out of the three with the highest PCE value (η > 0.04%) compared to the lower ones achieved with the other two devices (η < 0.02% for VG1C8 and VG10C8). Furthermore, in all cases an anti-aggregating agent (CDCA = chenodeoxycholic acid) was added in the sensitizing solution of NiO hence improving the performance of the corresponding p-DSCs.

2.4 Perylene imide sensitizers
Perylene imides (PIs) are another important class of high-performing dyes that demonstrate both high thermal- and photo-stability.117,118 Due to these features PIs have been widely used as precursor derivatives for self-assembly processing and applied in optoelectronic devices.119 Furthermore, PI compounds are ideal candidates for the fabrication of organic optoelectronic devices, such as organic photovoltaics (OPVs), organic field effect transistors (OFETs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).117,119,120 Additionally, perylene monoimides (PMIs) are included amongst the best sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells.117 Since PI dyes contain electron withdrawing units (imide moiety), they can be easily reduced either chemically or electrochemically in order to form stable anionic radicals.121,122 Taking into consideration a few additional characteristics that these derivatives possess, such as easy modification, broad absorption in the visible region and relatively high fluorescence quantum yields, PIs have been considered to be particularly well-suited for being employed as sensitizers in p-DSCs.123
The first two reported PI-based dyes used for the sensitization of p-DSCs were published in 2008. Morandeira et al. prepared and fully characterized a peryleneimide sensitizer (PMI) and a covalently linked peryleneimide-naphthalenediimide dyad (PMI-NDI) (Fig. 14). Both compounds were chemisorbed onto nanoporous NiO and their solar cells were compared regarding their efficiency.124 In both systems, an ultrafast electron shift was reported (0.5 ps) from the p-SC to the PMI unit, while in the case of the PMI-NDI the electron gets subsequently transferred to the NDI group. Moreover, the sandwich-type DSSC sensitized by the PMI-NDI dyad showed a three times higher overall absorbed-photon to current efficiency (APCE) of 45%. Later on, Le Pleux et al. reported the preparation of two novel organic dyads (PMI-PhNDI and PMI-PhC60), consisting of a perylene monoimide (PMI) moiety connected to a secondary electron accepting unit (naphthalene diimide (NDI) or fullerene (C60)) for application in NiO-based p-DSCs (Fig. 14).125 In both dyads a longer lifetime of the charge separated state was detected by almost five orders of magnitude when compared to the PMI dye, due to the presence of the secondary electron acceptor. It is worth mentioning that all sensitized cells were tested in the presence of both the iodide and cobalt based electrolytes. In both cases, reduction of the electrolyte by the secondary electron acceptor was rather slow, which could be attributed to this reaction's weak driving force. The p-DSC sensitized by the dyad containing the fullerene acceptor exhibits the highest IPCE and short circuit current density (IPCE = 57%, JSC = 1.88 mA cm−2) with the iodide electrolyte. These values were ascribed to the slightly stronger reducing power of C60 relative to NDI, leading to more efficient reduction of the electrolyte.
 Fig. 14  Perylene monoimide (PMI) based dyads developed by Odobel and co-workers. 
In Fig. 15 the chemical structures of three donor–bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) dyes (PMI-T2-TPA, PMI-T4-TPA and PMI-T6-TPA) are illustrated, consisting of a PMI unit as the acceptor and an oligothiophene bridge coupled to the triphenylamine donor group, as reported by Nattestad et al.18 The three chromophores differ in the length of the alkylated oligo-3-hexylthiophene bridge (PMI-T2-TPA, PMI-T4-TPA and PMI-T6-TPA). Theoretical calculations revealed that the electron density of the LUMO for all three dyes was located exclusively on the PMI unit and the thiophene ring closest to it, while the HOMO was distributed more evenly over the entire conjugated system. This was the first report in which a p-DSC was able to efficiently convert the absorbed photons into electrons, reaching yields of up to 96%. The solar cells tested in this particular study resulted in a sevenfold increase of the energy conversion efficiency in comparison to previously reported systems.126 An additional study containing the preparation of four D–π–A sensitizers was published in 2012 by Weidelener et al.127 As shown in Fig. 15 these dyes (Thioph2-PMI, Thioph′2-PMI, e-Thioph2-PMI and e-Thioph′2-PMI) were comprised of a triphenylamine donor bearing two carboxylate anchoring groups, a bithiophene π-bridge, and a perylenemonoimide (PMI) acceptor group. The first alteration involved the position of the alkyl chains of the oligothiophene unit in dyes Thioph′2-PMI and e-Thioph′2-PMI that resulted in a modest red shift in the dye absorption but not in an improved photovoltaic performance. Furthermore, the length of the conjugated bridge was increased by the introduction of an ethynyl unit between the bridge and the donor unit in dyes e-Thioph2-PMI and e-Thioph′2-PMI. As a consequence, the p-DSC sensitized by the ethynyl-containing dye (e-Thioph2-PMI) achieved a ∼25% higher power conversion efficiency compared to the cell based on Thioph2-PMI. This enhancement was mostly attributed to the increased current density.
 Fig. 15  Perylene imide sensitizers developed by Bäuerle and co-workers.18,127 
Consequently, in the same year four separate studies were published reporting the preparation and study of nine new PI-based sensitizers (PI3, PI6, PI7, PI12, PI18, PI19, PDI-1, PDI-2 and WS-PDI), as shown in Fig. 16. In particular, Hammarström and co-workers examined the charge separation lifetimes of four different perylene (mono and di)imide dyes when they were attached onto a semiconductor surface (PI3, PI6, PI7 and PI12).30 Additionally, the four dyes were incorporated in NiO-based DSCs and their photovoltaic parameters were recorded. It was clearly stated that in all studied PI derivatives the charge recombination process between the dyes and the hole of the SC occurred rapidly (20–500 ps), suggesting that regeneration by the electrolyte was therefore inefficient. Due to these findings, the p-DSCs based on these four sensitizers exhibited low photocurrents, low photovoltages, and low overall efficiencies. Soon after, a supplementary study was reported by Gibson and co-workers,115 which included the application of the four aforementioned PI dyes in p-DSCs and their comparison to two p-type solar cells sensitized by two PI derivatives that have been already tested in TiO2-based DSCs (PI18 and PI19).128 Even though these six tested dyes did absorb in the near-infrared region, the produced photocurrent decreased dramatically as the absorption maxima ranged from 517 to 565 nm. Furthermore, it was shown that the IPCE spectra for this series of perylene sensitizers relied strongly on the driving force for the efficiency-limiting regeneration step. The authors suggested that in order for the efficiency of p-DSCs to be improved, the regeneration process should be optimized.
 Fig. 16  Various PI-based sensitizers developed by Hammerstrӧm, Gibson, Guldi, Majima, Tachikawa and co-workers.30,115,129,130 
Later on, Guldi and co-workers demonstrated the sensitization of NiO-based p-DSCs by two dendronized perylenediimides, a symmetric and a non-symmetric derivative (PDI-1 and PDI-2, respectively).130 This work contains a detailed study regarding the fabrication of NiO photocathodes via following several different approaches. The most homogeneous NiO electrodes were constructed using an ethanol paste containing 10 wt% of NiO nanoparticles and triacetin as the plasticizer. These photocathodes revealed appropriate light harvesting ability, reasonable transparency and good conductivity. Hence such NiO electrodes were used for the preparation of p-DSCs after the attachment of the two sensitizers on their surface. The highest recorded efficiencies for both perylenediimide based devices were 0.0153 and 0.0147% for PDI-1 and PDI-2, respectively. Such moderate efficiency values were attributed to the potential adsorption of aggregates on the electrode surface. Finally in 2012, Bian et al. published a thorough study on how molecular interactions influence the important photoconversion processes.129 For this reason, a water-soluble perylenediimide (WS-PDI) was bound to a NiO film and the interfacial charge transfer dynamics were explored by various spectroscopic techniques. Transient absorption measurements suggested a clear coexistence of both weak and strong electronic couplings between NiO nanoparticles and WS-PDI. The existence of these two couplings resulted in both fast (several ps) and slow (tens of ps to ns) hole transfer processes and the subsequent charge recombination with a rate of pico- to microseconds. All the other spectroscopic techniques used in this study indicated site-specific interactions and dynamics. More importantly, it was proven that by introducing an insulating layer (namely, Al2O3) the electronic interactions between WS-PDI and the SC surface got weaker. As a consequence, the charge recombination was slowed down and the photoelectric conversion was enhanced, thus providing an insight as far as designing highly efficient p-type solar cells is concerned.
2.5 Ruthenium, iridium and rhenium coordination complexes
Transition metal complexes such as ruthenium and iridium polypyridine, exhibiting metal to ligand charge transfer transition (MLCT), have been widely investigated as sensitizers in classical TiO2 based DSCs.131 Notably, the ruthenium complex coded N3 was the most efficient sensitizer in Grätzel cells for almost two decades.132 Therefore, it was natural that these complexes could also be well suited in p-DSCs since their MLCT excited states are both significant reductants and oxidants. An analogue complex of N3 (N719) was tested in a NiO based p-DSC, but as expected it exhibited poor performance (JSC = 0.008 mA cm−2, VOC = 4 mV, ff = 50%, PCE < 0.0001%),133 since this dye was optimized for TiO2. Indeed, the LUMO orbital, localized on dicarboxylic acid bipyridine (dcbpy), is close to the NiO surface and consequently favors CR with the hole in NiO. On the other hand, the HOMO is predominantly spread over the thiocyanato ligands, preventing a possible fast hole injection to the valence band of NiO.
In 2008, Odobel and co-workers reported a series of ruthenium tris-bipyridine complexes with different anchoring groups (namely, carboxylic acid, methylene phosphonic acid, carbodithioic acid and styryl catechol) in p-DSCs (Fig. 17).134 Since the most extensively studied carboxylic acid anchoring unit inhibits the hole injection into the p-SC, the main goal of this study was the examination of new and better suited anchoring groups. Undoubtedly, the electron withdrawing character of the carboxylate moiety tends to localize the LUMO of the dye close to the NiO surface. The electronic decoupling of Ru-PO3H2 with NiO resulted in slow charge recombination due to the presence of the methylene deconjugated spacer, as well as the strong attachment of phosphonic acid anchors onto the NiO surface.
 Fig. 17  Structures of the ruthenium polypyridine complexes investigated in p-DSCs.134–136 
Another ruthenium complex (Ru-NMI), bearing phenanthroline–nitronaphthalene–dicarboximide (NMI) as the ancillary ligand, was developed for p-DSCs and it was compared with the tris-(2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid)ruthenium(II) complex (Ru(dcbpy)3).135 The charge transfer processes occurring between these two complexes and NiO surface were investigated by transient absorption spectroscopy. As expected, Ru-NMI exhibits slow charge recombination (between the reduced (Ru-NMI)2+ and the hole in the NiO valence band) yielding a charge separated state lifetime of about 10–50 μs, because the electron in the reduced state is located far away from the NiO surface, precisely on the distal NMI group. The two complexes were tested in p-DSCs with both iodide and cobalt based electrolytes. Compound Ru(dcbpy)3 produced negligible photocurrent density (JSC about 90 μA cm−2), while Ru-NMI exhibited higher photovoltaic performances. In detail, the recorded values for Ru-NMI were JSC = 0.28 mA cm−2, VOC = 82 mV, ff = 34%, PCE = 0.051% with the iodine based electrolyte and JSC = 0.16 mA cm−2, VOC = 95 mV, ff = 36%, PCE = 0.006% with the tris-(4,4′-bis-tert-butyl bipyridine)cobalt complex as the redox mediator. Yet again these results highlight the benefit of positioning the secondary electron acceptor away from the NiO surface.
Interestingly, Dietzek and co-workers reported another photophysical study with two ruthenium complexes (Ru-CO2H and Ru(dcEtbpy)3) immobilized on nanocrystalline NiO film (Fig. 17).136 The major finding of this study was that the complex Ru-CO2H had a very poor injection quantum yield, because in the MLCT excited state the electron is mostly localized on the anchoring ligand (dcbpy), as a result hindering the hole injection into the NiO valence band from Ru(III). On the other hand, Ru(dcEtbpy)3 upon instant hydrolysis of the dcEtbpy ligands binds onto the NiO surface. During the MLCT excited state, the electron is transferred to the ancillary ligands (dcEtbpy) enabling hole migration via the anchoring dcbpy ligand. As a result, the latter complex displays fast hole injection rate (18 ps) when attached on NiO, resulting in a high injection quantum yield.
In 2012, Wu and co-workers highlighted the implementation of cyclometallated ruthenium complexes in p-DSCs, by preparing a series of three dyes O8, O11 and O12 (Fig. 18).137 In these series, oligophenylene spacers of different lengths were appended to the ruthenium complex via the carbometallated phenyl unit of the phenyl-pyridine ligand. In this molecular design, the anchoring group was positioned on the most electron rich part of the molecule (HOMO) so as to promote electronic communication between the dye's excited state and the valence band of the p-SC. Remarkably, these cyclometallated complexes are attractive candidates in both p-DSCs and DSPECs, displaying negative reduction potential (ERed ≈ −1.5 V vs. SCE). In particular, when applied in p-DSCs, they can facilitate electron transfer to the redox mediator offering large VOC values, while in DSPECs, such complexes can reduce redox demanding electrocatalysts, as thoroughly discussed in Section 3. The photophysical investigation through transient absorption spectroscopy showed that the hole injection rate constant is very fast (few ps), in spite of the low driving force of this reaction. Furthermore, this process is slightly controlled by the spacer's length, while the charge recombination substantially decreases with the distance between the dye and NiO. In agreement with the above statement, the highest photovoltaic performances were measured for the O12 complex (JSC = 1.84 mA cm−2, VOC = 82 mV, ff = 34%, PCE = 0.051%) containing the longest spacer, which displayed the longer-lived charge separated state (NiO+/dye−). In another attempt, a new series of ruthenium complexes (O3, O13, O17 and O18) were prepared with N,N-di(4-benzoic acid)phenylamine as the anchoring group with some variations on the ancillary ligands (bipyridine, phenanthroline, bathophenanthroline and 4,4′-bis(styryl)bipyridine).138,139 Quantum chemical calculations clearly show that in all derivatives the HOMO is partly localized on the triphenyl amine moiety. Moreover, the 4,4′-bis(styryl)bipyridine ancillary ligands clearly affected the absorbance of O18, which displayed a higher extinction coefficient (ε = 2.4 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 451 nm) as well as an extended absorption band (until 700 nm). These characteristics enhanced the light harvesting efficiency of the dyed NiO film and consequently led to the highest photocurrent density (JSC = 3.43 mA cm−2) measured regarding these cyclometallated complexes in p-DSCs. Also, the charge separated state lifetime was enhanced with these new ruthenium complexes bearing the N,N-di(4-benzoic acid)phenylamine anchoring group relative to the first series O8, O11 and O12. This is based on the fact that the LUMO is localized on the ancillary ligand and not on the ligand anchored to NiO. After hole injection, the electron is subsequently located on the ancillary ligands, away from the NiO surface.
 Fig. 18  Structures of the cyclometallated ruthenium complexes investigated by Wu in p-DSCs.137–140 
The same authors have also reported a dyad (O26) that consists of a cyclometallated ruthenium complex functionalized with a naphthalene diimide (NDI) electron acceptor (Fig. 18).140 The clear objective was to achieve long-lived charge separation owing to electron shift from the reduced ruthenium to NDI. However, the photophysical study revealed that the lifetime of charge separation (CS) in O26/NiO was slightly increased (τ = 426 ps) compared to the CS of the reference O25/NiO (τ = 371 ps) that lacks the NDI moiety. The flexible spacer, which is located between the complex and NDI, allows the latter to lie close to the NiO surface.
Gibson, Berlinguette and co-workers designed two new heteroleptic cyclometallated ruthenium complexes (K1 and K2) as presented in Fig. 19.141 These complexes demonstrated high extinction coefficients (for example K1 displays an ε = 4.73 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 523 nm) and relatively high yields in p-DSCs. Specifically, when an iodine based electrolyte was applied K1 gave photovoltaic parameters such as JSC = 2.91 mA cm−2, VOC = 96 mV, ff = 32%, PCE = 0.09%. In contrast, both complexes presented low efficiencies with the cobalt electrolyte owing to the probable fast charge recombination reaction.
 Fig. 19  Structures of the cyclometallated complexes investigated by Berlinguette, Gibson or Housecroft in p-DSCs.141–143 
Recently, Housecroft and co-workers142 reported a new cyclometallated ruthenium complex Ru(bpy)2(H5) that differs from the O11 complex since a phosphonic acid anchoring group was used instead of a carboxylic acid. More importantly, the anchoring group was attached on the pyridine moiety of the phenyl-pyridine ligand and not on the carbometallated phenyl unit (Fig. 19). Interestingly, the zwitterionic complex Ru(bpy)2(H5) outperforms P1 dye (see push–pull dyes) on NiO p-DSCs demonstrating the following metrics: JSC = 3.34 mA cm−2, VOC = 95 mV, ff = 34%, PCE = 0.109%. Furthermore, Elliott and co-workers have reported the preparation of a ruthenium (AS16), an iridium (AS17) and a rhenium complex (AS18) using a triazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid as a new anchoring group (Fig. 19).143 In spite of the presence of two carboxylic acid anchoring groups, the introduction of a triazole unit increases the electron density close to the surface and favors the hole injection in NiO. This assumption is in agreement with the photocurrent density measurements of these complexes compared to that produced by the reference complexes, bearing a dcbpy instead of a 1-(2,2′-bipyrid-4-yl)-1,2,3-triazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid. However, quantum chemical calculations on AS16–AS18 indicate that the LUMO is spread over the anchoring ligand and not on the ancillary ligand, leading to slow charge recombination.
Push–pull ruthenium diacetylide complexes were also developed for p-DSCs by Olivier and co-workers.144 Towards this goal, two novel complexes (SL1 and SL2) were reported and examined as sensitizers in a NiO based p-DSC using iodide/triiodide as the supporting electrolyte (Fig. 20). These diacetylide ruthenium complexes exhibit desirable features such as high extinction coefficient values (over 2 × 104 M−1 cm−1) and less negative reduction potentials, compared to the cyclometallated polypyridine ruthenium complexes presented above. The red complex SL1 performs better (JSC = 2.25 mA cm−2, VOC = 104 mV, ff = 34%, PCE = 0.079%) than the blue SL2 complex, which was attributed to the three-fold higher dye loading of SL1 on the NiO surface. However, these two complexes have at least 4 times lower dye loading than the P1 dye and moderate hole injection driving force (about 0.25–0.3 eV). Therefore, major improvements could be accomplished by attaching more suitable push–pull units around the bis-acetylide ruthenium moiety to tune the HOMO level and the binding ability to NiO.

In contrast to ruthenium complexes (+II oxidation state), the iridium analogues are in the +III oxidation state, making them particularly strong oxidants in their excited state, hence favoring hole injection in p-SCs. To this end, Odobel and co-workers145 investigated a series of three bis-cyclometallated complexes (IrPhen, IrDPQCN2 and IrBpyStyryl) for application in p-DSCs (Fig. 21). These complexes contain two phenyl-pyridine ligands bearing two methylene phosphonate anchoring groups, along with a diimine ligand to complete the octahedral coordination sphere around Ir(III). The lowest excited-state of these complexes can be described as a CS state in which the positive electronic density is mainly localized on the Ir center, while the negative counterpart is positioned on the diimine ancillary ligand. Surprisingly, these simple complexes led to particularly long-lived charge separated states (τ = 1–30 μs), due to electron–hole decoupling between the diimine ancillary ligand and NiO. The long-lived CS states of these complexes make them suitable to be combined with slow redox mediators that possess high reorganization energy (e.g., tris-bipyridine cobalt complexes). Despite the moderate photocurrent density (JSC = 0.37 mA cm−2 with IrBpyStyryl), these yellow complexes achieved fairly large open circuit voltage (VOC = 508 mV with IrDPQCN2). The major conclusion from this study was that any dye with a long-lived triplet excited state performs very well in p-DSCs, because of the high injection quantum yield and the slow charge recombination (derived from strong electronic decoupling). Later on, Dietzek and co-workers,136 by presenting a series of tris-bipyridine ruthenium complexes, concluded that pushing the electron on the ancillary ligand greatly diminishes the charge recombination rate and consequently results in better performing sensitizers.
 Fig. 21  Structures of the iridium complexes investigated in p-DSCs by Odobel and co-workers.145 
Then, Gibson, Elliott and co-workers reported a series of new iridium complexes comprised of two 4-(pyrid-2-yl)benzoic acid ligands as anchoring units and one diimine ancillary ligand acting as the electron accepting moiety (AS9–AS15, Fig. 22).146 As the quantum chemical calculations revealed, these dyes are ideal candidates for application in p-DSCs since the HOMO is localized on the anchoring ligands with a significant spin density on the anchoring groups, while the LUMO is predominately spread over the ancillary diimine ligand. These findings showed that the electronic coupling between the dye's excited states and the semiconductor's valance band is favored, while simultaneously minimizing the possibility for the latter to overlap with the reduced forms of the complexes. Despite the fact that most of the complexes display modest absorption in the visible spectrum (with the maximum ε being approximately 5.4 × 103 M−1 cm−1), AS14 bearing the diimine bis(arylimino)acenaphthene ligand presented an intense MLCT/ligand to ligand charge transfer (LLCT) absorption band with a relatively high extinction coefficient (ε = 1.45 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 431 nm). As a consequence, AS14 proved to be the most efficient when applied in NiO based DSCs, demonstrating the highest short circuit current density (JSC = 1.12 mA cm−2, VOC = 100 mV, ff = 39%, PCE = 0.032%). In addition, another iridium complex (AS19) was also reported by the same group, which contained two coumarin-C6 chromogenic ligands and one dicarboxylic acid bipyridine (dcbpy) that acted as the anchoring unit (Fig. 22).147 This complex presented an intense absorption band at 480 nm (ε = 4.38 × 104 M−1 cm−1) with the HOMO and LUMO orbitals being localized on the cyclometallated coumarin-C6 and dcbpy ligands, respectively. These results indicated that this designed sensitizer was more suited for its implementation in TiO2-based rather than NiO-based DSCs. This dye was tested in both n-DSC (TiO2 as n-SC) and p-DSC (NiO as p-SC) with the iodide/triiodide electrolyte, but it gave moderate efficiencies in both devices. For example, in a NiO based solar cell the characteristics were: JSC = 0.45 mA cm−2, VOC = 104 mV, ff = 42%, PCE = 0.02%. The introduction of such chromogenic ligands in the coordination sphere of iridium is certainly a promising strategy for designing better performing sensitizers with enhanced light capturing ability and the proper vectoralization of the charge transfer transition. Indeed, the weak absorption of the iridium complexes in the visible region remains the main limitation for this class of compounds.
 Fig. 22  Structures of the iridium complexes investigated in p-DSCs by Gibson, Elliott and co-workers.146,147 
To sum up, all the above studies have provided essential insights for designing polypyridine transition metal complexes exhibiting MLCT transition. Overall, in the best performing systems the HOMO is positioned on the anchoring group whereas the LUMO on the ancillary ligands, diminishing the charge recombination by keeping the electron far away from the NiO surface (Scheme 3).

2.6 Push–pull dyes
Numerous are the examples of push–pull dyes synthesized for p-DSCs, in which an electron withdrawing and an electron donating moiety, are covalently linked through a π-conjugated bridge.20,29,148 In 2008, Sun, Hagfeldt and co-workers reported a particularly efficient organic push–pull dye (coded P1), which was designed especially for its application in p-type DSCs (Fig. 23).149 In P1 a triphenylamine (TPA) moiety bearing a carboxylic group played the role of the electron donating unit, while a malononitrile was introduced as the electron withdrawing moiety. The overall efficiency obtained for P1 was equal to 0.05% and an APCE of approximately 30%. However, improvements during the fabrication of the NiO film led to greatly enhanced photovoltaic performance. More specifically, the new p-type solar cell sensitized by the same dye (P1) resulted in a higher photocurrent density (JSC = 5.48 mA cm−2) and therefore better power conversion efficiency (PCE = 0.15%) and IPCE (up to 64%) were achieved.150 It is worth mentioning that P1 is considered as a rather efficient sensitizer due to its quite simple synthesis and is often used as a benchmark reference for NiO-based DSCs.
 Fig. 23  Push–pull dye developed by Sun, Hagfeldt and co-workers.149 
In 2013, Jin et al. reported the first two organic push–pull dyes bearing pyridine-anchoring groups (I and II) for p-DSCs (Fig. 24).151 A triphenylamine moiety, functionalized with pyridine groups, was selected as the electron donating unit in both dyes, while a malononitrile and a 2-(3-butyl-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidene)malononitrile (BOMN) were used as electron acceptors in dyes I and II, respectively. Dye II is more conjugated due to the presence of BOMN, which was also supported by its absorption features. It presents a bathochromic shift and a larger extinction coefficient (ε) compared to dye I. The p-DSCs sensitized by dyes I and II reached IPCE values around 20% and 30%, respectively. The best performing device (II-based p-type DSC) yielded a PCE of 0.14% (JSC = 2.97 mA cm−2, VOC = 130 mV, ff = 0.35).
 Fig. 24  Push–pull dyes proposed by Jin et al.151 
In 2014, the interest towards designing and studying efficient organic push–pull dyes noticeably increased, since eight relative studies were published by several groups. Cui et al. reported the synthesis of two new organic push–pull dyes (CW1 and CW2) and their employment in p-DSCs (Fig. 25).152 The two dyes (CW1 and CW2) bear pyridine anchoring groups and are structurally similar to the widely used P1 dye. Both CW1 and CW2 were designed with the purpose of determining the influence of the anchoring group on their photovoltaic performance. All these dyes have the same electron donating unit (a triphenylamine moiety), an electron withdrawing unit (2,2-dicyano-vinyl group) and a thiophene π-bridge connecting these moieties. Moreover, both push–pull dyes contain a pyridine anchoring group connected to the triphenylamine moiety, while in the case of CW2 a phenyl ring was introduced between the two groups. Due to the fact that no proton release was detected during the dye dipping of CW1 and CW2, a high photovoltaic performance of their p-DSCs was expected. Indeed, the device based on CW2 achieved a PCE of approximately 0.16%, a value slightly higher than the one obtained for the reference p-DSC sensitized by the benchmark dye P1 (0.14%).
 Fig. 25  Push–pull dyes reported by Cui et al.152 
Wu and co-workers153 reported three novel dyes (BH2, BH4, and BH6) consisting of a single donor and two acceptor moieties and their application in p-type DSCs (Fig. 26). Once again, triphenylamine was selected as the electron donor, while two functionalized PMI units were introduced as the electron acceptors. Both acceptors were communicating with the donating unit via oligothiophenes of three different lengths, 2, 4 and 6 corresponding to dyes BH2, BH4, and BH6, respectively. It was shown that light absorption is maximized when two acceptor moieties are added to a dye containing a TPA, leading to higher molar extinction coefficients. At first a better photovoltaic performance of the p-DSCs based on the double-acceptor dyes was monitored compared to a dye containing only one withdrawing unit. Out of those three dyes, the best performance was recorded when BH4 was used, since a PCE of 0.28% was achieved and the highest photocurrent at that time was observed (7.4 mA cm−2). Finally, the first ever light soaking effect, observed in p-DSCs, was reported.
 Fig. 26  Push–pull dyes developed by Wu and co-workers.153 
Additionally, two separate but interrelated works concerning the design of new organic donor–acceptor dyes for p-DSCs were published by Liu et al.154,155 The first publication included the study of three new push–pull arylamine–fluorene–perylenemonoimide dyes (zzx-op1, zzx-op2 and zzx-op3) in p-DSCs (Fig. 27).155 The three dyes contain a di(p-carboxy)phenylamine (DCPA) as a donor and a perylenemonoimide (PMI) as an electron acceptor connected through a fluorene unit bearing two hexyl chains, which acts as the π-conjugated spacer. In zzx-op2 and zzx-op3 a 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and a thiophene were inserted successively altering both their photophysical features and photovoltaic performance. More specifically, a gradual shift of the absorption maximum was observed along with a decrease in the overall PCE of their cells (0.160% and 0.153%), while the p-DSC based on zzx-op1 reached a PCE of 0.184%. In their second study they reported the synthesis of two “Y”-shaped organic push–pull dyes (zzx-op1-2 and zzx-op1-3) (Fig. 27).154 In an effort to improve the performance of dye zzx-op1 they designed two more derivatives in which one or two more fluorine units were inserted into the π-conjugated linker between the DCPA and PMI moieties. All three dyes are quite rigid and they tend to be anchored vertically on the semiconductor surface forming packed layers. The p-DSC device sensitized by zzx-op1-2 achieved the best performance out of the three with an overall PCE of about 0.353% and an averaged JSC of 7.27 mA cm−2.
 Fig. 27  Push–pull dyes reported by Liu et al.154,155 
The first organic push–pull dye bearing an acetylacetone (acac) anchoring group (JW44) was designed by Odobel, Jacquemin, Hammarström and co-workers, which was then incorporated in p-type DSCs (Fig. 28).156 Regarding the structure of this dye a nitrophenyl unit was introduced as the acceptor and a hexyl-thiophene moiety as the electron donating group. Two p-DSCs were prepared, one based on JW44 and the other sensitized by the commercially available coumarin C343 that was selected as the reference. Both cells achieved similar PCE values (around 0.03%), despite the weaker light harvesting ability of the dye functionalized with the acac anchoring group. Furthermore, the p-type solar cell based on JW44 showed a stronger coordination to the NiO surface (proven by FT-IR spectroscopy) and a stronger charge transfer (CT) character (predicted through TD-DFT calculations), suggesting that this new anchoring group is a promising alternative to the commonly used carboxylic acid anchoring unit.
 Fig. 28  Push–pull dyes reported by Odobel, Jacquemin, Hammarström and co-workers.156 
Later on, Bäurele, Mishra and co-workers157 studied four new organic push–pull dyes in p-DSCs (2, 3, 4 and 5), which consisted of a triphenylamine donating unit, a dihexyl bithiophen (2T) π-bridge and four different acceptors (Fig. 29). The various chosen electron accepting groups were namely: dicyanovinylene (DCV), tricyanofurane (TCF), 9,10-dicyano-acenaphtho[1,2-b]quinoxaline (DCANQ) and squaraine (SQ) for triads 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. Also, a well-known push–pull triad containing a PMI moiety as an acceptor was studied for comparison reasons (1).18 A clear relationship was observed between the strength of the electron withdrawing unit and the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the triads, since their features can be easily tuned. Regarding the photovoltaic performance of the fabricated p-type cells, PCE values in the range of 0.01–0.08% were reached, with the p-DSCs based on dyes 1 (reference triad) and 4. The results obtained from several measurements suggested that the charge recombination process in the p-DSC sensitized by 4 was significantly slower, due to the torsion between the acceptor and the donor.
 Fig. 29  Push–pull dyes developed by Bäurele, Mishra and co-workers.157 
In a different study, Wood et al. published the design of two new donor–π–acceptor dyes (CAD1 and CAD2) for p-DSCs with a near-red absorption and functionalized with indolium-type cationic acceptor units (Fig. 30).158 Based on the introduction of these cationic electron withdrawing units better electrostatic interaction between the dyes and the electrolyte was expected. This work was the second example in the literature where indolium-type dyes have been used in NiO-based DSCs.111 In both systems, functionalized diphenylamino benzoic acid moieties were selected as donors and a thiophene group as the linker. The addition of the extra 2,4-hexyloxyphenyl donor unit in CAD2 restrained the charge recombination process while simultaneously enhancing the conjugation of the sensitizer and leading to lesser dye loading. The photovoltaic performance of the devices sensitized by CAD1 and CAD2 was significantly improved compared to previously studied dyes that absorb so deep in the red region of the visible spectrum, achieving similar JSC and overall PCE values (around 3.30 mA cm−2 and 0.10%, respectively). On the other hand, the IPCE spectra of the two fabricated p-DSCs were different, with the one corresponding to CAD1 being higher (25%) compared to the CAD2 (17%).
 Fig. 30  Push–pull dyes reported by Wood et al.158 
Finally in 2014, two more triphenylamine–dicyanovinylene-based push–pull dyes were reported by Li and co-workers (T3 and T4)159 that were incorporated in p-type DSCs (Fig. 31). As illustrated in Fig. 31, the conjugation of the sensitizers was improved by altering the length of the ter-thiophene and fluorene bridges that were introduced between the electron donating and accepting units. For the fabrication of the p-DSCs double-layered NiO films were used and the measurements took place under standard conditions (AM 1.5 G). It was found that when the dyes were dissolved in a DMF–CH2Cl2 mixture their best performances were recorded. Particularly, the device based on T4 reached very poor efficiency (η = 0.06%) while the values of the photovoltaic parameters recorded for the p-DSC sensitized with T3 were considerably better (η = 0.19%, JSC = 4.01 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.144 V and ff = 0.33). The most important point highlighted in this work was that by changing the linker that connects the donor–acceptor groups, charge recombination could be prevented resulting in higher PCEs.
 Fig. 31  Push–pull dyes proposed by Li and co-workers.159 
In the following year the interest remained irreducible with several examples of triphenylamine-based push–pull sensitizers being published. Firstly, Artero, Dietzek and co-workers160 reported the sensitization of polystyrene-block-poly-(2-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P2VP) diblock copolymer-nanostructured NiO films with an organic push–pull dye 1 reaching a JSC of 300 μA cm−2. The (PS-b-P2VP) diblock copolymer-nanostructured NiO films were subsequently used for the construction and measurement of DSPEC devices (Fig. 32). Furthermore, Gibson and co-workers sensitized two new organic push–pull sensitizers, one with two cationic 1-hexyl-2,3,3-3H-indolium acceptors (CAD3) and the other with Bodipy chromophores (GS1) that were incorporated in p-type and pn-DSCs (Fig. 32).161 Both dyes absorb strongly in a wide range of the visible spectrum and based on the estimated driving forces for the charge separation process (ΔGinj ≈ −0.91 and −0.98 eV for CAD3 and GS1, respectively) they were suitable for withdrawing electrons from the NiO surface. The p-type cell based on GS1 achieved an IPCE of 53% whereas a JSC value of 8.2 mA cm−2 was recorded for the p-DSC sensitized with CAD3, indicating that both dyes could be efficiently applied in NiO-based devices. Additionally, two tandem cells were assembled incorporating dyes GS1 and CAD3 along with a benchmark sensitizer (D35) used in the n-type part of the device, which showed promising results with a photocurrent up to 5.2 mA cm−2.
 Fig. 32  Push–pull dyes reported by Artero, Dietzek, Gibson and co-workers.160,161 
Later on, Zhu and co-workers reported two distinct studies in which different aspects were tackled. In the first example, they designed three new D–A–A type sensitizers (W1, W2 and W3) and checked their applicability in p-DSCs (Fig. 33).162 In these structures the electron withdrawing 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) unit, which is commonly used as an acceptor, was introduced for the first time as a π-bridge connecting the donor moiety and the three different acceptor groups that were selected. All three fabricated cells exhibited PCE values greater than 0.1%, with the p-DSC sensitized with W2 that contained an octyl 2-cyanoacrylate acceptor achieving the best performance (PCE = 0.166%, JSC = 4.16 mA cm−2 and VOC = 0.121 V).
 Fig. 33  The push–pull dyes W1, W2, W3, T3, T4b, T5 and T6 reported by Zhu and co-workers.162,163 
Consequently, the second published work of the same group concerned the application of four organic push–pull dyes in p-DSCs (T3, T4b, T5 and T6). In this study the distance between the donor moiety and the NiO surface was explored for the first time by introducing three to six thienyl units as π-spacers (Fig. 33).163 By studying the four p-DSCs it was proven that an increase in the number of the thiophene units in the linker does not lead to a parallel improvement of the photovoltaic performance. The best performing sensitizer was T4b with a PCE of 0.208% (JSC = 5.31 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.119 V), while in dyes T5 and T6 with the longer spacers a decrease of the conductance was observed that was detrimental for charge transport.
In another publication He and co-workers52 investigated the influence of the conjugated spacers, with different lengths and in different positions, on the performance of p-DSCs. For this reason several push–pull dyes have been thoroughly studied by theoretical calculations, in which two different linkers were utilized with varying lengths: the electron-rich thiophene unit and the electron-deficient pyrimidine unit, which were introduced in two special bridge-sites (A-bridge and D-bridge) (Fig. 34). For all sensitizers the HOMO orbital was located lower than the VB of the semiconductor and the LUMO orbital was higher than the redox potential of the electrolyte, indicating their potentially successful use in p-DSCs due to the energetically favorable hole injection and dye regeneration. It was shown that the device performance can be improved by altering the conjugation length of the thiophene-based spacers when they are inserted between the donor group and the NiO surface, while in the case of pyrimidine-based linkers when they are introduced between the donor and acceptor moieties.
 Fig. 34  Push–pull dyes published by He and co-workers.52 
The last example in 2015 was published by Zhang et al. who designed the push–pull dye (QT-1) containing a quinoidal thiophene moiety as a π-bridge between the triphenylamine donor and the malononitrile acceptor, and studied its performance in a p-DSC (Fig. 35).54 The introduction of this specific linker creates a planar and more rigid sensitizer while simultaneously enhancing the intermolecular charge transfer. The highest to date JSC value was achieved (8.2 mA cm−2) with the best performing NiO-based device sensitized with QT-1 along with an overall efficiency of 0.33%.
 Fig. 35  Push–pull dyes reported by Zhang et al.54 
Organic mono- and di-branched dyes based on the triphenylamine donor–acceptor approach were recently employed in p-DSCs (Fig. 36).164 Karamshuk et al. synthesized three push–pull dyes using different electron acceptors, either Dalton's (SK2) or benzothiadiazole (SK3 and SK4). All reported p-type chromophores were studied in comparison with the literature standard P1 dye. The calculated exciton binding energy of the newly synthesized dyes was found two times higher comparing that of the reference compound (P1). The values of the binding energy revealed that the charge separation process is more difficult in the case of SK2, SK3 and SK4. The computed energy of the bound electron–hole pair, a factor accountable for charge separation, is greater in the new dyes but their photocurrent densities were fairly lower than that of P1. Nonetheless, the suggested lower charge separation that might occur didn't lead to efficient device parameters. It is noteworthy that the superior photocurrent of P1 is due to the efficient charge separation process. The authors pointed out that the larger photocurrent of P1 reference compound is in agreement with its smaller exciton binding energy that leads to higher charge separation.
 Fig. 36  Push–pull dyes reported by Abbotto and co-workers.164 
In 2016, Wu et al. reported the synthesis and the photovoltaic measurements of four organic dyes, namely T3, T4b, T3H and T4H.165 The structures of these dyes are presented in Fig. 37 and differ in the distance between the photocathode and the donor moiety. More specifically, three (T3, T3H) or four (T4b, T4H) thiophene units are introduced between the carboxylic acid unit and the triphenyl-amine donor group. Regarding the acceptor units, 1,3-diethyl-2-thiobarbituric acid was introduced for T3H and T4H, whereas a dicyanovinyl unit was employed for T3 and T4b. The enhanced power conversion efficiencies obtained for T3H and T4H compared to T3 and T4b analogues were due to the use of the more effective 3-diethyl-2-thiobarbituric acceptor unit. Likewise, the introduction of one additional thiophene unit in the case of T4H and T4b prevented the charge recombination process and provided greater photovoltaic results as to T3H and T3, respectively. It is worth mentioning that although T3 and T4b have been extensively used by various research groups, the obtained efficiencies were fairly equivalent (Table 1). The highest PCE value was recorded for T4H (0.317%) providing one of the highest photocurrent densities (JSC = 6.735 mA cm−2) reported in the literature, with a VOC value of 0.152 V. Consequently, the findings of this work underline the importance of 3-diethyl-2-thiobarbituric acid as an acceptor unit other than the use of increased thiophene units between the donor and the anchoring moiety.
 Fig. 37  The push–pull dyes T3, T4b, T3H and T4H published by Wu et al.165 
Regarding tetrahydroquinoline derivatives, that were synthesized and examined for p-DSCs, the charge injection along with the recombination processes were investigated using anchoring units electronically decoupled from the dye structure.166 A series of tetrahydroquinoline derivatives, Dye 1, Dye 2, Dye 3 and Dye 4 (Fig. 38), bearing a propionic acid chain and comprised of a triaryl amine as an anchoring group and a donor group, respectively, were synthesized. In this attempt, the effect of the aliphatic anchoring group on the device efficiency was examined. Despite the fact that the anchoring group was electronically decoupled from the NiO photocathode, the charge-separation process was as much effective as for most organic sensitizers using conjugated anchoring groups. The results regarding the IPCE measurements though point out that the generated photocurrent was relatively low in the maximum absorption region of each dye. The authors used transient absorption experiments and concluded that the rapid recombination of the reduced dye is caused by the dye's close proximity to the NiO surface. The performance of the fabricated p-DSCs varied from 0.017 to 0.030% and the best performing derivative was Dye 2 (η = 0.030%) with device parameters: JSC = 1.22 mA cm−2, VOC = 70 mV and ff = 0.35.
 Fig. 38  Tetrahydroquinoline derivatives prepared by Gibson, George, Yang and co-workers.166 
2.7 Miscellaneous dyes
Over the last few years, various chromophores have been employed in p-DSCs which are not included in the aforementioned segments of this review. Representative examples of such dyes are illustrated in Fig. 39 and a summary of their photovoltaic parameters is listed in Table 1. Many cyanine sensitizers (NK-2612, NK-3628, NK-2684 and Fast Green) have been considered as attractive candidates as they exhibit high molar extinction coefficient numbers. The above mentioned property is essential for p-DSCs, since the thickness of NiO film is rarely higher than 4 μm. As a consequence, a p-DSC dye should possess a high absorption coefficient value in order to achieve significant optical density. It is noteworthy that sensitizer NK-2684 was evidently one of the most efficient dyes and exhibited a record short circuit photocurrent density (JSC = 1 mA cm−2), resulting in the most efficient tandem cell in 2005.17
 Fig. 39  Structures of the miscellaneous dyes investigated in p-DSCs.17,133,150,167,168 
In addition, coumarin derivatives such as C343 and NKX-2311 were also investigated in p-DSCs.120,133,150,168 Notably, the commercially available C343 dye was one of the most used sensitizers in p-DSCs between 2000 and 2008. Nevertheless, P1 dye resulted in higher performances and as a consequence the utilization of C343 was limited. Finally, eosin derivatives (eosin and erythrosin) were employed in p-DSCs for the first time in 2005, nevertheless they provided poor efficiency.167 This is mainly attributed to the photo-physical and electrochemical properties of these dyes which are more suitable for n-type SCs rather than p-type photocathodes.
3. Sensitizers utilized in NiO-based DSPECs
Photocathodes are the key components of both tandem DSCs and DSPECs.7 The latter are attractive photoelectrochemical devices that facilitate either proton reduction into hydrogen or carbon dioxide reduction into carbon monoxide. The first implementation of photocathodes in DSPECs was reported by Sun and co-workers.178 More specifically, the photo-induced hole injection from the sensitizer grafted on NiO was followed by an electron shift from the reduced dye to a suitable catalyst (proton or carbon dioxide reduction catalyst) in order to activate a substrate in solution (Scheme 4).
 Scheme 4  Operation principle of DSPEC based on NiO photocathodes. Cat = catalyst. 
Apart from the already mentioned properties that a dye in p-DSCs should possess, it has to fulfill two additional conditions when implemented in DSPEC devices. Specifically, the reduction potential of the dye must be more negative than the operation potential of the catalyst. However, Bach and co-workers179 reported that when the sensitizer has a very negative potential hydrogen evolution can occur without the presence of a catalyst. This situation is rare though, since the presence of an electrocatalyst is crucial to achieve fast catalytic rates and therefore high efficiency of solar energy conversion into chemical energy. In addition, in DSPEC devices the chromophores ought to be more strongly attached on the electrode, making it more difficult for the aqueous or the acidic media to wash the dyes off the SC surface.
In Scheme 5 the three possible configuration types that are generally employed to combine a sensitizer with a catalyst in DSPEC are illustrated. The first approach is to either solubilize the catalyst in the reaction medium, like the redox mediator in DSC, or to simply deposit it as a layer onto the already chemisorbed sensitizer on the surface of the p-SC.178,180–184 The second method is to co-adsorb both entities on the p-SC surface.185,186 As it was clearly demonstrated, upon hole photoinjection, the electron that initially resides on the sensitizer has the tendency to be transferred between the dye molecules until finally captured by the catalyst.185,186 This is one of the simplest approaches, however the catalyst should firstly be functionalized by an anchoring group. In the last approach presented in Scheme 5, the catalyst is covalently connected to the sensitizer.187–190 Even though the preparation of a dye/catalyst complex is a more challenging task from a synthetic point of view, the overall efficiency of the DSPEC device is usually higher. This enhanced efficiency of the DSPEC in the latter approach can be attributed to the slower charge recombination reaction, the greater quantum yield for electron transfer (from the reduced dye to the catalyst) and the higher molecular organization on the NiO surface.
 Scheme 5  Schematic representation of the three possible configuration types that are generally employed to combine a sensitizer with a catalyst in DSPEC. 
Owing to the higher complexity of DSPEC relative to p-DSC, there are naturally fewer publications in this area and consequently fewer sensitizers were investigated for this purpose (Fig. 40).7,148 It is noteworthy that the chromophores used in this field have been inspired from sensitizers or similar derivatives already developed for p-DSCs (Fig. 41). In Fig. 42 the molecular structures of the hydrogen evolution catalysts (Cat) used in DSPEC are illustrated. Expectedly, the most investigated sensitizers in DSPEC are derivatives of tris-bipyridine ruthenium complexes. Notably, complexes containing one or two bipyridine ligands substituted by methylene phosphonic acid anchoring groups have been used either separately or covalently connected to the catalyst. In the latter case, Ishitani and co-workers have developed a Ru-Re dyad consisting of a tris-bipyridine ruthenium complex linked to a well-known rhenium bipyridine carbonyl reduction catalyst (Fig. 43).188,189 In addition, Reisner and co-workers have recently demonstrated the potential of the Meyer strategy based on zirconium phosphonate chemistry.192 They have developed photocatalytic NiO cathodes for hydrogen evolution containing a bilayer film with a ruthenium complex (RuP4) as the sensitizer and three Dubois nickel complexes as catalysts (Fig. 40 and 42).193 Wu and co-workers performed the coordination of a cobaloxime catalyst with a cyclometalated ruthenium complex in order to develop a DSPEC for H2 evolution.194 Moreover, the substitution of BH4 dye (Fig. 41) by hydrophobic chains made the dye monolayer resistant to diffusion of ions and hence protected the NiO surface from protons.183 This feature makes the photocathode compatible with acidic aqueous medium (pH = 1) without inducing the strong valence band bending that results from the Nernstian behavior of NiO.181 It is worth mentioning that the photocurrent density delivered by this system (BH4 dye and Mo3S4 catalyst) is the highest reported with a sensitized NiO photocathode.

Odobel and co-workers have also used a ruthenium based sensitizer RuP2 in association with a rhodium bis-bipyridine bis-chloro (Rh1) as a hydrogen evolving catalyst.181 Very recently, Chavarot-Kerlidou and co-workers have reported a RuP4-dppz complex with high photocurrent density using a sacrificial electron acceptor, denoting the importance of having the LUMO located on the ancillary ligand (Fig. 40).182
As presented in Fig. 43 various “Dye–catalyst” dyadic systems have been reported over the last few years, namely, a dyadic zinc porphyrin–rhenium complex (ZnP-Re) system was developed for CO2 reduction,190 dyes similar to P1 connected via click chemistry to a cobaloxime catalyst (T1-Co) by Artero and co-workers187 as well as (PB-2) by Tian and co-workers196 for proton reduction. Furthermore, Wu and co-workers194 have exploited the lability of one chloro ligand on cobaloxime to connect it with a cyclometalated ruthenium sensitizer via a coordination bond between the cobalt and the pyridyl unit of the photosensitizer (Ru-Co).

The Co-adsorption of sensitizers and catalysts on the SC surface was also investigated by Li et al. using P1 dye and cobaloxime as the catalyst (Co2 or Co3) attached on NiO.178,180 In the most recent report, the functionalized photocathode was combined with a sensitized TiO2 photoanode for the construction of a tandem DSPEC device performing water splitting. Hammarström and co-workers have prepared a NiO photocathode using a coumarin C343 sensitizer together with an iron benzene dithiolate catalyst (Fe1) that was functionalized by a phosphonate, demonstrating photo-driven hydrogen production.185,186 Moreover, a push–pull dye based on a naphthalene diimide molecule was co-immobilized on NiO with a new version of the Dubois catalyst (Ni2, bearing hydroxamic acid as the anchoring group) for proton reduction. Although the photocathode produced photocurrent upon light illumination in acidic media, the production of hydrogen could not be detected. This was ascribed to the fact that the second reduction of the catalyst did not efficiently occur due to fast charge recombination.191
Overall, the design of sensitized photocathodes for DSPECs is still in its early stages, because the conditions for the efficient conversion of solar energy to solar fuel are yet not optimal, namely, the multi-electron events which are essential for proton or carbon dioxide reduction require that the dye undergoes several oxidation processes by transferring electrons to the catalyst before charge recombination occurs. Another challenging feature is the stability of the molecular systems adsorbed onto the NiO surface even when submerged in aqueous and acidic medium. Overall, the recent development of DSPEC photocathodes has derived from the progress made in p-DSCs and particularly the design of more efficient sensitizers.
4. Conclusions and perspectives
Since the first paper on NiO based p-DSCs by Lindquist and co-workers in 1999 which exhibited a PCE of 0.0076%,48 enormous progress has been achieved in this field. In the following years, many research groups have reported the development of improved devices consisting of new chromophores with better suited photo-electrochemical properties. To this end, numerous chromophores have been studied in an effort to determine the ideal characteristics along with the optimum parameters that affect the efficiency of such devices. The first attempts between 1999 and 2000 involved the investigation of typical sensitizers already used in Grätzel cells, such as coumarin C343, TCPP, erythrosine and rhodamine, in p-DSCs. Nonetheless, since 2005 several research groups developed dyes with features satisfying specific requirements for p-type semiconductors, namely, the right directionality of the excited state as well as the electron shift from the NiO surface after hole injection. The first tested sensitizers that fulfill the above mentioned requirements were the PMI-NDI dyad and subsequently the P1 dye. Another breakthrough in this approach was achieved in 2010 with the implementation of the dye PMI-T6-TPA, which reached the record PCE of 0.41% using I3−/I− as the redox mediator.18 In 2013 and 2015 the same dye exhibited even higher PCE values with a cobalt tris(ethyleneamine) complex and a tris(acetylacetonato) iron complex as redox mediators, namely 1.3 and 2.51%, respectively.27,173 More recently, CAD3 and Th-DPP-NDI dyes were particularly efficient in producing high photocurrent density (up to 8.2 mA cm−2), with the I3−/I− electrolyte, due to their high absorptivity in the red region of the visible spectrum.21 The importance of the anchoring group has probably been underestimated until now, since limited studies have examined the effect of different anchoring units. Indeed, a significant milestone regarding those applications could derive by developing novel electron rich anchoring groups with higher affinity to NiO compared to the carboxylate unit.
From the three main factors used to estimate the PCE of a p-DSC, ff has a relatively constant value in the majority of the reported devices (around 30%). As a consequence, JSC and VOC are the main metrics defining the dye's efficacy. In Fig. 44 the evolution of JSC and PCE as a function of the publication year is illustrated.

Even though the performance of p-DSCs is continuously progressing since the first report in 1999, the best reported devices are still less efficient compared to their Grätzel cell counterparts. Thus far, the reasons that lead to these low photovoltaic performances are not fully understood. Undoubtedly, major pitfalls in such devices are the interfacial and geminate charge recombination reactions that occur. However, recent studies have shed light on the main source of these CR reactions, confirming the existence of intragap trap states. One possible strategy to overcome this issue is the development of dyes that display a closely packed arrangement onto the semiconductor, likewise the sensitizers used in n-DSCs. The high dye coverage on the semiconductor surface hinders the approach of the redox mediator; as a result this could either inhibit or reduce the interfacial charge recombination reactions. Concerning the geminate charge recombination, the most effective strategy which led to charge separated states with lifetimes over the μs timescale, is the introduction of a strong electron accepting unit appended to the extremity of the dye (see dye PMI-T6-TPA in Fig. 15 or DPP-NDI in Fig. 7). Another important factor, which is constantly low in p-DSCs is the fill factor (about 30%). Fundamental studies are essential to elucidate the factors leading to low ff values, as the interpretation of it is not fully established although geminate charge recombination may also play a substantial role.37
Currently, there is a real need to develop dyes with extended absorbance in the low energy part of the solar spectrum (near infrared). It is assumed that in tandem cells the photocathodes harvest the low energy part of sunlight, whereas the photoanodes exploit photons below 700 nm. In addition, the substitution of NiO by an alternative p-SC is one promising approach to increase the performance of p-DSCs. Although NiO is the material which led to the highest PCE ever reported in p-DSCs, its strong color and electrochromism properties limit the potential of this material for the construction of dye-sensitized photocathodes.38 Other inherent drawbacks of NiO that should be eliminated in future p-type materials are: the shallow valence band potential, the slow hole mobility and the presence of intragap states. It is worth mentioning that the imminent dyes applied in new p-SCs with deeper valence bands ought to possess suitable photoredox properties, specifically, higher oxidizing power in order to satisfy the thermodynamic barrier of the hole injection process.
The relevant studies reported in the literature concerning the field of dye-sensitized NiO photocathodes are constantly growing enticing the attention of plenty of research groups worldwide. Hopefully, owing to this immense scientific interest new breakthroughs in this area are going to ascend in the following years.
