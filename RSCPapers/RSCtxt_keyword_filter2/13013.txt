    , Accepted 19th December 2019First published on 20th December 2019Abstractvan der Waals (vdW) interaction-based heterostructures are known for enhanced photon absorption. However, the origin of these phenomena is not yet completely understood. In this work, using first-principles calculations, we provide a comprehensive study to show the effect of vdW interactions on the optical and electrical characteristics of the device and its origin. Herein, MoS2/2D (where 2D varies as graphene, black and blue phosphorene, and InSe) vdW heterojunctions are considered as model structures. The change in the band gap of the heterostructures is because of hybridisation and the non-linearity of the exchange–correlation functional. Hybridisation is correlated with strain and the difference in interstitial potential between layers of the heterostructure and the vacuum level. Significantly, the estimated values of energy conversion efficiency are high in the case of MoS2/InSe and MoS2/BlackP vdW heterostructures as compared to MoS2/GR and MoS2/BlueP, suggesting their potential application in efficient and atomically thick excitonic solar cell devices.
1 Introduction
Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have dominated global research for the last decade.1–9 The layer-dependent properties, such as strong photoluminescence (PL), and high photoresponsivity for optoelectronic devices, have been investigated.3,4,10–12 These layered materials are an essential part of today's modern semiconductor technologies.13–18 Quantum confined 2D materials are promising candidates to make sub-nanometre thick optoelectronic devices. The geometries of these devices are based on multilayer heterostructures, where the type of the junction greatly affects the efficiency and stability of the device. Additionally, monolayers of two different materials are stacked to form a heterostructure that could be used as an active layer in solar cells. Among all TMDs, MoS2 is the most suitable 2D material for solar cells because of its direct band gap in the monolayer around 1.8 eV (690 nm) and its low dark current. It is an ideal candidate for tandem cells if it is combined with a material of band gap 1.6 eV to achieve the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE).14
On the basis of interlayer band alignment, the heterojunctions are classified as: Schottky barrier junction, straddling gap (type-I), staggered gap (type-II), and broken gap (type-III). Type-I, type-II and type-III junctions are formed between semiconductors, whereas the junction between metals (or semi metal) and semiconductors is known as the Schottky barrier junction. In general, type-II junctions are required to reduce the electron–hole recombination rate within constituent layers.19 The mechanism of type-II junctions is controlled by interfacial processes and the resulting cells are called excitonic solar cells. The splitting of the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) in the individual layer justifies that the minority carrier density is insignificant. In contrast to Schottky barrier solar cells, the photo current consists mainly of the minority carriers in which both the carriers coexist in the same chemical phase.20
A reduction of the band gap with the number of layers has been reported21–26 and is mostly attributed to quantum confinement.3,5–7 While stacking layers to form a heterostructure (means summing up of potentials), a finite barrier is created in the interfacial region that forms a quantum well-like structure. In one of the studies, with the help of this barrier (calculated with the Hartree potential profile), a reduction in the band gap with increasing number of layers due to quantum confinement has been verified for black phosphorene.6 On the other hand, a quantitative approach has revealed that the observed trend is a combined effect of quantum confinement and non linearity of the DFT exchange–correlation functional.27 However, further investigation is necessary to correctly capture the effect of the change in the second layer potential.
We study the effect of the underneath layer on the MoS2/2D band structure and the potential profile and correlate it with the efficiency of a MoS2/2D vdW heterosturcture based solar cell. We show that quantum confinement, non-linearity in the exchange–correlation functional and hybridisation dependent interstitial potential play a role in determining the interlayer interactions. Further, visible light absorption was evaluated to verify the ability of heterostructures for sub-nanometre thick solar cell applications. We examined the electrical characteristics, such as the equivalent short circuit current density, open circuit voltage and upper limit of energy conversion efficiency under AM 1.5G28 solar illumination. Correlation of the lowest exciton energy to the hybridisation dependent interstitial potential opens up the possibilities to design atomically thick solar cells.
2 Computational details
We used first-principles calculations under Density Functional Theory (DFT) as implemented in Quantum Espresso29,30 with the Projected Augmented-Wave (PAW)31 pseudo-potential approach and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange correlation to calculate the ground state energy and the band structure. For vdW correction, the Grimme (DFT-D2) approach32 was used. All the systems were relaxed until the forces among all the atomic positions were less than 0.001 eV Å−1. A high cut-off energy of 550 eV was set for the plane-wave basis set and a 15 × 15 × 1 (for hexagonal system) and 21 × 15 × 1 (for rectangular) Monkhorst–Pack grid was used to sample the first Brilloin zone. The criterion for total energy convergence was set to 10−6 eV and to ensure that there was no periodic interaction, we used a vacuum space of 20 Å along the z direction. All the band structure calculations were carried out with smearing; we used a “marzari-vaderbilt” smearing type in the case of MoS2/GR whereas “Fermi–Dirac” was used for the other heterostructures. To correctly estimate the band gap, the HSE-06 functional was used with the screening parameter (in Bohr−1) ω = 0.106 for Hartree–Fock and ω = 0.189 for the PBE part. Optical properties were calculated using the Independent Particle Approximation (IPA) method as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).33
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Structural properties
In order to study the interlayer effects between MoS2 and different types of layers, we considered four heterostructures ranging from MoS2/semi-metal to MoS2/wide band gap semiconductors, as shown in Fig. 1. The monolayer of MoS2 (2H-MoS2 phase) has a hexagonal lattice with a = 3.16 Å. Other constituent layers are graphene (GR), black phosphorene (BlackP), indium selenide (InSe), and blue phosphorene (BlueP). The optimised lattice parameters for GR, InSe, and BlueP having a hexagonal lattice type are 2.461, 4.050, and 3.268 Å, respectively, whereas for BlackP, which has a simple orthorhombic lattice type, the values are a = 3.350 Å and b = 4.620 Å. Heterostructures are constructed using the supercell concept maintaining minimal lattice mismatch (up to 5%). The structural parameters of all the models under investigation are given in Table S1 (ESI†). To study the relative stability of the heterojunction formed, the interfacial binding energy (ΔEb) was calculated, as given in Fig. 1. The binding energies are consistent with the typical vdW binding energy of around 20 meV Å−2, obtained by DFT calculations.9 The calculation of the binding energies along with charge transfer analysis is given in the ESI.†

3.2 Electronic properties
To understand the effect of interlayer interaction, we systematically studied the change in the band gap between constituent mono-layers and the resulting heterostructure. Results are tabulated in Table 1, where we show the effect of tensile strain (due to lattice mismatch) and inter-layer interaction on the band gap. As shown in the table, the band gap decreases with respect to strain in all the participating layers; for example, the MoS2/BlackP band gap of MoS2 decreases from 1.78 to 1.24 eV and for BlackP, it decreases from 1 to 0.71 eV. However, in the case of MoS2/GR, there is no change. We further analysed the effect of interlayer interaction on the band gap of constituent layers in the heterostructure, where we found that the band gap increases in graphene from 0 to 1 meV and in BlackP, the band gap increases by 0.17 eV.

Further investigation regarding the change in the band gap was performed using the projected band structure. Firstly, we consider the band structure of MoS2 in all heterostructures, as shown in Fig. 2(b), (e), (h) and (k). Since for MoS2/GR there is no strain in MoS2 (Table 1), we can consider its band structure as our reference. On comparing the band structure of strained MoS2 in Fig. 2(e), (h) and (k) with Fig. 2(b), we notice that VBM and CBM are both shifted towards the Fermi level under tensile strain due to which the band gap decreases. One can see at the VBM of strained MoS2 that the orbital contribution is altered by the hybridised orbital of Mo-4dz2 and S-3pz (Fig. 2(e), (h) and (k)) as compared to Mo-4dxy (Fig. 2(b)) in unstrained MoS2. The hybridisation of orbitals at the VBM leads to the shifting of the VBM towards the Fermi level. In addition, the MoS2 band gap becomes indirect with K to G of 1.24, 1.30, and 1.10 eV for MoS2/BlackP with a strain of 2.82% along  and 2.60% along , MoS2/InSe with a strain of 2.45%, and MoS2/BlueP with a strain of 3.29%, respectively. For the CBM, there is no change in the contribution of orbitals, i.e. Mo-4dz2 persists after applying tensile strain; however, the CBM shifts towards the Fermi-level. Our calculated results are consistent with previous studies.34,35

Fermi level is set to 0 eV. Colour coded band projected orbitals are presented where the dot size illustrates the weightage of each orbital. EHETg, EL1g, and EL2g are band gaps (in eV) of the heterostructure layer-1 (MoS2) and layer-2 (GR, BlackP, InSe, and BlueP), respectively. 
Secondly, we studied the effect of the second layer when stacking with MoS2. Consider the band structure of MoS2/GR, MoS2/BlackP, MoS2/InSe, and MoS2/BlueP (in Fig. 2(c), (f), (i) and (l)). The figure shows that at the CBM in MoS2/GR, the contribution is from C-2pz, whereas in MoS2/BlackP, MoS2/InSe, and MoS2/BlueP, the contribution of Mo-4dz2 exists. On the other hand, at the VBM in MoS2/GR (Fig. 2(c)), the contribution is mainly from C-2pz, and in MoS2/BlackP (Fig. 2(f)), the contribution of hybrid orbitals P-3pz and P-3py at the G (gamma) point can be seen. Interestingly, at the VBM in MoS2/GR and MoS2/BlackP, there is no contribution from MoS2. For MoS2/InSe, the contribution from the out of plane Se-3pz orbital from InSe exists and it forms a hybrid-orbital with Mo-4dz2 and S-3pz, as shown in Fig. 2(i). For MoS2/BlueP (Fig. 2(l)), the contribution from BlueP is present (P-3pz) between K&G, but at the VBM (G-point), the contribution is only from MoS2 (Mo-4dz2 and S-3pz) orbitals. Overlapping among orbitals shows the inter-layer hybridisation in MoS2/InSe and MoS2/BlueP at the valence band, which is further verified considering the projected density of states given in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Overall, we see that the second layer contributes to the hybridisation that occurs among the layers, therefore we can say that hybridisation because of strain and interlayer interaction is responsible for decreasing the band gap of the 2D vdW heterostructure with respect to its participating layers. Due to the hybridisation at the VBM in MoS2/InSe (Fig. 2(i)), the energy levels of MoS2-VBM and InSe-VBM coincide. To study the type of junction formation in MoS2/InSe, we considered the band projected charge density at three different K-points numbered as 1, 2 and 3 for CBM-K, VBM-K, and VBM-G points (Fig. 3(a)–(d)). A hybrid state is present at the VBM G-point, which is an exception as the charge density is contributed by both the layers (MoS2 and InSe) in Fig. 3(d) and it may act as a recombination centre. The electronic state at the K-point (Fig. 3(a) and (c)) suggests that the electrons associated with the states localised on InSe transfer to MoS2 (Fig. 3(a) and (b)) after the absorption of a photon, which has an energy equivalent to visible light. As a result, a charge-transfer exciton shared among the layers is formed, which results in a type-II heterojunction. Furthermore, we discuss the band offset nature of the heterojunctions, as shown in Fig. 3(f), where we estimated the conduction band offset (CBO) and valence band offset (VBO) values with respect to layer-2. For MoS2/BlackP, the CBO is +0.42 eV and the VBO is +0.74 eV; for MoS2/InSe, the CBO is +0.22 eV and the VBO is 0 eV; and for MoS2/BlueP, the CBO is +0.39 eV and the VBO is −0.27 eV. For MoS2/BlackP and MoS2/InSe, the values of CBO and VBO are positive, which confirms the type-II heterojunction formation, whereas, in the case of MoS2/BlueP, the CBO is positive and VBO is negative, hence it forms a type-I heterojunction. In Fig. 3(f), MoS2/GR is shown, which forms a Schottky barrier junction, where the estimated value for the Schottky barrier (SB) is 1.16 eV, which is in good agreement with a previously reported result of 1.2 eV.36 Furthermore, we examined the maximum open circuit voltage (VOC,max), a sensitive parameter for solar cells. In the MoS2/GR heterojunction, VOC,max is calculated by taking the difference between SB and the built-in potential (ϕSB − ϕbi), whereas in the case of MoS2/BlackP, MoS2/InSe and MoS2/BlueP interfaces, we consider the VOC,max equal to the band gap (considered using HSE-06 for accuracy). Calculated values of VOC,max are given in Table 2. Comparatively, higher VOC,max values are shown by MoS2/InSe, which shows an estimated value of 1.68 eV whereas for MoS2/GR, VOC,max = 0.62 eV, for MoS2/BlackP, VOC,max = 1.25 eV and for MoS2/BlueP, VOC,max = 1.28 eV. In summary, regarding the nature of the junction, we found that 2D material based type-II heterojunctions form charge-transfer excitons where the electrons are present in one layer and the holes are present in the other.

To shed more light on the interlayer interaction, a separate DFT calculation was performed to compute the self-consistent charge density along with the total potential of the heterostructure and its constituent layers. All the atomic positions in the monolayers were considered the same as if they were in the heterostructure (no relaxation was performed). The planar average of the total DFT potential is shown in Fig. 4, where VL1tot, VL2tot, and VHETtot are the total potentials of layer-1 (i.e. MoS2), layer-2 (GR, BlackP, InSe and BlueP) and the heterostructure respectively. The sum of VL1tot and VL2tot was also plotted to consider the quantum confined potential of the bilayer heterostructure. In the Fig. 4, the difference in VHETtot and VL1tot + VL2tot is clearly shown, for example in Fig. 4(c), the difference in MoS2/InSe is 1.03 eV and is localised at the inter-layer region. We also plotted the planar average charge density, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), for layer-1 (ρL1), layer-2 (ρL2), ρL1 + ρL2 and for the heterostructure ρHET. It is clearly shown that in all cases, the planar averaged charge density completely overlaps with ρL1 + ρL2, which indicates that there is no significant rearrangement of the charge density in the heterostructure as compared to its constituent layers. Hence, the change in the total potential, as mentioned above, is not because of the Hartree potential since it is a linear functional of the charge density. The difference (ΔVxc = VHETtot − (VL1tot + VL2tot)) arises because of the exchange–correlation functional, which creates an additional barrier in the inter-layer region, as shown in Fig. 4.27 Moreover, to study the effect due to different types of underneath layers, we considered ΔVInttot — the difference between vacuum level (ΔVvacc set at 0 eV)—and the total potential of the heterostructure, i.e. ΔVInttot = ΔVvacc − VHETtot, as shown in Fig. 4. We found that in comparison with the non-interacting system (i.e. MoS2/GR), ΔVInttot is high in interacting systems. The calculated values are 4.23, 5.11, 4.51, and 5.92 eV for MoS2/GR, MoS2/BlackP, MoS2/InSe and MoS2/BlueP, respectively. To verify this, we performed a calculation with pure non-interacting MoS2/h-BN and we found that ΔVInttot is 4.29 eV (given in Fig. S5, ESI†). In MoS2/InSe, ΔVInttot is small as compared to that of the other two interacting systems. The reason behind that is, if we consider the contribution of the hybrid orbital at the VBM for MoS2/InSe (Fig. 2(i)), it is less compared to that for MoS2/BlackP and MoS2/BlueP in Fig. 2(f) and (l). Hence, the interstitial barrier height changes with hybridisation; the more hybridisation, the lower will be the barrier height. Therefore, we can say that the interlayer reliant band gap in the heterostructure changes because of quantum confinement, non-linearity in exchange–correlation functional and hybridisation dependent interstitial barrier potential.

The red curve represents MoS2 (VL1tot), the blue curve shows the total potential (VL2tot) of GR, BlackP, InSe and BlueP in their respective figure, the sum of VL1tot and VL2tot is shown by the light magenta colour and the black curve illustrates the potential profile of the heterostructure (VHETtot). ΔVInt represents the potential difference between the vacuum level (Vvacc) set at 0 eV and VHETtot; ΔVxc is the exchange and correlation potential that is calculated using VHETtot − (VL1tot + VL2tot). 
3.3 Optical properties
Considering the effect of interlayer interaction on the optical properties, we compared the imaginary part (ε2) of the dielectric function of the heterostructure with that of its constituent layers (in Fig. 5(a)). The imaginary part associated with the heterostructure shows that absorption edges occur at lower energies as compared to their participating layers. The occurrence of absorption edges at lower energies is consistent with our band structure analysis. We calculated the refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (κ)37 from ε1 and ε2 as a function of photon energy E using (1)and (2)The reflectivity was calculated by using n and κ as given: (3)where E is the photon energy. Since a huge vacuum is present in the simulation cell while considering the ultra-thin active layers for solar cell applications, we approximated our absorption coefficient (α)36 with n = 1, given as: (4)where the photon frequency ω is defined as the fraction of photon energy E = ħω absorbed by the active layer and c is the speed of light. Further, we examined the absorbance (A) given by A(E) = 1 − e−α(E)·d(5)where d is the thickness of the simulation cell. Calculated results for A are shown in Fig. 5(b). Significantly high absorbance is shown by all heterostructures in the visible spectrum of light, under a 30 Å thick simulation cell. Further, R(E) and α(E) are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), where all the heterostructures show low reflectivity and high absorption coefficients, which is promising for highly efficient atomically-thin layer solar cells. The reason behind the higher absorption coefficient is interlayer interaction among the layers, which increases the electron transition probability because of the lowering of the interstitial barrier, which was discussed before. To estimate the feasibility and performance of atomically-thin layered structures for solar cell applications, we examined the equivalent maximum short circuit current density (Jsc) from absorbed photon flux density (Jabs) as a function of photon energy (E), assuming that the internal quantum efficiency is 100%: (6)where Eg is the band gap of the absorber layer, Jph is the incident photon flux (photons per cm2 per s per eV) under AM 1.5G28 solar illumination and A is absorbance. Therefore, Jsc is given by Jsc = e·Jabs(7)where e is the elementary charge, which multiplies with Jabs to express the absorbed photon flux equivalent to the short circuit current density (mA cm−2). To go a step further, the upper limit of energy conversion efficiency (η) was calculated by using (8)where λ is the photon wavelength, W(λ) is the spectral irradiance at Air Mass 1.5, C(λ) is the conversion factor (or FILL FACTOR) of the photon energy converted to the lowest-exciton energy (Eo – for MoS2/BlackP, MoS2/InSe and MoS2/BlueP, it is equal to the HSE-06 band gap whereas for MoS2/GR, it is equal to SB), (9)and λmax – the longest wavelength absorbed by the active layer, which is determined by using (10)
 Fig. 5  (a) Imaginary part of dielectric function is shown on log-scale where blue colour represents the heterostructure, red curve represents MoS2 and black curve represents different underneath layers (GR, BlackP, InSe and BlueP); (b) absorbance and solar irradiance (AM-1.5G); and (c) bar graph of energy conversion efficiency at different photon wavelength ranges. 
The results are tabulated in Table 2, where we found that among the type-II heterojunctions, MoS2/BlackP shows 5% efficiency with Jsc = 9.31 mA cm−2 and VOC,max = 1.25 V. MoS2/InSe showed a high energy conversion efficiency of 5.10% with Jsc = 7.64 mA cm−2 and VOC,max = 1.68 V. The atomically thin active layers give a higher current density compared to the reported values of atomically thin films based on conventional materials; for example, silicon gives a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 and GaAs gives a current dentity of 0.3 mA cm−2.36 Additionally, in Fig. 5(c), we show the efficiency with respect to different ranges of photon wavelength. On comparing the efficiency with absorbance (Fig. 5(b)), in the visible spectrum (400 to 600 nm), we found that MoS2/InSe shows a higher efficiency than MoS2/BlackP and MoS2/BlueP although each has more or less the same absorbance spectra. The difference in efficiency is because of C(λ), which is directly proportional to Eo, and MoS2/InSe has a higher Eo (1.68 eV) because of the high band gap. Hence, this shows how the underneath layer affects the efficiency. Also, in the figure, one can see clearly that in the infrared region, MoS2/BlackP shows high efficiency. Thus, a possibly highly efficient solar cell can be designed if we arrange MoS2/BlackP and MoS2/InSe in a stacked format. In particular, we studied how the device efficiency depends on Eo, which is a material property and governed by the quantum confinement and interlayer interaction in the case of 2D bilayer heterojunctions. By using time-dependent DFT, it is possible to estimate the time scale of electron–hole separation after photon absorption.38 Such a study is necessary for our proposed heterostructures in the near future.
4 Conclusion
In conclusion, on the basis of first-principles calculation, we examined how the layer dependent band structure evolves. We showed that the interlayer reliant bandgap in heterostrucures changes because of quantum confinement, non-linearity in the exchange–correlation functional and a hybridisation dependent interstitial barrier potential. Further, we correlated the efficiency of the device with interlayer interaction, where we found that the factor C(λ) governs it, because it is directly proportional to the lowest exciton energy, which depends purely on the interlayer interactions. In particular, high short circuit current density is observed in the range of 7–9 mA cm−2. We also uncovered the strong absorbance of the MoS2/InSe type-II heterojunction in the visible spectrum of light that reaches 29% at 450 nm wavelength; also, it gives a Jsc of 7.64 mA cm−2 and η of 5.10%. The results suggest that MoS2/InSe and MoS2/BlackP can be a potential material for ultra-thin or atomically thin excitonic solar cells. Overall, this work investigates the role of quantum confined vdW interlayer interaction, in the context of a high-performance solar cell. Therefore, these types of heterojunctions can provide a fascinating choice to engineers for designing next-generation solar cell devices.

 	Fig. 2  Projected band structure of heterostructures and their constituent layers (with strain after lattice mismatch): (a) GR, (b) MoS2, (c) MoS2/GR; (d) BlackP, (e) MoS2, (f) MoS2/BlackP; (g) InSe, (h) MoS2, (i) MoS2/InSe; and (j) BlueP, (k) MoS2, (l) MoS2/BlueP. Fermi level is set to 0 eV. Colour coded band projected orbitals are presented where the dot size illustrates the weightage of each orbital. EHETg, EL1g, and EL2g are band gaps (in eV) of the heterostructure layer-1 (MoS2) and layer-2 (GR, BlackP, InSe, and BlueP), respectively.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Band structure of MoS2/lnSe, Fermi level is set to 0eV. (b)–(d) The charge density plots associated with the -points marked in the band structure as 1–3 using red dots. The charge density plot at the G-point (red dot 3) shows the contribution of both layers, which may act as a recombination centre; (e) projected density of states is shown, where the direct and indirect transition state at VB is shown. If we consider the direct transition of electron at a high symmetry point K, then it exhibits a type-II heterojunction, and if we consider the indirect transition at G, then it follows a type-I heterojunction with a recombination centre. (f) Band edge alignment of the heterostructure where Evacc represents the vacuum level, EC and EV represent the conduction and valence band, Ef represents the Fermi-level and Φ represents work function.
