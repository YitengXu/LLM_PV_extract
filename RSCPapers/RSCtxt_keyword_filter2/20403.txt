In the past two decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been paid unprecedented attention both in academic research and practical applications.1–3 To improve the performance of DSSCs in satisfying energy demand, tremendous research efforts have been dedicated to the design of panchromatic sensitizers, novel prospective electrolytes and other new materials.2 However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) still lags behind that of silicon solar cells though an efficiency of up to 12% has been achieved.4,5 One thorny problem restricting the performance of DSSCs is the charge recombination2,3 between the electrons in the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 and the acceptors in the electrolyte, which governs the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of DSSCs as advocated by O'Regan and Grätzel.6 Thus, searching for a better way to impair charge recombination is urgently demanding. Several strategies for restraining this process have been reported,7–9 including sensitizer modification.10–12 The careful engineering of polypyridine ruthenium (Ru) complexes, as one of the most efficient and stable dye sensitizers,2 has raised research interest.13 Schmidt-Mende et al. reported that the introduction of hydrophobic chains could effectively suppress charge recombination.14 Despite significant developments, to further slow down the charge recombination and enhance the VOC, exploitation of strategic molecular design of Ru complexes is still required.
Dendritic molecules,15 as a novel organic framework composed of focal point, repeated layered structures and peripheral groups, have been adopted in DSSCs and led to improvement in performance.16,17 Compared with other strategies, the major advantages of such multi-branched compounds in enhancing the VOC of DSSCs are their intrinsic bulky structures18 and the ability to interact with the ions in the electrolyte.19–21 Such properties inspire us to design a novel ruthenium dye simply by the introduction of PAMAM dendrons to the ligand, which we expect will retard charge recombination more efficiently than Ru complexes with hydrophobic chains. We herein report a newly synthesized ruthenium complex sensitizer (cis-di(thiocyanato)-4,4′-di(butylamide-terminated poly(amidoamine) dendrons)-2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine ruthenium(II)), denoted as RG1. The ability to reduce electron recombination of RG1-sensitized solar cells with different electrolytes was studied and compared with the commercially available dye Z907 with hydrophobic chains.

Fig. 1 illustrates the targeted molecule RG1 involved in this contribution. The compound bearing branched structures was prepared by reliable one-pot assembly protocol.22 The detailed synthetic procedures and characterization of RG1 are described in the Electronic Supporting Information (ESI†) (Scheme S1). Compared to the commercial product Z907 (Fig. 1), the only structural difference of RG1 is the replacement of aliphatic chains by the dendrons. RG1 and Z907 have a similar absorption spectrum and the molar absorption coefficient as revealed by the UV–Vis measurement (Fig. S1†).

The performance of the dye-sensitized solar cells was evaluated by photocurrent–voltage (J–V) measurements under AM 1.5 simulated sunlight illumination. The properties of commercial available product Z907 were simultaneously determined as a control to evaluate the functions of RG1. The devices were fabricated by the same procedures in the previous report23 (ESI†). The basic device parameters, such as the short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are listed in Table 1.

Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the J–V plots of RG1- and Z907-sensitized solar cells using I3−/I− as the electrolyte with (devices: RG1-TBP and Z907-TBP) and without (devices: RG1-N and Z907-N) 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) which is one of the most widely used additives in electrolytes to retard back current.24 It is found that when TBP is present in the electrolyte, compared to Z907-TBP with the VOC of 685 mV, RG1-TBP shows a higher VOC value of 747 mV; of particular importance, when no TBP in the electrolyte, the VOC of RG1-N (706 mV) retains the same level with that of RG1-TBP, but is much higher than the VOC of Z907-N that reduces to 531 mV. Meanwhile the PCE of RG1-N (4.76%) is 29% higher than that of Z907-N (3.69%). These results demonstrate that the RG1 dye bearing dendritic structures acts not only as a dye but also as an additive in the electrolyte, shifting the VOC to higher values even without TBP in the electrolyte. We attribute such behavior to the better ability of the dendrons to retard charge recombination due to the RG1-based cells with lower dark current that is usually used to estimate the extent of interfacial charge recombination.18 Interestingly, we also discover that for the RG1-sensitized cells, the PCE increases from 4.27% (RG1-TBP) to 4.76% (RG1-N). This result indicates that the RG1-based cells could display even better performance without TBP in the electrolyte since RG1-N shows similar VOC but higher JSC values as compared to RG1-TBP. The lower JSC of RG1-TBP results from the addition of TBP3,8 which could reduce the electron injection efficiency while enhancing VOC in DSSCs. However, RG1 dye can enhance VOC with no need of additives in the electrolyte, which affords an alternative method to improve the VOC without reducing electron injection efficiency.

To deeply understand the high VOC observed with RG1, we measured the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of RG1-and Z907-sensitized cells using I3−/I− as the electrolyte with or without TBP under reverse bias (0.55 V) in the dark condition. As shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), the recombination resistance (Rrec) values of RG1-TBP (838 Ω cm2) and RG1-N (322.8 Ω cm2) are 3 and 17 times larger than those of Z907-TBP (247.2 Ω cm2) and Z907-N (18.86 Ω cm2), respectively, demonstrating the better ability of PAMAM dendrons to suppress electron recombination compared to the hydrophobic chains. This can be attributed to the large size of the dendrons and the formation of more compact layers of RG1via H-bonds from amide groups in dendrons,25 which block I3− from accessing the TiO2 surface and impair the back current.11,12,18 The electron lifetime is usually calculated by the following equation:7τ = RrecCμ, where Cμ is the chemical capacitance. The electron lifetime τ at different reverse bias in the dark condition is shown in ESI† (Fig. S2). It is found that at the same reverse bias, contrary to Z907-sensitized solar cells, the electron lifetime of RG1-sensitized cells is more prolonged whether TBP existed in the electrolyte or not, which provides supplementary evidence for slower electron recombination occurring in the devices based on RG1 relative to Z907.
 Fig. 3  The electrochemical impedance spectra of RG1 and Z907 devices using I3−/I− as the electrolyte (a) with and (b) without TBP under reverse bias (0.55 V) in the dark condition. 
Meanwhile, we notice that the JSC of devices based on RG1 is lower than that of Z907 devices. It is ascribed to the large steric structures of PAMAM dendrons (ESI†, Fig. S3) which cause less adsorption of RG1 on the TiO2 electrodes (ESI†, Fig. S4). To overcome this shortcoming, RG1 and Z907 co-sensitized solar cells were prepared. As Fig. 2(a) and (b) show, the co-sensitized cells, with or without TBP (devices: RG1/Z907-TBP and RG1/Z907-N) in the I3−/I− electrolyte, give higher JSC values of 11.66 mA cm−2 and 13.28 mA cm−2, and higher PCEs of 5.34% and 5.06% as compared to bare RG1-based devices. Importantly, the RG1/Z907-N cell with no TBP in the electrolyte displays a similar PCE of 5.06% to that of Z907-TBP (5.07%), which further proves that the dendrons have the same function as TBP to inhibit the interfacial charge recombination.
In the one-electron redox system2,5 of Co3+/Co2+, the redox couples can cause more severe interfacial recombination and shorter electron lifetime in DSSCs. To further confirm the capability of controlling the dark current of RG1, we also extended our studies to the devices based on Co3+/Co2+ electrolyte. J–V plots of RG1- and Z907-sensitized cells using Co3+/Co2+ as the electrolyte with (devices: Co-RG1-TBP and Co-Z907-TBP) or without TBP (devices: Co-RG1-N and Co-Z907-N) are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). Obviously, the RG1-sensitized cells give higher VOC and PCE whether or not TBP is in the electrolyte as compared to Z907-sensitized cells, which confirms the action of the dendrons in reducing the electron recombination once again. The above results reveal the marked effect of dendrons in controlling the electron recombination and improving the VOC. This phenomenon can be ascribed to several reasons. The most important factor is the large size of dendrons and the formation of highly packed structures of dyes25via H-bonds from amide groups in PAMAM dendrons, which increase the space between the electrons in TiO2 and acceptors in the electrolyte, and prevent the motion of cations from the vicinity of the TiO2 surface especially the exposed sites, thus reducing the electron recombination and shifting the VOC to higher values.11,12,18 Moreover, higher VOC can benefit from the interactions of the amide groups in PAMAM dendrons with Li+ and I− in the electrolyte which were identified by the FT-IR, DSC and 1H NMR measurements (ESI†, Fig. S5–S7). The interaction of dendrons with Li+ and the highly packed structures of RG1 can prevent the cations accessing the TiO2 surface and then positively shift the TiO2 potential (ESI†, Fig. S8).26 Meanwhile the interaction of dendrons with I−/I3− redox couples can accelerate the dye regeneration that in turn reduces the charge recombination rate between electrons in TiO2 and oxidized dyes.27 Such synergetic effects increase the VOC. Finally, since N-containing organic molecules have been reported as additives in electrolytes to improve VOC,8 the nitrogen atoms contained in PAMAM dendrons may have the similar effect and can be expected to enhance VOC.10

In summary, we have prepared a novel ruthenium complex RG1 bearing butylamide-terminated poly(amidoamine) dendrons. We find that devices based on RG1 can retard the electron recombination more efficiently than Z907 with aliphatic chains. RG1 can act not only as a dye but also as an additive in the electrolytes, shifting the VOC to higher values even without TBP in both iodine and cobalt electrolytes. This is mainly due to the large steric structures of dendrons and the formation of highly packed structures of dyes via H-bonds. Moreover, the interactions of PAMAM dendrons with ions and the presence of nitrogen atoms may also be of benefit for high VOC. Such results can provide an alternative method to enhance the VOC with no need for additives in the electrolyte.
