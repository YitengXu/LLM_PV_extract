    , Accepted 11th February 2015First published on 12th February 2015AbstractFabrication of a monocrystalline silicon based heterojunction film at room-temperature in a time-efficient manner is desirable for energy and environmental considerations. In this report, a gas–solid phase direct elemental reaction (DER) route to realize this aim by firstly depositing an elemental copper layer on a monocrystalline silicon surface followed by a reaction with iodine vapor is described. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, photoelectrochemical measurements, and the transient photovoltage (TPV) technique. The novelty of the current work lies in the following three aspects: (1) formation of an in situ CuI/Si quasi-bulk-heterojunction at room temperature is assisted by the infiltrated elemental copper layer being completely transformed into a γ phase copper iodide (γ-CuI) thin film; (2) the virgin monocrystalline silicon is pretreated to ensure a pyramidally patterned rough surface which facilitates the construction of quasi-bulk-heterojunction thin films and enhances their chemical stability and mechanical stability; (3) the photovoltaic performance and mechanism of the resulting CuI/Si quasi-bulk-heterojunction based solar cell was detected and evaluated for the first time by a combination of photoelectrochemical and TPV techniques, which demonstrates that the intensity of the interface electric field as well as the open circuit potential can be adjusted by tuning the amount of CuI coated on the pyramidally patterned n-Si substrate.
1. Introduction
The traditional monocrystalline silicon based solar cells which are characterized by both comprehensive stability and high photoelectric conversion efficiency have been facing challenges from other alternative solar energy conversion materials.1 One of the important reasons is that the fabrication of p–n junctions requires high temperatures.2–5 To overcome this high temperature restriction, construction of inorganic/Si compound heterojunctions is an alternative way to build solar cells with relatively low temperature requirements. For example, a solar cell device based on the n-ZnO/p-Si heterojunction has been reported with a three dimensional structure, in which ZnO nanowires are uniformly distributed on the surface of Si nanowires.6 This device exhibited good optical and photovoltaic performance. Yet, the preparation of the p–n junction still necessitated the relatively higher temperature of 500 °C as well as argon protection. In addition, other heterojunction solar cells based on Si/compound semiconductors have been extensively studied, such as CdS/Si,7,8 which resulted in an efficient charge separation in heterojunction structures due to the well aligned band structure.
Considering that the organic polymer semiconductor materials can be assembled to form p–n junctions at lower temperatures, Avasthi and colleagues9 recently prepared a novel p-P3HT/n-Si heterojunction by spin-coating the p-type conjugated P3HT on the Si surface at room temperature, which indeed realized the low temperature fabrication of a single crystal Si based p–n heterojunction. At the same time, the utilization of the rigid Si substrate suppressed the flexibility of the organic polymer semiconductor and rendered it impractical for use in solar cells. In addition, the high cost, the low charge transfer rate, and the complex preparation process of the specialized organic polymer semiconductor material add to the inapplicability of this system. Thus, the challenge remains to find a new route to form p–n junctions with single crystal Si that satisfies the following criteria: (1) the inorganic compound semiconductors and the p–n junction can be prepared at room temperature and (2) the corresponding energy level of the inorganic compound matches well with that of the single crystal silicon so that photo generated carriers can be efficiently separated and the performance of photovoltaic devices is expected to be enhanced.
Among various common p-type inorganic semiconductor materials, CuI is attracting more and more attention because it possesses good electrical conductivity and a larger band gap.10,11 In particular, a CuI thin film is completely transparent in the visible and near infrared region due to its larger band gap. The top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band for CuI are located at −5.2 eV and −2.2 eV, respectively, resulting in a bandgap of ∼3.0 eV, which corresponds well with the energy level of monocrystalline silicon;12 thus Si/CuI meets the parameters for forming a heterojunction for effective photovoltaic conversion.
Multiple preparation methods for CuI semiconductor thin films are available, including thermal evaporation,13 the hydrothermal method,14,15 electrodeposition,16 and the photoelectrochemical copper nanoparticle deposition method.17 For example, Imanishi et al.12 prepared a CuI thin film with a lamellar structure on a silicon substrate by thermally evaporating 99.99% CuI powder at 600 °C and 1.0 × 10−3 Pa for solar cell device fabrication. In our previous work,18 we have successfully fabricated highly (110) oriented CuI thin films with sharp exciton bands on copper foil substrates under the solvothermal condition of 160 °C. All these methods require harsh conditions such as high temperature, high pressure, high vacuum, or an elaborate equipment set-up.
Fabrication of a CuI/Si quasi-bulk-heterojunction film in an alternative and straightforward way at room-temperature is highly desirable. Here, we report the development of a facile gas–solid phase route to realize this aim by firstly depositing an elemental copper layer on a monocrystalline silicon surface followed by iodination with iodine vapor at room temperature. The current iodination process is an alternative for preparing CuI thin films. The virgin monocrystalline silicon is pretreated to form a pyramidally patterned surface which enhances the chemical and mechanical stability of the ensuing bulk-heterojunction as a building frame for an infiltrated elemental copper layer and then reacts in situ with iodine to form a CuI/Si heterojunction thin film. The elemental Cu thin film can also be deposited by some other methods such as electroplating or electroless copper plating under air conditions. The result is the production of an in situ CuI/Si quasi-bulk-heterojunction at room temperature.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Silicon substrate pretreatment
An N-type silicon wafer (1.0 cm × 0.5 cm, thickness 170 ± 5 μm, 0.015–0.019 Ω cm−1, (100)) was first cleaned with acetone and then with deionized water (DI water) for about 1 min, and then treated with anhydrous ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for about 10 min, and stored in anhydrous ethanol. To obtain a textured surface on the pre-treated wafer, it was then corroded in an alkaline solution prepared by mixing 75 mL KOH solution (3.0% w/w–4.0% w/w) and 10 mL isopropyl alcohol at 90 °C for approximately 40 min, and then treated with HF solution (volume ratio of 1:50) for 30 s. The resulting textured wafer was cleaned with DI water and dried at 70 °C for further use.
2.2 Heterojunction thin film preparation
First, a 100 nm or 200 nm elemental Cu thin film was deposited on the n-type Si textured surface by magnetron sputtering using a film thickness monitor (FTM); second, this sample was treated with iodine vapor at 15–25 °C for about 40 min until the Cu thin film was completely converted to white CuI. Using this simple method, a CuI/Si heterojunction thin film with a large surface area was prepared. The CuI/Si heterojunction thin film surface was spin coated with PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)) at 1800 rpm to form the Si/CuI/PEDOT:PSS structure and dried in an oven at 70 °C. The resulting sample was stored in a clean and dry container and kept away from light.
2.3 Solar cell device fabrication
A quasi-bulk-heterojunction solar cell device was fabricated on the basis of the Si/CuI/PEDOT:PSS structure. Both the silicon and the PEDOT:PSS surfaces were covered with silver as a cathode and an anode by the thermal evaporation method.
2.4 Characterization
The structure of the resulting thin films was characterized by using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer under nickel-filtered Cu-Kα radiation, 40 kV, 40 mA, and a scanning step of 0.02° per second. SEM images were recorded using a Zeiss EVO LS-15 scanning electron microscope. The Raman spectrum was studied by a Renishaw Invia Reflex Micro-Raman Spectroscopy System using a 532 nm line laser as the excitation source. Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out by CHI660E. As reported,19 a transient photovoltage (TPV) curve was recorded by using a 500 MHz digital oscilloscope (TDS 3054C, Tektronix) and excited with a third-harmonic Nd:YAG laser (Quantel Brilliant Eazy: BRILEZ/IR-10). The photovoltaic performance of the final solar cell device was tested by using a Newport solar simulator with 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G irradiation, and the light intensity was calibrated by a standard silicon solar cell.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Preparation of a pyramidally patterned monocrystalline silicon surface
In order to enhance the surface area of a monocrystalline silicon wafer so as to construct a quasi-bulk-heterojunction and improve the chemical stability and mechanical stability of the heterojunction films, we pretreated the virgin Si surface with a potassium hydroxide/isopropyl alcohol solution and a dilute HF solution. At the same time, the pretreatment did not change the orientation of the Si crystalline structure, as both the virgin and pretreated Si surfaces had a highly oriented surface (400).
The corresponding SEM images in Fig. 1 clearly show pyramidally patterned arrays of the pretreated silicon surface (treated in a mixed solution of 3.0% w/w and 4.0% w/w KOH, respectively). Both the treatments resulted in a unique pyramidal structure with different pyramidal Si crystal sizes. We can clearly see that the Si surface treated with 4.0% w/w KOH resulted in larger Si pyramidal crystals but a relatively sparse surface structure than that treated with a 3.0% w/w KOH mixed solution. The difference in size and density of the pyramidal Si crystals is attributed to the effect of alkaline concentration on the anisotropic silicon. Higher corrosion intensity may produce pyramidally patterned Si with larger size and less density. The concentration of KOH mixed solution plays a key role in constructing the patterned pyramidal Si structure. When the concentration of KOH mixed solution was less than 3.0% w/w, the preferred pyramidal structures could not be obtained, while higher concentrations may lead to a sparse surface structure. We have found that 3.0% w/w KOH and an etching time of 40 minute are the optimal conditions for constructing the ideal pyramidal Si structure.

3.2 
          In situ iodination to form CuI/Si quasi-bulk-heterojunction thin films at room temperature
Elemental Cu was deposited on the above pretreated rough surface of pyramidally patterned monocrystalline silicon, which facilitates and improves the contact of Si/Cu interfaces. The reaction of the above Cu deposition layers with iodine vapors at room temperature yields the γ-CuI nanoparticle layer in situ. The corresponding XRD patterns of the CuI thin film transformed from 200 nm Cu (denoted as CuI/Si-200) is shown in Fig. 2a. The diffraction peaks of (111), (200), (220), and (311) correspond to the literature values of the CuI crystal face (PDF No. 75-831). The relatively sharp peaks suggest an expected high crystallinity in the CuI crystal. We can clearly see that the (111) face is predominant and there are no other noticeable peaks except for those from the Si substrate, indicating the high purity and preferential (111) growth of the obtained CuI crystal. For the 100 nm Cu transformed CuI sample (denoted as CuI/Si-100), there are no obvious changes in XRD except for the relative decrease of the CuI signal due to the thinner CuI film formation (ESI Fig. S2†). Fig. 2b displays the Raman spectra of the CuI/Si-200 sample with a relatively strong transverse-optic (TO) and weak longitudinal-optic (LO) model of CuI. The TO model was recorded at about 123 cm−1, which further confirmed that the in situ synthesized crystal thin films are γ-CuI with high purity.20

Fig. 3 shows the corresponding SEM and TEM images of the resulting CuI/Si samples. Based on the current gas–solid phase direct elemental reaction (DER) strategy, pyramidally patterned CuI/Si heterojunction films with a large area can be obtained. Fig. 3a shows the SEM image of a uniform pyramidal CuI/Si-200 surface fully coated with CuI nanoparticles. The cross-section SEM image of the CuI/Si-200 sample, which exhibited a dense CuI layer with about 200 nm in thickness, nearly the size of an individual CuI crystal, is shown in Fig. 3b. Fig. 3c and 3d show the enlarged SEM surface morphologies of both CuI/Si-100 and CuI/Si-200 samples with uniformly coated CuI nano-particles on the pyramidal Si crystal surface, which may provide a larger interface area for construction of a CuI/Si quasi-bulk-heterojunction structure. The surface thickness and roughness of the CuI/Si bulk heterojunction films can be easily controlled by adjusting the thickness of the initial elemental copper layer, in our strategy. A thicker copper layer may result in a relatively thicker and rougher pyramidal surface. The CuI particles were peeled off from the Si wafer by ultrasonic treatment and the corresponding TEM image is shown in Fig. 3e. From the HRTEM images (Fig. 3f) we can see the well-resolved 2D lattice fringes of the CuI particle clearly. The lattice spacing of 0.348 nm and 0.301 nm corresponds to the (111) and (200) planes of the cubic γ-CuI, respectively. The lattice spacing demonstrates that our current gas–solid phase direct elemental reaction (DER) strategy can result in a well crystallized CuI thin film at room temperature.

3.3 Diffuse reflection of different CuI/Si heterojunction films
The reflectance is an important parameter for photovoltaic applications because it reflects the light absorption ability of the semiconductor films. The diffuse reflectance data of the CuI/Si samples with different CuI thicknesses were collected and the corresponding reflectance curves are shown in Fig. 4. Apparently, the corresponding average reflectance only increased slightly along with the increase of the CuI film thickness, indicating that the CuI film thickness just slightly influences the light absorption in a reasonable thickness range. As comparison, the CuI/plane Si sample (without the pretreated pyramidal feature) was prepared and exhibited a significantly increased reflectance. This phenomenon definitely demonstrated the efficiently antireflective effect induced by the pretreated pyramidal Si surface.

3.4 Photovoltaic performance of the CuI/Si quasi-bulk-heterojunction thin films

3.4.1 Photoelectrochemical measurements. 
For understanding the performance of p-CuI/n-Si heterojunction thin films, photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out under chopped light (a 300 W Xe lamp) in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution. Fig. 5a shows the current–time (I–t) curves for each of the following samples: untreated n-Si, CuI/Si-100, and CuI/Si-200. The photocurrent density of the CuI/Si-100 sample increased relative to the bare n-Si sample, and the CuI/Si-200 sample had an even greater photocurrent density with a value of nearly 0.9 mA cm−2. Open circuit potential (OCP) was studied with chopped light (as shown in Fig. 5b). The corresponding I–V curves of both CuI/Si-100 and CuI/Si-200 samples showed significant differences of open circuit potentials (about 0.18 V and 0.3 V) under dark and light conditions. Such differences may be induced by the higher interface electric field between the p-CuI and n-Si in the CuI/Si-200 sample. The results indicate that p-CuI of a suitable thickness coated on the n-type Si surface will improve the performance of the p-CuI/n-Si heterojunction film.

I–t curves recorded at 0 V vs. SCE (a) and V–t curves of the thin films in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution vs. SCE (b) under a 300 W Xe lamp. 
The photocurrent and photovoltage enhancement in CuI/Si-200 was further studied by the photocurrent-potential method with chopped light in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution. The charge separation efficiency can be well illustrated from onset potential and photocurrent intensity variation. The onset potential can be defined as the photocurrent where the signal changes from negative to positive.21 The photovoltage generated after irradiation was defined as ΔV, and ΔV = ΔVsur − ΔVint, where ΔVsur is the photovoltage of the surface and − ΔVint is the photovoltage of the interface. The negative sign indicates opposing directions of the surface and interface potentials.22 As shown in (Figure Fig. 6, the onset potential was about −0.5 V in CuI/Si-200 and −0.25 V in CuI/Si-100. Considering that there are no considerable morphological differences in the surface of CuI/Si-200 and CuI/Si-100 samples (see Fig. 3c and 3d), the ΔVsur of each of the two samples can be disregarded, thus the variation of the onset potentials of CuI/Si-200 and CuI/Si-100 are dictated by their respective interface electric fields.22 Under illumination, the charge carriers are generated in n-Si and separated by the interface electric field, and photoinduced holes transfer to the CuI layer. As reported, the large magnitude of interface electric field intensity results in a negative shift of the photocurrent.23 The −0.25 V onset potential shift between CuI/Si-200 and CuI/Si-100 samples indicates a stronger p-CuI and n-Si interface electric field for CuI/Si-200. Therefore, we believe that the intensity of the interface electric field can be tuned by controlling the thickness of the CuI thin film in the CuI/Si structures.


3.4.2 Transient photovoltaic (TPV) study. 
For further understanding the behaviour of the p-CuI/n-Si quasi-bulk-heterojunction thin films, transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements were carried out. Fig. 7 shows the TPV curves of the CuI/Si-100 and CuI/Si-200 samples with top electrode illumination. The light passed through the CuI layer was mainly absorbed by the n-Si layer due to the limitation of the band gap. Consequently, the photo generated carriers were separated at the p–n junction of the CuI/Si interface, while photoinduced holes were transferred to the CuI layer (irradiation side) and led to a positive signal during the response range. The intensity of the photovoltage of CuI/Si-100 was higher than CuI/Si-200 due to the amount of the separated charges in space.24,25 However, the decay of the surface photovoltage intensity of the CuI/Si-200 sample was significantly slower than that of the CuI/Si-100 sample, indicating that the carrier life time in the CuI/Si-200 sample was prolonged. This observation is in accordance with the large magnitude of the interfacial electric field and efficient charge separation as shown in Fig. 6.

3.4.3 Device fabrication. 
Energy bands play a critical role in carrier transportation. High energy barriers will limit the electron or hole transport. For improving hole transportation from CuI to the electrode, PEDOT:PSS was used as the interface modification material to match the energy band gap. Fig. 8a shows the SEM image of the Si/CuI/PEDOT:PSS active layer and a schematic picture of the assembled solar cell device (inset). As we expected, the CuI surface was fully covered by PEDOT:PSS not only on the pyramidal crystal surface but also in the gap between them.
 Fig. 8  SEM images of Si/CuI/PEDOT:PSS bulk heterojunction thin film (a) and the corresponding energy level (b). The insert is the schematic picture of the Si/CuI/PEDOT:PSS bulk heterojunction solar cell device. 
The corresponding energy level is plotted in Fig. 8b according to the literature.26 In such devices CuI is a p-type semiconductor and the photo-generated hole carriers transfer the positive charges in this layer. The difference of the energy level between CuI and Ag is relatively large, resulting in a barrier to the hole transport process. The work function of PEDOT:PSS is between −4.8 eV and −5.2 eV. Although the separated holes can be collected by the Ag electrode, due to this interlayer the photo-generated holes pass through a relatively low barrier to the Ag electrode. The resulting photovoltaic region has an active area of 0.2 cm2 (defined by the silver electrode area). For investigating the performance of such quasi-bulk-heterojunction thin film solar cells, we further conducted preliminarily measurements on the resulting Si/CuI/PEDOT:PSS solar cell device under a sunlight simulator with AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) (see Fig. S3 in ESI†). We preliminarily obtained a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 3.36 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.33 V, a fill factor (FF) of 19.12%, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.32% using an un-optimized sample. It is expected that the PCE of the CuI/Si solar cell device which was fabricated at room temperature may be improved by decreasing the n-Si thickness and optimizing the CuI/Si interface.

4. Conclusions
We have developed a facile room temperature iodination approach for in situ fabrication of monocrystalline CuI/Si quasi-bulk-heterojunction thin films by firstly depositing an elemental copper layer on the pretreated monocrystalline silicon surface followed by a direct elemental reaction with iodine vapours. We demonstrated that the pretreated silicon exhibits a pyramidally patterned surface which facilitates the construction of quasi-bulk-heterojunction thin films and enhances the surface roughness, chemical stability, and mechanical stability of the resulting heterojunction films. The infiltrated elemental copper layer can be well controlled and completely transformed into a crystallized CuI thin film for in situ construction of a CuI/Si quasi-bulk-heterojunction at room temperature. The thickness of the upper CuI layer can be controlled by simply controlling the initial elemental Cu layer. The photoelectrochemical and transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements determined that the intensity of the interface electric field as well as the open circuit potential can be adjusted by tuning the amount of CuI coated on the pyramidally patterned n-Si substrate. We assembled a solar cell device with CuI/Si as the active layer and preliminarily checked the photovoltaic performance of an un-optimized solar cell device. Significantly, the direct elemental reaction route reported here can be extended to construct other p-CuI based heterojunction thin films for industrial photovoltaic applications.
