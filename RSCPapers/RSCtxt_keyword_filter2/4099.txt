    , Accepted 26th September 2016First published on 27th September 2016AbstractInterfacial engineering of polymer solar cells is regarded as an effective method to enhance the photovoltaic performance of polymer solar cells. In light of this, we prepared a novel organic–inorganic hybrid electron transport layer (ETL) composed of polyethyleneimine ethoxylate and a lithium quinolate complex, and investigated its effect on device performance. The properties of the hybrid ETL that are favorable for solar cell applications include solution processability, high optical transparency, smooth film morphology and work function tunability, which resulted in improved charge generation and suppressed charge recombination. Devices employing the hybrid ETL generated a promising power conversion efficiency of 10.10% with high ambient stability. Furthermore, the hybrid ETL showed good mechanical properties with high reproducibility at a large active area. Thus, the hybrid ETL is a promising candidate ETL for high performance polymer solar cells.
Introduction
In the past decade, the performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs) has been improved by the development of novel materials, optimized device architecture and optimized device fabrication conditions, which have produced power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 10%.1–6 In spite of the rapid progress of PCEs, the device performance and stability of the PSCs should be further enhanced for their practical applications, such as flexible solar cells and building integrated photovoltaics. In this regard, interfacial engineering not only reduces the energetic barrier between the active layer and the electrodes, but also increases the selectivity of single charge carriers to the corresponding electrode and is critical for improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs.7–10 An ideal interfacial layer should include the following prerequisites: (i) it should be easy to process at low temperatures, (ii) it should possess high optical transparency, (iii) the work function (WF) of the metal electrode should be tuned for maximum built-in potential and (iv) the energy levels between the active layer and electrodes should match to afford efficient charge transport/blocking minority carrier flow.
Recently, considerable effort has been devoted to the development of electron transport layers (ETLs).11 The ETL plays a very important role in the device with regard to energy level alignment and passivation of charge trap sites. It facilitates electron extraction and hole blocking at the interface of the cathode/active layer, resulting in efficient electron collection at the cathode.12 In the search for ETL candidates, organic-based interfacial materials have attracted a great deal of research attention.13 In particular, polymer-based interfacial materials provide opportunities to fabricate a thin interfacial layer via facile solution processing at low temperatures. Conjugated polymer-based electrolytes, which are based on a conjugated backbone and polar side chains that ensure high conductivity and good water/alcohol solubility, respectively, have been successfully applied as ETLs, leading to an improved PCE of the PSCs.14,15 However, the conjugated polymer electrolytes usually require synthetic sequences of 5–10 steps to produce high purity materials, which ultimately increases the cost of the resulting devices. In recent years, non-conjugated polymers (e.g., polyethyleneimine ethoxylate (PEIE)) have drawn a great deal of attention to be utilized as surface modifiers of the electrode.16,17 Strong dipoles of the modifiers, which arise from amine groups, can shift the vacuum level and change the WF of the cathode, thus reducing the electron injection energy barrier. Furthermore, their facile solution processability with orthogonal solubility with common active layer materials indicates the potential for low-cost-processing device fabrication. Nevertheless, their intrinsically insulating nature is still a problem and may limit efficient charge transport across the ETL to the cathode.
Inorganic semiconductors have also been applied as ETLs for PSCs, owing to their excellent electron mobility, high light transparency and hole blocking capability.18–20 However, high processing temperature and intrinsic trap sites of the inorganic semiconductors limit their use in large and flexible device applications. Alternatively, the solution-processed alkaline metal complex, such as the lithium quinolate complex (LiQ), is another interesting class, which has been utilized as an ETL for optoelectronic applications. LiQ is one of the most widely used alkaline metal complexes for organic light-emitting diodes as an electron-injection material due to its good solubility in polar solvents and strong metal-induced dipole moments, which reduce the electron injection/extraction barrier.21 Recently, a bilayer ETL made of LiQ and bathocuproine (BCP) was used in PSCs.22 Kim et al. also reported improved PCE of PSCs by co-evaporation of LiQ with tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum (AlQ3) as the ETL.23 However, there are few reports regarding solution-processed LiQ due to the strong tendency of the metal complex to self-aggregate. Liu et al. recently reported polymer solar cells that use solution-processed LiQ as the ETL, and these cells achieved a high PCE of up to 9.04%.24 However, solution-processed LiQ also suffers from unfavorable island-like aggregations, which may induce charge recombination, suggesting that the improved film morphology of the solution-processed LiQ is crucial to enhance the device performance of PSCs.
In this work, we demonstrate a hybrid ETL comprised of PEIE and LiQ that is used to fabricate high performance PSCs. Owing to the high polarity of PEIE and LiQ, the hybrid ETL could be prepared via low-temperature solution processing. The hybrid ETL exhibited high optical transparency as well as the capability of electrode WF tuning and smooth film morphology, which are all suitable features of ETLs necessary to attain high PCE of PSCs. Moreover, the optimal optoelectronic properties of the hybrid ETL effectively eliminated bimolecular charge recombination loss in the device, which led to the PCE exceeding 10%. More interestingly, the device with the hybrid ETL exhibited high ambient stability, good bending durability and high reproducibility suggesting that the hybrid ETL based on PEIE and LiQ is a promising candidate to serve as the ETL for practical device applications.
Experimental section
Preparation of materials
PBETT-FTTE and PC71BM were purchased from 1-Material. PEIE (branched, Mw ∼ 25000), LiOH (reagent grade, 98%) and 8-hydroxyquinoline were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. LiQ was synthesized from the dehydration reaction.25 A mixture of LiOH (0.316 g, 13.2 mmol) and 8-hydroxyquinoline (1.916 g, 13.2 mmol) in dry dichloromethane (40 mL) was stirred at room temperature under an N2 atmosphere under dark conditions. After stirring for 24 h, the precipitate was separated by filtration and washed several times with dry dichloromethane. The final solid product was dried to yield pure LiQ as a white solid (1.85 g, Y > 98%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO) δ (ppm) 6.75 (d, 1H), 6.90 (d, 1H), 7.28 (t, 1H), 7.38 (dd, 1H), 8.15 (d, 1H), and 8.60 (d, 1H).
Fabrication of devices
The solar cell devices were fabricated with an inverted architecture: ITO/ETL/PBDTT-FTTE:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag. The ITO-coated glass (10 Ω □−1) or ITO-coated PET substrates (ca. 50 Ω □−1) were cleaned by ultrasonication in detergent water, followed by acetone and isopropanol. After drying with nitrogen gas, the glass was treated with ultraviolet-ozone for 15 min. Then, ETLs were formed by spin coating the precursor solution (0.5 wt% for PEIE and 0.1 wt% for LiQ in 2-methoxyethanol). For PEIE:LiQ, a mixture of 9:1 in a volume of PEIE and LiQ solution was used for spin coating. After the substrates were thermally annealed at 80 °C for 10 min, the blended solution of PBDTT-FTTE (12 mg) and PC71BM (18 mg) in o-dichlorobenzene (1 mL) with 3 vol% of 1,8-diiodooctane was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 120 s. To complete device fabrication, MoO3 and Ag were subsequently evaporated to be 8 nm and 100 nm thickness, respectively. Different active areas (from 3.14 to 16.00 mm2) were defined using various shadow masks.
Characterization
The transmittance of the ETL was measured with a Lambda 25 (Perkin Elmer) spectrometer. The film morphology of the ETLs was observed using an atomic force microscope (Park Systems) in tapping mode. The electrical conductivity of the ETL was measured in a thin film device with a device structure of ITO/ETL/Ca/Al. The J–V curves were recorded in air using a 2400-SCS (Keithley) semiconductor characterization system. The photovoltaic performance was measured under a nitrogen atmosphere inside a glovebox. The J–V curves were obtained using a 4200-SCS (Keithley) under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination, which was calibrated using a NREL-certified photodiode. The incident photon-to-current density efficiency was measured in a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR830) system which records the short-circuit current density under chopped monochromatic light. The bending test of the flexible device was performed using in-house measurement settings with a curvature radius of approximately 5 nm. In order to measure the ambient stability of the device performance, the devices were kept under ambient conditions (RH ∼ 40%, 23 °C) in complete darkness.
Results and discussion
The chemical structures of the materials used as the ETL and the active layer in the PSC are shown in Fig. 1a. Due to the polar nature, thin layers of LiQ, PEIE and the hybrid ETL (mixture of LiQ and PEIE, denoted hereafter as PEIE–LiQ) base were easily fabricated from polar solvents (e.g., water, methanol or 2-methoxyethanol). Taking into consideration that light passes through the ETL in PSCs with an inverted architecture, high optical transparency is crucial to achieve a high PCE of the PSCs. The transmittance spectra of PEIE, LiQ, and the hybrid ETL on the ITO-coated glass substrate are presented in Fig. 1b. Because the PEIE and LiQ possess very low absorptivity in the UV-Vis-NIR range, the PEIE–LiQ layer also exhibits high transmittance (>90%) in the entire UV-Vis-NIR range. The high optical transparency in the UV-Vis-NIR range is essential for the ETL to avoid the parasitic absorption of the ETL and thereby maximize the light absorption of the conjugated polymers in the active layer of PSCs. Another important parameter of the ETL for high performance PSCs is electrical conductivity because the increased conductivity of the ETL reduces series resistance in the device. The electrical conductivities of the ETLs used in this work were investigated by two-probe measurements (Table S1†). Interestingly, the electrical conductivity was significantly improved by adding a very small amount of LiQ (ca. 2 wt%) to the PEIE which is an insulator. The electrical conductivity of the PEIE–LiQ would be mainly attributed to the low binding energy of the Li ion with 8-hydroxyquinoline; hence the mobile Li ions improve the electrical conductivity of the PEIE–LiQ layer.

The work function variation of the ITO glass substrate after being coated with different ETLs was investigated using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) because the electronic properties of the ETLs have great influence on the device performance. As shown in Fig. 2a, the WF of pristine ITO (4.80 eV) decreased to 4.41 eV and 3.43 eV for PEIE/ITO and LiQ/ITO, respectively, indicating that the intrinsic dipole of the ETL significantly reduces the work function of the cathode.26 For PEIE, a large amount of amine is likely to anchor at the ITO surface (statistic interaction between N+ from amine and O2− on the ITO surface), while electron transfer from Li to the quinolone molecule of LiQ generates a strong interfacial dipole.27 However, by taking the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the PC71BM (−3.9 to 4.0 eV) into consideration, both the work functions of PEIE and LiQ may not be ideally matched with that of the PC71BM.28 Alternatively, PEIE–LiQ/ITO (3.88 eV) allows much better energy level alignment to PC71BM and thus minimizes the energy barrier between the active layer and cathode (Fig. 2b).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was used to understand the electronic interactions of PEIE and LiQ. The XPS spectra of the N1s peak for different ETLs are shown in Fig. 2c. Because the N1s peak at around 400 eV is mainly attributed to the amines of PEIE, which corresponds to protonated (401 eV) and non-protonated (399.5 eV) amines, a slight peak shift (∼1.1 eV) of the PEIE–LiQ beyond that of the pristine PEIE indicates a change in the electronic state of the PEIE after mixing with LiQ. Compared to PEIE ([N+]/[N] ratio ∼ 0.187), PEIE–LiQ ([N+]/[N] ratio ∼ 0.751) exhibited the presence of much more protonated amines, which reveals the interaction between Li and PEIE. Although the exact electronic mechanism for the interaction between LiQ and PEIE is not fully understood, amine groups of PEIE control the excessive dipole alignment of LiQ at the interface of the cathode/ETL, which is coincidental with the moderate work function change of PEIE–LiQ than other ETLs, as discussed above.
The film morphologies of the ETLs on an ITO-coated glass substrate were studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 3). The surface morphology of LiQ/ITO shows a very rough surface with several nanoparticle-like domains (Rq = 4.45 nm), which may represent the aggregation of LiQ. In contrast, the surface morphologies of PEIE/ITO (Rq = 0.47 nm) and PEIE–LiQ/ITO (Rq = 0.71 nm) show a very smooth and homogenous surface, which fully fills the voids of the underlying ITO substrate. Based on the AFM observations, we inferred that the PEIE matrix effectively impedes the aggregation of LiQ, which induces homogeneous mixing of the PEIE–LiQ blend. The poor morphology of the interfacial layer (e.g., grain boundaries and aggregates) may induce bimolecular charge recombination, limiting the photocurrent generation of the device. Furthermore, the rough surface of the substrate cannot provide a robust platform for the active layer of PSCs. Thus, the fine film morphology of PEIE–LiQ would be beneficial for efficient charge transport and for high performance PSCs.

The influence of ETLs on photovoltaic performance was investigated with an inverted device architecture (ITO/ETL/PBDTT-FTTE:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag). The J–V curves under simulated AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) of the devices are shown in Fig. 4a and the relevant device parameters are summarized in Table 1. PSCs without any ETL exhibited an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.54 V, a short circuit current density (JSC) of 7.63 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.39 and a PCE of 1.52%. In comparison, after the ETLs were used, the devices showed significantly improved PCEs. The device with PEIE as the ETL exhibited a maximum PCE of 8.69% (VOC of 0.80 V, JSC of 16.21 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.67), while the LiQ-based device exhibited a maximum PCE of 7.64% (VOC of 0.82 V, JSC of 14.56 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.64). The increased VOC of the LiQ-based device can be attributed to the increased built-in potential (see Fig. 2a) as compared with the PEIE-based device. However, the strong dipole of LiQ also provides a considerable energy barrier between ITO and PCBM, which impedes efficient electron collection at the ITO. The poor morphology of LiQ/ITO would also be a cause of the inferiority of JSC and FF compared to the PEIE-based device. When the PEIE–LiQ was used as the ETL, PSCs achieved the highest PCE of 10.10% (VOC of 0.81 V, JSC of 17.25 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.71), which is improved over devices with PEIE and LiQ by 16% and 32%, respectively. The improved JSC and FF of the device based on PEIE–LiQ could be attributed to the affirmative WF change which is well matched with both ITO and PC71BM, unlike other ETLs. In addition, the smooth, defect-free morphology of the films may also suppress charge recombination at the ETL. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of the devices with different ETLs were measured under monochromatic light (Fig. 4b). The integrated JSC values obtained from the IPCE spectra were 16.10, 14.62 and 17.38 mA cm−2, for the devices with PEIE, LiQ, and PEIE–LiQ as ETLs, respectively, which are consistent with the JSC values measured in the J–V curves. Notably, the devices with PEIE–LiQ exhibit superior photocurrent generation over the entire wavelength range, indicating that PEIE–LiQ allows efficient charge transport and extraction of the devices.

In order to evaluate the effect of the ETL thickness on PCE, a series of PEIE–LiQ films with varied thicknesses was fabricated on ITO in the devices. The J–V curves of the devices are presented in Fig. S1† and their corresponding parameters are summarized in Table S2.† Although the best PCE was obtained with a PEIE–LiQ thickness of 1.2 nm, the devices with a thickness less than 5 nm showed steady device performance >9.5% PCE. This is due to electrically conductive nature of PEIE–LiQ, which allows efficient charge transport in devices with a relatively thick PEIE–LiQ. However, as the PEIE–LiQ thickness exceeds 5 nm, the PCE drops significantly to less than 8%. Thus, the optimum condition of PEIE–LiQ for the ETL layer in PSCs is less than 5 nm.
To verify the charge extraction properties of the ETLs, the differences in the photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) of the devices were analyzed, as shown in Fig. 5a (Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and under dark conditions, respectively, and Veff = V0 − V where V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0 and V is the applied bias).29,30 For all devices, Jph became saturated as Veff exceeded 1 V, which suggested that almost all the photogenerated excitons were readily dissociated into free carriers. With the assumption that all the photogenerated excitons are readily dissociated at high Veff, the maximum generation rate of the bound exciton pairs per unit volume (Gmax) of the PSCs can be calculated using the equation, Jsat = qLGmax, where Jsat is the saturation photocurrent density, q is the electronic charge and L is the thickness of the BHJ active layer of the device. The Gmax values for the devices were 9.47 × 1027, 8.26 × 1027 and 9.52 × 1027 m−3 s−1 for PEIE, LiQ, and PEIE–LiQ as the ETL, respectively. Because Gmax is mainly related to the absorption of incident photons in the active layer, higher Gmax values for the devices with PEIE and PEIE–LiQ than the LiQ-based one suggested that better light transparency of ETL afforded more photon absorption of the active layer, resulting in enhanced exciton generation.31 In addition, in the low Veff region, Jph of the device with PEIE–LiQ was higher than that with PEIE. This result indicated that even at a low internal electric field, the charge transport/extraction efficacy for the device with PEIE–LiQ was still better than that for PEIE or LiQ-based devices.
 Fig. 5  (a) Jph–Veff curves and (b) JSC dependence on light intensity for devices employing different ETLs. 
It is noteworthy that amine groups of PEIE could act as effective N-doping agents for organic semiconductors (e.g., conjugated polymer, PCBM or carbon nanotubes).32 Hence, the N-doping effect would induce improved charge injection into PCBM, leading to improved device performance. Although the efficacy of the N-doping effect of PEIE–LiQ is not fully understood yet, it would be worth to further investigate the exact mechanisms.
We further evaluated the effect of different ETLs on the charge recombination kinetics by investigating the light intensity dependence of the Jph of the devices. It has been reported that the correlation of JSC with the illumination intensity (I) can be expressed by JSC ∝ Iα where α is close to unity, which is indicative of negligible bimolecular recombination (all the charge carriers sweep out). In contrast, the unbalanced electron/hole transport and thus charge carrier accumulation inside the devices lead to α = 0.75.33Fig. 5b clearly shows different behaviors of light intensity dependence as ETLs were changed. The device without the ETL exhibited the lowest dependency (α = 0.86), while the device employing PEIE–LIQ as the ETL showed the highest α value (0.97 for PEIE, 0.97 for LiQ and 0.99 for PEIE–LiQ). This result confirms the efficacy of PEIE–LiQ as the ETL for suppressed bimolecular recombination. As a result, the reduced charge accumulation and bimolecular recombination loss effectively increased the JSC and FF of the device with PEIE–LiQ, achieving a high PCE exceeding 10%.
Based on the aforementioned advantages, the potential of PEIE–LiQ for broader device applications was further evaluated. To investigate its viability for high throughput and flexible optoelectronic applications, PSCs were fabricated on a plastic substrate. As can be seen in Fig. 6a and b, the flexible devices exhibited a maximum PCE of 9.70% which is a competitive efficiency to that of the control devices on a rigid glass substrate (Table 2). In particular, the VOC and JSC for the flexible device were comparable to those of the devices on glass, which revealed excellent light transparency as well as superior electron extraction ability of the PEIE–LiQ, irrespective of the substrate. The slightly decreased FF of the flexible device may be attributed to the increased sheet resistance of the ITO on the plastic substrate compared to that for the glass substrate.

The device stability under an ambient atmosphere is another critical issue for practical applications of PSCs. To quantitatively examine the ambient stability, devices with different ETLs were kept under ambient conditions (∼30% relative humidity) in the dark for up to 300 h and subjected to J–V measurements. As shown in Fig. 6c, the device employing PEIE–LiQ exhibits good stability upon exposure to ambient conditions, retaining over 85% of its initial PCE. A multiple-cycle bending test of the flexible device was also performed to assess the mechanical properties of PEIE–LiQ (Fig. 6d). After 100 bending cycles, the device still held >80% of its initial PCE, demonstrating the robustness of PEIE–LiQ, which is crucial for flexible optoelectronic applications. In addition, devices with different active areas (from 0.03 to 0.16 cm2) were fabricated to investigate the reliability of the PEIE–LiQ as the ETL for high performance PSCs. As seen in Fig. S2 and Table S3,† a high PCE over 9.6% was sustained even at 16 mm2, which suggests the high reproducibility of the PEIE–LiQ on large area devices.
Conclusions
A new class of hybrid ETL materials, PEIE–LiQ, has been developed for application in PSCs. The PEIE–LiQ possessed high optical transparency, an appropriate WF and smooth film morphology, which afforded high photovoltage and photocurrent generation as well as reduced bimolecular charge recombination loss in the device. The device employing PEIE–LiQ achieved a high PCE of 10.10%, which was significantly improved over that of the device with PEIE (8.80%) or LiQ (7.45%). In addition, the device with PEIE–LiQ exhibited high ambient stability, good bending durability and high reproducibility, demonstrating the potential of PEIE–LiQ to serve as a high performance ETL for efficient PSCs. Furthermore, this study suggests that the hybrid ETL could be an interesting material class for high performance optoelectronic applications.
