    , Accepted 23rd August 2015First published on 25th August 2015AbstractA series of new conjugated polymers (P1–P3) with 3,6-difluorocarbazole as a donor unit and benzoxadiazole as an acceptor unit were synthesized and used as donor materials for polymer solar cells (PSCs). The morphology of blend films was regulated by controlling the drying process via tuning the solubility of polymers and using solvent additives. Enhancing the solubility of polymers via increasing the volume of side chains can decrease the domain size of polymers and using 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a solvent additive can give an even better vertical phase separation, leading to a significant enhancement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 5.71% for P3 based PSCs. The improving of the interface between polymers and PC71BM phases as well as the formation of vertical phase separation after using DIO as an additive are probably responsible for the high open circuit voltage (Voc) of devices.
Introduction
In the last two decades, bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJ PSCs) with conjugated polymers as donors and PC71BM as an acceptor have attracted particular attention because of their advantages of lightweight, low-cost and mechanical flexibility.1–3 Significant progress has been made in recent years and power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 10% has been achieved.4–8 These accomplishments were mostly driven by the design and synthesis of newly conjugated polymer materials, the optimization of devices and the investigation of the relationship between the chemical structure of polymers and the photovoltaic performance of devices.
Development of effective methods to tune the morphology of the BHJ layer is a significant task to improve device performance9 and the solubility of polymers is very important to afford appropriate phase separation when blending with PC71BM.10 The morphology of the active layer is significantly influenced by the solubility of conjugated polymers. Generally, bad solubility of polymers usually causes oversized domains while evaporating from the solution which goes against the effective dissociation of the exciton. But good solubility, which comes from longer chains, usually affects the stacking of polymers as films. Therefore, using appropriate side chains to balance the solubility and planarity of conjugated polymers is beneficial to achieve best photovoltaic performance. Active layers with an appropriate vertical phase separation are beneficial to afford high performance of PSCs.11 Conventional devices with a polymer rich bottom surface could enhance the collection of holes by the anode and suppress the bulk and interfacial bimolecular charge recombination. Such vertical phase separation of active layers could be optimized by adding DIO as an additive.12
Fluorine has been proved to be a good substituendum for acceptor groups of donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating polymers, the introduction of F atoms onto acceptor unit could significantly improve the photovoltaic performance of polymers,13,14 but the introduction of F atoms onto donor positions may result in a different influence on the photovoltaic performance.15,16 Since F atoms exhibit greatly positive effects in the improvement of the photovoltaic performance, extending the study of D–A conjugated polymers with a fluorinated donor unit is still of great significance to achieve higher efficiency photovoltaic polymers. Benzoxadiazole (BO) has been proved to be a good acceptor unit for the construction of D–A conjugated polymers used for PSCs.17 Compared with the commonly used benzothiadiazole (BT) acceptor unit, BO could furnish deeper HOMO level for the resulted polymers. However, due to the high polarity of O atoms and the high planarity of the BO part, BO based polymers exhibited poor solubility.18 By changing the side chains of conjugated backbones, P1, P2 and P3 with fluorinated carbazole as a donor unit, BO as an acceptor unit, and thiophene as a π bridge were synthesized in this work. All three polymers exhibited worse solubility compared with PC71BM, which would lead to a liquid–solid mechanism in the film drying procedure.19 But too bad solubility would cause oversized domains in the process of film drying. By gradually extending the side chains for P1, P2 and P3, better solubility and higher hole mobility could be achieved, besides that the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of the film surface and series resistance values of devices all gradually reduced, which would lead to a higher PCE. XPS experiment demonstrated that P1–3 were all donor rich in the bottom surface, which is beneficial for the hole injection by the electrode. Using DIO as an additive, the fluorescence intensity of polymers was decreased, indicating that the domain size of polymers became smaller. Besides that, hole mobility values of devices were further enhanced, series resistor values of the devices were further reduced, and the RMS roughness values of the active layers were decreased, which demonstrated that DIO could optimize the film morphology. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiment also demonstrated that the contents of P1–3 in the bottom surface were all enhanced with DIO as an additive, which would lead to better photovoltaic performance. Compared with the non-fluorinated polymer, fluorinated polymers exhibited lower HOMO levels, and open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc) and the fill factor (FF) were all improved to achieve higher PCE. Using 2% DIO as an additive, photovoltaic devices based on P3 showed the best PCE of 5.71%.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
The syntheses of monomers (3a, 3b) and polymers (P1, P2, and P3) are outlined in Scheme 1. 2,7-Dibromo-3,6-difluoro-9H-carbazole(1),20 2,7-dibromo-3,6-difluoro-9-(2-hexyldecyl)-9H-carbazole (2a),20 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-dioctylbenzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazole (4a),21 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-didodecylbenzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazole (4b),21 and 3,6-difluoro-9-(2-hexyldecyl)-2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9H-carbazole (3a)20 were synthesized according to the literature procedures. 2b was prepared in a yield of 82% by the reaction of compound 1 and 11-(bromomethyl)tricosane in DMF with NaH as a base. The reaction of 2b and bis(pinacolato)diboron by Miyaura reaction using PdCl2(dppf) as a catalyst afforded 3b in a yield of 62%. Suzuki polycondensation (SPC) of the dibromo monomers (4a and 4b) with a diboronic acid ester monomer (3a) afforded polymers (P1 and P2) as dark-red solids in yields of 70% and 78%, respectively. SPC of 3b and 4b furnished P3 in a yield of 81% as a dark-red solid. SPCs were carried out in a biphasic mixture of THF/toluene (3:1) and aqueous NaHCO3 with Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst precursor. After polymerization, the bromo and boronic acid end-groups were capped by phenylboronic acid and bromobenzene, respectively. The side chains have a great influence on the solubility of polymers and the solubility of polymers can be tuned by changing their side chains. P1 carrying two octyloxy chains on the 5,6-positions of the benzothiadiazole unit and one 2-hexyldecyl chain on the 9-position of the 3,6-difluorocarbazole unit exhibited very poor solubility in chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB), and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) at room temperature. Nevertheless, P1 can be fully dissolved in DCB and TCB at temperature above 115 °C. P2, in which the two octyloxy chains on the 5,6-positions of the benzothiadiazole unit were changed to two dodecyloxy chains, exhibiting slightly better solubility than P1. P2 is also almost insoluble in common organic solvents such as CF, CB, DCB, and TCB at room temperature, but can be fully soluble in CB, DCB, and TCB at temperature above 105 °C. P3 with replacing the 2-hexyldecyl chain on the 9-position of 3,6-difluorocarbazole unit with 2-decyltetradecyl group showed further improved solubility in comparison with P2. P3 is partially soluble in DCB and TCB at room temperature and can be fully dissolved in CB, DCB, and TCB at temperature above 80 °C. The molecular weights and polydispersity indexes (PDI) of P1–3 measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 150 °C using TCB as an eluent and polystyrenes as the calibration standards are summarized in Table 1. Thermal stability of these polymers was investigated with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. P1, P2, and P3 exhibited good thermal stability with 5% weight loss at 327 °C, 323 °C, and 318 °C, respectively, and the results are also summarized in Table 1. No glass transition temperature can be detected for P1–3 by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in the range of 20 to 250 °C at a heating rate 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. To investigate the packing of polymer chains in the solid state, powdery samples of P1–3 were investigated by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. As shown in Fig. 1, P1 and P2 present a relatively intense diffraction peak in the small angle region and a broad peak in the wide angle region, reflecting the lamella stacking and π–π stacking of polymers, respectively. The small angles of 4.51° for P1 and 3.87° for P2 revealed that the stacking distances of polymer backbones separated by the flexible side chains are 19.58 Å for P1 and 22.81 Å for P2. The diffraction peaks at 20.8°, 20.6° and 20.4° reflex the π–π stacking distances between the polymer backbones, which are calculated to be 4.28 Å, 4.31 Å and 4.33 Å for P1, P2, and P3, respectively. XRD investigations indicated that the π–π packing distance between polymer backbones can be slightly tuned by the side chains (Chart 1).

Optical properties
UV-vis absorption characteristics of P1–3 in DCB (1 × 10−5 M) were investigated at an elevated temperature of 120 °C. As shown in Fig. 2a, all polymers exhibit three absorption peaks in the visible region. The peak located at around 386 nm can be attributed to the localized π–π* transition and the two peaks at a long wave length region can be ascribed to the internal charge transfer (ICT) interaction from the carbazole donor unit to the benzoxadiazole acceptor unit. The shoulder peak at about 573 nm can be attributed to the aggregation of polymer chains, and its intensity decreased slightly in the order of P1, P2 and P3 with the volume of side chains increasing gradually. UV-visible absorption spectra of P1–3 films spin coated on quartz substrates are shown in Fig. 2b. On going from solution to film, the long wave length absorption peak red-shifted from 572 to 582 nm for P1, from 573 to 577 nm for P2, and from 573 to 574 nm for P3. This result indicates that larger side chains can weaken the interaction of polymers in the solid state. The film absorption onsets of P1–3 are 632, 625, and 610 nm, corresponding to optical band gaps (Eg,opt) of 1.96, 2.00, and 2.03 eV, respectively. These data are also summarized in Table 2. In comparison with the non-fluorinated polymer P4, the long wave length absorption peaks of P1 and P2 became much stronger, indicating that the introduction of F atoms into the donor unit can significantly enhance the interaction of polymers in the solid state. To investigate the influence of DIO as an additive on the aggregation of P1–3 in the blend films, UV-visible absorption spectra of P1–3:PC71BM blend films with and without 2% DIO as an additive were also tested. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), all films exhibited a broad absorption in the range from 350 nm to 650 nm. After using 2% DIO as an additive, the intensity of the peaks at around 550 nm all significantly decreased, demonstrating that using DIO as an additive could reduce the aggregation of P1–3 in the blend film. To further investigate the influence of DIO as an additive on the charge recombination in the active layer, the fluorescence spectra of blend films also measured. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), after using 2% DIO as an additive, the blend films all exhibited higher fluorescence quenching efficiencies. The enhancement of fluorescence quenching efficiency demonstrated using DIO as an additive could optimize the blend morphology and reduce the charge recombination in the blend films, which would lead to higher Voc of devices.22–27

Electrochemical properties
Electrochemical properties of P1–3 films were investigated by cyclic voltammetry on a glassy carbon working electrode. As shown in Fig. 3, the onset oxidation potentials (Eox) of P1–3 are 0.84, 0.86 and 0.87 eV vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode. HOMO energy levels were determined according to the equation EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.71 eV) to be −5.55 eV for P1, −5.57 eV for P2, and −5.58 eV for P3. LUMO levels of P1, P2, and P3 were calculated by the equation ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg,opt to be −3.59, −3.57, and −3.55 eV, respectively. The complete data are summarized in Table 2. The results indicated that increasing the volume of side chains has a subtle influence on electrochemical properties of polymers. Compared with the non-fluorinated P4, the presence of two F atoms on the carbazole donor unit lowers the HOMO levels of P1–3 for about 0.2 eV. The fairly low-lying HOMO levels are beneficial to afford higher Voc for PSCs.

Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of P1–3 as donor materials, devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/P1–3:PC71BM/LiF (0.5 nm)/Al (100 nm) were fabricated. Detailed studies on the processing solvent, the weight ratio of P1–3 to PC71BM, the concentration of blend solution, the spin-coating speed, the thickness of active layers, and the amount of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive were carried out to optimize the device performance. Since the poor solubility of P1–3 in DCB at room temperature, all devices were fabricated by spin-coating blend solutions at elevated temperature. For all three polymers, the best plain devices were fabricated with a P1–3:PC71BM weight ratio of 1:3.5. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 4 and the device characteristics are summarized in Table 3. P1 based devices exhibited a PCE of 2.60% with a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 6.55 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.52. P2 based devices demonstrated a PCE of 3.71% with a Voc of 0.89, a Jsc of 6.80 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.61. P3:PC71BM based devices showed a PCE of 4.69% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 8.51 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.65. The results clearly demonstrated that the enhancement of the solubility of polymers can improve the device performance. 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO) is a good solvent for PC71BM but a poor solvent for conjugated polymers.19 DIO (2.0% by volume) was therefore used as a processing additive to optimize the device performance, and the results are shown in Table 3. After adding DIO, all devices exhibited improved photovoltaic performance with Voc increasing from 0.76 to 0.86 V for P1, from 0.89 to 0.93 V for P2, and from 0.84 to 0.91 V for P3. After adding DIO, the Jsc and FF values also slightly increased. The significant enhancement of Voc indicated that the charge recombination in the devices is reduced and the enhancement of the FF value should be ascribed to the decreasing of series resistance for the devices.27,28 To understand why using DIO as an additive can improve the device performance, the morphology of active layers was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), the transport properties of active layers were investigated by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method, and the elemental composition of the top and bottom surface of active layers was investigated by XPS (vide infra). These investigations demonstrated that the enhancement of device performance is mainly due to the optimized blend morphology and the improvement of vertical phase separation, namely the formation of a polymer rich bottom surface of the active layer, which are beneficial for the reducing of charge recombination and collecting of the charges by the electrode.27,29 Our investigations have demonstrated that the use of a fluorinated carbazole unit as a donor unit has a positive effect for the photovoltaic performance.

R
s is an important factor that determines the FF value of photovoltaic devices, it has been demonstrated by many researchers that the reduction of Rs usually results in higher FF.29 To elucidate what caused the improvement of FF value, we measured the Rs of devices. As shown in Fig. 5, Rs values were calculated from the inverse slope of dark J–V curves at a voltage of 1.0 V to be 53.25 Ω cm−2, 21.06 Ω cm−2 and 10.48 Ω cm−2 for P1, P2, and P3 based plain devices, respectively. As expected, the reduction of Rs resulted in an enhancement of the FF value. After adding DIO, the Rs values for P1, P2, and P3 based devices were decreased to 46.91 Ω cm−2, 14.59 Ω cm−2, and 5.40 Ω cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the increasing of FF obtained from J–V measurements. This reducing could be ascribed to the optimized morphology by extending the side chain and using DIO as an additive (vide infra). These data are summarized in Table 4.

To examine the veracity of Jsc, external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of devices fabricated without and with 2.0% DIO were measured. As shown in Fig. 6, all devices showed a broad EQE response from 350 to 700 nm. For plain devices, the EQE maximum reached 31% at 500 nm for P1, 44% at 542 nm for P2, and 53% at 467 nm for P3. By increasing the volume of side chains, namely the solubility of polymers, the EQE value increased. After adding 2.0% DIO as an additive, for three polymers EQE values only slightly increased. The integration of EQE curves afforded similar Jsc values to the J–V measurement, indicating that the Jsc values obtained from J–V measurements are reliable.

Transport properties
High efficiency PSCs require that the active layers are of balanced electron and hole mobility. Higher hole mobility is beneficial for achieving higher Jsc and FF. Hole mobilities (μh) of P1–3:PC71BM (1:3.5) blend films were measured by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. Hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/P1–3:PC71BM/Au (100 nm) were fabricated. Dark J–V curves were fitted by using the Mott–Gurney equation: J = 9εoεrμV2/8L3, where J is the space charge limited current, εo is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the permittivity of the active layer, μ is the hole mobility, and L is the thickness of the active layer. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), μh values of P1:PC71BM, P2:PC71BM, and P3:PC71BM based plain devices were calculated to be 1.1 × 10−6, 3.3 × 10−5, and 9.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively. The enhancement of hole mobility with increasing the volume of side chains should be ascribed to the better film morphology and lower Rs (vide supra). After adding 2.0% DIO, μh values of P1, P2 and P3 based devices were enhanced to 1.6 × 10−5, 3.4 × 10−5, and 1.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.
XPS measurement
The vertical distribution of the donor and acceptor materials in the active layer is very crucial for the performance of devices. Elemental compositions of the top (close to LiF layer) and bottom (close to PEDOT:PSS layer) surfaces of the active layer in a depth of a few nanometers were therefore investigated by XPS. The top surface XPS experiment was conducted with the blend film on a glass substrate, and the bottom surface XPS experiment was conducted with a blend film which was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS surface, floated on the surface of the pure water surface, and transferred onto a silicon substrate with the buried surface upward. The elemental compositions of sulfur (S) and carbon (C) at the top and bottom surfaces are summarized in Table 4. Because XPS is not a quantitative analysis method, these data could be used for semi-quantitative analysis of the distribution of two components.12,30 XPS results showed that the content of S element at the bottom surface is much higher than that at the top surface, indicating that the blend films are of a vertical phase separation with a PC71BM-rich top surface and a polymer-rich bottom surface. Such a vertical phase separation is beneficial to achieve high performance for conventional polymer solar cells. The formation of vertical phase separation is probably due to the following reasons. The polymers exhibit poorer solubility in DCB than PC71BM and they are prone to precipitate before the liquid–liquid phase separation occurs. Due to the centrifugation effect during spin-coating, the polymer precipitates could probably submerge to the bottom, the PC71BM-rich DCB solution could be at the surface of the active layer, and finally the drying of the blend film leads to a vertical phase separation with a PC71BM-rich top surface and a polymer-rich bottom surface. Since DIO is a good solvent for PC71BM and a poor solvent for the polymers, the use of 2.0% DIO as an additive will further promote the process of precipitation and retard the drying process of films.12 As confirmed by the XPS results, the contents of the S element further increased, which are close to that of pure polymers after using 2.0% DIO as an additive. Compared with the corresponding active layers spin coated without using DIO, the polymer content at the top surface also slightly increased after the addition of DIO, similar to the literature results.12 The reason for that is unclear at present time. Increasing the ohmic contact between the active layer and the electrode could be beneficial for the reducing of Rs and induce lower charge combination, which could lead to higher Voc.31–33 Such a vertical phase separation with almost a pure polymer thin layer at the bottom surface of the active layer was also beneficial for lowering the Rs and reducing the charge recombination at the bottom surface of the active layer.34
Film morphology
Film morphology of P1–3:PC71BM blend films spin coated from DCB solutions without and with 2% DIO as a processing additive is investigated by AFM in the tapping mode. As shown in Fig. 7, the P1:PC71BM films spin coated from DCB solution exhibited a rather rough surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of 14.5 nm. Upon increasing the volume of flexible side chains, RMS values of P2 and P3 based blend films spin coated from DCB solutions were reduced to 7.24 nm and 3.41 nm, respectively. As indicated before, the solubility of P2 and P3 is gradually improved with the presence of elongated flexible side chains. The solubility of P1–3 in DCB is poorer than that of PC71BM. Therefore, we predict that the polymers can precipitate first in solutions after spin-coating the hot blending solution onto the cold substrate before the film drying. The film drying procedure could be a liquid–solid mechanism. Due to the extremely poor solubility of P1 in DCB at room temperature, P1 is prone to form rough film morphology due to the solid–liquid phase separation.17P3 exhibited the best solubility among these three polymers, as observed by AFM experiments, the film morphology of the P3 based active layer is more uniform. P2 exhibits medium solubility, and the domain size formed by P2 is also of the medium size. After adding 2% DIO as an additive, the RMS roughness values of P1–3 based blend films were slightly decreased, which demonstrated that DIO could optimize the film morphology. Smother morphology usually indicates phase separation on a smaller scale, which would be beneficial for the reducing of charge recombination.35 The relatively low Voc of P1 based devices could be ascribed to the charge recombination caused by big domain sizes in the blend films. The RMS roughness values of P1–3 based devices all decreased after adding 2% DIO into the active layer, demonstrating that DIO could optimize the morphology of devices and afford a more donor–acceptor interface, which would be beneficial to reduce the charge recombination and lead to higher Voc.36 Due to the domain size formed by liquid–solid phase separation became smaller, P3:PC71BM based PSCs gave the highest power conversion efficiency of 5.71% among these three polymers.

Conclusions
In summary, a series of new conjugated polymers (P1–P3) with 3,6-difluorocarbazole as a donor unit and benzoxadiazole as an acceptor unit were synthesized and used as donor materials for PSCs. These polymers exhibited poorer solubility than PC71BM in DCB. Among them, P1 exhibited the poorest solubility, leading to the formation of large polymer domains due to the liquid–solid phase separation in the drying of blend films. By gradually extending the side chains for P2 and P3, the solubility of polymers was increased, and the root mean square (rms) roughness values of blend films and the domain size of polymers decreased. Meanwhile, the hole mobility and series resistance value were increased and decreased, respectively, which were beneficial to achieve higher PCE. For all polymers, using DIO as a solvent additive, series resistance values of devices were further reduced and hole mobility was slightly increased. XPS experiments also demonstrated for all polymers at the bottom surface of active layers processed with DIO as an additive became more polymer-rich, which is beneficial for the hole injection into the electrode. Using DIO could also optimize the film morphology, decrease the domain size, lower the Rs value, and enhance the fluorescence quenching efficiency, which would be beneficial for reducing charge combination, leading to higher Voc. After optimization, PSCs based on P3 finally gave the best PCE of 5.71%. Compared with the non-fluorinated polymer, fluorinated polymers exhibited lower HOMO levels. Voc, Jsc and FF were all improved to furnish higher PCE. These preliminary results also demonstrated that the introduction of fluorine atoms at the donor unit is an effective way to achieve higher PCE.

A mixture of 3 (0.30 mmol), compound 4 (0.30 mmol), NaHCO3 (1.25 g, 9 mmol), THF (20 mL), toluene (7 mL), and H2O (2 mL) was degassed before and after Pd(PPh3)4 (6.9 mg, 5.96 μmol) was added. The mixture was heated to reflux and stirred for 3 d under a N2 atmosphere. Phenylboronic acid (10 mg) and bromobenzene (0.2 mL) were added successively at a time interval of 12 h to end-cap the bromo and boronic acid end groups, respectively. After cooling down to room temperature, water (100 mL) and chloroform (100 mL) were added. The organic layer was separated, washed with water (50 mL × 3), and concentrated by evaporation of most of the solvent. The residue was poured into a large amount of acetone, and the resulting precipitates were collected by filtration and washed with acetone. The crude product was dissolved in a large amount of hot chlorobenzene and filtrated. After the removal of most of the solvent, the resulted concentrated solution was precipitated into a large amount of acetone and the precipitates were collected by filtration and dried under vacuum.
