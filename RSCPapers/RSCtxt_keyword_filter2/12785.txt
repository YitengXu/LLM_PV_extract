    , Accepted 8th January 2019First published on 9th January 2019AbstractSolution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) have become a promising renewable energy technology in recent years. The fast initial degradation, which causes performance reduction at the initial stage for OSCs, needs to be understood and investigated thoroughly. In this work, for the first time, we have conducted a comparative study of light- and thermal-induced degradation during the burn-in process. As revealed in the estimation of Urbach energy, both light and thermal degradation created an increased energetic disorder. However, characterisation by steady-state photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and capacitance–voltage (C–V) indicates that the mechanisms behind these two types of degradation are very different. The loss in light degradation was found to be more related to its degraded energy transfer ability, exciton dissociation ability and increased non-radiative recombination; whereas, the loss in thermal degradation was found to be more related to the reduced current extraction ability and increased leakage current.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs), possessing the advantages of simple and cheap fabrication, light-weight, semi-transparency and flexibility, have attracted significant research attention over the past few years.1–4 Recently, non-fullerene acceptor-based organic solar cells have become a research hot spot.5 Compared to conventional fullerene acceptors, non-fullerene acceptors have advantages such as stronger light absorbing ability, tunable energy levels and variable molecular structures.6–8 Poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] (PTB7-Th) is a widely applied low bandgap polymer donor material that has demonstrated good compatibility with both classic fullerene and non-fullerene acceptor materials, namely, [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) and 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC).9 With the development of novel organic materials synthesis and device processing technology, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs have surpassed 14% for single junction devices and 17% for tandem devices to date.10–14
OSCs emerged as a promising renewable energy technology for commercialisation. Nevertheless, besides reaching the high PCE, stability is a critical barrier to commercialisation. It was found that OSCs usually showed dramatic performance degradation at the initial stage of the device operation.15–18 This rapid reduction is defined as the “fast initial degradation”, which is responsible for a significant loss in OSCs.19 Commonly, a burn-in test is required for most photovoltaic devices to ensure their reliability.20 For future applications, the fast initial degradation of organic solar cells also needs to be well understood and investigated. There are many factors contributing to the degradation of OSCs, including the chemical instability, oxidation, interfacial degradation, thermally induced changes, light-induced instability and so on.21–24 Different factors may contribute to various failure mechanisms. To date, many studies have investigated the mechanism behind the light-induced fast initial degradation, also called burn-in photodegradation.16,18 Upama et al. reported that the formation of sub-bandgap trap states is the main reason for the burn-in photodegradation in PTB7:PC71BM fullerene-based organic solar cells.18 Similarly, the trap-mediated charge recombination was found to be the dominate burn-in photodegradation mechanism in non-fullerene-based PBDB-T:ITIC devices.17 Nevertheless, researchers have rarely studied and performed comparative studies on the fast initial degradation that results from other factors. Many stability studies only investigated a single factor (such as thermal or air) over the long term, and they lacked detailed mechanistic analysis.25–28 As such, more detailed and comparative stability studies are needed in this field. In addition to light-induced degradation, thermal-induced degradation is a non-negligible part of the fast initial degradation. To fully investigate the mechanism behind the fast initial degradation, a comparative analysis of the fast initial photodegradation and fast initial thermal degradation for organic solar cells is inevitable.
Herein, we have evaluated the fast initial photodegradation and fast initial thermal degradation of both PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based fullerene and PTB7-Th:ITIC-based non-fullerene OSCs and compared these two types of degradation. Similar PCE reduction was observed for both photo-degraded devices and thermal-degraded devices. However, photo-degraded devices showed a higher open circuit voltage (Voc) loss, while thermal degraded devices showed a higher short circuit current (Jsc) loss. To investigate the root cause of the difference, characterisations such as external quantum efficiency (EQE), photoluminescence (PL), capacitance–voltage (C–V) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were conducted. We determined the Urbach energy from the tail region of the EQE spectrum and estimated the carrier recombination resistance from the diode ideality factor. As a result, the degradation mechanism was found to be different between the fast initial photo-degradation and thermal degradation. An increase in the Urbach energy was observed for both photo-degraded and thermal-degraded devices to a similar extent. This indicates a larger energetic disorder in the device. The loss in fast initial photodegradation was found to be related to its degraded energy transfer ability, exciton dissociation ability and increased non-radiative recombination. On the other hand, the loss in fast initial thermal degradation was found to be more related to its decreased current extraction ability and increased leakage current.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Material preparation
The pre-patterned ITO glasses with an area of 12 mm × 12 mm were purchased from Lumtec. PTB7-Th and ITIC were purchased from Solarmer. PC71BM was purchased from 1-Material. Zinc oxide nanoparticles, reagent alcohol (anhydrous, <0.003% water), chlorobenzene (99.8%), 1,8-diiodooctane, and MoO3 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
2.2 Device fabrication
We used an inverted device structure of ITO Glass/ZnO/PTB7-Th:ITIC or PTB7-Th:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag. The ITO glass substrate was cleaned with soapy deionised (DI) water, pure DI water, acetone and isopropanol and ultrasonicated for 10 min in sequence. The ZnO nanoparticle solution (3%) was made by adding 50 μL of zinc dispersion into 1622 μL of reagent alcohol. The ZnO nanoparticles solution was stirred overnight in the N2 filled glove box and then spin-coated on the top of the cleaned ITO glass with a spin rate of 5000 rpm for 60 s. After coating with the ZnO solution, all the samples were annealed at 120 °C on a hot plate inside the N2 filled glove box for 10 min. The PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layer solutions were made with 10 mg PTB7-Th and 15 mg PC71BM in a 1:1.5 wt ratio in a 25 mg mL−1 chlorobenzene solution with 3 vol% DIO. The PTB7-Th:ITIC active layer solutions were made with 10 mg PTB7-Th, 15 mg ITIC in a 1:1.5 wt ratio in 25 mg mL−1 chlorobenzene without DIO addition. The active layer solution was stirred overnight inside an N2-filled glove-box and then spin-coated at a rate of 1800 rpm for 2 min onto the samples to reach 100 nm thickness. After that, the coated samples were put into a vacuum chamber at a pressure of 10−5 Pa. The 10 nm thick film of MoO3 and 100 nm thick film of silver were deposited on the sample surface through a shadow mask by thermal evaporation. The device area fabricated was 0.045 cm2.
2.3 Device characterisation
Fresh samples were stored in a N2-filled glove box to avoid degradation before characterisation. Photo-degraded samples were exposed to one-sun test conditions under ambient conditions for 5 hours. Thermal-degraded samples were put on an 85 °C hot plate for 5 hours in ambient conditions. The current density–voltage (J–V) measurements were conducted by using a solar cell I–V testing system from PV Measurements, Inc. (using a Keithley 2400 source meter) under illumination power of 100 mW cm−2 by an AM 1.5G solar simulator. The device temperature was measured by a GM1350 50:1 LCD infrared thermometer digital gun and maintained at around 25 °C. An Autolab PGSTAT-30 was used for the capacitance–voltage (C–V) determinations and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This was conducted inside the glove box with a frequency range of 106 to 100 Hz by using a frequency analyser module. A QEX10 spectral response system from PV measurements was used as a characterisation machine for external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. Optical characterisation was conducted using a UV-VIS-NIR spectrometer (Perkin Elmer-Lambda 950). A Bruker Dimension ICON SPM with a scan size of “5 μm × 5 μm” at the scan rate of 0.512 Hz was used as the atomic force microscopy (AFM) to characterise the film surface morphology. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken using a Nano SEM 230 system. The micro-photoluminescence (μPL) characterisation was conducted on a self-developed μPL system. The sample was excited by a pulsed OPO laser at 532 nm. For steady state spectral PL, the signal was detected by a Glacier X TE Cooled CCD Spectrometer with a detection range of 200 nm to 1050 nm. For time-resolved PL (TRPL), the signal was detected by an id110 VIS 100 MHz Photon Detector operated in free running mode.
3. Results and discussion
In this work, all devices were fabricated with the inverted structure as shown in Fig. 1(a) inside a N2 filled glove box. PTB7-Th, ITIC and PC71BM are the three organic materials that were used to fabricate the PTB7-Th:PC71BM fullerene-based and PTB7-Th:ITIC non-fullerene-based active layers. The chemical structure and energy levels of these three materials are shown in Fig. 1(b) and (d) and the normalized absorbance of the two active layers are shown in Fig. 1(c). The organic solar cells that were characterized immediately after fabrication are called “fresh” devices. These devices were then divided into two groups for fast initial degradation analysis. To evaluate the fast initial photodegradation in ambient conditions, fresh devices were exposed to continuous one-sun test conditions for 5 hours in ambient conditions to become the so-called “photo-degraded” devices.17 To evaluate the fast initial thermal degradation, fresh devices were put on a hot plate at 85 °C under dark conditions for 5 hours in ambient conditions to become the so-called “thermal-degraded” devices.15 The photovoltaic parameters, including Voc, Jsc, fill factor (FF), PCE, series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh), of those devices were evaluated at a regular interval of 1 hour during the degradation process. The current density to voltage (J–V) curves of fresh, photo-degraded and thermal-degraded fullerene and non-fullerene-based devices are displayed in Fig. 2, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters extracted from Fig. 2 are listed in Table 1.

The photovoltaic parameters for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM fullerene-based-device and PTB7-Th:ITIC non-fullerene-based device are similar, with a slightly higher Jsc value in the fullerene-based device (14.67 ± 0.67 mA cm−2) as compared to that of the non-fullerene-based device (13.13 ± 0.73 mA cm−2). The highest PCE of 8.08% and 7.31% were achieved by the fullerene-based and non-fullerene-based device, respectively. From the fast initial degradation perspective, both the fullerene and non-fullerene devices degraded dramatically within 5 hours. Fullerene devices showed a slightly higher resistivity to the burn-in process after 5 hours, with 73% and 71% of PCE maintained after the fast initial photodegradation and thermal degradation, while the non-fullerene based devices maintained only 57% and 63% of PCE after the degradation. Fig. 3(a)–(l) show the fast initial aging curves of all photovoltaic parameters including Voc, Jsc, FF, PCE, Rs and Rsh for both fullerene-based and non-fullerene-based devices for 5 hours; Tables S1 and S2† show the corresponding values of those photovoltaic parameters. From Fig. 3(g) and (h), the PCE loss after 5 hours in fast initial photodegradation and thermal degradation was very similar for both types of devices, while the degradation trend after 5 hours was different.

From the photodegradation perspective, non-fullerene-based devices showed a typical burn-in degradation, where the PCE showed a significant drop in the first hour followed by a stabilization regime. For fullerene-based devices in the burn-in degradation regime, it was not apparent that the PCE decreased continuously over 5 hours. From the thermal degradation perspective, both fullerene and non-fullerene-based devices showed the burn-in process with a significant PCE drop within the initial 1 hour. On the other hand, the fullerene-based devices showed a PCE recovering trend for the following 4 hours. Similar recovering trends were also observed in the degradation curve of the fill factor, shunt resistance and series resistance for fullerene-based devices; the recovering of these three factors can be the main reason for the PCE recovering trend. Since all devices used the same device structure and the same donor material in this study, the difference in degradation between the fullerene and non-fullerene-based devices mainly results from the degradation in the active layer, which is related to the morphology change and the molecular structure of the acceptor. Compared to fullerene acceptor PC71BM, non-fullerene acceptor ITIC has four 4-hexylphenyl groups that can restrict molecular planarity, aggregation and large phase separation.9 Thermal treatment was proven to cause aggregation and larger domain size, leading to higher carrier mobility for PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices, which may be the root reason for the observed PCE recovery.29
From Fig. 3(a)–(d), it is easy to observe that the degradation of Voc and Jsc is different in the fast initial photodegradation and thermal degradation, where photo-degraded devices have a higher Voc loss and thermal-degraded devices have a higher Jsc loss. From Fig. 3(i)–(l), it can be seen that the degradation of the internal resistance is also different in photodegradation and thermal degradation. After 5 hours of degradation, thermal-degraded devices showed a higher shunt resistance loss while photo-degradation devices showed a higher series resistance increase. Thus, the degradation mechanism of fast initial photodegradation and thermal degradation can be very different.
To investigate the mechanism behind the fast initial photodegradation and thermal degradation, EQE measurements with high sensitivity were conducted for fresh, photo-degraded and thermal-degraded devices. It is worth mentioning that all measurements were conducted under constant one sun light bias, as the variation in the sun light bias will cause the variation in the EQE results.30Fig. 4(a) and (b) depict the curves of EQE versus the photon energy for fullerene-based and non-fullerene-based devices, respectively. Since the photocurrent spectrum response of the polymer donor PTB7-Th is up to 1.6 eV,31 the photocurrent response of the device higher than 1.6 eV is more likely to be related to the excitation of the polymer chains, and the photocurrent response of the device lower than 1.6 eV is more likely related to the excitation of the charge transfer (CT) states.32 The Urbach energy of the device was then determined with the absorption tail (also called the Urbach tail) below 1.6 eV by using the following equation:33,34 (1)where E represents the photon energy, α represents the light absorbing coefficient and EU is the estimated Urbach energy.33–36 The extracted Urbach energy for both fullerene and non-fullerene, fresh, photo-degraded and thermal-degraded devices are listed in Table 2. It was found that both photo-degraded devices and thermal-degraded devices showed a similarly increased Urbach energy when compared to fresh devices. A higher Urbach energy usually indicates a higher energetic disorder with increased states in the bandgap of the active layer, which can cause a reduction in the photovoltaic performance via trap-mediated charge recombination.37 Thus, the increased energetic disorder with higher trap mediated charge recombination was found to be a common reason for both fast initial photodegradation and thermal degradation. Fig. 4(c) and (d) showed the EQE curves over the light wavelength range from 300 nm to 850 nm for both fullerene and non-fullerene based devices. For both types of devices, thermal-degraded devices exhibited a relatively higher EQE reduction than photo-degraded devices when compared to fresh devices, which is consistent with the observation of Jsc loss from J–V characterisation.

Dark J–V characterisation was then conducted to further analyze the current loss in both fast initial photo- and thermal-degradation. The obtained dark J–V curves are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b) for fullerene and non-fullerene-based devices, respectively. It was clear that the leakage current of the photo-degraded and thermal-degraded devices increased for both types of devices under the reverse bias conditions as compared to fresh devices. Moreover, the thermal-degraded devices showed a higher increase than the photo-degraded devices. The high leakage current usually indicates a high shunt possibility, which is responsible for the low Jsc in the device, and a low shunt resistance is responsible for the low FF in OSCs.38 Herein, the observation from the leakage current explained the higher Jsc loss in thermal-degraded devices and is consistent with the observed higher shunt resistance loss from J–V characterisation. The results from dark J–V measurements proved that the fast initial thermal degradation is responsible for the increased shunt resistance and higher shunt probability in OSCs.

On the other hand, a saturation current density (Jsat) with charge carrier extraction possibility (P) analysis was performed for both fullerene and non-fullerene-based fresh, photo-degraded and thermal-degraded devices. The plots of the photocurrent density (Jph) vs. the effective voltage (Veff) are shown in Fig. 6. The Jph and Veff were calculated by using the equations below:39 Jph = JL − JD(2) Veff = Voc − Vbias(3)where JL is the light current density under one-sun testing conditions, JD is the dark current density under the dark testing conditions, and Vbias is the externally applied voltage bias. When the Veff is higher than 1.0 V, the assumption that all the generated excitons in the active layer are dissociated and collected can be made. In the meantime, the photocurrent density (Jph) can be assumed to be equal to the saturation current density (Jsat), which is only restricted by the absorption of incident photons. The charge carrier extraction possibility (P) was then obtained by calculating the ratio of Jsc to Jsat, which can reasonably explain the current loss during the current extraction process.40Table 3 presents the Jsat and estimated P value for all devices. It was found that for both fullerene and non-fullerene based devices, the thermal-degraded devices showed a higher reduction in Jsat and P values than the photo-degraded devices when compared to fresh devices, which revealed that fast initial thermal degradation had a more negative effect on the current extraction process in OSCs as compared to fast initial photodegradation. The charge extraction process in OSCs is commonly related to the charge collection at the interface between charge transport layers and active layers.41,42 The low charge collection at the interface usually results from the poor surface contact with the shunt conditions and indicates low shunt resistance.43 Thus, the results from the Jph–P analysis were also found to be consistent with the observed higher shunt resistance loss in J–V characterisation.

To investigate the changing electrical properties in the fast initial degradation, C–V characterisation was conducted. Fig. 7(a) and (b) display the Mott Schottky (MS) curves at a frequency of 1 kHz for fullerene and non-fullerene-based devices. When the applied voltage bias is lower than 0.0 V, the assumption that the active layer is entirely depleted can be made.44 Under these conditions, the dielectric constant of the device can be estimated by using the capacitance at 0.0 V bias with the equation below:45 (4)where A is the area of the device, which is 0.045 cm2 in this study, d is the thickness of the active layer, which is around 100 nm for all devices, εo represents the vacuum permittivity of 8.854 × 10−12 F m−1, and εr is the estimated relative dielectric constant. Since the dielectric constant is known, the Coulombic capture radius (Rc), which describes the charge dissociation process, can be estimated by using the following equation:46 (5)where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the operating temperature in Kelvin and e is the elementary charge. The extracted Coulombic capture radii with corresponding dielectric constants for all devices are presented in Table 4. In OSCs, generated excitons are initially bound together before the dissociation, which is defined as the Coulomb binding. Only when the distance between charge carriers exceeds the Coulombic capture radius can the exciton be dissociated.46 A large Coulombic capture radius indicates that the excitons are more difficult to dissociate. From Table 4, both photo-degraded and thermal-degraded devices were found to possess an increased Rc value as compared to fresh devices. In addition, the increase was found to be much larger in photodegraded devices for both fullerene and non-fullerene-based devices. The results imply that the reduction in exciton dissociation ability is more dependent on the fast initial photodegradation than the fast initial thermal degradation.

Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) was performed for all devices in order to gain deeper insights into the degradation mechanism. The normalized PL spectra are shown in Fig. 8. It is obvious that for both fullerene and non-fullerene-based devices, the photo-degraded devices showed a dramatically increased PL intensity, while the PL intensity of the thermal-degraded devices is almost unchanged when compared to fresh devices. The PL intensity from the steady-state PL is usually related to the number of excitons in organic solar cells. The high PL intensity indicates that a large number of excitons exist in the active layer.47,48 The low PL intensity indicates that the excitons are efficiently dissociated into charge carriers.49,50 Thus, a significantly increased PL intensity implies a largely decreased exciton dissociation ability for photo-degraded devices, which is considered one of the main reasons for the fast initial photodegradation. Herein, the observation is consistent with the results obtained from C–V characterisation. On the other hand, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was conducted to investigate the dynamics of fast initial photodegradation and thermal degradation for the fresh, photo-degraded and thermal-degraded fullerene and non-fullerene-based devices. Fig. 9 shows the TRPL decay curve under the 532 nm light excitation, and a bi-exponential decay model below was used to simulate the curve and extract the excited state lifetime:51 (6)where A1 and A2 represent the amplitudes and τ1 and τ2 represent the fast and slow lifetimes for the carrier recombination. Table 5 lists the obtained excited lifetime values for all devices. It can be seen that both photo-degraded and thermal-degraded devices showed increased excited lifetimes as compared to fresh devices. Nevertheless, both fullerene and non-fullerene-based photo-degraded devices showed a much larger increase in fast and long excited lifetimes than thermal-degraded devices. Excited lifetimes can indicate the energy and carrier transfer process inside the active layer, which corresponded with the potential of the heterojunction.52 Since the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) offers an alternative non-radiative pathway between the donor and acceptor, the excited state lifetime can be used to evaluate the energy transfer process in the active layer.53 The higher excited state lifetime usually represents a more inefficient energy transfer. Herein, fast initial photodegradation was found to have a larger negative impact on the energy transfer process as compared to fast initial thermal degradation. This is in accord with the higher Voc loss observed in photo-degraded devices. The degraded energy transfer ability was identified as one of the main reasons for the fast initial photodegradation but is less related to the fast initial thermal degradation.

A diode ideality factor (n) and carrier recombination resistance (Rrec) analysis were performed to investigate the non-radiative recombination changes during the fast initial degradation. According to the ideal diode model, the diode ideality factor can be estimated from the slope in the exponential region of dark J–V curves (shown in Fig. 5) by using the equation below:54 (7)
Regarding dark J–V curves, the differential diode ideality factor at each voltage was calculated and depicted in Fig. 10(a) and (b) for fullerene and non-fullerene-based devices, respectively.
 Fig. 10  The differential ideality factor calculated from the slope of the dark J–V curves versus the applied voltage bias for (a) PTB7-Th:PC71BM fullerene and (b) PTB7-Th:ITIC non-fullerene-based fresh, photo-degraded and thermal-degraded devices. 
When the external bias voltage exceeds 0.6 V, dark J–V curves have an exponential region with parasitic effects occurring.55,56 Under a high voltage bias, when the minimum differential diode ideality factor value is very sharp, parasitic resistance hardly allows the correct determination of the intrinsic diode ideality factor as the recombination-limited slope is not reached.54 Thus, this minimum value is considered as the upper limit of the differential diode ideality factor. The dashed lines in Fig. 10 represent this upper limit as well as the estimated diode ideality factor for all devices. On obtaining the diode ideality factor, the carrier recombination resistance (Rrec), which is related to the non-radiative recombination process, can then be calculated by using the following equation:57 (8)where Ve is the effective voltage for the minimum ideality factor, and B = JscRs, which represents the voltage loss across the series resistance. Since it is extracted from the dark J–V, which is measured under dark conditions without light generation, Rrec can reasonably explain the non-radiative recombination in the device.58,59 The high Rrec indicates a high ability to resist non-radiative recombination.57,58 The extracted n and Rrec value for both fullerene and non-fullerene-based, fresh, photo-degraded and thermal-degraded devices are listed in Table 6, and the corresponding calculation parameters including Ve, Rs and B are shown in Table S3.† From Table 6, after 5 hours of degradation, both photo-degraded and thermal-degraded devices demonstrated a reduction in carrier recombination resistance as compared to fresh devices. Nevertheless, this reduction was found to be much larger in photo-degraded devices for both fullerene and non-fullerene-based devices. The results revealed that fast initial photodegradation has a stronger negative impact on the non-radiative recombination in the device.

AFM and SEM characterisations were conducted to investigate the morphology changes during the fast initial degradation. AFM images are shown in Fig. 11 and SEM images are shown in Fig. S1† for both fullerene and non-fullerene-based fresh, photo-degraded and thermal-degraded devices. In addition, the estimated root mean square roughness (RMS) values are shown in each corresponding image. It was found that the RMS value for both photo-degraded and thermal-degraded devices was larger as compared to the value of the fresh device. For fullerene-based devices, the RMS value increased from 3.65 nm to 5.35 nm and 5.00 nm after 5 hours of the fast initial photo- and thermal-degradation, respectively. Similarly, for non-fullerene-based devices, the RMS value increased from 4.24 nm to 4.98 nm and 4.34 nm after the fast initial photo- and thermal-degradation. Apparently, the fast initial photodegradation was found to induce a greater extent of roughness than the fast initial thermal degradation. The high RMS value with rougher surface morphology implies strong aggregation behaviour inside the active layer, which is related to large phase-separated domains with more traps. It can negatively affect the charge dissociation process and increase the non-radiative recombination in the device.60,61 Hence, the decreased charge dissociation and increased non-radiative recombination were found as two major degradation reasons for the fast initial photodegradation. Herein, the result is consistent with the steady-state PL results, the diode ideality factor analysis and carrier recombination resistance analysis.

Overall, although a similar device PCE drop was observed from the fast initial photo- and thermal degradation for both types of devices, the mechanism behind these two types of degradation was found to be different. Urbach energy estimation pointed out that both photo- and thermal degradation can cause an increased energetic disorder with higher trap-mediated charge recombination. Meanwhile, steady-state PL, TRPL and C–V measurements indicate that the fast initial photodegradation is more dominated by degraded charge dissociation ability and energy transfer ability as compared to fast initial thermal degradation. Moreover, carrier recombination resistance estimation and AFM characterisation found that photodegradation caused a relatively stronger negative impact on the non-radiative recombination in the fast initial process. However, the dark J–V measurement and the Jsat with P analysis showed that the fast initial thermal degradation is more related to the increased leakage potential and degraded current extraction process as compared to fast initial photodegradation.
4. Conclusion
We have studied and compared the fast initial photodegradation and fast initial thermal degradation of both PTB7-Th:PC71BM fullerene-based and PTB7-Th:ITIC non-fullerene-based devices. The determined Urbach energy indicates that both photo- and thermal degradation during the fast initial process can cause energy disorder. However, the fast initial photo and thermal degradation were identified to have very different mechanisms. Compared to the fast initial thermal degradation, the fast initial photodegradation was found to have more negative effects on the energy transfer process and exciton dissociation process and caused a higher increase in non-radiative recombination. On the other hand, the fast initial thermal degradation was found to be more responsible for the degradation in the current extraction process and can induce a higher current leakage potential. As the organic solar cell emerges as one of the promising energy technologies, it becomes essential to address its stability issues. Understanding the mechanism behind the fast initial degradation process is thus a crucial step towards further development and commercialization.
