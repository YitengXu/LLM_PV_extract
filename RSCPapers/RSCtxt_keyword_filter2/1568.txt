    , Accepted 5th July 2019First published on 8th July 2019AbstractSemitransparent organic solar cells (STOSCs) are of great interest in both academic and industrial fields since they can be easily used as building windows to achieve solar power generation in building façades. However, many studies only focused on the optimisation of photocurrent generation and light transmission and ignored the colour-fidelity of devices. Meanwhile, many reported semitransparent organic solar cells require a very thin active layer around 100 nm which makes it difficult for them to be applied to large-scale window applications. Herein, we reported STOSCs with neutral color perception based on a PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM thick active layer for the first time. We optimized the active layer thickness of the device from 300 nm to 120 nm to obtain the best performance. As a result, semitransparent devices showed a decreasing PCE and increasing AVT with the reduction of the active layer thickness. All semitransparent devices showed an excellent color rendering index above 90. The semitransparent device with an active layer thickness of 250 nm exhibits the best performance among all devices which corresponds to a considerable PCE of 6.60%, AVT of 16.3% and CRI of 90.7. This reveals that the PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM based semitransparent devices with a thick active layer are suitable for application in building windows in terms of color perception and large-scale fabrication.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPV) as one kind of renewable and clean energy technology has attracted a lot of research attention.1,2 Many studies have been conducted for investigating and improving the performance and stability of organic solar cells (OSCs).3–7 A record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.7% for single junctions and 17.3% for tandem OSCs has been achieved in this field.8,9 Compared to silicon based solar cells, organic solar cells can reach a very high open circuit voltage (Voc) beyond 1.0 V.10 Recent studies have boosted the Voc of OSCs from 1.15 V to even beyond 1.2 V which indicates a huge potential for OSCs to achieve high performance.11–13 Moreover, ascribed to its advantages of semitransparency, flexibility, fabrication by a solution process and light weight, OSCs show tremendous potential to be integrated into buildings and mobile electronic devices.14–19 Particularly, semitransparent organic solar cells (STOSCs) are of great interest in both academic and industrial fields since they can be easily used as building windows to achieve solar power generation in building façades.20–25 There are three critical requirements for STOSCs towards this purpose: (i) considerable power conversion efficiency (PCE); (ii) high transparency over the visible light range (380–780 nm) and (iii) good neutral-colour perception.26,27
In the past few decades, many research efforts have been devoted to developing STOSCs. Various transparent electrode materials including thin metal films,22 graphene,28 nanotube films29 and transparent conducting oxides30 and various donor or acceptor materials such as PTB7,31 PTB7-Th,32 PBDB-T,33 IUIC32 and FOIC34 have been fabricated and optimized to achieve semitransparency. However, most of the research studies only focused on the optimisation of the photocurrent generation and light transmission and ignored the colour-fidelity of devices. For example, Wang et al. recently demonstrated STOCSs with a record PCE of 11.6% and Average Visible Transmittance (AVT) of 13.6%, but the device has a strong colour bias which is not favourable for window applications.35
To achieve neutral colour perception for STOSCs, the light passing through the device should be maintained at the same relative intensity with the incident light which means the transmittance of the device in the visible light region should be as flat as possible.25,36 The transmittance of the device in the visible light region can be used to calculate the colour rendering index (CRI) which is a parameter used to qualify the colour perception. The CRI ranging from 0 to 100 compares the passing light with the standard illuminance and reveals the light quality of the depiction of colours perceived by the human eye. For application in building-integrated windows which need to display vivid pictures when looking through, the CRI value of STOSCs should be as high as possible.36,37 Moreover, many reported semitransparent organic solar cells require a very thin active layer below 100 nm which makes it difficult for them to be applied to roll-to-roll mass production or large scale window fabrication.19,38,39 Thus, semitransparent devices with a thick active layer are needed.
In this work, we demonstrated for the first time the use of a conjugated polymer:fullerene system based on poly[(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl)-alt-(3,3′′′-di(2-octyldodecyl)-2,2′;5′,2′′;5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophen-5,5′′′-diyl)] (PffBT4T-2OD) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) in an inverted semitransparent solar cell architecture. The thickness of the active layer was optimized to balance the electrical and optical properties. As a result, all devices showed a good neutral colour perception with a very high CRI value above 90. The semitransparent device with 250 nm active layer thickness showed the best performance which corresponds to a PCE of 6.60%, AVT of 16.3% and CRI of 90.7. This reveals that the PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM based semitransparent devices with a thick active layer are suitable for application in building windows in terms of color perception and large-scale fabrication.
Experimental details
Material preparation
The pre-patterned ITO glasses (12 mm × 12 mm) were purchased from Lumtec. The chemical material PffBT4T-2OD was purchased from Solarmer and chemical material PC71BM was purchased from 1-Material. The molecular weight of PffBT4T-2OD is Mw > 130 KDa, Mn > 74 KDa and the polydispersity index (PDI) = 1.76. The chemical material, zinc oxide nanoparticles, reagent alcohol (anhydrous, <0.003% water), chlorobenzene (99.8%), 1,8-diiodooctane, and MoO3 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Device fabrication
In this paper, we used an inverted device structure of ITO glass/ZnO/PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag. The ITO glass substrate was cleaned using soapy deionised (DI) water, pure DI water, acetone and isopropanol by 10 min ultrasonication in sequence. The ZnO nanoparticle solution (3%) was prepared by adding 50 μL zinc dispersion into 1622 μL reagent alcohol. The ZnO nanoparticle solution was stirred overnight in a N2 filled glovebox and then spin-coated on the top of the cleaned ITO glass at a spin rate of 1000 rpm for 60 s. After coating the ZnO solution, all the samples were annealed at 120 °C on a hot plate inside a N2 filled glovebox for 10 min. The PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM active layer solutions were prepared by adding 10 mg PffBT4T-2OD and 13 mg PC71BM at a 1:1.3 wt. ratio in 23 mg mL−1 chlorobenzene with 3 vol% DIO. The PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM active layer solution was stirred overnight inside a N2-filled glovebox and then spin-coated at a different rate for 30 s onto the samples. After that, the coated samples were put into a vacuum chamber at a pressure of 10−5 Pa. A 10 nm thick film of MoO3 and 15 nm thick film of silver were deposited onto the sample surface through a shadow mask by thermal evaporation. The device area fabricated was 0.045 cm2.
Device characterization
Fresh samples are stored in a N2-filled glovebox to avoid degradation before characterisation. For thermally-annealed samples, they have been put on a hot plate for 5 min with different temperatures in a N2-filled glovebox. The current density–voltage (J–V) measurements were conducted by using a solar cell I–V testing system from PV Measurements, Inc. (using a Keithley 2400 source meter) under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 by using an AM 1.5G solar simulator. The device temperature was measured by using a GM1350 50:1 LCD infrared thermometer digital gun and maintained at around 25 °C. A QEX10 spectral response system from PV measurements was used as a characterisation machine for external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. The optical characterisation was performed by using a UV-VIS-NIR spectrometer (Perkin Elmer-Lambda 950). A Bruker Dimension ICON SPM with a scan size of “5 μm × 5 μm” and a scan rate of 0.512 Hz was used as an atomic force microscope (AFM) to characterise the film surface morphology. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken using a Nano SEM 230 system.
Results and discussion
The PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM based STOSCs were fabricated with an inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag as shown in Fig. 1(a). ITO glass was used as the transparent bottom electrode, and a thin silver layer of 15 nm was employed as the transparent top electrode as has been optimised in the former study.40 40 nm ZnO nanoparticles and 10 nm MoO3 layers functioned as an electron transport layer and hole transport layer in the device. The conjugated polymer material PffBT4T-2OD and classic fullerene material PC71BM were selected as the electron donor and acceptor material in this work.41 Chemical structures and the energy level alignment of these two materials are shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c). The combination of PffBT4T-2OD and PC71BM in an opaque device with a thick Ag layer of 100 nm showed excellent photovoltaic performance with an average PCE of 9.06%. When fabricated in a semitransparent device structure, high performance with a PCE of 6.60%, AVT of 16.3% and CRI of 90.7 was achieved. The transparent anode (15 nm of the thin silver layer) has sufficiently high transmission with a maximum transmittance of 82% at a wavelength of 320 nm. The sheet resistance of the anode is 12 Ω □−1 which indicates that it is conductive enough for fabricating high-performance STOSCs.40

To optimise the performance of STOSCs, a range of devices with different active layer thicknesses were fabricated and characterised. The thickness of the active layer was tuned by changing the rate of spin coating from 1000 rpm to 4000 rpm. Cross-section SEM was employed to estimate the thickness with different spin rates and the results are shown in Fig. S1.† It was found that the thickness of the active layer decreased from around 300 nm to 120 nm on increasing the spin rate. Current density–voltage (J–V) characterisation was performed for all devices to investigate the photovoltaic performance. The J–V curves of the optimized opaque device compared with all semitransparent devices are shown in Fig. 2(a) and its corresponding parameters including the open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), power conversion efficiency (PCE), series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) are shown in Table 1. Fig. 2(b) depicts the relationship between the PCE and AVT versus the active layer thickness. It is obvious to see that all devices possess a similar Voc value of around 0.76 V which indicates that the use of the transparent electrode and the reduction of active layer thickness have less effect on the voltage performance of the device. The FF showed a slightly decreasing trend for semitransparent devices with decreasing thickness which may result from the increasing series resistance in a thinner active layer. The Jsc of the device was found as the major changing parameter in the optimisation. When fabricating the semitransparent device with the same active layer thickness as the opaque device, the Jsc value dropped dramatically from 17.79 mA cm−2 to 13.71 mA cm−2 which can be ascribed to the reduced light trapping in devices using a transparent anode. Compared to the opaque anode with full refection of light, the transparent anode lets a part of the light pass through and the reflection of light at the back is reduced. The mechanism of the reduction of light trapping can be explained from Fig. S2 in the ESI.† With the same transparent anode, the Jsc value of semitransparent devices was found to keep decreasing with decreasing active layer thickness. This is because the light absorption of the active layer is directly related to the active layer thickness. In other words, the thinner the active layer, the weaker the light absorption for semitransparent devices.42

The absorption spectrum and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of all devices are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b). The average absorption and EQE of the opaque device are around 90% and 80%, respectively. When fabricated into semitransparent devices, the absorption and EQE showed a significant decrease with the reduction in the thickness of the active layer. Herein, the results are consistent with the observation of the changing Jsc value from J–V characterisation. On the other hand, the light absorption and photocurrent generation of all devices were found to occur in the wavelength range of 300–750 nm which is almost the same as the visible light wavelength region (380 to 780 nm). Thus, tuning the light absorption by changing the active layer thickness may directly influence the transmission properties of the semitransparent device. Except for the normal power generation under the illumination from the ITO side, our semitransparent devices were found to also have photovoltaic properties when illuminated from the thin Ag anode side. Fig. S3(a)–(d)† compare the J–V curve, EQE, absorption spectrum and reflectance spectrum for the semitransparent devices with an active layer of 300 nm under the top (ITO side) and bottom (Ag side), respectively. Although the semitransparent device showed the ability of bifacial power generation, the performance illuminated from the Ag side is much lower than the performance from the ITO side which may result from the lower light absorption and higher light reflection caused by the Ag anode. J–V curves, EQE spectra, absorption spectra and reflectance spectra for all semitransparent devices illuminated from the Ag side are shown in Fig. S4(a)–(d)† and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters including Voc, Jsc, FF, PCE, Rs and Rsh are shown in Table S1.†

The transmittance and reflectance measurements of all semitransparent devices were carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b) and the corresponding average visible transmittance (AVT) results are shown in Table 1. It was found that the reduction of light trapping by using the transparent anode can be attributed to an AVT of 14.5% for a semitransparent device with the same active layer thickness as the opaque device. On tuning the active layer thickness from 300 to 120 nm, the AVT of the device showed an increasing trend from 14.5% to 25.0%. The results indicate that the transparency of STOSCs can be controlled by controlling the thickness of the active layer. Moreover, it was surprising to find that both the transmission and reflectance spectra of all devices showed a very flat shape over the visible light range which reveals that all PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM based semitransparent devices may exhibit an excellent neutral-colour perception.22,25

Therefore, we further investigated the colour rendering properties of the fabricated ST solar cells. The transmittance spectrum in the visible region has been converted into a tristimulus system (X, Y, Z) and the colour coordinates (x, y), using the following equations:18 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5)
In eqn (1)–(5), S(λ) represents the CIE Standard Illuminant D65; , ȳ, and  are color matching functions defined in the CIE protocol; T(λ) represents the measured transmittance spectrum; and (x, y) are the color coordinates in the CIE 1931 color space. The tristimulus system and color space convert the cell colors for human eye perception so that it can show how the light from an object changes when it is transmitted through the ST devices as viewed by the human eye. The color coordinates of all ST devices with different active layer thicknesses are plotted in the CIE color map, as shown in Fig. 5, and the corresponding values are shown in Table 2. It is obvious to see that all STOSCs fabricated in this study are located within the white region and close to the achromatic point [(xD65, yD65) = (0.3127, 0.3290)] on the CIE chromaticity diagram which demonstrated that these devices can transmit high-quality visible light with a near-white sensation to the human eye.43 The Color Rendering Index (CRI) is an objective indicator of the color rendering properties of a semitransparent device.43,44 It is expressed as a percentage, indicating the ability of a device to accurately present an image compared to a perfect light source such as daylight. A CRI close to 100 is desirable for semitransparent devices as it can correctly distinguish the color of an object and hence satisfy the natural lighting purposes. To calculate the CRI, according to the CIE 13.3 1995 protocol, the (x, y) coordinates from the CIE 1931 color space can be converted to (u, v) coordinated in the CIE 1960 color space, and then modified according to the 8 test color samples. Each test sample should provide a special CRI. The detailed methodology can be found in ref. 18. Table 2 shows the calculated CRI values for the ST devices fabricated in this study. As a result, all of them show an excellent CRI value above 90 and the semitransparent device with 120 nm thickness of the active layer achieved the highest CRI of 95.8 which is also one of the top values for the semitransparent organic solar cell to the best of our knowledge. Overall, all PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM based semitransparent organic solar cells fabricated in this work showed an excellent neutral-color perception.

AFM characterisation as a valid method to measure the surface morphology for organic solar cells was performed to investigate the morphology of semitransparent devices with different active layer thicknesses.45,46 AFM images with the estimated root mean roughness (RMS) values are shown in Fig. 6. It can be found that all films showed a similar RMS value of around 3 nm. When reducing the active layer thickness, there is no apparent trend in morphology change for the devices. Hence, the optimization of the active layer thickness in semitransparent devices has less effect on the morphology change in the active layer.

Conclusion
In summary, we fabricated semitransparent organic solar cells based on a conjugated polymer:fullerene PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM active layer for the first time. The active layer thickness was optimised to obtain the best performance. J–V, EQE, absorption, transmission, reflection and CRI characterisation was conducted for all devices. It is worth mentioning that all PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM based semitransparent devices showed an excellent ability of neutral colour perception with a CRI value above 90. As a result, the semitransparent device with an active layer of 250 nm exhibits the best performance among all devices which corresponds to a considerable PCE of 6.60%, AVT of 16.3% and CRI of 90.7. This reveals that the PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM based semitransparent devices with a thick active layer are suitable for application in building windows in terms of color perception and large-scale fabrication. Overall, our study reported a new type of semitransparent organic solar cell with a thick active layer and excellent neutral colour perception towards window applications. More research studies are needed in this field to narrow the gap between the experimental work and future applications.
