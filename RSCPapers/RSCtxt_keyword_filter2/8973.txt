    , Accepted 18th March 2014First published on 21st March 2014AbstractTiO2 nanoparticle (NP)/ITO nanowire (NW) nanocomposites for use as photoelectrode materials were fabricated to improve the charge collection efficiency in solid state dye sensitized solar cells (ss-DSSCs). The average current density for ss-DSSCs containing TiO2 NP/ITO NW arrays was 7.2 mA cm−2 that was 98% higher than that for the conventional TiO2 NP ss-DSSCs. The intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) studies exhibited that the electron diffusion length of TiO2 NP/ITO-NW nanocomposite ss-DSSCs was in the range of 4.3–5.6 μm, longer than that of TiO2 NP solar cells (2.6–4.1 μm). The longer diffusion length was responsible for the boosted current densities of TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite ss-DSSCs. We also employed the TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite photoelectrode to inorganic–organic perovskite solar cells whose energy conversion efficiency was 7.5%.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received a vast amount of interest as promising alternative photovoltaic devices due to their relatively high efficiency and low production cost.1 DSSCs have achieved an energy conversion efficiency of 12.3% using zinc porphyrin dye sensitized TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) films.2,3 Solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (ss-DSSCs) have generated a strong interest owing to the problem of liquid electrolyte DSSCs which have suffered from electrolyte leakage and corrosion problems.4 Moreover, ss-DSSCs have many advantages; mechanical and chemical stability with organic hole transporting materials (HTM), easy film formation and adjustable functionality by molecular design.5 ss-DSSCs have exhibited an energy conversion efficiency of ∼5% by using (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9-9′-spiro-bifluorene) (spiro-OMeTAD) as the HTM.6 Despite these advantages, ss-DSSCs still have a low efficiency due to insufficient light harvesting limited by the TiO2 NP film thickness. The electron diffusion length of TiO2 was reported to be 4.4 μm in ss-DSSCs, but so far the highest efficiency of ss-DSSCs has been obtained for approximately 2 μm thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 films.7 This thickness is not sufficient to perfectly catch the incident photons, thereby deteriorating light harvesting efficiency. There have been several reports on the ways to increase the light harvesting property of the thin TiO2 film. This includes increasing the molar extinction coefficient of dye molecules, which enhances the absorbance of the solar spectrum with thin TiO2 film,8–10 and increasing the surface area of the thin TiO2 film for enhancing the amount of dye loading.11–13 The simplest way to enhance the light harvesting property is to increase the TiO2 NP film thickness. However, the limitation of charge collection capability restricts the film thickness. Therefore, many studies have previously focused on replacing the TiO2 NP film with one-dimensional (1-D) nanostructures, such as TiO2 nanowires, nanorods and nanotubes to provide a unidirectional conduction pathway for enhancing charge collection of the photoelectrode.14–18 However, these 1-D materials do not have enough surface area to adsorb a large amount of dye molecules, which is another bottle neck for achieving high efficiency. For this reason, the 3-D nanostructure photoelectrode containing a mixture of 1-D nanomaterials and 0-D nanoparticles is an alternative to improve the charge collection as well as to ensure the high surface area.
In the present study, we fabricated a 3-D TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite for use as a photoelectrode material in ss-DSSCs, whose photocurrent density was 98% higher than TiO2 NP ss-DSSCs due to superior charge collection capability. Moreover, we also applied the same concept to inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite solar cells and achieved 7.5% efficiency.
Experimental
Synthesis of ITO nanowire arrays
ITO NW arrays were synthesized by a vapour transport method.19 Au seeds were deposited on ITO glass by using an ion beam coater (Eiko-IB-3). To fabricate ITO NWs, Au coated ITO glass was placed at the outlet of the tube furnace. The mixture of indium and tin metal powder of an atomic ratio of 3:1, was placed at the centre of the quartz tube in the tube furnace. The furnace was kept under vacuum condition at 1.0 mTorr by using a rotary pump. Then, the tube furnace was heated to 850 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. Oxygen gas was disembogued with a flow rate of 12 standard cubic centimetres per second (sccm) into a tube furnace during the growth of ITO NWs.
Fabrication of solar cells
To fabricate ITO NW ss-DSSCs, the ITO NWs were coated with ∼10 nm TiO2 thin layers by using atomic layer deposition (ALD). The deposition was performed at 300 °C using the plasma. The TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite was fabricated by a spin coating method, which filled ∼20 nm anatase TiO2 NPs into ITO NW arrays. Then, TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposites were annealed at 450 °C in an air atmosphere for 1 h followed by Z907 dye loading in a 5 × 10−4 M solution of acetonitrile–tert-butanol (1:1) for 8 h. The hole transport materials (HTM) were synthesized by dissolving the spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-dipmethoxyphenylamine) 9,9′-spirobifluorene) in chlorobenzene (0.17 M) containing tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (TFSI) additives. HTM was deposited on the TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite by spin-coating at 2000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, 80 nm thick Ag electrodes were deposited on HTM layers by thermal evaporation.
Fabrication of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells
To verify the effect of TiO2 NP/ITO NW arrays on perovskite solar cells, we also fabricated the perovskite solar cell using the same concept. CH3NH3PbI3 was synthesized by a process reported earlier.20 The methyl ammonium iodide was synthesized as follows: hydroiodic acid (30 mL, 0.227 mol, 57 wt% in water) and methylamine (27.8 mL, 0.273 mol, 40% in methanol) were stirred in a round bottom flask at 0 °C for 2 h. The solution was evaporated to precipitate the white powder (CH3NH3I). CH3NH3I was washed three times with diethyl ether and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 6 h. To synthesize CH3NH3PbI3, PbI2 (1.3 M) in γ-butyrolactone (2 mL) was added into the CH3NH3I solution (1.3 M) dissolved in γ-butyrolactone at 60 °C followed by stirring the solution overnight. The CH3NH3PbI3 layer was deposited on the TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite substrate using a spin-coating method. It was followed by heating at 100 °C for 15 min. Finally, HTM and Ag electrodes were deposited in the same manner as discussed in the above section.
Characterization
The morphology of the ITO NW arrays was observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM-7600F, JEOL). The crystal structure and phase analysis of the ITO NW arrays were analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D-MAX 2500, Rigaku) with CuKα radiation. Furthermore, the ITO NWs were investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, JEM-3000F, JEOL). Photovoltaic properties were measured by using a potentiostat (CHI660, CHI instrument) and solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A class AAA, Newport). Optical absorbance spectra were recorded using a UV-Vis spectrometer (Lamda 35, Perkin-Elmer). The amount of dye molecules was determined by the desorbed dye in an alkaline alcoholic solution. The electron transport and recombination time were measured by intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) (Zahner, Zennium) with a red light-emitting diode (627 nm). The incident photon to current conversion efficiency was measured using an IPCE measurement system (PV measurements).
Results and discussion
Indium tin oxide (ITO) nanowires (NWs) were grown by a vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) method using Au catalysts on a glass substrate. Fig. 1(a) shows the FE-SEM image of ITO nanowires (NWs) grown on the ITO/glass substrate. The length of aligned ITO NWs is about 2 μm and the diameter is about 70 nm. Fig. 1(b) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the ITO NW array which is consistent with cubic In2O3 (JCPDS #76-0152). The electrical resistivity of the ITO NW array was 4.7 × 10−4 Ω cm, in good agreement with the previous results.19 Given that the relative intensity of the (400) peak is much stronger than the (222) peak for ITO NW arrays, ITO NWs are grown along the [100] direction.

For application of ITO NWs to ss-DSSCs, the TiO2 thin layer with about 20 nm thickness was deposited on ITO NWs by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD). Fig. 1(c) shows the HRTEM image of a TiO2 coated ITO NW, which demonstrates a conformal TiO2 coating on the ITO NW. The TiO2 thin layer was found to be in an anatase phase, optimized from our previous report.21Fig. 1(d) shows the HRTEM image of the ITO NW. The lattice image with a d-spacing of 0.51 nm for (200) is consistent with the lattice parameter of cubic In2O3. The selective area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of ITO NWs clearly show that ITO NWs are single crystalline and grown along the [100] direction (inset of Fig. 1(d)). To increase the surface area of the ITO NW-based photoelectrode, the TiO2 colloid penetrated into the ITO NW array by a spin-coating method. Fig. 1(e) presents the FESEM image of the TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite photoelectrode containing 20 nm TiO2 NPs and 2.1 μm long ITO NWs. The thickness of TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposites was varied by changing the number of spin coating, presented in ESI 1.† As illustrated in Fig. 1(f), the generated electrons are expected to be easily captured by ITO NWs which are able to play the role of antennas.

Fig. 2 shows the photovoltaic (PV) properties of TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite ss-DSSCs compared with conventional TiO2 NP ss-DSSCs. More information on variation of PV properties as a function of active layer thickness is presented in ESI 2.† As shown in Fig. 2(a), the photocurrent density for the TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite ss-DSSCs is dramatically increased from average current density 4.5 mA cm−2 at approximately 3.2 μm to 7.2 mA cm−2 at 4.8 μm thickness. In contrast, the maximum photocurrent density for TiO2 NP ss-DSSCs is 3.6 mA cm−2 at 2.1 μm thickness. The photocurrent density for the TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite photoelectrode with an optimal thickness of 4.8 μm is approximately 98% higher than that for the TiO2 NP photoelectrode with an optimal thickness of 2.1 μm. Over the same thickness range, the open circuit voltage (Voc) shows a similar trend with photocurrent density. The maximum Voc of TiO2 NP ss-DSSCs is approximately 800 mV (2.1 μm). In the case of TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite ss-DSSCs, Voc increases from 530 mV (3.2 μm) to 750 mV (4.8 μm), and then the Voc is decreased. This trend is related to the quasi-Fermi level and charge recombination. In the regime of a thinner thickness, the concentration of photoelectrons is not sufficient to increase the quasi-Fermi level enough to reach high Voc. Over maximum Voc, the concentration of photoelectrons is too high, which is a driving force for charge recombination. Also, the film thickness is too large to collect all the photoelectrons due to the limitation on the electron diffusion length.7 The nanocomposite ss-DSSCs exhibit lower fill factors than the TiO2 NP ss-DSSCs in the overall thickness range, ascribed to the deterioration of sheet resistance of ITO films after 450 °C heat-treatment. The original sheet resistance of the ITO film is approximately 10 Ω □−1. Further heat-treatment for the fabrication of photoelectrodes increases the sheet resistance by 40 Ω □−1, which is consistent with our previous results.22 The deteriorated conductivity of ITO films increases the series resistance, consequently reducing the fill factor. In contrast, the TiO2 NP ss-DSSCs employ the FTO films whose sheet resistance does not change after the same heat-treatment process.

The J–V characteristic of the best-performing cell is presented in ESI 3.† In the case of the TiO2 NP ss-DSSC under an irradiance of AM 1.5 conditions, we achieved the values of 3.82 mA cm−2, 820 mV, 0.69 and 2.17% for Jsc, Voc, fill factor (ff), and the power conversion efficiency (PCE), respectively. On the other hand, the TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite ss-DSSC shows the respective value of 6.30 mA cm−2, 774 mV, 0.61 and 3.0%, respectively. The PCE of the TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite ss-DSSC (4.8 μm) is about 40% higher than the TiO2 NP ss-DSSC (2.1 μm).
To understand the difference in the photovoltaic performance of the TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite ss-DSSC compared to the TiO2 NP ss-DSSC, the charge collection properties were investigated by analyzing intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS), intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and transient open circuit voltages. To improve the reliability of this analysis, the thickness of TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposites and TiO2 NP photoelectrodes were fixed at 4.8 μm and 4.5 μm, respectively. As presented in ESI 4,† the amount of dye adsorption is similar to each other at this thickness, implying that the number of photoelectrons is similar. The IMPS is related to the photoelectron transport time through the photoelectrode under short-circuit conditions, and the IMVS provides the information about the recombination time that the electrons generated from dyes and holes in HTM recombine under open circuit voltage conditions.23Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the IMVS and IMVS data as a function of light intensity, respectively. The results show that the TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite ss-DSSC has faster charge transport time (τc) and longer recombination time (τr) than TiO2 NP ss-DSSCs. Moreover, the transient Voc data which is another way to characterize the charge recombination time also support our result. The apparent recombination time of the photoelectrons can be evaluated by the following expression:24 (1)where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. Therefore, Fig. 3(c) shows the electron recombination time of TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite ss-DSSCs (red line), which is about 1 order longer than TiO2 NP ss-DSSCs (black line).

The superior photovoltaic performance of the TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite ss-DSSC, i.e. the higher photocurrent, would be attributed to several parameters. Photocurrent is in proportion to the product of light harvesting efficiency (ηlh), electron injection efficiency (ηinj), and charge collection efficiency (ηcc), expressed as follows.17 (2)
The light-harvesting property is directly related to the degree of dye loading. As aforementioned, these samples possessed a similar amount of dye adsorptions, which indicates that both ss-DSSCs should exhibit a similar light harvesting property. Moreover, the electron injection efficiency can be ignored because of employing the same dye molecules (Z907 dye) and TiO2 nanoparticles.12,25 Therefore, higher photocurrent of TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite ss-DSSCs is probably attributed to excellent charge collection efficiency.
As plotted in Fig. 4(a), the charge collection efficiency was calculated from the following expression:17 (3)
 Fig. 4  (a) Charge collection efficiency and (b) electron lifetimes, diffusion coefficients and electron diffusion lengths of the TiO2 NP (black line, 4.5 μm) and TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite ss-DSSCs (4.8 μm). 
The TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite ss-DSSC has higher charge collection efficiency (max.; ∼0.85) than the TiO2 NP ss-DSSC (max.; ∼0.7) over all light intensity ranges. These results originate from the fast charge transport time and longer recombination time, which ultimately increase the electron diffusion length. Fig. 4(b) shows the electron diffusion length (Ln), electron diffusion coefficient (Dn), and electron life time (τn) with respect to short circuit current (Jsc). The electron diffusion length is given by Ln = (Dτ)1/2, where D and τ are the diffusion coefficient and the life time of electrons, respectively. The electron diffusion length of TiO2 NP ss-DSSCs is in the range of 2.6–4.1 μm, consistent with already reported values.7 The TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite ss-DSSCs exhibit a longer electron diffusion length, 4.3–5.6 μm, which enables the collection of electrons that are generated in a deeper region. This is a reason why the TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite photoelectrode is capable of generating higher photocurrent by increasing the optimized thickness to 4.8 μm. At this thickness, the amount of dye loading for the TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite photoelectrode is 1.8 times higher than that for the TiO2 NP photoelectrode with an optimized thickness of 2.1 μm, which consequently yields 98% higher photocurrent density for the TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite ss-DSSCs.
To demonstrate the same effect of TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite photoelectrodes on inorganic–organic hybrid solar cells, we employed the perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 absorber instead of Z907 dye. The perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 absorber has a long absorption range and a high absorption coefficient, which is recently an emerging solar cell material. We fabricated TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposites and TiO2 NP photoelectrodes with a thickness of 900 and 500 nm, respectively. The thickness for each solar cell was optimized to perform the best photovoltaic property under the same conditions. Fig. 5 shows the PV properties of TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposites and TiO2 NP perovskite solar cells. In the case of the TiO2 NP perovskite solar cells, the typical photovoltaic characteristics are 11.9 mA cm−2, 0.87 V, 0.70 and 7.1% for Jsc, Voc, fill factor (ff), and the PCE, respectively. The TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite perovskite solar cell shows the respective value of 16.4 mA cm−2, 0.74 V, 0.63 and 7.5%. The photocurrent density for the nanocomposite perovskite solar cell is approximately 40% higher than the TiO2 NP perovskite solar cell. Also, the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the nanocomposite perovskite solar cell is higher than the TiO2 NP one in the overall wavelength. These results demonstrate the superior charge collection properties of TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite materials and their potentials for use as an efficient charge collector in the perovskite solar cells.

Conclusions
In summary, we synthesized single crystalline ITO NW arrays oriented along the [100] direction and fabricated TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposites for use as photoelectrode materials in ss-DSSCs. TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite ss-DSSCs have higher charge collection efficiency as well as a longer diffusion length compared with conventional TiO2 NP ss-DSSCs. The superior charge collection property of ITO NWs enabled the increase of the thickness of the photoelectrode to 4.8 μm, yielding 98% higher photocurrent than TiO2 NP ss-DSSCs. We also employed the TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposites in perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells, which exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.5%. Our study demonstrates that superior charge collection capability for TiO2 NP/ITO NW nanocomposite materials can make it viable to boost up the energy conversion efficiency of photo-energy conversion devices such as ss-DSSCs, quantum dot solar cells, and water-splitting photochemical cells.
