    , Accepted 23rd February 2015First published on 25th February 2015AbstractIn this study, a series of novel D–π–A porphyrin sensitizers with different alkyl chains were designed and synthesized for dye-sensitized solar cells. The effects of different alkyl chains (methyl, methoxyl and hexyloxy groups) on the photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic performance were investigated systematically. The results indicate that the molar extinction coefficients of three dyes normally increase as the alkyl chain length increases. Furthermore, it is also found that the incident photo-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs), short circuit current (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc) of the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on WH-C1, YD20 and WH-C2 increase with the elongation of alkyl chains in the order of WH-C1 < YD20 < WH-C2. Accordingly, under standard global air mass 1.5 solar conditions, the optimized WH-C2-sensitized cell could produce a high conversion efficiency (η) of 7.77%, with a Jsc of 13.10 mA cm−2, a Voc of 831.10 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.70.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as promising photovoltaic devices have attracted significant and extensive attention owing to their high power conversion efficiency, ease of fabrication and potential low cost compared with traditional silicon-based solar cells.1–5 It is well known that DSSCs are principally composed of working electrodes (dye-sensitized nanocrystalline oxide), electrolytes or hole-transporting materials (HTMs), and counter electrodes (CEs), where the dyes play a crucial role in determining the power conversion efficiency (PCEs) of the devices. In the past two decades, Ru polypyridyl sensitizers with PCEs of over 11%6–9 have been demonstrated to be very efficient due to their broad absorption spectrum through metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT), longer exciton lifetimes, and long-term chemical stability.2,5,10 However, the high cost of noble metal ruthenium, the requirement for careful synthesis, tricky purification steps and a low molar extinction coefficient10–12 restrict its large-scale application.
Recently, due to its low cost, high molar extinction coefficients and structural diversity, the porphyrin has been paid a great deal of attention to be utilized as one of the most popular sensitizers for DSSCs.13–19 As we all know, most of the efficient organic dyes have been designed according to basic structures of Donor-π-conjugated bridge-Accepter (simplified as D–π–A), which is beneficial to intramolecular electron transport. Inspired by this, the PCEs of the device sensitized by porphyrin have also been improved dramatically since the D–π–A structure was introduced into its backbone.20–27 At the same time, some high-performance D–π–A porphyrin dyes were designed rationally and synthesized for DSSCs.28–30 To our excitement, a record efficiency of 12.3% was achieved through the cosensitization of an organic dye Y123 with the porphyrin YD2-o-C8 based on D–π–A structure.31 In 2012, by substituting the dihexyl diphenylamine donor in YD2-o-C8 with a dimethoxyltriphenylamine donor, the optimized push–pull porphyrin YD20 has been successfully synthesized and it produced a PCE of 8.1% based on I−/I3− electrolyte.32 Recently, the DSSCs based on dye SM315 obtained through inserting a benzothiadiazole unit between the porphyrin ring and the benzoic acid acceptor achieved a world record liquid state efficiency of 13% with the utilization of a cobalt(II/III) redox electrolyte.33
Clearly, the performance of the DSSCs is closely related to molecular structures of sensitizers. Actually, the performance of porphyrin sensitized solar cells is limited by its serious aggregation and recombination, which also happen to the organic dyes.5,34 However, in the fields of organic dyes, some measurements have been taken to surmount their above problems. For instance, incorporation of the long alkoxy chain onto the backbone of organic dyes could efficiently inhibit the aggregation and recombination, resulting in great enhancement of both the Jsc and Voc.35 As a matter of fact, dye intermolecular aggregation on the TiO2 can also be inhibited through introducing long alkyl chains at conjugated spacers to enhance Jsc.31–33,36,37 Additionally, incorporating long alkyl chains at donors can effectively suppress charge recombination between the electrons injected into the conduction band of TiO2 and oxidized dyes or electrolyte, resulting in an improvement of Jsc and Voc.31,33,35–42 Therefore, based on the successful examples reported above on the organic dye, introducing long alkoxy chains onto the skeletons of the porphyrin dyes, which usually possess some short alkoxy groups, should be effective in inhibiting the intermolecular aggregation and electron recombination. Simultaneously, to date, few studies have reported the effect of different length alkyl chains on the photovoltaic performance of porphyrin-sensitized solar cells.
In this context, one of the most widely used porphyrin dyes, YD20 with a short methoxy group, was selected as the reference dye. In order to further improve the PCEs of solar cells based on YD20 as well as to gain more insight into the relationship between the structure of porphyrin dyes and the performance of DSSCs, we design and synthesize two novel porphyrin molecules (denoted as WH-C1 and WH-C2) through substituting the methoxy group on the donor of YD20 with a methyl and hexyloxy group, respectively. Furthermore, through photophysical, electrochemical, I–V curve, IPCE curve and EIS characterization methods, the relationship between the electron-donating ability as well as length of alkyl chains substituents at donors and the photovoltaic performance of the porphyrin-sensitized solar cells was systematically investigated. As a result, the optimized device sensitized by WH-C2 with a long hexyloxy group shows a best PCE of 7.7%.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
All reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification unless otherwise noted. THF and toluene was dried over sodium/benzophenone and freshly distilled before use. DMF used for formylation was dried over enough P2O5 for several hours and distilled under reduced pressure. Column chromatography of all the products was performed on silica gel (Kanto, Silica Gel 60N, spherical, 200–300 mesh), and some were further purified by recrystallization.
2.2 Characterization
UV-visible spectra of about 4 μm thick TiO2 film sensitized by as-synthesized dyes were performed on a PerKinElmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker-AV400 spectrometers with 400 MHz. The chemical shifts were recorded in parts per million (ppm) with TMS as the internal reference. ESI mass spectra were measured on Finnigan LCQ Advantage mass spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CVs) was carried out using a three-electrode system in an argon-purged electrolyte solution on a PARSTAT 2273 Electrochemical Workstation. Cyclic voltammograms for porphyrin dyes were conducted with a three-electrode cell equipped with a BAS glassy carbon (0.07 cm2) disk as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the auxiliary electrode, and a Ag/AgCl (saturated) reference electrode. The working electrode was polished with 0.03 μm alumina on felt pads (Buehler) and treated ultrasonically for 1 min before each experiment. The potential of the reference electrode was adjusted by recording the cyclic voltammogram for 0.01 M ferrocene in THF containing 0.1 M TBAPF6. The thickness of the films was measured with a profilometer (VeecoDektak 150). The melting points of WH-C2, YD20 and WH-C1 were measured on a Melting point meter, SG WRR, Shanghai Shenguang.

2.4 Device fabrication
A compact layer of TiO2 was deposited on the FTO-coated glass by spray pyrolysis deposition with di-isopropoxytitanium bis(acetyl acetonate) solution. Subsequently a 8 μm mesoporous TiO2 (particle size, 20 nm, PASOL HPW-18NR TiO2 nanopowders, JGC Catalysts and Chemicals Ltd, Japan) transparent electrodes and a 5 μm scattering layer were prepared by screen printing onto FTO-coated conducting glass layer by layer, which were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min, respectively. Then the working electrode was prepared by immersing the TiO2 film into the 0.2 mM dye solution (in Toluene/EtOH = 1/1, v/v) containing chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, 0.4 mM) at 25 °C overnight. A thermally platinized FTO glass counter electrode and the working electrode were then sealed with a 25 μm thick hot-melt film (Surlyn, Dupont) by heating the system at 100 °C. After sealing, the liquid electrolyte was injected into the cell through the hole predrilled in counter electrode and then the hole was sealed with Surlyn polymer and cover glass. The liquid electrolyte (Z959) consisted of 1.0 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII), 0.03 M iodine, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in a mixture of acetonitrile/valeronitrile (85:15, v/v).
2.5 Photovoltaic measurements
The complete DSSCs prepared under the same conditions were used to measure I–V, IPCE and EIS. Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley 2400 source/meter and a Newport solar simulator (model 91160) giving light with AM 1.5 G spectral distribution, which was calibrated using a certified reference solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE) to an intensity 100 mW cm−2. A black mask with a slightly smaller circular aperture (0.159 cm2) than the active area of the square solar cell (0.25 cm2) was applied on top of the cell. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a 150 W xenon lamp (Oriel) fitted with a monochromator (Cornerstone 260) as monochromatic light source. The illumination spot size was chosen to be slightly smaller than the active area of the DSSC test cells. IPCE photocurrents were recorded under short-circuit conditions using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The monochromatic photon flux was quantified by means of a calibrated silicon photodiode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the symmetric cell was measured using PARSTAT 2273 Electrochemical Workstation in the frequency range 0.1 to 106 Hz with 10 mV AC amplitude. The electrolyte used was the same as that used for the fully functional DSSCs. The distance between two electrodes was 45 μm and the active area was 0.8 cm2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis
In the present work, three porphyrin dyes with different alkyl chains at the donor were designed and synthesized for DSSCs based on I−/I3− electrolyte. Thereinto, YD20 dye reported previously32 is utilized as a reference dye to better understand the influence of different alkyl chains at donors on the photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs. The structures of dyes are shown in Fig. 1 and the synthetic scheme and detailed synthetic procedures are presented in Scheme 1 and the Experimental section, respectively. The molecular structures of all target porphyrins and intermediates were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and APCI/ESI-MS, which are given in the Experimental section.

3.2 Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of WH-C1, YD20 and WH-C2 in THF solution are depicted in Fig. 2(a). The corresponding peak positions and molar absorption coefficients (ε) of Soret and Q bands are listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2, the three sensitizers exhibit typical porphyrin absorption characteristics with a strong Soret band appearing in the range of 400–500 nm and mild Q bands appearing in the longer wavelength range of 600–700 nm, which is attributed to π–π* charge transfer transitions of the conjugated molecule and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions of the D–π–A conjugated backbone.17 From the absorption data in Table 1, it is shown that the Soret band and Q band peak positions for WH-C2, YD20 and WH-C1 are nearly the same. However, on one hand, the Soret band and Q band of WH-C2 and YD20 are broadened and red-shifted upon introduction of alkoxy chains to the donor at the meso-position opposite to the anchoring benzoic acid group.48 On the other hand, the measured peak molar extinction coefficients (ε) of the Soret band and Q band for three different porphyrin dyes show a significant difference. Compared with WH-C1, both WH-C2 and YD20 with alkoxy exhibit stronger absorption at the Soret band and Q band, which may be ascribed to the stronger electron-donating ability of hexyloxy and methoxy.48 It is clear that the molar extinction coefficients of the three dyes normally increase with increasing alkyl chain length, in agreement with the literature reported previously.35 The enhanced molar extinction coefficient may favor light harvesting and improve monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for DSSCs based on these sensitizers. Meanwhile, Fig. 2(b) presents the UV-visible absorption spectra of the sensitizers adsorbed on TiO2 films. In comparison with absorption spectra in solution, the trend of the Soret and Q band absorption spectra is similar when the sensitizers are adsorbed on TiO2 films. Nevertheless, the Soret and Q absorption bands are broadened and red-shifted conspicuously. This phenomenon is believed to result from the formation of J-aggregates.13,49,50 Additionally, the fluorescent emission spectra were measured in THF and shown in Fig. 3. For the fluorescence spectra, major emission bands are observed at 677, 677 and 679 nm for WH-C2, YD20 and WH-C1, respectively, which are similar to the trend of the Soret band absorption spectra. Therefore, it can be concluded that the light-capturing ability of the high molar extinction coefficient Zn porphyrin dyes can be enhanced by rational design of the electron donating moieties.47,51

3.3 Electrochemical properties
In order to investigate the feasibility of electron injection and dye regeneration processes in DSSCs, cyclic voltammetry measurements for the three dyes were performed in water-free THF containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte and cyclic voltammograms are displayed in Fig. 4. It is observed that electrochemical data for three dyes display quasi-reversible couples. The highest-occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of dyes corresponding to the first redox potential were calculated to be 0.82, 0.81 and 0.86 V for WH-C2, YD20 and WH-C1, respectively. Practically, it was confirmed that ηinj with unit efficiency requires approximately 0.2 V of over-potential (−ΔG) between the TiO2 conduction band (CB) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of dye, and 0.3 V of −ΔG between the dye highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and redox potential for sufficient driving forces of electron injection from the dye to the CB of TiO2 and the regeneration of oxidized dye.5,52 It is observed that the HOMO levels of three porphyrin dyes are sufficiently more positive than the iodine/iodide redox potential value (0.4 V vs. NHE),53 guaranteeing the efficient regeneration of the oxidized dye through I− presented in the electrolyte of the DSSCs. The zero–zero excitation energies (E0–0) were calculated to be 1.989 V (WH-C2), 1.998 V (YD20) and 1.976 V (WH-C1) by the intersection of the normalized UV-vis absorption spectrum and steady-state fluorescence emission spectrum. The lowest-unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) levels of all porphyrin sensitizers were determined according to the expression of LUMO = HOMO − E0–0 and the corresponding level values are summarized in Table 1. Obviously, the LUMO levels of all dyes are sufficiently more negative compared with the conduction band edge level (Ecb) of the TiO2 electrode (−0.5 V vs. NHE), which means that electron injection from the excited dye into the conduction band of TiO2 is thermodynamically feasible. Therefore, the three dyes are properly used as sensitizers for DSSCs.

3.4 Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
Monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for DSSCs is expressed as follows:5,54IPCE(λ) = ηLHEηinjηcc where ηLHE is the light harvesting efficiency, ηinj is the electron injection yield from the photo-excited dye into TiO2, and ηcc is the charge collection efficiency at the electrodes. Among them, ηLHE contributes to improvement of IPCE greatly. The IPCEs for DSSCs based on the three dyes are presented in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 5, it is observed obviously that two peaks are located in the range of 400–500 nm and 600–700 nm, respectively, which is consistent with UV-visible absorption spectra of the three dyes. As presented in Fig. 2(a), the molar extinction coefficients at Soret and Q bands for the three dyes are in order of WH-C2 > YD20 > WH-C1. It is found easily that the IPCEs for DSSCs based on the three dyes have the same order as that mentioned above. Compared with WH-C1, higher IPCEs of WH-C2 and YD20 are put down to their higher molar extinction coefficients and light harvesting efficiency. Additionally, IPCEs for WH-C2, YD20 and WH-C1 cover the whole UV-visible absorption range with the maxima of 66% at 460 nm, 63% at 460 nm and 55% at 450 nm, respectively. It is shown that the maximum IPCE of WH-C2 dye was increased by 4.5% compared to that of reference dye YD20. Consequently, it is demonstrated that introduction of long alkoxy chain can enhance the molar extinction coefficients at Soret and Q bands for porphyrins and result in an improvement of IPCEs.35,48

The current density–voltage (I–V) characteristic of the DSSCs sensitized by WH-C2, YD20 and WH-C1 are displayed in Fig. 6 and Table 2. Under standard global air mass 1.5 solar conditions, the WH-C1 sensitized cell gave a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 11.87 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 814.06 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.69, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 6.71%. Under the same conditions, the DSSCs for WH-C2 and YD20 with incorporation of hexyloxy or methoxy groups on the triphenylamine donor segment showed a Jsc of 13.10 and 12.54 mA cm−2, Voc of 831.10 and 817.71 mV, and FF of 0.70 and 0.68, corresponding to a η of 7.77% and 7.02%, respectively. To account for the influence of the substituent groups of the dyes on the Jsc value, the amount of dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 film was measured. It could be found in Table 1 that the adsorbed amounts of 0.36 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for WH-C2, 0.35 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for YD20, and 0.35 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for WH-C1 are almost the same. Therefore, it is obvious that the enhanced Jsc is not originated from their adsorbed amounts. Apparently, Jsc of DSSCs based on the three sensitizers increases with the elongation of alkyl chains in the order of WH-C1 < YD20 < WH-C2, which is in accordance with the electron-donating ability of alkyl chains namely methyl < methoxy < hexyloxy. Actually, the order of Jsc of DSSCs with the three sensitizers is in good agreement with the trend of molar extinction coefficients (as shown in Fig. 2) and IPCEs. In comparison with WH-C1 and YD20, the Jsc of WH-C2-sensitized solar cell is enhanced by 10.4% and 4.5%, respectively. So it has been well documented that the incorporation of the long alkoxy chain at the donor is beneficial to intramolecular charge transfer and improves the short circuit current dramatically. The photocurrents integrated from the IPCE spectra of WH-C2, YD20 and WH-C1 give a current density of 11.83, 10.79 and 10.16 mA cm−2, respectively, which is in good agreement with the measured photocurrent density. In addition, as seen from Table 2 and Fig. 6, the Voc of the devices sensitized by the three porphyrin dyes follows the order: Voc(WH-C2) > Voc(YD20) > Voc(WH-C1). It is clear that the Voc of DSSCs with YD20 is only higher by about 4 mV than that of DSSCs with WH-C1, which might be ascribed to their same alkyl chain length. Compared with YD20, the WH-C2-sensitized solar cell exhibits an open circuit voltage increase of 13.39 mV. The result is explained through the long hexyl chain that can prevent charge recombination between the electron injected into the conduction band of TiO2 and I3− in the vicinity of TiO2.27,39,40,48,55

3.5 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
To further investigate and elucidate the photovoltaic results and obtain more interfacial charge transfer information of the DSSC with the different dyes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also performed in the dark under a forward bias of −0.6 V. The Nyquist and Bode plots for WH-C2, YD20 and WH-C1 are shown in Fig. 7. As shown in the Nyquist plots (Fig. 7(a)), in the high frequency range over 106 Hz, the impedance is dominated by the ohmic serial resistance (Rs) of the dummy cell owing to the square resistance of the FTO glass substrate, where the phase is zero.5,56 As seen in Fig. 7(a), the first semicircle is assigned to impedances related to charge transport at the electrolyte/counter electrode interface. In the middle frequency range, the large semicircle is ascribed to the electron recombination resistance (Rrec) and chemical capacitance at the working electrode/electrolyte.57,58 It is obvious that the semicircle resulting from Rrec based on different dyes is in the order of WH-C1 < YD20 < WH-C2, indicating that the electron recombination resistance augments from WH-C1 to WH-C2.5 Considering that the different length of the alkyl chains, it could be concluded that the longer alkyl chain usually produces a higher recombination resistance. It is well known that the photovoltage of a DSSC is intrinsically influenced by the degree of electron recombination reaction.59 Based on the above conclusions, the order of the Voc(WH-C1 < YD20 < WH-C2) could be attributed to different electron recombination resistances caused by different alkyl chains. In the Bode phase plots Fig. 7(b), the middle-frequency peak stands for the charge-transfer process of the injected electrons in TiO2 corresponding to the second semicircle in Nyquist plots. The Bode phase plots likewise demonstrate the differences in the Rrec. Electron lifetime calculated through the relation τe = 1/(2πf) (f is the peak frequency of middle-frequency range in EIS Bode plot)60 can well explain the higher Voc of WH-C2-sensitized solar cells compared with that of WH-C1 and YD20. The electron lifetime τe was determined to be 19.86, 24.80 and 33.99 ms, for WH-C1, YD20 and WH-C2, respectively. The higher electron lifetime τe observed from WH-C2 indicated more effective repression of the charge recombination back reaction, which could be reflected in the improvements of Voc, resulting in improved device efficiency. In a word, it has been demonstrated that incorporation of a long alkoxy chain not only can enhance molar extinction coefficients of dyes but can also act as a blocking layer through suppression of the recombination reaction between the electron injected into the conduction band of TiO2 and I3− in the vicinity of TiO2.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we designed and synthesized a series of novel push–pull porphyrins possessing different alkyl chain substituents with electron-donating ability at donors. In order to systematically investigate the effect of different electron-donating ability of alkyl chains substituents at donors on the photovoltaic performance of the porphyrin-sensitized solar cells, we performed UV-vis absorption, cyclic voltammetry, photovoltaic performance, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements and so on. The Voc and Jsc of the devices sensitized by the three porphyrin dyes follows the order: WH-C2 > YD20 > WH-C1. Under standard global air mass 1.5 solar conditions, the highest power conversion efficiency was achieved by the solar cell based on the WH-C2 sensitizer with a long alkoxy group, which gave a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 13.10 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 831.09 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.70, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 7.77%. This study demonstrates that incorporation of long alkoxy chain is an effective method to enhance the molar extinction coefficients of dyes, suppress dye aggregation and recombination. For the purpose of further improving the power conversion efficiency of porphyrin-sensitized solar cells, further elaborate and rational design is of the essence.
