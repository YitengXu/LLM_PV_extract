    , Accepted 5th January 2009First published on 12th February 2009AbstractThree low bandgap conjugated polymers, i.e., PDTPBT-C8, PDTPBT-C6 and PDTPBT-C5, which consist of alternating N-alkyl dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole units and carry 1-octylnonyl, 1-hexylheptyl and 1-pentylhexyl as side chains, respectively, were synthesized. These polymers show strong absorption in the wavelength range of 600–900 nm with enhanced absorption coefficient as the length of alkyl chain decreases. The film morphology of the polymers and 1-(3-methoxycarbonyl)propyl-1-phenyl-[6,6]-C-61 (PCBM) blends is also dependent on the alkyl chain length. As the length decreases, the film becomes more uniform and the domian size decreases from 400–900 nm for PDTPBT-C8 to ∼50 nm for PDTPBT-C5. Bulk heterojunction photovoltaic solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated based on the blend of the polymers and PCBM with a weight ratio of 1:3. The device performance is dramatically improved as the length of the side chain decreases, due to enhanced film absorption coefficient and improved film morphology. With the polymer PDTPBT-C5, which carries the shortest alkyl chain, power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 2.80% has been achieved. This result indicates that optimizing the structure of the solublizing alkyl chain is also crucial for the design and synthesis of high performance PSC polymeric materials.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction polymer photovoltaic solar cells (PSCs) have been emerging as one of the attractive renewable energy sources for the possibility of chemically manipulating the material properties of the polymers combined with easy and cheap processing techniques.1 In the last few years, continuous development of new polymers together with optimizing the morphology of the active layer and device structure has led to dramatic improvement of the device performance. Single-layer and tandem PSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) beyond 5%2 and up to 6.5%,3 respectively, have been reported. Moreover, lifetimes of the devices have been significantly improved, and an appropriate industrial processing technique has also been developed.4
In typical bulk-heterojunction PSCs, conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives (e.g, 1-(3-methoxycarbonyl)propyl-1-phenyl-[6,6]-C-61 (PCBM)) function as the light-absorbing/electron-donating and electron-accepting materials, respectively.5 Therefore, the energy gap and film absorption coefficient of conjugated polymers are two of the most important parameters to be optimized for efficient harvesting of the solar energy, and hence realizing high performance PSCs. The solar spectrum covers a very broad wavelength from ultraviolet to near-infrared (NIR) regions. Theoretically, the ideal bandgap of conjugated polymers for PSCs should be around 1.5 eV.6 However, most conjugated polymers reported so far, e.g., polythiophenes (PThs) and poly(phenylene vinylene)s (PPVs),7,8 exhibit optical bandgaps larger than or around 2.0 eV, and therefore can only harvest visible light. This mismatch of the absorption to the solar spectrum significantly limits the device performance of PSCs. Therefore, development of NIR-absorbing or low-bandgap polymers is very important.
To construct polymers consisting of alternating electron-rich and electron-deficient aromatic units is the most successful strategy to lower the optical bandgap of the conjugated polymers.9 Various electron-deficient units, e.g., electron-deficient heterocycles,10,11 perylene diimides,12 and cyanovinylenes,13 and several electron-rich units, e.g., thiophene, pyrrole, fluorene and carbazole, have been used to construct low bandgap polymers. However, of those with NIR absorption,10d,e,i,14 only a few exhibit PCE beyond 1%.10e,14e–f
Dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole is an easily made aromatic unit, which has been used to synthesize PTh-like soluble conducting homo-polymers15 and copolymers for PSCs16 and thin film transistors (TFTs).17 Herein, we report the synthesis of donor (D)–acceptor (A) type low bandgap polymers consisting of alternating dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole units for bulk-heterojunction PSCs, and the length of the alkyl side-chain was optimized in order to improve device performance.

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) measurements were carried out on an Agilent 5975/6890N GC-MS instrument equipped with an Agilent HP-5 column (30 m) with 1,4-bishexyloxy-benzene as the internal reference. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker/AutoflexIII Smartbean MALDI Mass Spectrometer with dithranol as the matrix. GPC measurements were conducted on a Waters 510 system equipped with a Waters 410 Differential refractometer using polystyrene as standard and THF as the eluent. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was run on a TA Instruments Q100 DSC under a flow of N2 at heating/cooling rates of 10 °C·min−1. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-vis-NIR spectrometer. All films for absorption measurements were spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 1 min with the solution concentration of 5 mg·mL−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a CHI660a electrochemical analyzer with a three-electrode cell in a solution of 0.1 mol · L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 100 mV·s−1. A glassy carbon electrode with a diameter of 10 mm, a Pt wire, and a saturated calomel electrode were used as the working electrode, the counter electrode, and the reference electrode, respectively. The potential was calibrated against the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were estimated by the equations: HOMO = −(4.80 + Eonsetox), and LUMO = −(4.80 + Eonsetred).19 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed in tapping mode on a SPA400HV instrument with an SPI 3800 controller (Seiko Instruments).
Photovoltaic device fabrication and characterization
The PSCs were fabricated with the device structure of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/polymer:PCBM/LiF/Al. The ITO glass was pre-cleaned and modified by a 30 nm PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P4083) layer which was spin-cast from a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution on the ITO substrate, and was dried subsequently at 120 °C for 30 min. The active layer of the blend of polymer and PCBM was prepared by spin-coating the chlorobenzene solution of the polymers and PCBM (1:3, w/w) with the polymer concentration of 6 mg/mL on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode. The thickness of the active layer was controlled to ca. 80–140 nm by adjusting the rotating speed of the spin-coating. Then the LiF/Al cathode was deposited at a vacuum level of 4 × 10−4 Pa. The thicknesses of the LiF and Al layers are 1 and 100 nm, respectively. The effective area of the unit cell is 12 mm2. The current–voltage (I–V) measurement of the devices was conducted on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit. A xenon lamp (500 W) was used as the white light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW/cm2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a Model SR830 DSP Lock-in Amplifier coupled with a SBP500 monochromator, a DSC102 data acquisition system and a Model SR540 chopper controller. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photodiode.

The structures and synthetic route to the polymers are shown in Fig. 1 and Scheme 1, respectively. Compound 7a was prepared according to the literature procedure.15 Compounds 7b and 7c were synthesized in an identical approach. First, alcohols 2b,c were prepared from ethyl formate 1 by reaction with 2 equiv of Grignard reagent. Next, N-substituted phthalimides 3b,c were prepared using a Mitsunobu reaction from 2b,c, and were finally converted to 4b,c by hydrazinolysis. Dithienopyrroles (DTP) 6b,c was synthesized via Buchwald–Hartwig reaction of 3,3′-dibromo-2,2′-bithiophene (5)18 and 4b,c in yields of 78% and 87%, respectively. Compounds 6b,c were converted to 7b,c by deprotonation with n-butyllithium followed by addition of trimethyltin chloride in yields of 43% and 77%, respectively. Subsequently, polymers PDTPBT-C8, PDTPBT-C6 and PDTPBT-C5 were synthesized by Stille coupling10h between 7a,b,c and 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole with Pd2dba3 as catalyst in yields of 82, 82 and 88%, respectively. All of the three polymers are soluble in common organic solvents, such as THF, chloroform and chlorobenzene. The molecular weights and the polydispersity indices (PDIs) measured by GPC with THF as eluent and polystyrene as the standard are listed in Table 1.

Thermal properties
The thermal stability of PDTPBT-Cn was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1, the three polymers are thermally stable with 1% weight-loss temperatures of 345, 344 and 361 °C, respectively. No phase transitions below the decomposition temperatures were observed from DSC measurements.

Photophysical properties
Absorption spectra of the polymers were recorded in both solution (CHCl3) and film, and related data are collected in Table 2. In solution, the polymers exhibit two distinct vibronic absorption peaks (Fig. 3a) with wavelength identical to poly[cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT),10e a state-of-the-art NIR-absorbing polymer for PSCs. This indicates that PDTPBT-Cn have a rigid chain-conformation. The film absorption spectra are 7–13 nm red-shifted in comparison to those in solution with the maxima of 776, 777 and 771 nm for PDTPBT-C8, PDTPBT-C6 and PDTPBT-C5, respectively (Table 2). The optical bandgaps of PDTPBT-Cn in the solid state were estimated to be around 1.42 eV (Table 2), which is close to the ideal bandgap of the conjugated polymers for PSCs.6a Compared with homo-polymers of N-substituted DTPs,15 the film absorption spectra of the current polymers exhibit a red-shift of up to 230 nm. As shown in Fig. 3b, all of the three polymers show strong absorption between 600 and 900 nm, which are in the maximum flux region of the solar emission spectrum.20 It is known that, in addition to the bandwidth of the absorption, high absorption coefficient of conjugated polymer is very important for efficiently harvesting photons and thereby getting large short circuit current in PSCs.21 As shown in Fig. 3b, the film absorption coefficients of the polymers increase as the length of alkyl chains decreases, and the films of PDTPBT-C5 and PDTPBT-C6 can absorb 60 and 35% more light than PDTPBT-C8 at the same thickness.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical characteristics of the polymers in thin film were studied by cyclic voltammetry with Bu4NPF6 (0.1 M in acetonitrile) as the electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mV·s−1. As shown in Fig. 4, all of the three polymers exhibited one reversible reduction process and one broad oxidation process. The oxidation onsets (Eonsetox) of PDTPBT-Cn have minor differences, which are 0.09, 0.06 and 0.01 V vs. Fc/Fc+ (Table 2), respectively, while the reduction onsets (Eonsetred) are same (−1.72 V). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels and electrochemical bandgaps (Eecg) of the polymers calculated from Eonsetox and Eonsetred are listed in Table 2. The three polymers have the same LUMO levels at −3.08 eV, and their HOMO levels have minor difference in the range of −4.81 to −4.89 eV. For comparison, the HOMO and LUMO levels of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) were also measured under the same conditions, which are −4.86 eV and −2.46 eV, respectively. The electrochemical bandgaps are 0.3–0.4 eV larger than optical bandgaps, which is also observed in other polymers measured by a similar method.22

Photovoltaic properties
The PSCs with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM(1:3, w/w)/LiF/Al were fabricated, and the film thickness were optimized. Depicted in Fig. 5 are the typical absorption and EQE spectra. The shapes of the EQE spectra are identical to the absorption spectra (Fig. 5a), indicating that all the absorption of the polymers contributed to the photovoltaic conversion. As shown in Fig. 5b, the EQE values of PDTPBT-C6 and PDTPBT-C5 in the wavelength range from 350 to 800 nm are noticeably higher than PDTPBT-C8. At 429 nm, PDTPBT-C5 exhibits an EQE of 39%, and the EQE is still as high as 27% at 800 nm. This is among the best for the polymers with absorption edge beyond 800 nm.10e,14e

The photovoltaic properties of the devices with different polymer:PCBM (1:3) thicknesses are listed in Table 3, and Fig. 6 shows the illuminated I–V curves of the PSCs based on PDTPBT-C8, PDTPBT-C6 and PDTPBT-C5 with a film thickness of 90 nm. The best performance was obtained at the thickness of 90 nm for PDTPBT-C8 and PDTPBT-C5, and 100 nm for PDTPBT-C6. The best device of PDTPBT-C8 shows an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.43 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 6.19 mA/cm2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.46, leading to a PCE of 1.23%. The best device of PDTPBT-C6 shows a Voc of 0.43 V, a Jsc of 11.1 mA/cm2, and a FF of 0.43, leading to a PCE of 2.06%. The polymer PDTPBT-C5 exhibits the highest PCE of 2.80%, ascribed to the largest Voc of 0.54 V, although Jsc (11.9 mA/cm2) and FF (0.44) are similar to those of PDTPBT-C6.

 Fig. 6  
I–V curves of the polymer solar cells based on PDTPBT-Cn with a polymer:PCBM (1:3) thickness of 90 nm. 
It has been reported that film morphology could significantly affect the performance of PSCs.23 Therefore, the film morphology of PDTPBT-Cn:PCBM (1:3) was studied in order to understand the reason for the improved device performance as the length of the alkyl chain decreases. As shown in Fig. 7, tapping-mode AFM studies show that the films for all three polymers have a low root mean square (RMS) roughness, which are 0.59, 0.80 and 0.35 nm for PDTPBT-C8, PDTPBT-C6 and PDTPBT-C5, respectively. However, the films have very different morphologies. The film of PDTPBT-C8:PCBM exhibits phase separation into large islands with a domain size of 400–900 nm. The film of PDTPBT-C6:PCBM also shows phase separate into islands, but the domains are more regular and the size is smaller (100–150 nm). PDTPBT-C5:PCBM exhibits the best film morphology, and the AFM images indicate a much more uniform mixing of PDTPBT-C5 and PCBM with a domain size of ∼50 nm, as shown in Fig. 7c,f. This alkyl chain length induced difference of film morphology and accordingly variation of Voc were also observed in other polymer systems.24 Meanwhile, hole only device measurements of PDTPBT-C8, PDTPBT-C6 and PDTPBT-C5 indicate that the length of the alkyl chain has a negligible effect on mobility. Consequently, the improved PSC performance with the decrease of the length of alkyl chain can tentatively be attributed to the improved film morphology and the more efficient harvest of light. It is worth noting that the device performance of PDTPBT-C5 is better than those of most of the NIR-absorbing polymers and comparable to that of the state-of-the-art NIR-absorbing polymer PCPDTBT with similar device structure and fabrication conditions,10e,i but its synthesis is straightforward and much easier than PCPDTBT. We expect further improvement of the device performance through optimization of polymer structure, film morphology and device configuration.2d

Conclusions
A series of conjugated copolymers comprising alternating dithienopyrrole and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole units and carrying alkyl side chains with different lengths were synthesized by Stille coupling polymerization. These polymers are thermally stable with decomposition temperatures beyond 340 °C, and show a strong absorption at 600–900 nm with increased film absorption coefficient as the length of the alkyl chain decreases. Bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells with the polymers as donor and PCBM as acceptor (polymer:PCBM = 1:3, w/w) were fabricated. The device performance was improved dramatically with a decrease of the alkyl chain length. Polymer PDTPBT-C5 exhibits the best device performance with a power conversion efficiency of 2.80%. The enhanced performance from PDTPBT-C8 to PDTPBT-C6 and then to PDTPBT-C5 can tentatively be ascribed to the increased absorption coefficients and the improved film morphology as the length of alkyl chain decreases. Easy synthesis and structural modification of the dithienopyrrole unit together with possible device performance improvement through optimization of the film morphology and device configuration make this type of polymer promising donor materials for high performance polymer solar cells.
