    , Accepted 26th September 2015First published on 28th September 2015AbstractWe have successfully integrated two effective strategies to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of bulk heterojunction inverted small molecule solar cells (i-SMSCs) by doping a ZnO cathode with a fullerene derivative (ZnO–C60) followed by fullerene derivative self-assembled monolayer (SAM) modification on its surface in contact with the active layer. Such ZnO–C60 gives a fullerene-derivative-rich interface in contact with the active layer and enhanced surface conductivity relative to pristine ZnO (from 0.015 to 1.09 S cm−1) and bulk electron mobility (from 1.23 ± 0.39 × 10−4 to 6.43 ± 0.35 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1).

Further incorporation of fullerene derivatives (NPC60-OH and NPC70-OH) as a SAM on ZnO–C60 effectively passivates the electron traps on the ZnO–C60 surface, resulting in increased electron mobility. The device using the ZnO–C60 nanofilm with phenol substituted C70 (NPC70-OH) as the SAM gives a further promoted PCE of up to 9.14%, which is the best value among the reported values in i-SMSCs.
Introduction
Among different photovoltaic technologies developed for organic solar cells,1 bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) small molecule solar cells (SMSCs) have attracted considerable attention for their advantages of promising flexibility, low production cost, high purity, and absence of batch to batch variations in molecular weight and polydispersity.2,3 In 2012, Heeger and coworkers developed a solution-processable small molecule 5,5′-bis{(4-(7-hexylthiophen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo [3,4-c]pyridine}-3,3′-di-2-ethylhexylsilylene-2,2′-bithiophene (DTS(PTTh2)2), which was based on a acceptor/donor/acceptor (A/D/A) framework with donor end-capping units.4 The DTS(PTTh2)2 has a low band gap (1.5 eV) able to absorb a broad range of sunlight (350–800 nm) through intramolecular charge transfer and high hole mobility (0.12 cm2 V−1 s−1) due to the ability of the highly planar structure to promote intermolecular π–π stacking. The device based on DTS(PTTh2)2:PC71BM gave a PCE of 6.7%, which is an important progress for solution processed conventional small molecule solar cells (c-SMSCs). As the acceptor units of DTS(PTTh2)2 were modified by the electron-withdrawing group, fluorine, the resulting structure is 7,7′-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) (p-DTS(FBTTh2)2) and its PCE was 7.0%.5 Further improvement of c-SMSCs has been made by replacing calcium (Ca) with ZnO nanoparticles6 or barium (Ba)7 as the cathode interlayer inserted between the active layer and the aluminum (Al) cathode to obtain a PCE of 8.94% and 9.02%, respectively, by effectively increasing electron collection and reducing charge recombination. Y. Chen and coworkers reported a series of oligothiophene-like small molecules (5Z,5′Z)-5,5′-((3,3′′′′,3′′′′′,3′′′′′′,4′,4′′-hexaoctyl-[2,2′:5′,2′′:5′′,2′′′:5′′′,2′′′′:5′′′′,2′′′′′:5′′′′′,2′′′′′′-sepithiophene]-5,5′′′′′′diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(3-ethyl-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one) (DRCN7T) as the active material for c-SMSCs giving a PCE of 7.60%,8 which was further promoted to 9.30% as poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) was introduced as the cathode interlayer to reduce the energy barrier between the active layer and the cathode for improving the charge collection efficiency. Furthermore, the backbone was optimized by changing the number of oligothiophene from 7 of DRCN7T to 5 of (2,2′-((5Z,5′Z)-5,5′-((3,3′′′,3′′′′,4′-tetraoctyl-[2,2′:5′,2′′:5′′,2′′′:5′′′,2′′′′-quinque thiophene]-5,5′′′′-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(3-ethyl-4-oxothiazolidine-5,2-diylidene))dimalononitrile) (DRCN5T), the device using DRCN5T with PFN as the cathode interlayer gave a certified PCE of 10.10%,9 which is highest PCE reported for single-junction c-SMSCs to date.10,11
In order to avoid using low work function metals as the cathode for promoting the ambient stability of devices, inverted small molecule solar cells (i-SMSCs) are so designed to be able to use air-stable high work function metals (Au, Ag) as the hole collecting electrode, and air-stable ZnO or TiOx as the electron collecting interlayer between the electron collection electrode ITO and the active layer.12,13 Such a i-SMSC device structure can reduce degradation upon prolonged exposure to air resulting from the use of air-stable metal cathodes.14 Its PCE can be promoted by the strategy of cathode interlayer modification. As p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM was used as the active layer and ZnO as the electron collecting interlayer, the corresponding i-SMSC gave a PCE of 6.29%, which was further improved to 7.88% (ZnO/PEIE)15 as PEIE was introduced as the cathode interlayer. Here PEIE contains simple aliphatic amine groups, which can substantially reduce the work function of the ITO electrode16 and consequently the extent of trap-assisted recombination, resulting in an increase of PCE. The PCE of 7.88% is the highest value reported for i-SMSCs so far.
Since two modification methods of doped cathode17,18 and self-assembled monolayer (SAM)19,20 in inverted polymer solar cells (i-PSCs) can lead to a promotion of their PCEs, we expect that a similar modification for i-SMSCs could also improve the performance, which has not been reported before. A brief review on the doped ZnO cathode and SAM modification for i-PSCs is given below. Chen and coworkers used organic fullerene derivative-doped ZnO as the cathode for inverted polymer solar cells (i-PSC) with a low band gap polymer PTB7-Th and improved the PCE significantly from 7.64% to 9.35%.18 Doping of the electron collecting interlayer can create an additional electronic state, which provides a new pathway for charge transport. In addition, the doping can result in promoted conductivity and allow for the formation of quasi-ohmic contacts between the active layer and the electrode.21 On the other hand, the insertion of an SAM of fullerene derivatives19 on the ZnO surface was also found to effectively reduce the extent of charge recombination at the interface and therefore provided an improvement in the PCE for an inverted polymer solar cell using P3HT:PC61BM from 3.47% to 4.4%.20
Here we report a simple and effective method to improve the PCE of BHJ i-SMSCs by the integration of a ZnO–C60 nanofilm and SAM modification. Such ZnO–C60 results in a fullerene-derivative-rich interface in contact with the active layer and enhanced surface conductivity (relative to the pristine ZnO) and bulk electron mobility.18 Using this ZnO–C60 as the cathode, the device with the active layer p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM (the chemical structures of all the materials used and their energy levels or work functions are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively) gives a PCE of 8.3% higher by 2.22% than that using ZnO without doping, 6.08%. The incorporation of a SAM on the top of ZnO–C60 can further eliminate the hydroxyl groups on the ZnO–C60 surface, and therefore reduce the extent of electron/hole recombination and enhance the electron extraction from the active layer. The ZnO–C60 nanofilm with NPC70-OH as the SAM gives a further promoted PCE of 9.14%. This PCE of 9.14% is the best among the reported i-SMSCs so far.

Experimental
i-SMSC fabrication
For the i-SMSC, a thin film of ZnO was prepared similar to the previously reported procedures,18 in which ZnO precursor solution was spin-cast at 5000 rpm on top of a cleaned ITO, and then sintered at 180 °C for 1 h in air, resulting in a transparent ZnO thin film with a thickness about 40 nm. The ZnO precursor solution was prepared by dissolving zinc acetate dihydrate (C4H6O4Zn·2(H2O) 99.5% from Merck, 1 g) and monoethanolamine (HOCH2CH2NH2, 98% from Acros, 0.252 g) in 2-methoxyethanol (10 ml) under stirring for 8 h for the hydrolysis reaction and aging. But the HOCH2CH2NH2 weight ratio is different from previously reported procedures (0.28 g).18 And the ZnO–C60 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving zinc acetate dihydrate (995 mg), PCBE-OH (5 mg) and monoethanoamine in 2-methoxyethanol (10 ml) under stirring for 8 h for the hydrolysis reaction and aging. Then, the ZnO or ZnO–C60 film on ITO is soaked in 0.1 mM fullerene derivative solution (NPC70-OH and NPC60-OH) in CB/THF (1:1, by v/v) for 10 min at room temperature and then washed with a clean solvent (the same solvent as in the corresponding solution). On top of the modified ZnO–C60 (ZnO) or pristine ZnO–C60 (ZnO) film, a thin layer (about 100 nm) of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM(3:2, w/w) was spin-cast in a N2-filled glovebox from its solution in chlorobenzene/1,8-diiodooctane (99.6:0.4, v/v) with the overall concentration of 35 mg ml−1. The prepared solutions were heated at 90 °C before film casting for 15 min. The coated films were annealed at 70 °C for 10 min to evaporate the residual solvent and additional annealing at 80 °C for 5 min was performed to obtain the optimum result. All the procedures were carried out in a glovebox with N2, except those for ITO cleaning, and precursor spin coating for ZnO and ZnO–C60. Finally, a thin layer of MoOx (about 10 nm) covered with a layer of Ag (100 nm) as the anode was deposited successively in a vacuum thermal evaporator through a shadow mask at a pressure of less than 2 × 10−6 torr. The active area of the device is about 6.5 mm2.
Results and discussion
ZnO–C60 and pristine ZnO nano-films (40 nm) were prepared by spin-casting from the solution of 0.5 wt% [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid 2-hydroxyethyl ester (PCBE-OH) and 99.5 wt% Zn(Ac)2 (1 g, total) and the solution without PCBE-OH both in the solution of 2-methoxyethanol (10 ml) and ethanolamine (0.252 g) on top of ITO and then sintering at 180 °C for 1 h. The procedure is illustrated in Scheme 1 and the detailed preparation of the ZnO–C60 nano-film was in accordance with that in our previous report.18

We then used the ZnO or ZnO–C60 coated ITO as the cathode for the i-SMSC with the device structure ITO/ZnO or ZnO–C60/p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM/MoOx/Ag. The device performances were measured under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G illumination and their current density versus voltage (J–V) profiles are shown in Fig. 2a and b and their characteristic values are listed in Table 1. For each i-SMSC, 10 pieces of the device are tested and its average value and deviation as well as the maximum PCE are given. The reproducibilities are quite good as manifested by the small variation in PCE, for example, the average PCEs are 5.96 ± 0.12% and 8.17 ± 0.13% for ZnO and ZnO–C60 based devices, respectively. The device with ZnO–C60 gives remarkably increased performance relative to that with ZnO, as the PCE increases from 6.08% to 8.30%; all the three corresponding parameters (open circuit voltage (Voc), the short-circuit current density (Jsc), and the fill factor (FF)) were also improved from 0.775 V, 12.33 mA cm−2, and 63.6%, to 0.785 V, 14.34 mA cm−2, and 73.7%, respectively. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements of these devices show overall enhancement in the entire absorption range when ZnO–C60 is used to replace ZnO as the cathode (Fig. 2c and d), which implies that the increase of current density results from more efficient electron collection by the ZnO–C60 than ZnO. With the ZnO–C60 cathode, the EQEs from 500 to 700 nm and 375 to 500 nm are in the range of 69–73% and 50–61%, which are much higher than those with ZnO 59–63% and 41–50%, respectively. The ZnO–C60 shows additional absorption in the range of 400–500 nm as compared to ZnO, indicating the occurrence of doping by generating additional electronic states in the bandgap and hence resulting in the improvement of EQE in the range from 400 nm to 500 nm in the case of ZnO–C60 as compared to ZnO.18 The additional electron collection enhancement can also be manifested by the calculations of series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) as shown in Table S1.† For the device with ZnO–C60 as the cathode, a significant drop in Rs and a drastic increase in Rsh relative to those with ZnO are found under illumination and dark.

In order to further improve electron collection for further PCE enhancement, insertion of a SAM on the ZnO and ZnO–C60 is performed. The fullerene derivatives for use as the SAM were prepared by substitution of C70 or C60 with phenol to give NPC70-OH or NPC60-OH and their molecular structures are shown in Fig. 1a. The SAM coated ZnO–C60 and ZnO were obtained by soaking them into the solution of NPC70-OH or NPC60-OH in the mixed solvent (CB/THF, 1:1 v/v) for 10 minutes and then rinsed with the same mixed solvent to remove nonbonding residual SAM on the surface, and subsequently dried for further characterization by contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and charge transport measurements. The detailed procedures for the preparation of the SAM materials are described in the ESI.† The fullerene derivatives are able to form chemical bonding on the surface of ZnO–C60 (or ZnO) through the reaction of their phenolic hydroxy groups with –OH groups on ZnO or ZnO–C60 surfaces.24,25
The contact angle measurements with a water drop as the probe for the SAM treated electrodes are shown in Fig. S1.† The ZnO–C60 and ZnO modified with NPC70-OH give higher extent of improved hydrophobicity (from 47° to 82° and from 28° to 77°, respectively) than those with NPC60-OH (47° to 70° and from 28° to 60°) and the hydrophobicity of ZnO–C60 with or without the same modifications is better than that of ZnO with the corresponding modifications.
XPS measurements for the carbon analysis on the surfaces of the treated and pristine ZnO–C60 (ZnO) are shown in Fig. 3 to further ensure that the change of the contact angle is indeed due to the presence of the SAM bound on ZnO–C60 (or ZnO) rather than by other sources. When the SAM is bound on the ZnO–C60 (ZnO) surface, its intensity of the carbon binding energy C1s should be stronger than that without SAM, since the SAMs (NPC70-OH and NPC60-OH) are primarily composed of carbon atoms. The C1s spectra in Fig. 3a and b for the substrates of ZnO and ZnO–C60, each show a major peak and a very weak peak; the major peak is attributed to the carbons of C–O–R for ZnO (285 eV) and aromatics for ZnO–C60 (285.7 eV), while the weak peak (289.5 eV) is from the carbonyl group.18 Upon coating both substrates with the fullerene derivative SAM, the major C1s peaks grow dramatically and shift to 284.7 eV attributed to the fullerene derivatives.26,27 The intensity of NPC70-OH is stronger than that of NPC60-OH due to the more number of carbon in the former than in the latter. The XPS results clearly indicate that both treated substrates are fully covered with the fullerenes.

In the fullerene-doped ZnO (ZnO–C60), new energy levels in the ZnO bandgap were found to be generated and the created electronic states allow for an improvement in conductivity relative to ZnO.18 The resulting surface conductivity increases by a factor of 73 from 0.015 (ZnO) to 1.09 (ZnO–C60) S cm−1, indicating that ZnO–C60 would allow an improvement in charge transport relative to ZnO.18 To examine the effect on charge transport after the SAM modification on ZnO or ZnO–C60, we measured electron mobility (μ) with or without SAM across the film by applying single carrier space charge limited conduction (SCLC) on the electron-only devices. The devices were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/Al/ZnO or ZnO–C60/SAM or without/Al. Since the work function of Al is −4.3 eV, it can be used to fabricate the electron-only SCLC device. The Mott–Gurney law was applied based on the trap-free assumption:28J = 9εε0μ(V–Vbi)2/8L3, where ε0 (8.85 × 10−12 A2 S4 Kg−1 m−3) is the permittivity of free space, ε is the dielectric constant of the sol–gel ZnO (the dielectric constant ε is taken as 8 (ref. 29)), μ is carrier mobility, V is the applied voltage across device, L is the thickness of the film, Vbi is the built-in potential, and Vbi is the difference of the work functions of the anode and the cathode (in this device structure, Vbi is taken as zero since aluminum is used for both electrodes). The results are shown in Fig. S2.† The electron mobility of the sample was deduced from the plot of ln(J) vs. 2ln(V) and listed in Table S2.† The average μ is based on the measurements of more than three device samples. All of the electron mobilities for these devices are higher than those for the devices without SAM, and the electron mobility of ZnO decreases in the sequence NPC70-OH (2.33 ± 0.33 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) > NPC60-OH (1.50 ± 0.35 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) > without (1.23 ± 0.39 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1); and ZnO–C60 decreases in the same sequence NPC70-OH (1.49 ± 0.31 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) > NPC60-OH (1.01 ± 0.25 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) > without (6.43 ± 0.35 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). The SAM modification effectively passivates the electron traps on the ZnO surface by the elimination of hydroxyl groups on the ZnO surface,19,20 and therefore enhances the electron mobilities. Furthermore, the SAM also provides direct contact with PC71BM at the interface of the active layer, allowing an effective extraction of electrons from the active layer. In addition the NPC70-OH modified ZnO–C60 (or ZnO) shows the highest electron mobility among all the devices.
The electrochemical properties of NPC60-OH and NPC70-OH measured using cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S3 and Table S3†) were obtained with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in the mixed solvent (THF/CB/acetonitrile(1:1:1,v/v/v)) as the electrolyte solution, a platinum foil as the working electrode, and another platinum foil as the counter electrode, and a Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. The reduction potentials (Ered) of NPC60-OH and NPC70-OH are −0.50 ± 0.015 V and −0.41 ± 0.010 V, respectively, and the corresponding electron affinities (EAs) are −4.21 ± 0.015 eV and −4.3 ± 0.010 eV as determined by the equation (EA = −e(Ered + 4.71 V)).23 The EA of NPC70-OH is lower than that of NPC60-OH by 0.09 eV reflecting a possibility to obtain better contact with PC71BM (−4.3 eV) in the active layer and thus contributing positively to the PCE. The energy levels so determined along with those of the other materials taken from the literature are summarized in Fig. 1b.
We applied the SAMs described above to the i-SMSC with the device structure ITO/ZnO or ZnO–C60/SAM or without/p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM/MoOx/Ag and examined their performances under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G illumination as shown in Fig. 2a and b with their characteristic values listed in Table 1. For the devices with modified ZnO (including NPC70-OH and NPC60-OH), the efficiency enhances appreciably from 6.08% (pristine ZnO) to 6.45% (NPC60-OH treated ZnO), and to 6.97% (NPC70-OH treated ZnO). For the devices with modified ZnO–C60, the efficiency also enhances appreciably from 8.3% (pristine ZnO–C60) to 8.76% (NPC60-OH treated ZnO–C60), and to 9.14% (NPC70-OH treated ZnO–C60). This NPC70-OH treated ZnO–C60 reaches the maximum PCE of 9.14% with the average of 8.89 ± 0.25%, which is higher than that of the NPC60-OH treated one with a PCE (max) of 8.76% and a PCE (ave) of 8.63 ± 0.13%. It is also worth mentioning that this 9.14% value is the highest among the reported values for i-SMSCs. The PCE improvement by SAM modification can be mainly attributed to the promoted Jsc and FF, which implies that the SAM effectively reduces the extent of electron/hole recombination and increases the electron extraction. The promoted Jsc is consistent with the EQE measurement, which shows the enhancement in the absorption range from 380 to 700 nm when the SAMs are introduced (Fig. 2c and d). The additional electron collection enhancement can also be manifested by calculating serial resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) from the reciprocals of the slopes of the J–V curves under illumination and dark.12 For the case of ZnO with SAM modification, a significant drop in Rs and a drastic increae in Rsh are shown in Table S1.† It represents that SAM can reduce the interfacial contact resistance and electron–hole recombination,30 hence resulting in better FF with the SAM modification. This statement is supported by the dark J–V curves in which ZnO and ZnO–C60 devices show lower current in the forward bias and high leakage current in reverse bias. And the ZnO and ZnO–C60 with SAM modification show excellent diode quality with very low leakage current and a high rectification ratio in the dark J–V curve (Fig. S4†). Another factor that can probably improve the efficiency by the SAM modification could be due to elimination of the hydroxyl groups on the ZnO surface, which are considered as electron traps.19,27 The SAM effectively passivates the electron traps on the ZnO surface, resulting in increased electron mobility. On the other hand, the NPC70-OH modified device has higher a PCE than that with NPC60-OH, which can be attributed to the fact that the chemical structure of NPC70-OH is more close to that of PC71BM in the active layer than that of NPC60-OH, allowing better contact to PC71BM at the active layer interface to facilitate electron collection.
Conclusions
We have successfully integrated two effective strategies to improve the PCE of BHJ i-SMSCs with the active layer p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM by doping the ZnO cathode with a fullerene derivative (ZnO–C60) and introducing SAM modification on its surface in contact with the active layer. Such ZnO–C60 gives a fullerene-derivative-rich interface in contact with the active layer and enhances the surface conductivity and bulk electron mobility relative to pristine ZnO. The resulting device with the cathode ZnO–C60 gives a PCE of 8.3% higher than that with ZnO 6.08% by about 2%. Further incorporation of the SAM (NPC70-OH) on top of ZnO–C60 leads to further promotion of the PCE to 9.14% by 0.84%, resulting from reduced electron/hole recombination and therefore more effective electron collection.
