    , Accepted 9th April 2015First published on 10th April 2015AbstractTextile wearable electronics offers the combined advantages of both electronics and textile characteristics. The essential properties of these flexible electronics such as lightweight, stretchable, and wearable power sources are in strong demand. Here, we have developed a facile route to fabricate multi walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) coated polyester fabric as a flexible counter electrode (CE) for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). A variety of MWCNT and enzymes with different structures were used to generate individual enzyme-dispersed MWCNT (E-MWCNT) suspensions by non-covalent functionalization. A highly concentrated colloidal suspension of E-MWCNT was deposited on polyester fabric via a simple tape casting method using an air drying technique. In view of the E-MWCNT coating, the surface structure is represented by topologically randomly assembled tubular graphene units. This surface morphology has a high density of colloidal edge states and oxygen-containing surface groups which execute multiple catalytic sites for iodide reduction. A highly conductive E-MWCNT coated fabric electrode with a surface resistance of 15 Ω sq−1 demonstrated 5.69% power conversion efficiency (PCE) when used as a flexible CE for DSSCs. High photo voltaic performance of our suggested system of E-MWCNT fabric-based DSSCs is associated with high sheet conductivity, low charge transfer resistance (RCT), and excellent electro catalytic activity (ECA). Such a conductive fabric demonstrated stable conductivity against bending cycles and strong mechanical adhesion of E-MWCNT on polyester fabric. Moreover, the polyester fabric is hydrophobic and, therefore, has good sealing capacity and retains the polymer gel electrolyte without seepage. This facile E-MWCNT fabric CE configuration provides a concrete fundamental background towards the development of textile-integrated solar cells.
Introduction
The demand for textile electronics (e-textiles) has grown rapidly in the field of wearable electronics to encompass urban life in the form of building textile integrated energy storage devices.1–4 These e-textiles have received much attention due to their potential application in photo voltaic devices, which offer the combined features of both textiles and electronics such as light weight, stretchability, and energy storage capacity.5–7
As a third-generation photovoltaic device, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted significant interest due their low cost, easy fabrication and relatively high efficiency as compared to silicon based solar cells.8–10 A standard DSSCs structure consists of a mesoporous TiO2 photo anode, an iodide/tri-iodide redox electrolyte, a dye sensitizer, and a counter electrode (CE). The counter electrode plays a significant role in DSSCs, by acting to balance the charges and regenerate the key components; the oxidized form of a mediator needs to be reduced by the electrons flowing through the external circuit and passing through the CE. Therefore, an ideal CE must have high electro catalytic properties with good electrical conductivity for electron collection, and a large surface area for high electrode/electrolyte interface. A platinized fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass counter electrode has been widely used in DSSCs due to its electrical conductivity and low over potential for an iodide/tri-iodide (I/I3−) reduction reaction. The heavyweight, rigidity, and expensive characteristics of platinized FTO glass cannot be accommodated into the wearable photovoltaic devices. Moreover, the cost of FTO glass is estimated to account for about 30% of the total material cost of DSSCs.11
Recently, there has been a renewed interest in textile-based solar cells associated with mesh, fibrous matt, and fabrics.12–19 Among them textile fabrics gain much attention due to their unique physical characteristics. Textile fabrics are flexible and porous materials, made by interlacement of yarns, which gives them intrinsic features such as lightweight, mechanical strength, and flexibility. Recent studies were carried out for integrating nano scale materials, including conducting polymers, graphene, and carbon into textile fabrics to prepare textile fabric electrodes.20–24 However, complex synthesizing process and high temperature fabrication restricted the used of textile fabrics in photovoltaic devices.
Highly concentrated colloidal suspensions of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are of great concern for a variety of applications, ranging from wearable displays and flexible portable power batteries to super capacitor devices.25–28 Hence, these small dimension structures of high conductivity with remarkable electrochemical properties make them a distinct candidate for e-textiles. Direct coating technologies using printable CNTs in conducting pastes with high electrical conductivity can be projected to show potential in the expansion of emerging e-textiles. However, one of the main problems with CNT materials is associated with dispersion in further applications. Generally, the covalent functionalization of CNTs with oxidative moieties or shortening with ball milling are used to make a dispersion, but these methods agglomerate CNT irretrievably at high weight concentrations due to their high aspect ratio (>500) and strong van der Waals forces.29 Nevertheless, such severe oxidative functionalization of CNTs irreversibly degrades their sp2 bond structure and electronic properties to some extent. However, many dispersants such as surfactants,30 super acids,31 alkali solutions,32 and ionic liquids33 have been used to prepare highly concentrated CNTs suspensions. A drawback of these methods is that the basic features (e.g. the electrical and thermal properties of the suspension) can suffer due to separation of inter-tube and increased sheet to sheet junction resistance when a highly concentrated dispersant is used to facilitate the dispersion process.
Here, we have developed a novel and facile technique to overcome these issues for fabricating a textile printable conductive suspension containing high-quality enzyme dispersed MWCNTs (E-MWCNTs) prepared with a diluted polymeric binder without any oxidative functionalization. The exceptionally low temperature drying of the proposed E-MWCNT suspension provides the essential evidence for textile printing technology. The key advantages of our suggested structure include:
(1) the E-MWCNT suspension dried at low temperature without any further annealing, so no harmful effects occurred on the polyester fabric; (2) the E-MWCNT has a well organized structure, which is beneficial to increased electron transport and reduced interfacial resistance; (3) the E-MWCNT coated polyester fabric demonstrated high efficiency due to high conductivity and electro catalytic activity of the coating; (4) polyester woven fabrics are high strength, thermo-plastic materials that are widely used in our daily life so it would be an interesting statistic to incorporate polyester fabric for low cost textile structured CE materials; (5) polyester fabric has more sealing ability for polymer gel electrolytes and fewer chances of leakage due to their hydrophobic surface finish; (6) a highly dispersed E-MWCNT coating can better diffuse a polymer gel electrolyte and hasten the CE/electrolyte interface reaction.
In this report the synthesis and characterization of an E-MWCNT coated fabric CE will be reported first, followed by a discussion on the importance of using an appropriate MWCNT and enzyme for E-MWCNT fabrication. Finally, two different types of cell structures were fabricated and comparison studies made. They include the following structures: (1) proposed DSSC: two holed FTO-dye absorbed TiO2/polymer gel electrolyte/E-MWCNT coated polyester fabric; (2) conventional DSSCs: FTO-dye absorbed TiO2/polymer gel electrolyte/platinized FTO.
Experimental section
Material
The plain weave 100% polyester fabric, with hydrophobic surface finish was purchased from Candy Fabrics Pvt Ltd. For synthesis of E-MWCNT coating, different sizes of MWCNT powder with different carbon contents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Type-I: carbon content >90% carbon basis, D × L 110–170 nm × 5–9 μm; Type-II: carbon content ≥98% carbon basis, O.D. × I.D. × L 10 nm ± 1 nm × 4.5 nm ± 0.5 nm × 3–6 μm; Type-III: carbon content >95%, 6–9 nm diameter, 5 μm length. Three different enzyme based dispersants: lipase from candida rugosa, glucose oxidase (Gox) from aspergillus niger, and laccase from trametes versicolor plus carboxymethyl cellulose (sodium salt of MW 250000 g used as binder) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. For platinized FTO CE, chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6, Sigma-Aldrich), and conductive FTO glass (TEC 8, Pilkington Co.) were used. For Cell fabrication, dye sensitizer D719, cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2, 2′-bipyridyl4,4′dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis(tetra butyl ammonium) from Ever Light Co. was used. For electrolyte composition, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), iodine (I2), lithium iodine (LiI), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), poly ethylene oxide (PEO) polymer and anhydrous acetonitrile from Sigma-Aldrich were used. Ionomer surlyn seal of 60 μm thickness used as both spacer and sealant was purchased from solaronix.
Fabrication of E-MWCNT coated fabric counter electrode
Different E-MWCNT suspensions were synthesized using different MWCNT sizes and enzymatic dispersants in the following steps. First, 0.4 g of pristine MWCNTs was dispersed in 50 mL (1 mg mL−1) of aqueous enzyme solution by stirring for 12 hours at room temperature. The enzymes were adsorbed on MWCNT surfaces and loose aggregations without disturbing their electronic characteristics (Fig. 1a). The stable E-MWCNT suspension was filtered by vacuum filtration using a 0.5 μm pore size PTFE polymer membrane filter (Fig. 1b). The non-adsorbed enzyme molecules were removed by washing E-MWCNT twice with D.I. water. The E-MWCNT filtered cake was then re-dispersed in 10 mL CMC polymer using an agate mortar to get thick homogenous E-MWCNT paste (Fig. 1c). The E-MWCNT paste was then stored over night at room temperature for aging.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of synthesis of E-MWCNT conducting paste and fabrication of an E-MWCNT fabric electrode. 
The E-MWCNT conducting paste was deposited on polyester fabric via simple tape casting using an air drying technique (Fig. 1d). The drying temperature was set at 50 °C to facilitate slow evaporation of moisture so as to avoid cracking and distracting of the layer. Fabrics were coated with different types of E-MWCNT pastes with different combinations using a doctor's scalpel and 3 M Scotch Tape. The E-MWCNT coated fabrics were dried at 50 °C for 30 minutes in an oven and pressed at 100 °C for 15 minutes in Teflon-coated hot iron plates. Uncoated fabric surface edges were removed with scissors and 15 × 15 mm2 square pieces were cut down for fabrication of DSSCs. The final features of an E-MWCNT coated fabric electrode are shown in Fig. 2. For comparison, Pt counter electrodes were also prepared for fabrication of DSSCs. The FTO coated glass with sheet resistance of 8 Ω sq−1. was cleaned by sonication with acetone, distilled water, and ethanol, respectively for 15 minutes each. A 10 mM H2PtCl6 solution prepared in isopropanol was drop casted on two-holed FTO glass and annealed at 400 °C for 20 minutes in a high temperature furnace.

Preparation of photo anode
To prepare a photo anode, P25 and titania nanotubes (TNT) paste were prepared and coated on the FTO glass according to our previous work.34,35 The two-holed FTO glass with sheet resistance of 8 Ω sq−1 was cleaned by sonication with acetone, distilled water, and ethanol, respectively. Cleaned FTO glass (15 × 15 mm2) was dipped in TiCl4 solution (40 mM) used as a TiO2 blocking layer, at 70 °C for 30 minutes followed by heating at 500 °C for 30 minutes in a high temperature furnace. Next, pre-treated FTO glass was screened with TiO2 paste using the scalpel blade method. The thickness of the TiO2 was set by using the 3 M Scotch Tape. In order to avoid a short circuit of the cell, we selected a SMT pattern for the photo anode as discussed in our previous work.35 The active area of the cell was 4 × 5 mm2 and was measured by an electronic microscope equipped with Camscope (ICS-305B, Sometech Co.) software. These photo anode samples were heated in 5 steps of 70 °C, 325 °C, 375 °C, 450 °C, and 500 °C for 30, 5, 5, 15, and 15 minutes, respectively. Annealed photo anodes were again immersed in TiCl4 solution (40 mM) at 70 °C for 30 minutes followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 minutes. Sintered photo anodes were cooled down to 100 °C in a furnace and immersed in dye sensitizer solution D719 (0.3 mM, in absolute ethanol) for 10 hours and enclosed in an airtight glass container at room temperature. Dye-adsorbed photo anodes were washed to remove non adsorbed dye molecules using ethanol and dried under nitrogen flow.
Cell assembly
Finally, two different types of cell structures (Fig. 3) were fabricated and compared: (1) proposed DSSC: two-holed FTO-dye absorbed TiO2/polymer gel electrolyte/E-MWCNT fabric CE; (2) conventional DSSC: FTO-dye absorbed TiO2/polymer gel electrolyte/platinized FTO. The proposed DSSC was fabricated by sandwiching the dye absorbed photo anode and E-MWCNT coated fabric CE using a 60 μm ionomer surlyn as the spacer. To provide support, the back side of the cell was attached with PET film. After assembling, the polymer gel electrolyte (composed of 0.6 M BMII, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.5 M TBP and 5 wt% PEO in acetonitrile) was introduced from a two-holed photo anode by using vacuum filling and then sealed with ionomer surlyn and a cover glass. A polymer gel electrolyte exhibits an advantage of more sustainability when porous fabric materials are used. Conductive silver paste was coated at the edges of the cell to make better contact with the current collector. A black mask aperture was placed on the photo anode to avoid over estimation of photo voltaic performance. For comparison, a conventional DSSC assembly with platinized FTO substrate was also assembled by using the same photo anode and polymer gel electrolyte.

Characterization
The surface morphology of the E-MWCNT coated fabrics was investigated by field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (model JEOL JSM-6700F) after a very thin coating of platinum was placed on the samples by sputtering at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Visual examination of the coating of E-MWCNT on the polyester fabric was carried out with the help of digital photographs taken by a software equipped Camscope ICS-305B, Sometech Co. To investigate the surface structure of E-MWCNT coated polyester fabric, a wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) method was used with a Rigaku Denki X-ray generator (Rigaku, D/MAX-2500), using CuKα (λ 1.5418° A) radiation at 40 kV and 60 mA. Intensities of carbon and oxygen group peaks at the surface of E-MWCNT coated fabrics were measured with XPS using a Multi Lab ESCA 2000 system VG from Thermo Scientific, USA. For this experiment mono-chromatized Al Kα radiation with an energy step size of 0.05 eV was used. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were also recorded using a Nicolet™ iS™10 FT-IR spectrophotometer from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA. All the samples were tested using the ATR mode. The flexibility and stability of E-MWCNT coated fabrics against bending was tested using a custom-built two-probe device. The mechanical adhesion of E-MWCNT on polyester fabric was examined with a Scotch Tape test; in this test a piece of Scotch Tape is placed on the coated fabric and then removed. The sample fails the test if any of the coating particles are attached to the tape.36
To examine the accurate thickness of an E-MWCNT layer on polyester fabric, an electronic outside micrometer (0–25 mm 0.01 mm) by Schut Geometrical Metrology was used. To calculate the accurate layer thickness value, thickness was measured from eight different places and then the difference between uncoated and coated fabrics was used to calculate the accurate layer thickness of E-MWCNT coated fabrics.
Electrical resistance at the surface of an E-MWCNT coated fabric was measured using a standard four-point probe head system method with a RM3000 resistivity test unit by Jandel Engineering, Switzerland. The catalytic activity of the E-MWCNT layer was investigated by using a three-electrode system in an argon-purged electrolyte (0.01 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 acetonitrile solution) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 with an ultimate electrochemical workstation (Bio Logic Co.). For the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, the symmetrical cell configuration with two identical fabric or FTO CEs was used. The symmetrical cell was constructed by sandwiching two identical fabric CEs separated with a spacer of 60 μm surlyn. Two pieces of PET films were utilized to stabilize the symmetric fabric cell. The electrochemical impedance spectrum of the symmetrical cell was observed in a frequency range of 0.05 Hz to 300 kHz under 100 mW cm−2 using an Ultimate Electrochemical Workstation (Bio Logic Co.). The photovoltaic performance of DSSCs was evaluated using a K101-Lab 20 source measuring unit (Mac Science Co.). A solar simulator with 160 W Xenon arc lamp was used as the light source (Spectral match; 0.75–1.25, Non-uniformity of irradiance; ≤±2 percentage, temporal instability; ≤±2%). The light intensity was calibrated with a KIER-calibrated Si solar cell (Mc science Co.). The photovoltaic parameters of the cells were measured under a masked frame.37 A masked frame measurement was employed to guarantee the accurate estimation of photovoltaic efficiency, as the light guiding effects arise, due to the passage of light through the FTO substrate.
Results and discussion
Choice of suitable enzyme for MWCNT dispersion
The MWCNT produced by chemical vapor deposition38 is very hydrophobic in nature and thus gives rise to aggregation when dispersed. In the field of biotechnology, different bio materials such as DNA,39,40 proteins41,42 and enzymes43,44 are recognized as efficient dispersants to individually disperse CNTs without disturbing their electronic properties. Different types of enzymes have been well proven to disperse CNT in biosensor applications. Even though glucose oxidase45 and lipase46 have been proven to be effective and safe dispersants for CNT, on the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, no research has been reported on the application of an enzyme-dispersed MWCNT suspensions in textile printable electronics. Therefore, for MWCNT dispersion, we chose an enzymatic route to synthesize a highly conductive E-MWCNT coating for textile substrates. To investigate the morphology and composition of E-MWCNT coated polyester fabrics, various analytical methods were employed. Fig. 4 shows the FE-SEM images of surface morphologies of the uncoated and E-MWCNT coated polyester fabrics. It can be seen that the surface of the uncoated fabric (Fig. 4a) is relatively clean and smooth whereas, hydrophobic surface finish particles are clearly seen on the yarn strands. After coating using a doctor's scalpel, the surface of the fabric was fully covered by the E-MWCNT layer, which is compact and continuous. High resolution (×45000) images clearly revealed the surface morphology of different E-MWCNT coatings. The E-MWCNT suspension prepared with laccase (Fig. 4b) and glucose oxidase (Fig. 4c) enzymes presented amalgamated and aggregated surfaces with no cracks but layers are not uniform throughout the surface. However, the E-MWCNT suspension prepared with lipase enzyme (Fig. 4d) exhibited a well-ordered and highly dispersed surface with an even interconnectivity of tubular configuration. This indicates that the synthesis of E-MWCNT with lipase enzyme is an efficient approach for preparing a highly colloidal conductive network of MWCNT. Hence, the coated layer on the plastic substrate clearly indicates the flexibility of E-MWCNT. Visual examination with a micrograph showed the even weaved pattern of polyester fabric coated with an E-MWCNT layer.

Further analysis of surface structure was done using XRD characterizations of E-MWCNT coated fabrics. Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of E-MWCNT coated polyester fabric. All three E-MWCNT coated polyester fabrics showed a diffraction peak centered at 25.8° equivalent to a d spacing of about 3.406 Å, indexed to (002) reflection of the MWCNT structure. It should be noted that the corresponding peak for lipase suspended E-MWCNT is very confined and sharp indicating a better dispersed and even conductive network. In addition, the XRD pattern also showed a small peak at 46.8°, which may be ascribed to the diffraction peak for the graphite planes. This result indicates that the nature of MWCNT in this case is represented by topologically randomly assembled tubular graphene units. A broadened peak at 22.6° was also observed and assigned as the contribution of the polymeric chain of polyester fabric. Appearance of a sharp (002) diffraction line in the XRD spectra shows that polyester fabric is evenly coated with an ordered crystalline E-MWCNT layer.
 Fig. 5  XRD pattern of E-MWCNT coated polyester fabrics prepared with different enzymes. 
To extend the characterization, XPS investigation was also used to observe the intensity of O1s/C1s peaks in the survey spectrum as shown in Fig. 6. This technique can quantify the amount of carbon and oxygen on the surface before and after the coating process. For a reference, an uncoated polyester fabric XPS spectrum is also provided. A noticeable difference can be observed in O1s and C1s peaks after coating with the E-MWCNT suspension. The high peak intensity of C1s indicated the clear increase in carbon containing groups and restoration of the sp2 graphite network structure. The sharp peak intensity of O1s also suggests restoration of a sp2 graphitic network structure. This shows that the structure has high density of colloidal MWCNTs structure with edge states and more oxygen containing surface groups. The concentrated MWCNT edge surface with an adequate amount of oxygen has multiple catalytic sites for iodide reduction and fast redox reactions.

The FTIR-ATR data was also recorded for uncoated and E-MWCNT coated polyester fabrics.

Fig. 7 shows the characteristics peaks of uncoated and E-MWCNT coated fabrics. The characteristic peak appearing at wave number 872 cm−1 is due to the C–O–C symmetric stretch. The peak at wave number 1097 cm−1 is due to the C–O–C asymmetric stretch. The peak appearing at 2160 cm−1 is due to the CH2–O asymmetric stretch. All observed characteristic peaks are indications of specific molecular bonds within the polyester fabric. The obtained spectra of E-MWCNT coated polyester fabric show no appearance of new peaks or changes in the intensity of already existing peaks of uncoated polyester fabrics. The change in the spectra is directly related to the chemical reaction of layers with base fabric. FTIR-ATR examination indicated that no chemical reaction took place between the polyester substrate and E-MWCNT coating.

To show the flexibility and stability of E-MWCNT coated polyester fabric against different bending positions and cycles, we prepared a sample size of 1 cm × 3 cm. The bending test was conducted using a custom-built two-point bending device with a high precision mechanical system (Fig. 8a). When the sample was bent gradually in different positions, the conductivity remained constant, displaying the excellent durability of the samples under bending. We also compared the effect of electrical resistivity against bending cycles to demonstrate the stability of E-MWCNMT coated polyester fabrics. The variation in the electrical resistance of the fabric was negligible over 10 bending cycles (Fig. 8b). After the bending test, no cracks were observed on the surface of the E-MWCNT coating. The mechanical stability of the E-MWCNT coating was also measured by the Scotch Tape test method, and no obvious MWCNT residues were observed on the tape, demonstrating good mechanical adhesion of E-MWCNT coating on the polyester fabric. The successful Scotch Tape test results are shown in Fig. 8c and d.

Electro catalytic properties of E-MWCNT layer
To investigate the electro catalytic activity of an E-MWCNT layer with respect to I3−/I− redox electrolyte couples, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed using a three-electrode system in 0.01 M liClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 in acetonitrile solution. For the test, different E-MWCNT suspensions were deposited on a FTO substrate and dried at 50 °C for 30 minutes followed by drying at 100 °C for 15 minutes. As shown in Fig. 9, the CV curve of the E-MWCNT electrodes shows two pairs of I3−/I− redox peaks. The negative cathodic peak was assigned to the reduction reaction and the positive anodic peak was assigned to the oxidation reaction. The CV of all CEs can be described by the following reactions.47 3I− → 2I3− + 2e− (Oxidation)(1) I3− + 2e− → 3I− (Reduction)(2)
 Fig. 9  CV curves obtained for E-MWCNT layers (a) prepared with different MWCNT sizes. (b) Prepared with different enzymatic dispersants. (c) Comparison of CV of E-MWCNT with Pt catalyst. 
The catalytic activity of an electro catalyst toward I3 reduction can be visualized in terms of its cathodic peak potential (Ecp) and cathodic peak current density (Ipc) in a CV diagram. Accordingly, a higher Ipc with more positive Ecp values indicates a better electro catalytic activity of CE toward iodide reduction. Fig. 9a and b show the CV curves of the different MWCNT sizes and effects of enzymatic dispersants on catalytic activity of E-MWCNT samples. MWCNT of a Type-III layer prepared with lipase enzyme demonstrated higher Ipc with more positive Ecp values compared to its counterparts, including a commercial Pt catalyst, and also possessed the highest electro catalytic activity among all investigated CEs. This shows that a Type-III layer prepared with lipase enzyme has a high density of colloidal edge states and high surface area with high amounts of oxygen surface groups, which executes multiple catalytic sites for iodide reduction. Furthermore, large diameter nanotubes increase the insulated gap between the CNTs which reduces the catalytic sites for I3−/I− reduction. The calculated electro catalytic values of different E-MWCNT CEs are tabulated in Table 1.

Moreover, the peak to peak separation (Epp), which is inversely proportional to the standard electrochemical rate constant of I3−/I− redox reaction, is a considerable aspect in investigating the ECA of CE. As shown in Fig. 9c, E-MWCNT layer has a smaller Epp (0.53 V) value, equal to that of Pt CE (0.52 V), indicating the intrinsic electro catalytic activity of E-MWCNT towards the I3−/I− redox reaction. This investigation specifies that a higher electro catalytic surface area can be achieved in our suggested E-MWCNT system.
Electrochemical performance of E-MWCNT fabric counter electrode
To examine the electrochemical characteristics of E-MWCNT coated fabrics, electrochemical reaction rates of the redox couple iodide/triiodide were measured using symmetrical fabric electrodes with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The symmetrical sandwich cell technique (Fig. 10) for EIS measurement has the advantage of yielding a specific electron transport mechanism of CE and shows the explicit impedance barrier of the photo anode processes.48 For precise fitting of semicircles to calculate the impedance values, the EIS spectra were simulated with EC-lab software by using a Randles-type equivalent circuit (shown in inset of Fig. 11a). The Randles-type equivalent circuit is composed of ohmic serial resistance of CE (RS), charge transfer resistance (RCT) at the CE/electrolyte/CE, constant phase element (CPE), and Nernst diffusion impedance (ZW) of the I3−/I− redox couple in a thin layer of electrolyte. CPE was used instead of double layer capacitance, due to high porous E-MWCNT surface morphology. In this regard, we focused mainly on the analysis of the ohmic series resistance (RS) of the substrate and electrochemical impedance at the CE/electrolyte impedance of E-MWCNT fabric electrode. As the same photo anode and polymer gel electrolyte were used for each cell, the difference of the ohmic series resistance and impedance at the CE/electrolyte is responsible for the different electrochemical properties of the E-MWCNT fabric CE.

To investigate the choice of using suitable size of MWCNT for our suggested system, three different types of E-MWCNT suspensions were synthesized with different sizes of MWCNT material. Investigation by EIS revealed that the different sizes of MWCNT significantly affected the electron transport in the structure of a layer, though the interplay of CNT length and outer diameter led to an appreciable change in the electron transport mechanism. From the Nyquist plots shown in Fig. 11a and the impedance values listed in Table 2, we concluded that the impedance value for Type-III CE is much lower with RS of 18.20 Ω cm2, and RCT of 2.06 Ω cm2 than that of Type-I and Type-II CEs, respectively. For the case of Type-I and Type-II MWCNT, larger diameter and smaller CNT length tends to increase the impedance effect of the conductive layer. The sheet resistances of these substrates were also confirmed by four-point resistivity measurements. The different MWCNT size may affect the impedance of a layer in two ways: (i) longer and thinner Type-III MWCNTs ensure a more uniform electron conduction path along the individual nanotubes, similar to the electrical conduction mechanism; (ii) Type-I and Type-II MWCNTs, with larger outer diameters, provide less compact structures so that the insulating separation (tunneling distance) between MWCNTs increases and thus increase the impedance.

In order to find the optimum layer thickness, the consecutive layers of E-MWCNT were coated onto the polyester fabric by the tape casting method. The dimension of thickness was controlled by 3M Scotch Tape. Electronic outside micrometer (0–25 mm 0.01 mm) was used to check the accurate layer thickness coated onto the fabric. The symmetrical cells were prepared and filled with same polymer gel electrolyte. The RS and RCT values were obtained by fitting EIS spectra using the equivalent circuit (Fig. 11b), and the values are summarized in Table 3. The RCT decreased drastically from 23.39 Ω cm2 to 2.06 Ω cm2, by coating an E-MWCNT layer as thick as 16 μm, the uniformity in the 16 μm thickness implies the drastic decrease in RCT and acceleration of the I3− reduction mechanism. On the other hand, a marked difference in RCT values was observed over a 16 μm thickness. This was attributed to the high density CNT layer and low porous surface structure. The CNT thick layer mainly consists of a randomly oriented mesoporous network. As the dimensions of I3 ions in acetonitrile are only 3 Å in width and 6 Å in length,49 therefore over an optimum E-MWCNT thickness they can diffuse through the pores, be adsorbed onto the active site, and become reduced. Higher E-MWCNT layer thickness reduced the catalytic reduction, as the catalytic activity mainly depends on surface area. In contrast, the sheet resistance (RS) of the E-MWCNT coated fabric CE increased with the increase in layer thickness. The interconnection of CNT was improved, which contributes to the electron transfer at the counter electrodes.

Further, the effect of enzymatic dispersant on electrochemical properties of E-MWCNT fabric CE was observed. The obtained electrochemical parameters are listed in Table 4. As shown in Fig. 12, the RS and RCT of E-MWCNT fabric CE prepared with lipase were lower 18.20 Ω cm2 and 2.06 Ω cm2, respectively than that of prepared with laccases and Gox enzymes. This result indicates that the variation in dielectric space around MWCNT caused by different enzyme dispersions lead to a change in charge transfer kinetics. Moreover, the low RS value of the E-MWCNT fabric prepared with lipase enzymes can be compared with the platinized FTO glass electrode. The obtained impedance value is listed in Table 5. As shown in Fig. 13, the Pt symmetrical cell shows high RCT values when fabricated with the polymer gel electrolyte. This indicates that the electron transport of the E-MWCNT fabric CE is superior due to the higher uniformity and larger active surface area of the E-MWCNT structure, which improves the redox reaction with the high density polymer gel electrolyte. As a result, the small observed RS and RCT values for our suggested system indicate that the electrochemical performance of the E-MWCNT coated fabrics are improved substantially when it is prepared with lipase enzyme, which can interact more rapidly with the polymer gel electrolyte.

Photo voltaic performance of E-MWCNT fabric counter electrode
The photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs using E-MWCNT fabric CE (Fig. 14) and platinized FTO CE were evaluated under AM 1.5 illumination at (1 sun, 100 mW cm−2). To find the effect of different parameters on photo voltaic performance, we prepared a variety of E-MWCNT fabric CE different in structure and thickness.
 Fig. 14  Photographs of front and side view of DSSC fabricated with E-MWCNT fabric CE. 
To investigate the effect of different MWCNT size on the photovoltaic performance, the E-MWCNT coated fabric was subsequently assembled into DSSCs and compared with devices fabricated using a conventional Pt counter electrode. Polymer gel electrolyte was filled into the cell assembly. We choose polymer electrolyte to increase stability of cell. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 15a. The photovoltaic parameters, open circuit voltage (VOC), Fill Factor (FF), short circuit current density (JSC) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSC fabricated with different E-MWCNT fabric CEs are tabulated in Table 2. The DSSCs fabricated using E-MWCNT fabric CE prepared with different size of MWCNT, are named as Type-I, Type-II, and Type-III. The thickness of the layer was set at 16 μm with 3M Scotch Tape. As precisely discussed in EIS results, impedance effects of the E-MWCNT layer was strongly influenced by the MWCNT dimension. Small diameter and large CNT length tends to improve the specific surface area of a layer. Type-III has a larger specific surface area than Type-I and Type-II CEs, and gives much higher photo voltaic performance. The DSSC fabricated using MWCNT Type-III CE achieves a remarkable PCE of 5.69%, JSC of 11.92 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.688 V, and FF of 69.39%. For DSSC with E-MWCNT fabric CE, PCE follows the order of Type-III > Type-II > Type-I; JSC and VOC also follow this order. It can be clearly seen that the improvement in the photovoltaic performance of the MWCNT fabric CE is mainly due to the increase in JSC and FF. The distinction in JSC and FF is related to the internal resistance of the DSSC. As the same photo anode and polymer gel electrolyte was used in the fabrication of DSSC, therefore the change in efficiency is due to the different sizes of MWCNT, which affects the electron transfer mechanism. Large diameter and small length of MWCNT lead to high RCT and low electro catalytic activity.
 Fig. 15  Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of DSSCs prepared with different E-MWCNT fabric CE. (a) Effect of size of MWCNT. (b) Effect of E-MWCNT thickness. 
Earlier electrochemical studies of DSSCs have suggested that impedance effects in solar cells reduce the photovoltaic performance of the cells by dissipating power in internal resistance. The key effect of internal resistance is to reduce fill factor (FF). Therefore, the substrate must be coated with an optimum thickness to catalyze the iodide/triiodide reduction. We fabricated DSSC using E-MWCNT fabric CE with different layer thickness. It was found that the thickness of the E-MWCNT layer played a critical role on the photovoltaic performance (Fig. 15b). The photo voltaic parameters are tabulated in Table 3. The E-MWCNT coated fabric became highly conductive after being coated with consecutive coatings of E-MWCNT when the thickness is over 11 μm. In the resulting DSSC, the E-MWCNT coated fabric can efficiently dissipate the energy and enabled high photovoltaic performances. Mainly, FF was increased from 29.90% and 44.26% to 69.39% by increasing thickness of the E-MWCNT layer from 5 μm and 11 μm, to 16 μm, respectively. Accordingly, PCE was increased from 1.79% and 2.77% to 5.69%. However, although the E-MWCNT coated fabric became more conductive with the further increase of the E-MWCNT thickness (more than 16 μm), the thick layer cannot easily assimilate the energy; as a result it reduced the efficiency of the cell. As discussed earlier, when the size of the MWCNT increased and their surface area declined; similarly, as the E-MWCNT thickness increased from 16 μm to 28 μm, the VOC decreased from 0.688 V to 0.655 V. This may be caused by the decline in catalytic activity, because catalytic activity generally depends on the surface area of the E-MWCNT electrode surface area. For instance, JSC and η were decreased from 11.9 mA cm−2 to 9.29 mA cm−2 and 5.69% to 4.25%, respectively. The optimal thickness of the E-MWCNT layer is around 16 μm.
Further, the effects of different enzymatic dispersants was observed on the performance of DSSCs (Fig. 16). The DSSC fabricated using the lipase suspended E-MWCNT fabric CE exhibits a VOC of 0.688 V, a JSC of 11.92 mA cm−2, and a FF of 69.39%, giving an overall PCE of 5.69%. The obtained photo voltaic parameters are listed in Table 4. The PCE of lipase suspended E-MWCNT fabric CE is better than that of counterparts based on a Gox- and laccase-suspended E-MWCNT fabric CE with 3.31% and 3.77%, respectively. Among three different enzymatic dispersants, the lipase enzyme offered high dispersion of MWCNT and enabled high surface area facile electron transfer. The enhancement in the electro catalytic activity is due to the fast electron-withdrawing ability of the lipase-suspended E-MWCNT layer. Moreover, the concentrated edge states of E-MWCNT surface and oxygen containing surface groups results in multiple catalytic sites for iodide reduction.
 Fig. 16  Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of DSSCs fabricated using MWCNT suspended in different enzymatic dispersants. 
The platinized FTO-based CE was also compared with E-MWCNT coated fabric CE (Fig. 17). The obtained photo voltaic parameters are given in Table 5. The conventional DSSC using platinized FTO CEs have VOC, 0.701 V; JSC, 14.18 mA cm−2; FF, 72.06%; and PCE, 7.16%. It is interesting to note that the performance of DSSC using E-MWCNT fabric CE can be compared to that of platinized FTO CE due to the increased value of JSC and FF. The short circuit current density (JSC) of DSSC prepared with platinized FTO CE was much higher than the E-MWCNT fabric CE, indicating a difference in light harvesting properties of modified CE substrates. The unabsorbed light could be reflected back to the photo anode for re-absorption by the semi-transparent platinized FTO glass, leading to a higher JSC. The fabric CE cannot induce such a reflection effect. Furthermore, the low FF is mainly attributed to the relatively low conductivity and higher sheet resistance of the E-MWCNT fabric CE rather than FTO substrate, as investigated in electrochemical analysis. The electrical conductivity can be improved by adjusting the synthesis conditions of E-MWCNT, which offers the opportunity to significantly decrease the sheet resistance, which is currently under investigation in our lab.

Conclusions
We have successfully established a facile and economical process to formulate a highly conductive suspension of enzyme-dispersed MWCNT (E-MWCNT) for textile fabric coating. A variety of MWCNT and enzymes, different in structure, were used to generate E-MWCNT and to make a highly electro catalytic well-ordered conductive electro catalyst, which plays the role as a platform to fabricate a textile-based counter electrode. As compared to a commercial platinized FTO electrode, E-MWCNT fabric CE was found to have the best electrochemical features of high conductivity, excellent electron transport, and to enable facile redox reaction. Hence, DSSCs using E-MWCNT fabric CE with a high conversion efficiency of 5.69% was fabricated; and which can be compared to the 7.16% efficiency of conventional Pt-based DSSCs. By taking all of the stated characteristics into account, the highly concentrated colloidal suspension of E-MWCNT was prepared for low temperature coating of a textile substrate, and this enhances the feasibility of fabric-based CE. This facile and innovative structure can be a great benefit to scientific society by incorporating the intrinsic properties of carbon nanotubes with biomolecules in wearable e-textile based photo voltaic systems.
