    , Accepted 18th July 2017First published on 19th July 2017AbstractHigh power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long-term stability against ultraviolet irradiation and humidity for organometal halide perovskite solar cells (Pero-SCs) are challenging factors for the practical application of solar cells. Here, we report a facile strategy to enhance the long-term tolerance of Pero-SCs to UV light. A silane coupling agent was introduced between the electron collection layer and the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite absorber layer, while an ultraviolet absorber was adopted to block the UV radiation, which is detrimental to the stability of CH3NH3PbI3. This device exhibits excellent performance and chemical stabilities, which result in the loss of 2.2% PCE on average. The unencapsulated devices retain over 80% of their initial efficiency even after continuous UV irradiation for 24 h (at 60% relative humidity), exhibiting greater UV-light tolerance and superior stability. This is a simple and effective approach to fabricate Pero-SCs with enhanced stabilities against UV radiation and the results confirm the influence of UV light on the efficiency, demonstrating a new method for the commercialization of Pero-SCs.
Introduction
Accompanied by the rapid growth of world economy in the 21st century, bridging the gap between the supply and continuous demand of energy resources has increasingly become the greatest challenge. The current energy sources inevitably lead to environmental pollution, which renders the search and effective exploitation of renewable, environmentally friendly energy exceptionally essential to meet the enormous energy demand and environmental protection requirements. From the strategic viewpoint of sustainable development, utilization of the solar energy is of utmost importance and the transformation of the solar energy into the cleanest electrical energy can potentially resolve the existing issues. Recently, significant research and efforts have been devoted to photovoltaic devices, owing to the considerable attention accompanied by a decline in the price of solar cells. Of late, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials such as CH3NH3PbBr3/CH3NH3PbI3 have been applied in photovoltaics,1–6 catalysis,7–9 organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),10,11 and sensors,12–14 because of their excellent absorption coefficients, small bandgaps, good ambipolar charge mobility, long carrier life times, and diffusion lengths.4,5,15,16 Moreover, the easy fabrication process along with higher photovoltaic performance render perovskite materials the next generation thin film solar cells. During the past 6 years, an increase in their efficiency from 3.8 to 22.1% (certified by NERL) has been achieved by processes such as interface modification, crystal growth, and device engineering.17–20 With respect to solar cells, the first hurdle has been overcome, which will steer the focus to overcoming the new challenges on the way to commercialization. However, toward actual application in the outdoor environment, the industrialization of Pero-SCs requires that the focus is not only on the efficiency, but also on improving their stability and exploring mechanisms that could lead to degradation under different atmospheric conditions. Therefore, the stability of Pero-SCs is gradually becoming an important consideration. Compared to the 25-year lifetime of the crystalline silicon cells with a slight power conversion efficiency (PCE) loss (less than 0.5%), several other factors such as humidity (water), ultraviolet radiation, and interface can cause the decomposition of the lead halide perovskite materials, inevitably restricting their competition with the traditional solar cells.21–23 The strict requirements for experimental conditions, fabrication processes, characterization, and storage of Pero-SCs necessitate that the devices are prepared in a glove box. In previous studies, the instability and the degradation mechanism of the materials and devices under humidity conditions have been assessed.24,25 To date, several methods including interface modification, doping of water-absorber polymers, fabrication of new hole transporting materials (HTM), etc. have been adopted to improve the stability against humidity, rendering the application of Pero-SCs in an outdoor atmosphere up to 1 year at the most.26–28 However, most of the research with respect to the stability has been focused on the influence of humidity and there have been very few studies related to the effect of the ultraviolet radiation on the device performance. The mechanism of the action of UV light is attributed to the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 in the interface between the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layer and the compact titania (c-TiO2) and/or mesoporous TiO2 layers, which are widely adopted to fabricate high performance devices. Upon UV light exposure for several hours, photogenerated holes react with the adsorbed oxygen radicals adsorbed at surface oxygen vacancies, which then become deep traps leading to charge recombination.29 To overcome this, several methods have been introduced to improve the device stability against UV light. We have demonstrated that mesoporous Al2O3 is a good substitute for mesoporous TiO2 and that the stability of the device could be significantly improved.29 Li et al. introduced CsCl for modifying TiO2 to prevent ultraviolet light from directly influencing CH3NH3PbI3, which led to the maintenance of more than 70% of the original PCE after prolonged intensive UV irradiation for 200 min.30 With respect to recent progress in the UV stability, Grätzel's team showed that upon the incorporation of rubidium cations into Pero-SCs the devices retain 95% of their initial PCE at 85 °C for 500 h under full illumination.31 In another publication, their team reported improved UV-stability obtained by coating photocurable fluoropolymers with a retention of 98% of device PCE during prolonged operation. This propelled more researchers to investigate the UV stability.32 Such progress will inevitably accelerate the commercialization of Pero-SCs. There are only limited research studies on the long-term stability under strict UV irradiation. Thus, in the long run, the requirement for improved UV-stability appears to be more important than the efficiency.
Herein, inspired by these previous works, we introduced 3 types of silane coupling agents (SCAs), referred to as KH550 (NH2(CH2)3Si(OC2H5)3), KH560 (CH2CH(O)CH2O(CH2)3Si(OCH3)3), and KH570 (CH2C(CH3)COO(CH2)3Si(OCH3)3), as interface modifiers for compacted TiO2. Silane coupling agents are often used to fabricate composites that require chemical bonding (coupling) between the organic and inorganic components. In this study, SCAs could not only control the crystalline morphology of c-TiO2 and reduce the pinholes of the perovskite film but also improve the stability of the devices under ultraviolet irradiation. Apart from the interface modification, a UV-absorber layer was coated on the front surface of the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass to effectively absorb the UV-A and UV-B (wavelengths between 275–400 nm that cannot be filtered by the earth's atmosphere). Finally, through the incorporation of SCA at the interface between TiO2 and the perovskite film along with the UV-absorber coating, the unencapsulated Pero-SCs are shown to exhibit excellent ultraviolet-resistance performance. Furthermore, we investigated the contribution of the ultraviolet radiation to the PCE of the perovskite devices and achieved the surprising result that UV portion of the sunlight has a negligible influence on the photovoltaic performance in terms of UV stability.
Results and discussion
In this work, a one-step spinning coating method was adopted to fabricate planar-type perovskite solar cells owing to its reliable, simple processing, and conventional configuration with FTO/(c-TiO2)/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au, where, spiro OMeTAD refers to 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl) amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene. In order to improve the UV-stability, a layer of SCA was introduced into the interface between c-TiO2 and the perovskite absorber, which is usually adopted to improve the chemical bonding between the organic and inorganic materials in the field of polymer chemistry. Moreover, an optimal UV absorber was spin-coated on the frontside of the FTO glass, as shown in Fig. 1a. To confirm the effect of the modification layer, 3 types of SCAs were investigated. Fig. 1b shows the energy level of the devices that allow electron extraction from CH3NH3PbI3 (−3.90 eV) to the c-TiO2 conduction band (−4.2 eV) and hole collection from the CH3NH3PbI3 valence band (−5.43 eV) to spiro-MeOTAD (−5.22 eV). In such a structure, SCA can also be considered an obstacle to the direct contact of spiro-MeOTAD and c-TiO2, which is known to be detrimental to the high and stable devices over larger areas. Fig. S1 in the ESI† shows a representative cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the device with c-TiO2/KH570 compared to the pristine device, where the interface contact between c-TiO2 and CH3NH3PbI3 thin films after the introduction of the modifier has been improved slightly.

There are two types of functional groups in the molecular structure of SCA: methoxy, ethoxy, and others that can be hydrolyzed to form Si(OH)3 and combine with the inorganic materials through covalent bonds, apart from vinyl, amino, epoxy, and other organic groups that can react with the organic molecules. As mentioned above, a thin film of SCA was successfully introduced on the surface of c-TiO2. Fourier-transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) were used to verify the presence of SCA on top of c-TiO2, and the spectra are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). For c-TiO2/KH550, a broad absorption peak between 3800 and 3000 cm−1, coinciding with the main characteristic peak positions of TiO2 is observed. The absorption bands at 2929 cm−1, 1582 cm−1, and 1066 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching vibrations of –CH2, –NH2, and Si–O groups, respectively, of KH550. For c-TiO2/KH560, absorption peaks appear in the wavenumber range of 1270–1066 cm−1 corresponding to the strong absorption of acrylate (stretching vibration of C–O) and Si–O. For the TiO2 films functionalized with KH570, the presence of bands at 1740 cm−1, 1695 cm−1, and 1066 cm−1 corresponds to the absorptions of its functional groups. These results indicate that SCA was successfully introduced on the surface of c-TiO2.
Furthermore, we also studied the morphology of c-TiO2 with and without SCA (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†). The presence of SCA renders the surface of c-TiO2 different from that of the pristine one. The SEM image of c-TiO2/KH550 displays an uneven surface morphology compared to the others, while that with c-TiO2/KH570 shows the best uniformity. It is widely known that high-quality perovskite films are essential for photoelectric performance and stability. To investigate the significant effects resulting from the interface modification, the surface morphologies of the unmodified and modified perovskite films were observed by SEM. Fig. 2 shows the top-view SEM images of the unmodified c-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 films and the c-TiO2/SCA/CH3NH3PbI3 films with different SCAs at the interface. The morphologies of the unmodified and modified films showed significant differences. The high-magnification SEM image of the c-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 films based on KH550 (Fig. 2b) exhibits irregular grains with increased pinholes that are detrimental to the device performance, while the films based on KH560 and KH570 show more uniform, compact, and pinhole-free films compared to the control films (Fig. 2(c and d)). In addition, the top-view low magnification SEM images of the CH3NH3PbI3 films were employed to verify the uniformity, in which, compacted crystal grains are observed upon modification with KH560 and KH570 (Fig. S5, ESI†). This can be attributed to the reported hydrogen-bonding, electrostatic interactions, and hydrolytic reaction between c-TiO2 and CH3NH3PbI3.33 However, it is obvious that, among the three modified films, the ones with KH560 and KH570 show better morphologies. All these results confirm the successful fabrication of high-quality, interface-modified perovskite films.

To further investigate the influence of the interface modification on the morphology of the CH3NH3PbI3 film on c-TiO2, the surfaces of the different perovskite films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The root mean square roughnesses (RMS) of the films are 12.9, 13.0, 14.8, and 14.3 nm, respectively, which are in excellent agreement with the SEM results, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). All the films appear smooth and exhibit similar RMS within a reasonable error range, which demonstrates the uniformity of the fabricated films.

Fig. 3a displays the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite films. All the CH3NH3PbI3 films present the same diffraction peaks at 14.12°, 28.5°, and 31.9°, corresponding to the (110), (220), and (310) crystal planes, respectively, of CH3NH3PbI3. Notably, the major peaks for the films fabricated by interface modification with KH560 and KH570 show stronger intensities than the other two perovskite films, confirming the improvement in crystallization. c-TiO2 in the devices plays a role in collecting electrons and reflecting holes. To further investigate the electron transport ability across the c-TiO2, time-resolved photoluminescence decays of the perovskite films deposited on c-TiO2 were measured and the curves are shown in Fig. 3b. The lifetime of the emission from the CH3NH3PbI3 thin films decreases, confirming the high and fast electron transfer to c-TiO2 upon interface modification, with the best results obtained for the film with KH570.34

The optoelectronic performance of the devices without and with interface modification was investigated systematically. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the control device and those of the devices with different SCAs (KH550, KH560, and KH570) at their interfaces are shown in Fig. 4a. SCA has a significant effect not only on the morphology of the films but also on the PCE of the devices. The key parameters related to the best performance of the corresponding devices are summarized in Table 1. Considering the above results in totality, it is apparent that the devices without interface modification (open circuit voltage (Voc) = 1.04 V, short circuit current (Jsc) = 22.42 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) = 73.93%, and PCE = 17.27%) and with KH570 modification (Voc = 1.04 V, Jsc = 22.5 mA cm−2, FF = 72.90%, and PCE = 17.36%) exhibit similar PCEs in a reasonable range, while devices modified with KH550 and KH560 show lower efficiencies. The average PCEs of different devices based on c-TiO2, c-TiO2/KH550, c-TiO2/KH560, and c-TiO2/KH570 are 16.68, 15.71, 16.15, and 16.73% respectively (the forward scan curve is shown in Fig. S7, ESI†). Fig. 4b exhibits the PCE distribution histograms of >100 devices, without and with interface modification. The devices based on c-TiO2/KH570 show a narrower distribution than the control devices, while the PCE distribution of the devices modified with KH560 is broader than that of KH570-modified device and is narrower than the control and KH550-modified devices, which is consistent with the aforementioned results. The significant improvement in the PCE distribution and reproducibility of Pero-SCs is attributed to the compact and pinhole-free perovskite films. Considering these results, KH570 can be an appropriate interface modifier for fabricating high-quality light absorber layers. It has been confirmed to be beneficial not only for achieving high PCE but also for the long-term stability of Pero-SCs.

According to previous studies, the stability of Pero-SCs is another important factor for commercialization, apart from efficiency. The stability of the devices under UV light without encapsulation, at room temperature in a 60% relative humidity (RH) condition is illustrated. Fig. 4c displays the XRD patterns of the perovskite films without and with interface modification after the UV-aging test for 12 hours. The diffraction peak at 12.7° is a characteristic peak of the PbI2 phase, which confirms the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3. After the UV-aging test, the PbI2 peaks are found in all types of films. Remarkably, the CH3NH3PbI3 phase based on c-TiO2/KH570 remains intact and the intensities of the PbI2 peaks are still lower than others, revealing the significant effect of KH570 in enhancing the UV-light stability. Additionally, to further investigate the effect of c-TiO2/KH570 on the efficiency, the aging test result with normalized PCE of the control device and those of the devices modified with KH570 were measured and the results are depicted in Fig. 4d. The efficiency of the control devices reduced to 0 within 12 h, indicating the rapid decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3. However, the devices fabricated with c-TiO2/KH570 exhibit the best PCE of 9.31%. These results confirm the improved crystallinity of the perovskite induced by the introduction of KH570 between the c-TiO2 and CH3NH3PbI3 thin films.
Apart from interface modification, a UV-absorber layer was introduced on the front of the devices. It is widely known that perovskite materials such as CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbBr3, and CH(NH2)2PbI3 are prone to decompose under sunlight and UV-light. According to a previous report, TiO2 as a photocatalyst is sensitive to the shorter wavelengths of sunlight, which contributes to the decomposition of the perovskite absorber, while the ozone in the stratosphere of the earth can effectively absorb the ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths shorter than 306.3 nm.35,36 Considering the overall effect of the ozone and TiO2, 2-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4,6-bis(1-methyl-1-phenylethyl)phenol (named UV-234) was used to absorb the ultraviolet radiation of the wavelengths between 300 and 400 nm to protect the perovskite films. UV-234 is usually adopted to improve the light stability of polymers under many harsh environments. First, the UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption of UV-234 was measured to characterize the transmission of the UV-light between 300 and 400 nm. Fig. 5a exhibits the UV-vis absorption spectra of UV-234 at different concentrations. Obviously, transmission of the far-ultraviolet radiation between 300 and 400 nm decreases almost to zero with an increase in the concentration of UV-234 to 0.25 g mL−1. Finally, UV-234 with the optimized concentration of 0.25 g mL−1 was spin-coated onto the front of the devices at a speed of 2850 rpm for 30 s.

(b) PCE sacrifice statistics of the corresponding Pero-SCs with modification of UV absorber coating, (c) EQE curves of the control device with and without coating a UV absorber layer, (d) XRD patterns of perovskite films without and with the UV-absorber layer upon UV irradiation environments without encapsulation. 
To date, several articles have suggested that the ultraviolet radiation is detrimental to the optoelectronic properties and high quality of the perovskite films. However, hardly any reported the specific impacts on the efficiency evolution of the solar cells resulting from the decomposition induced by UV radiation. In order to determine whether the UV light contributes to the PCE of Pero-SCs and how much the contribution rates of ultraviolet are, the PCE values of pristine devices without and with the UV-absorber layer were measured and the results are shown in Fig. 5b. The control cells exhibit a PCE value of 16.55% (Voc = 1.04 V, Jsc = 22.35 mA cm−2, and FF = 71.32%), revealing a 2.2% decrease compared to those of the devices coated with the UV absorber (Voc = 1.03 V, Jsc = 21.91 mA cm−2, and FF = 71.34%). To further confirm the effects of UV-234 on the optoelectronic properties, external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured (Fig. 5c). The EQE spectrum of the devices irradiated with AM 1.5G photon flux yielded Jsc values of 21.43 and 20.85 mA cm−2 for the uncoated and UV-absorber-coated Pero-SCs, respectively, indicating a 2.7% decrease in the current density, which is in accordance with the aforementioned results within a reasonable error range. Simultaneously, the devices with the UV-absorber coating hardly exhibited photoresponses over the far-UV region (300–400 nm), which also confirms the blocking effects of UV-234 to ultraviolet light. Taking the efficiency sacrifice of Pero-SCs into consideration, another important factor on the commercialization of these devices is the long-term stability under normal operation. Fig. 5d shows the XRD patterns of CH3NH3PbI3 films before and after the UV-aging test for 12 hours without and with the UV-absorber layer. After UV-aging, an obvious peak at 12.7° consistent with the diffraction peak of PbI2 is observed for the control CH3NH3PbI3 films, while the major diffraction peaks of CH3NH3PbI3 were intact in the perovskite films with the UV-absorber, revealing that UV-234 can block the harmful ultraviolet light effectively and thereby prolong the service life of the device with little sacrifice of PCE under harsh testing conditions.
Finally, in order to determine the compounding effect of KH570 and UV-234 to Pero-SCs, a rather brutal aging test was expected to investigate a decomposition process rapidly under UV irradiation without any protection, as shown in Fig. 6, it can be seen that the PCE of the control devices was reduced to nearly zero rapidly indicative of the decomposition of the perovskite material, while the devices with modification of KH570 and coating UV-234 exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties than those without post-treatment. After the aging test, the modified cells exhibit the PCE of 13.67% (Voc = 0.98 V, Jsc = 19.51 mA cm−2 and FF = 71.25%), directly illustrating superior stability and a high tolerance for ultraviolet by compounding effects. Fig. 7 exhibits the SEM images of the CH3NH3PbI3 films without and with modification after the aging test. It can be seen clearly that the based films shows the irregular morphology (PbI2) compared to the intact and compacted CH3NH3PbI3 film, which is in accordance with the digital photos of perovskite films, as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The based perovskite films turn into yellow (PbI2), while the films with modification were unchanged under the same harsh test environment. And, more importantly, SEM images with low-magnification are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The above results perfectly show that the stability of devices and tolerance to UV-light can be enhanced by interface modification and filtering ultraviolet light.

Conclusions
We demonstrated that silane coupling agents (e.g., KH570) could be effectively introduced into the interface between the c-TiO2 and CH3NH3PbI3 films, as a modifier, in planar perovskite solar cells. The KH570 not only tunes the morphology of the films and leads to improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) distribution of the devices, but also stabilizes the perovskite solar cells under high ultraviolet irradiation. Moreover, a UV-absorber material (2-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4,6-bis(1-methyl-1-phenylethyl)phenol) was also coated simultaneously on the front of the devices to effectively filter the UV light between 300 and 400 nm. The device modified with both KH570 at the interface and a UV-absorber layer on the frontside exhibits an excellent stability against UV. More importantly, the contribution of the UV light to PCE (2.7%) of the perovskite solar cells was also studied. By analyzing these results, a new, commercial route for the fabrication of high-quality perovskite devices with highly improved stability under UV illumination is provided.
