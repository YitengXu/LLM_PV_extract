    , Accepted 1st June 2017First published on 5th June 2017AbstractDegradation is among the most pressing problems facing organic materials, occurring through ingress of moisture and oxygen, and light exposure. We determine the nanoscale pathways underlying degradation by light-soaking organic films in an environmental chamber, and performing infrared spectroscopy, to identify atomic bonding changes. We utilize as a prototype the low band gap PTB7-PCBM blend. Films light-soaked in the presence of oxygen show unusual increased absorption at 1727 cm−1 attributable to increased CO modes, and a broad increase at 3240 cm−1 attributable to hydroxyl (O–H) groups bonded within the organic matrix. Films exposed to oxygen in the dark, or light-soaked in an inert atmosphere, do not exhibit significant absorption changes, suggesting simultaneous exposure of oxygen and light that creates singlet excited oxygen is the detrimental factor. Our ab initio electronic structure simulations interpret these by oxidation at the α-C site of the alkyl chains in PTB7, with an irreversible rupture of the alkyl chain and formation of new CO and C–O–H conformations at the α-C. Infrared spectroscopy coupled with ab initio simulation can provide a powerful tool for quantifying photo-structural atomic bonding changes. Understanding nanoscale light-induced structural changes will open avenues to designing more stable organic materials for organic electronics.
Introduction
Organic electronics are a very appealing platform for low cost, flexible solar cells and displays. A primary problem in organic materials is their stability. One of the primary roadblocks preventing commercial deployment of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is their instability during light exposure, often in a few hours or days.1–3 Such stability issues are also a major concern in the new perovskite family of solar cells.4,5
The photo-degradation of OPVs in the presence of light and ultraviolet (UV) exposure1,6–12 show the loss of short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and efficiency (η) after light-soaking in inert and ambient environments. Measurements of mid-gap states in films found increases in mid-gap densities of electronic states with light and UV exposure, with a hint of stabilization at long time.6 It is well-recognized that energetic blue and UV photons can break bonds and lead to structural changes in organic materials. The oxidation of conjugated vinylene groups has been characterized1,2 and detailed measurements have identified the diffusion of metal from the cathode, and In from the ITO contact, as potential sources of degradation. Hole-transport layers such as PEDOT:PSS and the various interfaces in organic solar cells (OSCs) have been suggested to cause instability.1,2 The widely studied prototypical polymer organic solar cell (OSC) with 3–4% efficiency, comprises P3HT-PC60BM, with alkyl chains attached to the thiophene group (Fig. 1a). These solar cells exhibited creation of mid-gap states in ∼96 hours of light-exposure in an environmental chamber under nitrogen flow.8 Street et al.13 observed a near stabilization of the defect density over several days for PCDTBT:PC70BM cells. Much longer light exposure (exceeding a year), observed an initial burn-in period where OSC characteristics drop nearly exponentially, followed by a slow linear decay.7,14 The low band gap polymer PCDTBT (utilized for higher efficiency (>6%) solar cells), with alkyl chains bonded to N in the aromatic backbone (Fig. 1b) may exhibit higher stability than P3HT-PCBM.15 OSC stability also depend on the conformation of the polymer, as illustrated by the low band gap polymer PTB7, used in higher efficiency (7–9%) solar cells (Fig. 1c), which has alkyl chains connected to an aromatic backbone via a bridging O atom. PTB7 shows lower stability16 and faster light-induced degradation than the P3HT based solar cells, with recent studies indicating the fill factor and short circuit current degrade the most.17

These observations suggest that the atomic configuration of the polymer strongly influences photo-induced changes and photo-stability. Utilizing rigorous ab initio simulations, Northrup18 and Street et al.,13 proposed that local H-motion from the α-C to the thiophene ring forming a CH2 defect could account for many features of the P3HT and P3AT (A = alkyl) photo-degradation. Electron paramagnetic resonance after light-irradiation of polymer (PBDTTT)-fullerene blends recently established metastable C-dangling bonds as the spin-active defect19 and it is of great interest to identify the chemical bonding changes generating such spin-active defects. Experiments on oxidized PTB7 and PTB7:PC70BM blends observed changes in the Raman spectrum, attributed to oxidation within the benzo-dithiophene (BDT) portion of the aromatic backbone.16 The formation of singlet oxygen, from non-geminate triplet excitons, has also been proposed to cause instability.20 In our previous work21 we simulated intrinsic defect formation from reconfiguration of PTB7 occurring through local O and local H-motion. In spite of these intriguing proposals, there have been just a few studies16 on experimentally characterizing the structural changes during the degradation process, and correlating the changes with ab initio calculations. There has been relatively little fundamental understanding of what organic polymer atomic conformation, can lead to more stable devices, and how organic materials may be designed to be more stable.
To avert the complexity with interfaces, electron-transport and hole-transport layers in OSCs, we focus on the stability of the intrinsic absorber layer alone here. Changes in device architecture (e.g. using an inverted OSC) cannot avert the instability underlying the absorber layer. This has led us here, to experimentally characterize through infrared (IR) spectroscopy, structural changes in the organic polymer films on standard salt substrates, induced by light-soaking. We focus on the low-band gap donor–acceptor PTB7-PCBM blend, since this has led to higher efficiency solar cells (η ∼ 7–9%).17 We find large measurable changes in infrared absorption before and after light-soaking in the presence of oxygen. We interpret the results with our ab initio calculations of light-induced bonding rearrangements.
Our approach is to spin coat organic polymer absorber layers on infrared (IR) transparent salt (NaCl) substrates, under the same conditions and thicknesses in OSCs. For donor–acceptor blends we expect the same bulk morphology in films that were present in devices. As-deposited (pristine) films, isolated from moisture and oxygen, were characterized with IR spectroscopy, to identify IR-active vibrational modes. The organic films were then light-soaked in an environmental chamber, under inert N2, ambient air and dry air conditions, and their infrared absorption was re-measured. The light-soaked films were compared with the reference pristine film, to identify atomic bonding changes. Interpretations of atomic bonding changes and IR absorption changes, can be made more readily for films than in complex solar cell structure where multiple layers and interfaces can contribute. Moreover infrared spectroscopy is a powerful tool since the polymers have strong infrared-active modes, dominated by CHn (n = 2 being the dominant species, and n = 3 much weaker) in the alkyl chains (Fig. 1), C–S in the thiophene groups, C–O or C–F in PTB7-PCBM, and bending vibrations in the aromatic backbone. Significant changes in the infrared absorption spectrum indicate that a sufficient density of species show conformational changes, and our work may be among the first to find such measureable changes in infrared spectra.
Experimental
The organic films were spin-coated on salt (NaCl) substrates, since NaCl is transparent to IR from 4000 cm−1 to 650 cm−1 as confirmed by its featureless IR absorption. A solution of PTB7 polymer (1-Material, 10 mg) and PC60BM (Nano-C, 15 mg) in dichlorobenzene solvent (Sigma Aldrich, 0.97 mL) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive (Sigma Aldrich, 0.03 mL (i.e. 3%)) was prepared in the glove-box and stirred for 12 hours at 75 °C and 300 rpm. The PTB7:PC60BM blend was spin-coated on the NaCl salt substrate at 600 rpm for 60 seconds, in the glove-box. The sample was then dried at 100 °C for 30 minutes on a hot-plate. For these deposition conditions the film thickness was ∼100 nm, typical of the absorber layer in PTB7:PC60BM OSCs.
Previous experiments on PTB7-PCBM by Guo et al.22 found that annealing at 120 °C for 30 minutes did not change optical properties but significantly reduced the short circuit current and power conversion efficiency of the organic solar cell. We did not anneal at such higher temperatures (120 °C) which can alter the lamellar packing of the PTB7, but took care to dry our films at 100 °C. We consider drying as an important step to remove the solvent and the additive from our spin-coated films which can introduce unwanted features in the infrared absorption spectrum. We compared PTB7:PC60BM films that were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min and 30 min, and found the IR absorption of these to be very similar (ESI Fig. S1†). This indicated that that IR absorption was insensitive to the anneal time.
Spin-coating and drying processes were performed in the nitrogen filled glove-box, where H2O and O2 levels were only a few ppm. To perform the light-induced degradation, illumination of the samples was carried out in an environmental chamber (Fig. S2, ESI†) at 4× Sun intensity for 24 hours, under conditions of (i) inert N2 flow, (ii) ambient air atmosphere containing both oxygen and moisture, and (iii) dry air consisting of 70:30 N2:O2. The circulating gas and a fan inside the chamber were utilized to keep the sample near room temperature (∼30 °C).
Pristine (un-degraded) and light degraded samples were sealed in an air-tight transfer-tube for Fourier-Transform IR (FTIR) spectroscopy. FTIR spectroscopy was performed in a Bruker Vertex 70 V FTIR spectrometer. The samples on NaCl substrates were placed within the sample chamber in vacuum to avoid exposure to the atmosphere. Infrared transmission measurements were performed for two reference configurations comprising of (i) no sample – straight transmission (ii) NaCl substrate (without) organic film. Transmission measurements of pristine and light-degraded films were performed at room temperature, over ∼2 hours, allowing the measurements to stabilize. Transmission measurements were performed with the beam incident on the uncoated surface of NaCl, although the transmission through the coated surface is equivalent, due to reciprocity. To identify absorption changes, we referred both the pristine and light-degraded films to the bare NaCl substrate as the reference.
Results and discussion
PTB7 is an intra-molecular donor–acceptor configuration with thienothiophene (TT) and benzodithiophene (BDT) pairs, forming the hole transport phase in OSCs. The donor TT units contain electronegative F, whereas the acceptor BDT has two thiophene groups (Fig. 1c). PCBM is the commonly used acceptor and electron transport phase.
IR spectroscopy has a sensitivity of a few parts in 1000, and is not expected to measure changes below such a threshold. It is known6,8 that the OSC density of electronic states changes after light soaking in N2 are in the range of 1017 cm−3, or 1 atom in 105 and such changes are not expected to be resolved in IR measurements. IR measurements probe much larger changes in atomic bonding configuration.
We performed IR spectroscopy of pristine and light-soaked PTB7:PCBM films, that were light-soaked in N2, ambient air and dry air (in a mixture of 70:30 N2:O2). Additionally, we kept films in the dark in an ambient atmosphere for one week and re-measured their IR absorption. The largest measurable changes in the IR absorption were observed in films that were light-soaked in dry air or in the ambient atmosphere. No measurable changes were observed for films exposed to air in the dark, implying that oxygen or moisture alone does not cause degradation. Instead it is necessary to have a combination of oxygen and light. The likely interpretation is that light excites triplet molecular oxygen to its excited singlet state (), which in turn reacts with organic species.
We measured the infrared transmission of pristine PTB7:PC60BM blend (Fig. 2a and b) and the light-degraded blend (Fig. 2) films in N2, utilizing the reference of a bare NaCl substrate. For clarity of interpretation, we divide the IR absorption spectrum into (i) the higher frequency region above 2000 cm−1 (Fig. 2a) and (ii) the lower frequency region between 1000–2000 cm−1 (Fig. 2b). Standard infrared absorption tables23,24 are utilized to identify the inter-molecular species contributing to the vibrational modes. Among the principal IR-active species contributing to the absorption, are the large density of ethyl (CH2) groups within the alkyl chains, that are connected to the aromatic backbone. The well-known six vibration modes of the CH2 group with their gas phase vibrational frequencies, consist of the asymmetric stretch (∼2926 cm−1), symmetric stretch (∼2853 cm−1), scissor bend (∼1450 cm−1), twist (∼1250 cm−1), in-plane wag (∼1250 cm−1), and a low frequency rocking mode (∼720 cm−1). Such CH2 modes are found in our measurement, albeit at slightly shifted frequencies.

The pristine PTB7-PCBM film (Fig. 2a) displays well-defined IR-active vibrational modes, that we index (Table 1), utilizing the standard IR assignments23,24 to be: (1) a closely spaced doublet at 2961 and 2933 cm−1 assigned to the asymmetric CH2 stretch vibration. (2) A weaker absorption feature at 2867 cm−1, assigned to the CH2 symmetric stretch. (3 and 4) Below 2000 cm−1 there are a rich variety of modes for pristine PTB7 (Fig. 2b) arising from bending and stretching vibrations. A mode pair at 1728 cm−1 and 1705 cm−1 can be assigned to stretch modes of CO in the O–CO configuration in PTB7, corresponding to the ester conformational geometries (RO–CO; R = alkyl). PCBM also contributes to CO stretching modes. (5) The 1569 cm−1 mode is ascribed to the IR-active combination of CC stretch in the TT and BDT units in the aromatic backbone that have a weak infrared active absorption. In Raman measurements16 these produce weak Raman active modes at 1549 cm−1 and 1578 cm−1. (6) The weak shoulder at 1458 cm−1 can be assigned to the methyl (CH3) asymmetric bend, since CH3 conformations cap the alkyl chains. CH3 capping groups are far fewer that CH2, resulting in much weaker CH3 features. (7) The strong 1431 cm−1 absorption can be assigned to the CH2 scissor bend. (8) The weak feature at ∼1400 cm−1 is assigned to the CF stretch, from the single F atom within the conjugated portion of PTB7. (9) A weak 1367 cm−1 feature assigned to the CH3 symmetric bend, is paired with its symmetric bend (see 6) at 1458 cm−1. (10 and 11) The two overlapping modes at 1294 cm−1 and 1261 cm−1, can be assigned to a combination of the asymmetric C–O–C stretch and the CH2 twist, which both lie in this region. (12) The 1183 cm−1 feature is assigned to a C–O stretch in the ester functional group, present in the TT portion of PTB7, containing the ester conformation R–O–CO (COOR). (13) The 1153 cm−1 mode is assigned to the CH2 in-plane wag. (14) The 1061 cm−1 mode likely arises from the C–O–C symmetric stretch, a counterpart of its asymmetric stretch (10) at 1294 cm−1.

We performed a photo-degradation of the PTB7:PCBM blend film in an inert N2 atmosphere in an environmental chamber. All of the IR absorption features of the pristine are also found in the degraded PTB7 sample (Fig. 2; Table 1), albeit with slightly shifted wavelengths (by ∼2–3 cm−1), but with similar line shape. The high frequency region (4000 cm−1 to 2000 cm−1, Fig. 2a) depict similar features for the pristine and N2 photo-degraded blend except for some change in the overall slope. Photo-degradation of individual PTB7 films (Fig. S2, ESI†) and PCBM films (Fig. S3, ESI†) in an inert N2 atmosphere, also did not show significant absorption changes, similar to these results of the blend.
We performed the photo-degradation of PTB7-BCBM blend films in ambient air (in the presence of oxygen and moisture, with a relative humidity ∼40–50%) instead of the inert N2, (Fig. 3a and b), similar to the measurements of Razzel-Hollis et al.16 We observe much larger changes in the IR spectrum of the light-degraded blend in the ambient atmosphere. The features of the ambient degraded film are much weaker than the pristine film and the smaller absorption features of the pristine film are not apparent. We find a stronger absorption feature at 1727 cm−1 and a new broad and weak absorption mode at 3240 cm−1 appearing in the ambient-degraded blend film (Fig. 3). The strong 1727 cm−1 feature arises from CO bond stretching modes. Although CO bonds are present in the pristine film, this feature has much higher strength in the ambient-degraded blend film, suggesting an increase of CO bonds when photo-degradation is performed in oxygen environments. At the wavelength of 1600 cm−1 there is a significant increased absorption in dry air, and a weak absorption in ambient- a feature that was absent in the pristine blend.
 Fig. 3  Measured infrared (IR) transmission spectra of PTB7:PCBM blend films. Pristine and photo-degraded in ambient air atmosphere blend film at (a) high frequency and (b) at low frequency. Pristine and photo-degraded in dry air (N2:O2 70:30) at (c) high frequency, and (d) at low frequency. 
The weak 3240 cm−1 feature can be ascribed to stretching modes of O–H bonds from bonded H in the structure in a C–O–H configuration. This is distinguished from molecular water absorption modes that occur above 3600 cm−1 which may also be slightly present. Very few bond-stretching conformations produce vibrational modes at such high frequencies. Trapped water (H2O) has significantly higher frequency modes, between 3600 cm−1 and 3800 cm−1, and cannot contribute to the 3240 cm−1 feature. An alternative candidate is the N–H vibrational modes which occur in this region. However, there are no N sites in PTB7 and we can rule out the presence of N–H or trapped ammonia species in the sample.
To assess the relative importance of moisture and oxygen, we performed light soaking in dry air (with a 70:30 N2:O2 mixture) (Fig. 3c and d). We observed increased absorption of the 1727 cm−1 mode from CO bonds (Fig. 3d), a similar photo-degradation feature seen in ambient air. There is also a broad weak absorption at 3200 cm−1 (Fig. 3c) suggesting also O–H bonds from bonded H in the structure in a C–O–H configuration. Since the results of photo-degradation in ambient air and dry air are very similar, we infer that moisture has negligible effect, and the primary source of degradation is oxygen in the presence of illumination. Furthermore, photo-degradation in N2 does not cause significant changes in absorption spectra, strengthening our conclusion that O2 with light is the primary degradation source. We also kept the pristine blend films in the dark under ambient conditions (in the presence of oxygen and moisture). However, no significant changes in the absorption spectra were found. This suggests that illumination combined with oxygen is necessary to cause degradation.
The most significant change occurs when the PTB7:PC60BM blend is light-soaked under ambient atmospheric conditions or in dry air. The appearance of strong absorption at 1727 cm−1 (Fig. 2b and d) corresponds to a strong CO stretch vibration mode. This is accompanied by new broad absorption at 3240 cm−1 attributable to O–H stretch for hydroxyl groups bonded within the organic matrix. The likely source of these features is the oxidation of the PTB7, in which the O2 molecule is photo-excited from its triplet ground state to the excited singlet state ().  is well-known to be very reactive and can oxidize organic molecules with vinylene groups (e.g. MEH-PPV) to form C–O–O–C ring conformations or CO conformations.1 Our simulations below suggest  can attack PTB7 at the α-C site, well-known to be the most reactive C site. PTB7-PCBM films left in the ambient atmosphere in the dark over several days do not show significant absorption changes, in spite of continuous exposure to oxygen and moisture. This is consistent with triplet O2 being unreactive and the role of light exposure to excite triplet O2 to singlet  as the initiating step to degradation.

Ab initio simulations
We performed ab initio simulations to identify a pathway for oxidation of PTB7. The Spanish Initiative for Electronic Simulations with Thousands of Atoms (SIESTA)25 method was employed to simulate the electronic properties. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) with the SIESTA method utilized Troullier–Martins norm-conserving pseudo-potentials,26 in a fully non-local form, with a basis set of multiple-zeta pseudo atomic orbitals. The self-consistent potential was calculated on a real space grid whose spacing was determined by an energy cut-off of 100 Ry. We used the general gradient approximation (GGA) using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) parametrization of the exchange–correlation functional27 to treat the nonlocal exchange and correlation energies. We obtain the electronic structure, density of states, and total energies. The local-orbital based SIESTA method allows computationally efficient calculations in a multi-processor environment. Structural relaxation is performed with a steepest descent algorithm to obtain low energy configurations. Although PTB7 is a polymer we adopted a 105-atom segment of the PTB7 chain by capping the ends of the conjugated segment with H atoms. This permitted the use of a simulation cell (with 2.41 nm × 2.15 nm × 1.35 nm dimensions) with periodic boundary conditions. We started with the fully relaxed PTB7 (Fig. S4, ESI†) as the reference configuration, that does not have any levels within the electronic band gap, and a HOMO–LUMO separation of 1.54 eV, slightly smaller than the experimental band gap of 1.63 eV. We simulate external O2 reaction with the α-C, and find the α-C loses an H, which transfers to the neighboring β-C (Fig. 4). The oxygen molecule bonds to the α-C resulting in the OCα –O–H configuration, with a new CO bond and a new C–O–H group at the α-C (Fig. 4b). The bridging Cα–O–C between the polymer and the aromatic backbone remains undisturbed. Schematically this reaction is represented as (1)
 Fig. 4  
Ab initio simulations of the oxidation of the PTB7 polymer. (a) The starting configuration showing a portion of the PTB7 monomer (Fig. S4, ESI†) in which the bridging O is bonded to α-C and the aromatic backbone. (b) The degraded configuration with CO and C–O–H formation at α-C, resulting in the irreversible cleavage of the polymer. 
The simulated enthalpy change for this reaction was −5.76 eV. The large energy gain is expected since the initial O–O (bond energy 5.15 eV), C–C (3.6 eV), and two C–H (4.4 eV-ethyl) are converted to C–H (4.57 eV-methyl), CO (7.7 eV), C–O (3.71 eV), and O–H (4.81 eV). A net energy gain ∼3.24 eV (i.e. 20.79–17.55 eV) is estimated. The new CO configuration at the α-C, results in the increased absorption at 1727 cm−1, observed in degradation with ambient or dry air. There is a new hydroxyl group at the α-C, belonging to a carboxylic acid (COOH) configuration, and this OH stretch is expected to generate broad IR absorption modes in the high frequency region (3100–3400 cm−1). We do observe a new weak IR absorption at 3240 cm−1 in ambient or dry air degraded blend films (Fig. 3), that corresponds to this hydroxyl stretch mode at α-C. The stretch frequency is significantly lower than that of OH in water molecules (>3600 cm−1).
The alkyl chain ruptures and breaks away from the α-C site. After the oxidation reaction, the alkyl chain is capped by the β-C with a methyl CH3 group (Fig. 4b). The oxidation is an irreversible degradation pathway in which the polymer chain detaches from the aromatic backbone. Since the α-C remains bonded to the aromatic backbone through a C–O–C bridge (Fig. 4b) the symmetric and asymmetric C–O–C vibrational modes are largely unchanged, consistent with the observed IR absorption (Fig. 3).
We envisage an alternative oxidation pathway can involve CO formation on the α-C and a C–O–H on the β-C, leaving two C–H bonds on both α-C and β-C, represented by: (2)
Such a reaction would also be consistent with the observed increases of CO and C–O–H bonds, and the rupture of the PTB7 monomer.
Auxillary absorption changes
In addition to the significant changes to the IR absorption at 3240 cm−1 and 1727 cm−1, there are additional IR changes after photo-degradation. A notable change is the increased absorption at 1600 cm−1 after degradation in dry air (Fig. 3(d)) that also appears as a weak feature for the degradation in ambient (Fig. 3(b)). Although water has H–O–H bending modes near 1600 cm−1, our observed absorption increase at 1600 cm−1 cannot be simply interpreted as due to water since the change occurs in dry air in the absence of moisture, and is not accompanied by significant increases in the O–H stretch at 3500–3600 cm−1.
We suggest that the increased absorption at 1600 cm−1 maybe linked to changes in the aromatic backbone. In previous ab initio simulations of PTB721 we observed the local motion of the bridging O to the aromatic backbone to form CO, and leaving behind a C-dangling bond on the α-C (Fig. 5). Our simulations indicate the local reconfiguration has an energy barrier near 2.7 eV which can be surmounted with blue photons, with a net change in enthalpy of 2.17 eV. This internal re-configuration causes a loss of aromaticity in the backbone, and two CC and four C–C in-ring bonds (Fig. 5b), forming a cyclic alkene configuration. The CC stretch modes for cyclic alkenes are known to occur between 1566–1650 cm−1,23 and can explain the increased 1600 cm−1 absorption. This internal reconfiguration also increases the CO stretch at 1727 cm−1, but would not affect high frequency modes near 3200 cm−1.

External O2 or  is not directly needed for this reconfiguration, but our experiments suggest that light soaking in O-containing dry air can be effective in driving this reaction, although light soaking in the presence of moisture is less effective. More studies are needed to quantify these changes.
Photo-degradation in either ambient or dry air (Fig. 3(b) and (d)) shows (i) an overall decrease of the absorption (especially at lower frequencies) and (ii) the absence of fine absorption features seen in the pristine sample.
We investigated the role of the NaCl substrate by photo-exposure of the bare uncoated NaCl in ambient atmosphere (Fig. S6, ESI†). No new IR absorption features were induced in the NaCl substrate on light exposure. There is an overall decrease in NaCl substrate transmission by ∼8% after photo-degradation in ambient atmosphere and 0–10% in dry air depending on the wavelength, (Fig. S6†). This agrees with the observed reduction of baseline transmission for the PTB7-PCBM blend samples after degradation (Fig. 3(a and b)). The 0.5 cm thick NaCl disks show some white discoloration after photo-degradation in ambient air, that causes scattering of the incident IR radiation. Since the NaCl is polycrystalline, it is likely that photoexposure develops finer scale polycrystalline grains in the NaCl that causes scattering. This scattering can dampen fine IR features observed in the pristine blend film. A magnified view of Fig. 3(b and d) reveals that the fine IR absorption features (between 1000–2000 cm−1) in the pristine film (Fig. 3) are present but far weaker in the photo-degraded film, and more difficult to distinguish from the background.
Pathways for nanoscale bond conformation
The previously suggested local H-motion from the α-C to the thiophene creating a CH2 defect within the thiophene group13,18 would leave the bridging oxygen C–O–C configuration unchanged, and would not be able to generate new CO or C–O–H configurations. In previous simulations21 we found intrinsic defect formation from reconfiguration of PTB7 (without external O2) by (i) local motion of the bridging O to the thiophene forming sequentially CO and then C–O–H (but no CO), and (ii) local H motion21 from the β-C to the α-C, producing a shifted Cβ–O–C bridge. However additional CO and C–O–H were not simultaneously produced in these pathways.
Raman spectroscopy16 suggested oxidation of PTB7 can form hydroxyl bonds on two equivalent CH sites within the TT unit at the 3,5 positions in the thiophene group, which however does not increase CO bonds. A suggested pathway to stabilize PTB7 is replacement of H at these sites by fluorine, since the hydroxyl formation would be eliminated. Fluorine substitution to synthesize PTBF2 and PTBF3 has been achieved.28 Fully fluorinated PTBF3 exhibits better photo-stability28 since the F prevents O–H bond formation within the aromatic backbone. However the fluorinated analogs PTBF2 and PTBF3 exhibited lower efficiencies of 3.2% and 2.3–2.7% respectively, markedly lower than the 7–8% of standard PTB7 (i.e. PTBF1), since the band gap widened to 1.73–1.75 eV with lowering of both the HOMO and LUMO levels.28 Fluorination within the aromatic backbone is not expected to affect the degradation pathway at the α-C found here. Although oxidation at the Sulphur site in the thiophene ring forming1 (OSO) or (S–O + C–O–H) has been suggested, it is not supported by the IR changes observed here. Unusual changes in IR absorption were also observed in reduced graphene oxide following O-rearrangements to produce strongly IR-active modes of O bonded to edge atoms.29
We measured the wavelength dependent optical absorption and found no significant changes between pristine and light-degraded samples in N2 or dry air (Fig. S5, ESI†). Notably, degradation of organic solar cells may be caused by changes in additional layers (PEDOT:PSS, ITO etc.) and interfaces of OSCs, in additional to the absorber layer, and our work does not consider the effect of such additional layers/interfaces. It is likely that photo-degradation in inert N2 is causing small bonding changes, below the measurement threshold of IR spectroscopy. Defect formation involving 1 in 104–105 atomic sites can only be observed through measurements of electronic sub-gap states or electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). EPR measurements19 of light-induced C-dangling bonds in polymer-fullerene blends with densities of 1018–1019 cm−3 may be below IR detection threshold. The small magnitude of light-induced degradation is well-known in the realm of inorganic solar cells, where amorphous hydrogenated silicon (a-Si:H) exhibits light-induced metastability or the Staebler–Wronski effect.30 The density of light-induced mid-gap electronic defects is ∼1016–1017 cm−3, equivalent to changes involving 1 atom out of ∼105.31–34 Such changes are exceedingly difficult to observe in IR spectroscopy, and can only be observed through subtle changes in the mid-gap electronic DOS or in electron spin resonance. In contrast, photo-structural changes in organic solar materials are orders of magnitude larger, and may affect a few % of all the atomic sites, as suggested by the new IR-active vibrational modes. This indicates fundamental differences between organic and inorganic materials. The lower stability of organic materials than inorganic, may be intimately related to the ease of carbon to form multiple bonding configurations and aromatic bonding configurations.
Conclusions
Photo-degradation is among the most pressing problems in organic electronics. We studied the photo-degradation of organic light-absorbing films (PTB7:PCBM) utilized in organic solar cells, performing infrared absorption spectroscopy on as-deposited and light-soaked films, in an environmental chamber under inert N2 flow, with ambient air and dry air. Significant additional unexpected IR active absorption modes were found in PTB7:PCBM blends light soaked in the presence of oxygen (in ambient atmosphere and dry air), consisting of an intermediate frequency mode (1727 cm−1) and a weak high frequency mode (3240 cm−1). No significant IR changes were seen after light soaking in inert N2, or in ambient conditions in the dark. We interpret photo-degradation originating from the presence of oxygen and light, through the photoexcitation of the O2 molecule from its triplet ground state to the excited singlet state (), that is well known to be very reactive.
To understand the atomistic pathways underlying this degradation we performed ab initio density functional simulations. We found oxidation occurring at the α-C site of the alkyl side chains, forming a new CO bond and a new C–O–H group at the α-C, accompanied by a rupture of the alkyl chains at the α-C site. This pathway accounts for the unusual measured increased strong absorption at 1727 cm−1 from the new CO stretch mode, whereas the broad absorption at 3240 cm−1 is attributable to C–O–H stretch for hydroxyl groups at α-C.
Organic polymers with bridging O may be substantially less photo-stable and our results offer pathways to designing more stable organic materials for solar cells and displays.
