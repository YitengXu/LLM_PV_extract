    , Accepted 23rd April 2020First published on 11th May 2020AbstractTernary organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the alloy model have great potential in maximizing the improvement of device performance due to the probability of simultaneously enhancing the photocurrent through morphology optimization and improving open circuit voltage (Voc) by energy level adjustment. However, rationally designing compatible materials and constructing an effective alloy remain difficult. In this manuscript, two donor isomers, BT-TO-ID and BT-OT-ID with non-covalently conformational locking of alkoxy groups at different position, were designed and synthesized to obtain an “ideal alloy”. A linearly tunable Voc was observed between the Voc limitation of binary blends with the changes of the composition across the full range, indicating the behavior of an ideal alloy in the ternary blends. A face-on molecular packing and an appropriate phase separation was observed in the ternary blends due to the strong interactions between the two isomers, which facilitated charge transport and charge recombination suppression. Notable improvements of 76% and 29% in device performance were obtained for the ternary blends compared with BT-OT-ID based and BT-OT-ID based binary devices, respectively. Therefore, this work provided a probable molecular design strategy to guide the construction of an effective alloy in ternary OSCs.
1. Introduction
Ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted much attention for their broad absorption spectrum while retaining simpler fabrication compared with tandem devices. Compared with binary OSCs, the addition of the third component could lead to improvements in short circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and/or open circuit voltage (Voc), resulting in evident enhancements in performance.1–9 Well-established mechanisms of ternary OSCs include energy transfer, charge transfer, parallel linkage, and alloy model.10–13 Alloy structure in ternary OSCs exhibits the following advantages.1,3,14–19 (a) Tuneable Voc. The Voc does not become pinned to the smaller one of the corresponding binary OSCs mainly due to a continuous change in the electronic state with composition changing.20 (b) Robust fabrication condition. Device optimization is much easier than in other mechanisms, because the exact location of the third component, or the overlapping between the absorption spectrum of the third component and fluorescence spectra of the host material, need not be considered. (c) Easy-modified morphology. The microstructure of the active layer has a high propensity to achieve ideal phase separation because of the strong physical interactions (miscibility) between the alloy materials. Although organic alloy is still a controversy on the definition and existence due to lots of restrictions of a real “organic alloy”, this term has been used in ternary OSCs, doping semiconductors and organic cocrystals.21,22 The “alloy” in ternary OSCs normally indicates a donor or acceptor phase formed by two or even more miscible materials, and the alloy electric states could be adjusted through the different ratios of the miscible compounds.1,3,14–20 The formation of alloy structure has demonstrated great potential to maximize the improvement of device performance due to the probability of achieving a simultaneously enhanced photocurrent through morphology optimization and an improved Voc by energy level adjustment. Moreover, the more complementary the two alloy materials are, the greater the performance improvement will be. However, the construction of such an effective alloy intentionally for ternary OSCs is the main challenge.
The basic rule of alloy formation is that the involved materials should be compatible and have strong interaction with one another. For alloys in ternary OSCs, having similar surface energy is definitely a prerequisite.23,24 The alloy model for ternary OSCs can be divided into three major categories, as follows. (1) Polymer alloy.20,23,25,26 Random copolymers, such as those containing 70–80% 3-hexyl thiophene and other different comonomers, are reported to produce the polymer alloy. The copolymer retained similar surface tension by the main monomers of 3-hexyl thiophene, whereas the random incorporation of small amount of common comonomers adjusted opto-electrical properties. However, the performances of such ternary OSC alloys were not evidently improved compared with their reference binary devices because of the difficulty in obtaining ideal morphology. (2) Small molecule–polymer alloy.14,17 The backbone units of the small molecule and the polymer are normally similar to achieve good compatibility. However, constructing the alloy in all blending ratios is difficult for the substantial disparity in molecular interactions between the small molecule and the polymer. This situation limits a further improvement of opto-electrical properties, morphology, and ultimately device performance. (3) Small molecule alloy.5,16,27–31 Compared with the previous two, this kind of alloy, especially the non-fullerene acceptor alloy, has become popular, recently. The main strategy for this kind of alloy construction is to select similar molecular backbones that slightly differ in end-capped acceptor modification.32–36 On the other hand, we exhibited a successful example where small molecular donors can form an alloy in kinetic-controlled conditions.27 However, rationally selecting or designing the third component remains challenging.
Herein, two donor regioisomers, BT-TO-ID and BT-OT-ID (Fig. 1a), were designed and synthesized. The two regioisomers owned a same molecular backbone, and differed only in the position of one alkoxy group. According to the rule “like dissolves like”, the same molecular backbone ensures their similarity to construct an ideal alloy. The difference in conformational locking positions aimed to obtain a relative noticeable difference in opto-electrical and molecular packing properties. We used PC71BM as the acceptor, and increments of the third component in the ternary OSCs revealed a linearly tuneable Voc, which indicates the formation of ideal alloy structures. Different from the edge-on orientations of binary blends, a face-on packing mode emerged owing to the strong interaction between the two isomers, leading to the formation of an ideal microstructure in the ternary blend. Hence, the ternary devices produced an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.14% and an astonishing increment of 76% over the reference binary devices based on the host materials, which can only manage a PCE of 4.61%. This work provides a probable strategy and guidance to construct an effective alloy model to maximize the improvement of efficiency in ternary OSCs.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Molecular design, geometries, and properties
The molecular structures of two isomers, BT-TO-ID and BT-OT-ID, are shown in Fig. 1a. Detailed synthesis scheme and structural characterization for the two isomers are shown in the ESI.† The side views of the calculated molecular geometries are shown in ESI,† Fig. S1. The BT-OT-ID molecule exhibited a more planar backbone (the dihedral angle between the alkoxythiophene and thienothiophene is 0°), whereas the BT-TO-ID molecule displayed a torsional backbone (the corresponding torsional angle is increased to 27°). The dihedral angle between the alkoxythiophene and acceptor unit for the simplified BT-OT-ID is 0° is different from the corresponding dihedral angle of BT-TO-ID (180°).
Relaxed potential surface energy (PSE) scans of rotamers between alkoxyled thiophene and its adjacent units in the two molecules were carefully investigated to further explain the differences in the molecular geometry (Fig. 1b and c). For BT-OT-ID, the linkage between BT (thienothiophene) and OT (alkoxythiophene) showed a planar conformation (dihedral angle: ∼0°) because of the “O⋯S” conformational locking. However, for BT-TO-ID, the linkage between TO (alkoxythiophene) and BT exhibited a much more torsional geometry (dihedral angle: ∼30°) without the non-covalent stabilization. Consequently, BT-OT-ID exhibited much better molecular planarity compared with BT-TO-ID. Given the preferred conformation of the alkoxythiophene and thienothiophene rotamer, the rotamer of the alkoxythiophene and acceptor unit was further studied, as shown in Fig. 1c. For BT-OT-ID, the relative lowest energy of OT-ID could be obtained at 0° (0 kcal mol−1). Nevertheless, for BT-TO-ID, the TO-ID rotamer could be locked up in a 180° conformation at the lowest energy state because of two reasons, as follows: (a) the H⋯O intramolecular attractive interactions at 180° (2.38 Å for H⋯O distance, which is much smaller than their corresponding Pauling van der Waals radius 2.50 Å37); and (b) the O⋯O intramolecular repulsive interactions at 0°. The latter was deduced from natural bond orbital charge distribution analysis (ESI,† Fig. S2), because both Os were negative, and a smaller O⋯O distance (2.53 Å) was observed compared with their corresponding Pauling van der Waals radius of 2.80 Å.37 The above analysis showed that different alkoxy-locked positions had a profound effect on molecular conformations and geometry. The alkoxy groups substituent that locked the π-bridge facilitated a more planar and delocalized geometry with a longer effective conjugated length, whereas the alkoxy groups substituent that locked the π-bridge and the acceptor unit led to the creation of less conformers.
The geometry and conformational differences between the two molecules had a substantial influence on molecular properties. Given the more planar conformation resulting from non-covalent interaction, the absorption spectrum for BT-OT-ID film (solution) red-shifted ca. 120 nm (70 nm) compared with BT-TO-ID film (solution) (Fig. 1d). In addition, BT-OT-ID exhibited better π–π stacking than BT-TO-ID, as deduced from its much evidently sharp shoulder peak. Consequently, the band-gap for the two molecules differed by a large margin, and the two isomers exhibited a compatible absorption spectrum. The molecular energy levels measured by cyclic voltammetry (ESI,† Fig. S3) were presented in Fig. 1e. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were −5.23 and −3.60 eV for BT-OT-ID and −5.31 and −3.54 eV for BT-TO-ID, respectively, and the corresponding calculated electron density distribution were shown at Fig. S3 (ESI†). The disparity in HOMO energy levels ensured the probability of tuning the open circuit voltage Voc in the ternary blends (the detailed data of photoelectric properties resulted from calculations and experiments have been summarized in Table S1 in ESI†). Furthermore, the two molecules exhibited extensively dissimilar crystalline properties. The grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) patterns of the pristine films (ESI,† Fig. S4) show that both molecules exhibited edge-on molecular packing orientation as evident from the presence of (100) peak in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and (010) peak in the in-plane (IP) direction. However, the BT-OT-ID evidently demonstrated much better and ordered molecular assembly due to the presence of lamellar peaks besides the (100) peaks in the OOP direction. As discussed earlier, this disparity between the molecular packing of the two isomers originated from differences in backbone planarity and effective conjugated length as a consequence of the conformational locking positions. Therefore, two isomers with distinct molecular packing, absorption, and energy levels were obtained through the introduction of alkoxy groups into the two different positions.
2.2. Device performances
The ternary devices were fabricated utilizing an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO (30 nm)/active layers (ca. 90 nm)/MoOx (5 nm)/Ag (160 nm) (Fig. 2a) using PC71BM as the acceptor. Device performances based on various weight ratios of BT-TO-ID in the ternary systems were carefully investigated, and the corresponding results are summarized in Table 1. The best device performance was obtained with a blend ratio (BT-OT-ID:BT-TO-ID:PC71BM) of 0.9:0.6:1 (weight ratio of BT-TO-ID in the two isomers is 40%) using o-chlorophenol (0.6% CP) as additive, and the detailed device optimization results are summarized in Tables S2–S4 in ESI.†Fig. 2b and c contains the J–V curves and the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) results for the two binary systems (BT-TO-ID/PC71BM and BT-OT-ID/PC71BM) and the best ternary device (40%), whereas the J–V and EQE curves for other ratios are displayed in ESI,† Fig. S5. A PCE of 8.14% was achieved for the best ternary devices, indicating an increment of 76% over the reference binary devices based on the host materials, which can only manage a PCE of 4.61%. These results signified such difference in PCE as one of the top-ranked improvements compared with previously reported ternary cells. The Voc, Jsc, and FF exhibited enhancements of approximately 6.2%, 13.4%, and 45.3% respectively, compared with the reference binary blends.

Fig. 2d shows that the ternary blends retained their outstanding performances even when working with a wide range of weight ratios, i.e., from 30% to 60%. Furthermore, an approximately linear trend in the Voc of the ternary blends was observed as the BT-TO-ID weight ratio increased from 0% to 100%, indicating the probable formation of alloy. These results met our expectations and are analysed in detail in the following sections. The enhanced Jsc in the ternary blends can likewise be attributed to the complementary absorption spectrum in the 450–600 nm range as a consequence of BT-TO-ID addition and as the more efficient utilization of absorbed photons, which was deduced from the enhanced EQE values in the ca. 400 nm region (the absorption spectrum region of PC71BM). The improved Jsc and FF indicated the synergistic effect of the two isomers that contributed to the efficient charge separation and transport within the active layer. These enhancements can further be confirmed by the relatively high FF of 72.6% in the ternary devices. However, drastic dissimilarities in the performances of the two binary OSCs can be associated with their different molecular geometries, electronic properties, and corresponding morphologies, as discussed earlier.
2.3. Morphology and phase separation
GIWAXS was used to investigate the microstructure of the active layers. The 2D images and 1D curves based on ternary blends with different ratios of BT-TO-ID are shown in Fig. 3a–c. The two isomers exhibited substantially different molecular assemblies in the pristine films and their corresponding binary blends with PC71BM. Hence, the BT-OT-ID binary blends (labelled 0%) exhibited relatively more ordered and preferential edge-on orientation compared with its pristine film (Fig. S4, ESI,†) due to the moderately apparent but strong lamellar (n00; n = 1, 2 and 3) peaks in the OOP direction and the (010) peak in the IP direction. In addition, a same π–π stacking distance was observed for BT-OT-ID in the pristine films and the blends (3.60 Å), indicating that the additives and the PC71BM did not disrupt much of the crystallinity of BT-OT-ID. By contrast, the BT-TO-ID binary blends (labelled 100%) revealed a relatively decreased crystalline intensity compared with their pristine films, which could be inferred from the much weaker lamellar (100) peak in OOP direction and the disappearance of the (010) peak in the IP direction. Hence, under optimized conditions, the BT-TO-ID represented much better miscibility but poor crystallinity with PC71BM, whereas the BT-OT-ID behaved in the opposite manner. Through the above analysis, whether in pristine or blend films, the morphology of the two isomers apparently complemented each other.
 Fig. 3  (a) 2D GIWAXS results of ternary blends with different weight ratios of BT-TO-ID; (b) OOP curves of 2D GIWAXS patterns; (c) IP curves of 2D GIWAXs pattern. 
However, in the ternary blends, as the weight ratio of the less ordered BT-TO-ID increased, the lamellar (n00) (n = 1–3) peaks gradually disappeared. The (200) peak retained its position in the ternary blends at a BT-TO-ID weight ratio of 20% and 30% but vanished at 40% and 50% concentrations. The addition of BT-TO-ID probably led to the formation of relatively smaller nano-crystallites by tuning molecular crystallinity. By contrast, the decreased weight ratios of BT-TO-ID inclusion led to relatively greater domain sizes. Consequently, the interpenetration network with proper phase separation was well tuned in the ternary blend with the weight ratio of BT-TO ID at ca. 40%, which could be further explained by the following morphology analysis. And consequently, the efficiency of exciton dissociation, charge transportation, and collection were enhanced.
Furthermore, a remarkably intense and sharp (010) peak emerged in the OOP direction at BT-TO-ID weight ratios of 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%, demonstrating an evident BT-TO-ID induced face-on packing mode in the ternary blends. Compared with the edge-on packing mode, the face-on packing mode facilitated charge transport through the reduced charge transport routes and stronger electronic coupling. This phenomenon was already reported for ternary OSCS exhibiting the alloy model, indicating a strong interaction between the two isomers.14
Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to further confirm surface and bulk phase separation (Fig. 4). TEM images for the BT-TO-ID binary blends show that the relatively more apparent alternative dark and light regions indicated better donor and acceptor mixing within the system, thereby facilitating exciton dissociation but was adverse to charge transport. By contrast, TEM images for the BT-OT-ID blends reveal relatively larger domains in their TEM images that were beneficial to charge transportation but detrimental to exciton dissociation. Hence, these results further confirmed the complementary morphology of the two isomers. Correspondingly, TEM images for the ternary blends revealed a more evident boundary between the dark and light regions compared with BT-TO-ID binary blends. Relatively smaller domain sizes with rod-like shape were observed in the ternary blends compared with the flake form in the BT-OT-ID binary blends. AFM top images revealed a similar phenomenon. Consequently, miscibility and phase separation in the ternary blends appeared to be in good equilibrium, which is consistent with the GIWAXS results.

Compared with BT-OT-ID binary blends, the ternary blends displayed a substantial enhancement (ca. 45%) in the FF (Fig. 5a). Hole and electron mobility of binary and ternary blends were measured using the space-charge limited current method by utilizing hole-only and electron-only device structures to elucidate the essential reason. Fig. 5b exhibits mobility as the function of BT-TO-ID weight ratio and shows that the BT-OT-ID blends exhibited lower electron (hole) mobility compared with BT-TO-ID and ternary blends. This difference can be attributed to the relatively stronger molecular packing ability of BT-OT-ID that led to the formation of isolated domain islands and blocked the charge transport continuity. For BT-TO-ID blends, the relatively lower hole mobility than that of ternary blends can be attributed to its relatively poor molecular packing. Furthermore, a gradual increase in the hole mobility was observed as the BT-TO-ID weight ratio was increased from 0% to 40% in the ternary blends; the latter demonstrated the highest value. This phenomenon can be probably attributed to the steady increase in the stronger face-on π–π stacking ratio (Fig. 5c) and the formation of less blocked charge transport routes as a consequence of BT-TO-ID inclusion. Hence, when utilizing compatible and complementary morphology of the two isomers, ternary OSCs exhibited a more ideal interpenetrating network morphology, enhancing hole and electron charge transport, and ultimately, the FF.

2.4. Alloy formation and device stability characterization
Hence, quasi-linear variation in the Voc as a consequence of the addition of the third component and emergence of an (010) peak in the OOP direction of the ternary blend as well as effective regulation of the blend morphology indicated the strong interaction between the two isomers and the formation of an alloy. Furthermore, the binding energies of BT-OT- ID/PC71BM, BT-TO-ID/PC71BM, and BT-OT-ID/BT-TO-ID were calculated using DFT methods with long-range corrected functional CAM-B3LYP and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set to confirm that the interaction between the two isomers was stronger than that with PC71BM. The isomer complex had a lower binding energy (−6.26, −8.02, and −8.76 kcal mol−1) than the two other complexes (−2.15, −2.27, and −2.47 kcal mol−1 for BT-OT-ID/PC71BM; −1.37, −2.61, and −2.84 kcal mol−1 for BT-TO-ID/PC71BM) (ESI,† Fig. S6), indicating the good compatibility between the two isomers.
Given that disparity in surface energy and interfacial tension is considered one of the essences for alloy and morphology formation, the surface tension of the individual molecules and the interfacial tension between the two molecules were analysed via contact angle measurement according to the literature.17,18 The corresponding results are summarized in Table 2 (contact angle measurement images are displayed in ESI,† Fig. S7). Table 2 shows that the BT-TO-ID (22.1 mN−1 m−1) apparently possessed surface tension similar to that of BT-OT-ID (20.3 mN−1 m−1), which is not surprising considering their quite similar structures. Consequently, the interfacial tension between the two isomers was 0.89 mN−1 m−1, which is much smaller than that of BT-TO-ID/PC71BM (2.02 mN−1 m−1) and BT-OT-ID/PC71BM (5.15 mN−1 m−1). The similar surface energy and the low interfacial tension between the two isomers indicated the formation of an almost inseparable organic phase and ultimately an efficient alloy donor in ternary solar cells (Fig. 5d), which could explain the almost perfect linear relationship between Voc and composition. In addition, the BT-OT-ID/PC71BM system exhibited higher interfacial tension than the BT-TO-ID/PC71BM system, which could further explain its much larger domain sizes observed in TEM and the stronger molecular packing in the blends.

Thermal stability of the optimized ternary and reference binary devices were tested under 65 °C (for the actual operating temperature for solar panels is evaluated at 50 to 70 °C) over 80 hours at nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S8, ESI,†). Out of our expectation, the ternary device exhibited better thermal stability than binary ones. The annealing time of 10% efficiency loss were over 40 hours for ternary devices, which is much better than 20 minutes of BT-TO-ID/PC71BM based device, and better than 10 hours BT-OT-ID/PC71BM based device. The better thermal stability for the ternary blend is probably due to its formation of fine nanostructures we discussed above.38
3. Conclusion
In summary, two novel isomers with different conformational locking positions were designed and synthesized. The two isomers exhibited substantial differences in photoelectric properties and molecular packing ability because of their different molecular planarity and effective conjugated length. The strong interaction between the two isomers enabled them to form an alloy in the corresponding ternary OSCs with PC71BM acceptor, resulting in a face-on molecular packing orientation, a more ideal phase separation in ternary blends, and a linearly tuneable Voc. Remarkable improvements of 76% and 29% in device performance were obtained for the ternary blends compared with BT-OT-ID based and BT-OT-ID based binary devices, respectively, which is among the top-ranked improvement in ternary devices. Hence, our work provided a probable molecular design strategy for constructing an alloy model with distinct molecular properties and morphology to maximize the performance of the ternary OSCs.
