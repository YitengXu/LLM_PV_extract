    , Accepted 21st October 2019First published on 22nd October 2019AbstractQuadruple cation-based perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have crossed the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.2% because of their effective light harvesting ability. The perovskite materials and type of additives play a crucial role in improving the photovoltaic performance and stability. Therefore, here, we demonstrated a simple approach to reduce the grain boundaries and increase the grain size by adding thiourea (TU) as an additive in mixed halide (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, triple cation Cs0.05[(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15]0.95 and quadruple Rb0.05{Cs0.05[(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15]0.95}0.95 cation perovskite absorbers. Our results indicate that the TU-added perovskite thin films have positive effects on the grain size, which improved up to 2.6 μm for the quadruple cation. Final optimization with the quadruple cation containing TU additive-based PVSC exhibited a 20.92% PCE, which is higher than additive-free PVSCs. Furthermore, the stability of the additive-modified PVSCs is much higher than that of bare films due to their ultra-large grain size with reduced grain boundaries. In addition, our thermal stress results exhibited that the additive-based PVSC devices display better thermal stability of more than ∼100 h at 60 °C without encapsulation.
Introduction
Controlling the grain size of perovskite thin films directly affect their photovoltaic properties. Organic–inorganic hybrid, low-cost perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have attracted increasing attention due to their tremendous improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8 to 25.2% within a very short period.1–3 Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites have an ABX3 formula and usually consist of an organic cation, A-site (herein methylammonium (MA); formamidinium (FA), cesium (Cs) and rubidium (Rb)) cation, B-site (Pb2+; Sn2+) metal cation and an anion X (I−, Br− and Cl−).4 The PVSCs are divided into three different types, namely, normal n-i-p, inverted p-i-n and mesostructured triple-layered. However, so far normal type n-i-p PVSCs have demonstrated certified world record efficiency. Therefore, researchers are interested in the normal type due to their high reproducibility and stability. The normal type n-i-p PVSCs consist of an n-type mesoporous TiO2 electron transporting layer (ETL), FA/MA cation-based perovskites and p-type hole transporting layer (HTL) along with top electrode contacts.5 The mixed, triple and quadruple cation perovskite materials have been widely used due to their tunable band gap, high thermal stability and high absorption coefficient.5–7 The stability of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) (band gap (Eg) of 1.58 eV) can be increased by combining methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) (Eg = 2.26 eV).8,9 The comparatively low band gap (1.48 eV) of the formamidinium (FA)-(FAPbI3)-based perovskite with a desired composition such as (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite (Eg = 1.54 eV) stabilized at 100 °C achieved a PCE of 20.8%.9 The iodine management in the (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 mixed perovskite (Eg = 1.51 eV) can exclude the deep-level traps by the non-radiative recombination, enabling higher PCE of 22.1%.10 The vacuum-flash process (VASP) was introduced by Li et al. to obtain smooth and crystalline perovskite thin films. The VASP-processed mixed-cation FA0.81MA0.15PbI2.51Br0.45 perovskite-based device showed a PCE of 20.8%.11 Mali et al. reported 20.98% PCE for triple cation Rb0.05[(FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05]0.95 PVSCs with thermal stability for more than 200 h at 80 °C by developing an SnO2:TiO2 bilayer electron transporting layer (ETL).7 Saliba et al. reported the triple cation Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite, which provides a high quality perovskite film that can yield stable PCE of 21.1% after 250 h under operational conditions.12 The bivalent alkyldiammonium cation ethylenediamine (EDA) in mixed halide has been employed to increase the stability, making triple cation (MA0.7FA0.3)0.97EDA0.015PbI3 as a light absorber layer for PVSCs. This novel triple cation EDA-incorporated (1.5 mol%) PVSC showed a PCE of 20.01%.13 Liu et al. reported a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) molecule process for increasing the quality of perovskites. The DMSO molecule-treated Cs(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite improved the crystal orientation, grain size, carrier lifetime and reduced trap density with a PCE of 21.7%.14 Zhong et al. reported a PCE of 20.17% for a quadruple cation perovskite absorber (KxCs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3) with 1 μm grain size for PVSC.15 Saliba et al. reported [RbCsFAMA (FA:MA = 0.85:0.15)] quadruple cation containing perovskite (Eg = 1.63 eV), incorporating the double/triple/quadruple cations together, with the stability of the perovskite being improved to 21.6% PCE at 85 °C up to 500 h by polymer-coated cells.8 Thus, triple or quadruple cation-based perovskites display higher stability than single/double/triple cation-based perovskites. Therefore, quadruple cation perovskite materials open a new approach towards highly efficient and stable perovskites.
In addition to the above-mentioned processes, numerous alternative attempts have been made to get a defect free perovskite with enhanced grain size, reduced grain boundaries and passivated perovskite surface. These processes can affect the quality of perovskite interfaces, and hence considerably enhance the photovoltaic performance. The quality of a perovskite thin film can be increased by thermal treatment,16 solvent annealing7 or by incorporating additives.18 The incorporation of the additives is considered as a promising method to enhance the photovoltaic performance. Hu et al. reported ascorbic acid (AA) as an additive to stabilize the all-inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite for PVSCs. The ascorbic acid molecules can effectively retard the fast crystallization of CsPbI3 and decrease the size of the coordination colloidal framework by interacting with ions and colloids in the precursors, leading to better thermal/moisture stability. As a result, ascorbic acid-based PVSC devices show a high PCE of 11.44%.19 Nowadays, for the passivation of grain boundaries of perovskites, additives have been suggested;20,21 for example, doping perovskites with polymers,22 fullerenes23 and pyridines.24 The use of these additives reduces the recombination charges at the grain boundaries of the perovskite thin films and considerably increases the grain size with specific functional groups.25 Usually, grain boundaries are terminated with functionalities of either alkylammonium ions or halogens due to the thermal instability of the structure, leading to the creation of under-coordinated Pb–I anti-site defects and lead ion (Pb2+) at the grain boundaries. This system enhances the trap states leading to the charge carrier recombination and accumulation.26 To reduce grain boundaries and to passivate the surface of the MAPbI3 perovskite, the guanidinium thiocyanate-assisted Ostwald ripening post-treatment has been reported by Wang et al. with a PCE of 16.37%.27 Yan et al. reported a PCE of 17.18% for the doping of an lead thiocyanate (Pb(SCN)2) additive and a solvent annealing process to increase the grain size of the mixed-halide perovskite along with avoiding extra lead iodide formation.28 Also, hypophosphorous acid (HPA) (16.2% PCE)29 and methylammonium chloride (MACl) (17.56% PCE)30 have been used by Li et al. and Yu et al. as an additive, respectively. Urea and thiourea (TU) have previously been incorporated in the MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx-based PVSC for inverted p-i-n type-based solar cells with a PCE of 18.8%. Therefore, there is room to develop PVSCs based on improved grain size with reduced grain boundaries.17 The composition comprised of (FAPbI3)0.75(MAPbI3)0.17(MAPbBr3)0.08 perovskite with DMSO/urea additive was used by Meng et al. to enhance the PCE up to 20.06%.31 However, this quaternary system with TU additives is not yet studied.
Therefore, here, we developed TU as an additive for mixed cation (here, (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 named as FAMA) and quadruple cation (herein, Rb0.05{Cs0.05[(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15]0.95}0.95 named as (CsRbFAMA)) perovskite solutions. The additives acted as Lewis base for mixed-halide perovskites and controlled the grain size of the perovskite thin films. With the help of the TU additive and well-developed solvent engineering methods, we achieved a PCE of 20.92% for TU-added quadruple cation PVSCs having 2.6 μm grain size, which is much higher than that of perovskite films without TU.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows the schematic representation of the crystallization of perovskite thin films through intermediate phases. The perovskite solution precursors, such as PbI2, PbBr, FAI, MABr, CsI, RbI and TU, were dissolved in the DMSO/DMF (4:1 v/v) solvent. The perovskite solution having CsRbFAMA composition in DMSO/DMF with or without TU were deposited on FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2 by a solvent quenching technique. The chlorobenzene (CB) antisolvent was dropped on to the FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2/perovskite film to form an intermediate PbX2-DMSO-FAI or PbX2-(DMSO)-DMSO-FAI phase. This intermediate phase with a Lewis acid–base adduct of DMSO have the composition of DMSO-PbI1.7-(FAI)0.85(MABr)0.15.11,32,33 After annealing this intermediate phase at 120 °C for 90 min, the solvent evaporated and the intermediate phase crystallized into a highly crystalline (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite phase. The grain size was tuned by the addition of TU in the precursor solution. It is well known that FAI and PbI2 could easily react during the crystallization of the FAMA and CsRbFAMA perovskite material, resulting in small grain sizes. However, once TU is added in the FAMA and CsRbFAMA precursor solution, the perovskite thin films showed larger gain sizes. The addition of TU in the precursor solution has a vital effect on the nucleation and consequent crystal growth processes. The crystallization of perovskite includes a higher Gibbs free energy, which consequently decreases the nuclei numbers in the presence of TU. Thus, the crystal growth of perovskite will start from limited nuclei centers, resulting in large grain sizes with limited grain boundaries.32,34 The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic analysis was performed in order to trace TU in the perovskite. Fig. 1(b) reveals the FT-IR spectra of perovskite precursors of TU, FAMA:DMSO:DMF, FAMA:DMSO:DMF:TU, CsRbFAMA:DMSO:DMF and CsRbFAMA:DMSO:DMF(4:1):TU perovskite precursors. Fig. 1(c) shows the magnified spectra of the CS vibration. The CO, SO and CS vibrations are observed in FT-IR spectra. The main peak of TU is located at the 730 cm−1 wavenumber, which is attributed to the CS vibration. The CO vibration appears at 1670 cm−1, and the SO vibration appears at 1015 cm−1. The CO vibration represents the coordination ability of DMF towards PbI2.35 Moreover, the SO vibration shifted to 1015 cm−1 when the perovskite was mixed in DMSO.36 These CO and SO vibrations have been used to explain the coordination ability of DMF and DMSO towards the PbI2 species.33 There is no CS vibration observed for without TU-added FAMA:DMSO:DMF and CsRbFAMA:DMSO:DMF perovskite precursors. The original CS vibration of TU located at 730 cm−1 shifted towards 705 cm−1 for the FAMA:DMSO:DMF:TU and CsRbFAMA:DMSO:DMF(4:1):TU perovskite precursors.31 Noticeably, these CO, SO and CS vibrations show that there is coordination between the Lewis bases and perovskite.33,37 Thus, thiourea was confirmed to be involved in the CsRbFAMA:DMSO:DMF:TU perovskite formation process.

After the annealing of this intermediate phase at 120 °C for 90 min, the solvent evaporated and intermediate phase crystallized into a highly crystalline (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite phase,32 as shown in Fig. 2(a). Fig. 2(b) shows the crystal structure of TU. The surface morphology of the annealed perovskite thin films was analyzed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The influence of TU additives on the formation of perovskite thin films has been shown in Fig. 2(c). The SEM image of quadruple cation CsRbFAMA + TU revealed the uniformity of the deposited perovskite thin film with a grain size of 2.6 μm. After the perovskite thin film deposition, we annealed these thin films at 120 °C for 90 min and used for HTM deposition. Poly (triaryl amine) (PTAA)-based HTM was prepared as per the previous reports and was subsequently deposited on a dark brown perovskite thin film at 3000 rpm. The perovskite device was completed by depositing 80 nm gold contacts by thermal evaporation. Fig. 2(d) shows the regular type n-i-p device cross section SEM image of the whole device, which consists of compact TiO2 (c-TiO2)/mp-TiO2 (180 nm), a perovskite capping layer (650 nm), PTAA (75 nm) as a HTM and 80 nm of Au contacts. The vertical growth of highly crystalline perovskite with the large grain growth is revealed from the cross sectional SEM image. It is also noted that the interfaces and uniformity of each layer are highly smooth, which is beneficial for the smooth charge transportation. Further, we analyzed current–voltage (J–V) measurements, as shown in Fig. 2(e). The perovskite device showed a PCE of 20.92% with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.110 V, current density (JSC) of 24.48 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 0.77. In order to validate the J–V measurements, we recorded the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the champion device. The EQE spectrum revealed >80% EQE values in the 500–750 nm region, as shown in Fig. 2(f). The calculated integrated current density (JSC int) for the champion cell having CsRbFAMA + TU perovskite-based PVSC is 24.20 mA cm−2. This higher JSC value is ascribed to a wide-ranging EQE plateau of 82% in the 400–750 nm wavelength range and broad light absorption up to a longer wavelength of 840 nm. The JSC value of 24.20 mA cm−2 was obtained from integrating the EQE spectrum and found to be in good agreement with that measured from the J–V curve.

In order to understand this enhancement, we obtained the surface morphology, XRD spectra and UV-Vis spectra of with and without TU additive-added perovskite thin films. Initially, we obtained the surface morphology of the FAMA, FAMA + TU, CsRbFAMA and CsRbFAMA + TU perovskite thin films on FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2. Fig. 3(a–d) shows the top view SEM and AFM images of the FAMA and CsRbFAMA perovskite thin films with and without the addition of TU. Fig. 3(a) shows the SEM image of the bare FAMA perovskite film revealing a dense structure with nearly 1 μm grain size, indicating that the solvent engineering method is well-optimized. Moreover, the film roughness root mean square (RMS) and topographical images of the corresponding thin films were checked using atomic force microscopy (AFM), which shows the 25.93 nm RMS roughness for a bare FAMA film. Therefore, we have added 0.5 M TU in the perovskite precursor solution, and perovskite thin film has been deposited as per the above protocol. Interestingly, once we added a small amount of TU (0.5 M) in the mixed cation perovskite precursor solution, the grain size increased up to 2 μm. This positive result indicates the role of TU additives in the perovskite film formation. Furthermore, the grain boundaries also reduced substantially (Fig. 3(b)). When TU was added in the FAMA perovskite composition, the RMS roughness value decreased up to 18.30 nm. This broadening in grain size is precisely clear and noteworthy. For the triple cation, the grain size increased by 1.3 μm. In the case of the triple cation with TU (herein CsFAMA + TU), the grain size increased up to 2.2 μm (Fig. S1†). For the quadruple cation CsRbFAMA perovskite thin film, a grain size of ∼1.7 μm is observed (Fig. 3(c)). The incorporation of the Cs and Rb cations accelerates the nucleation of the perovskite to yield more nuclei and therefore smaller crystals.38 However, the grain size increased dramatically and the RMS roughness of CsRbFAMA perovskite material slightly decreased (22.79 nm). When we used the TU additives in the quadruple cation perovskite, nearly 2.6 μm grain size with uniform and highly compact thin films (Fig. 3(d)) were obtained. Interestingly, in the case of the CsRbFAMA + TU film, the RMS values come around 15.29 nm after TU incorporation. From the above discussion, it is clear that the TU plays a key role in improving the grain size of the perovskite thin films. The surface grain size measured by AFM is consistent with that of the SEM images.

Scale for AFM image is 5μm × 5 μm. 
The structural analysis was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The characteristic perovskite peak of all composition appears at 14.1°. The pure FAMA perovskite shows diffraction peaks at 14.1°, 19.94°, 28.40° and 31.75° corresponding to the (111), (120)/(012), (222) and (312) crystal planes of tetragonal phase.32,39 The intensity of the dominant perovskite (110) peak was compared. Interestingly, we observed the dominant reflection peak angle at 14.2° preferred (111) plane, which is highly crystalline for quadruple cation CsRbFAMA + TU based perovskite thin film. Similarly, the comparative intensity ration of the (111) plane of CsRbFAMA + TU perovskite is much higher than that of FAMA, FAMA + TU and CsRbFAMA-based perovskite thin films. This indicates that the TU additives can remarkably increase the crystallinity of CsRbFAMA and vertical growth of the perovskite grains. Consequently, the CsRbFAMA perovskite was observed to have highly crystalline, dense and compact structure with large grain size due to the retarding reaction by the TU additives. Fig. S2† shows the XRD patterns of perovskite films with different concentrations of TU. The several weak peaks and two noteworthy peaks of TU-added CsRbFAMA perovskite films were observed at 14.2° and 28.4° corresponding to the (110) and (220) planes, indicating that there was no damage to the crystal structure and no change in any shift.40 The intensity of the (110) peak was enhanced by adding TU into the perovskite precursors. According to the result of the XRD patterns (Fig. S2†), there is no shift in the diffraction peak position of the perovskite with different concentrations of TU. Fig. S3† reveals that TU exists mainly at the surface or grain boundaries instead of being inserted into the crystal structure.41Fig. 4(b) shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite thin films obtained from without and with 0.5 M thiourea additive-based FAMA and CsRbFAMA perovskite films deposited on the FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2 substrate. From the UV-Vis absorption spectra, it is clear that the absorption values for thiourea-modulated thin films are substantially improved in the visible region. This higher absorption stems from the improved film quality of the perovskite thin film after the addition of thiourea. We have also observed a similar type of improvement in the quadruple perovskite film. However, the band-absorption for both type of films were unchanged, indicating the structural intactness. Fig. S4† reveals the perovskite layer thickness for FAMA (450 nm), FAMA + TU (550 nm), CsRbFAMA (600 nm) and CsRbFAMA + TU (650 nm) perovskite thin films. Increase in the perovskite layer thickness up to 700 nm was observed for the CsRbFAMA + TU sample, which is higher than other perovskite thin films and the similar trend is also observed in the device performance. This will facilitate the enhanced light harvesting and scattering ability within the perovskite grains.42 Therefore, we observed highest PCE for TU-added PVSCs. All with or without TU-added perovskite films revealed the characteristic band edge at around 775 nm. Fig. 4(c and d) show the photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements of FAMA, FAMA + TU, CsRbFAMA and CsRbFAMA + TU perovskites. As can be seen in Fig. 4(c), the PL intensity is higher for the TU added quadruple cation CsRbFAMA perovskite than that for other TU added or not added, mixed and quadruple cation perovskite materials. All perovskite materials display an emission peak at 775 nm. The information gained from PL results indicates that a higher effective lifetime is developed by the TU-added quadruple perovskite compared to the other perovskite films. To investigate the recombination behavior of photo-excited charge carriers within the perovskites, TRPL measurements were recorded, as shown in Fig. 4(d). The TU-added quadruple cation perovskite reveals a much longer lifetime than that of the mixed cation perovskite. The tri-exponential function was well-fitted with TRPL decay profile data, which reveals the lifetime decay. The detailed parameters of TRPL are given in Table 1. The FAMA, FAMA + TU and CsRbFAMA, CsRbFAMA + TU perovskites have a fast decay lifetime of 19, 89, 131 and 172 ns (τ1), respectively, while the slow decay lifetimes of the respective electrodes are 83, 21, 22 and 37 ns (τ2) and 5.1, 4.7, 1.9 and 2.3 ns (τ3). The longer lifetime of the quadruple cation CsRbFAMA perovskite thin film is due to the high uniformity, large grains and reduced density of grain boundaries that can act as trap centers. The large grain size displays the higher PL intensity, which is observed in our steady-state PL measurements. However, quadruple incorporation results in much stable perovskites with higher grain sizes. It is also well known that Cs and/or Rb will make higher lifetime with enhanced PL intensity.15 Very similar results have been observed in our case. Besides, the thiourea addition makes an ultra large grain size, which is also reflected in our PL/TRPL analysis. From TRPL results, we conclude that the recombination centers in CsRbFAMA + TU perovskite thin film is minimum compared to that of the other perovskite thin films.

All devices were illuminated under 1.5 AM (100 mW cm−2) illumination for their photovoltaic analysis. The perovskite device based on the (FAMA) perovskite exhibited a PCE of 17.68 ± 0.02% with VOC of 1.10 ± 0.04 V, JSC of 22.65 ± 0.03 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.71 ± 1.02. When the TU additive was added to the FAMA perovskite material, increased PCE of 18.26 ± 0.04%, VOC of 1.08 ± 0.01 V, JSC of 23.49 ± 0.02 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.72 ± 0.08 were obtained. Moreover, as expected, the triple cation Cs/FA/MA perovskite-based PVSC exhibited 18.86 ± 0.05% PCE, as shown in Fig. S5.† The TU-added CsFAMA perovskite-based device showed an increment in photovoltaic performance with 19.33 ± 0.03% PCE and VOC of 1.10 ± 0.02 V, JSC of 23.75 ± 0.01 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.74 ± 0.06 as given in Table S1.† Further, we fabricated CsRbFAMA perovskite-based PVSC, which revealed an increment in all J–V parameters (PCE of 19.61 ± 0.01%, VOC of 1.10 ± 0.03 V, JSC of 24.10 ± 0.02 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.74 ± 0.05), as shown in Fig. 5(a). Interestingly, TU-added CsRbFAMA perovskite-based PVSC revealed the highest photovoltaic performance than without TU-added quadruple perovskite-based PVSC (Table 2). Our champion device exhibited a VOC of 1.11 ± 0.01 V, JSC of 24.48 ± 0.01 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.77 ± 0.02, yielding a PCE of 20.92 ± 0.02%. The FAMA + TU based film showed a larger grain size, increased absorption and enhanced PCE than bare FAMA-based PVSCs. For the quadruple cation CsRbFAMA perovskite thin film, small grain size has been observed. The incorporation of Cs cation accelerates the nucleation of the perovskite to yield more nuclei and usually decreases the grain size of the perovskite film. Also, the Cs ions incorporation intensely increases the density of the crystal nuclei in the film formation process, which leads to a noteworthy decrease in the grain size of the perovskite.43 However, the Cs and/or Rb cation incorporation in mixed perovskites can effectively decrease the recombination within the PVSCs and thus noticeably increase the PCE.8,33 Therefore, the CsRbFAMA-based film showed a small grain size with higher PCE for PVSC than FAMA + TU. When TU was added in the CsRbFAMA perovskite, the PCE of PVSC increased due to the advantages of increased grain size and enhanced absorption than the bare CsRbFAMA-based PVSC. From Fig. S4† and Fig. 4(b), it is observed that as the perovskite layer thickness increases, the absorption edge also increases. Therefore, TU additive-based PVSCs exhibited the highest efficiency. Zhou et al. reported 20.02% PCE with a 650 nm thickness for the layer.44 However, Chen et al. reported 19.54% PCE for 700 nm perovskite thickness.45 The perovskite layer thickness (650) was optimized for the CsRbFAMA + TU film and therefore, PCE of the PVSC was obtained to be higher than the other films.

To check the reproducibility of the developed method, 25 devices of each process were monitored and the PCE for all four types of the devices are summarized in Fig. 5(b). Interestingly, we conclude that the quadruple cation-based perovskite, such as CsRbFAMA and CsRbFAMA + TU, exhibited much higher reproducibility than other devices. These results demonstrate that the reproducibility of the TU additive-added CsRbFAMA perovskite is quite high. Fig. 5(c) shows the steady state short current density JSC recorded from the J–V analysis and it is obtained to be around 0.85 V (voltage maximum power point). After the illumination of the device at 100 mW cm−2, a drastic increment in the current density has been observed within few seconds, which reached up to 24 mA cm−2. Further, this current was steady up to 400 seconds. The CsRbFAMA and CsRbFAMA + TU devices exhibited 24.00 mA cm−2 and 24.30 mA cm−2JSC corresponding to the stabilized PCE of 19.55% and 20.10%, respectively, from the steady state current output of the device. To check for long-term stability, we monitored the air-thermal stability of the PSCs based on the above compositions without encapsulation. Fig. 5(d) shows the normalized PCE as a function of the storage time of the PVSC devices. All devices were stored in atmospheric conditions to check thermal stability for ∼100 h at 65 °C with a measured 35–45% relative humidity (RH) without encapsulation. The J–V measurements were recorded for each 12 h. It is confirmed that the CsRbFAMA + TU based perovskite device maintain >95% initial efficiency even after 96 h. However, the efficiency of the other devices quickly reduced after 60 h storage in air, which maybe due to the degradation of MA cations and small grain size of the PVSC devices.
Conclusions
In summary, thiourea as an additive has been successfully employed in mixed cation FAMA and quadruple cation CsRbFAMA perovskite-based PVSC devices. From the morphological, structural and photovoltaic results, it is observed that the TU plays a key role in improving the quality of perovskite thin films and device performance. The TU-added quadruple cation CsRbFAMA perovskite showed large grain size (2.6 μm) and PCE of PVSC device than other perovskite thin films. This is the first demonstration of TU-added quadruple cation CsRbFAMA perovskite that has the highest PCE than the FAMA. Addition of TU could reduce grain boundaries and increase grain size along with the crystallinity of the perovskite film. This is beneficial in increasing the effective lifetime and therefore a high PCE can be achieved for the PVSCs. Our champion device with CsRbFAMA + TU composition was processed by the solvent engineering method and exhibit the highest PCE of 20.92%. Remarkably, CsRbFAMA + TU based PSC device displayed an exceptionally high thermal stability for ∼100 hours at 65 °C than the other devices and retained >95% of its initial performance efficiency. Our results reveal that there is much scope in improving the efficiency of quadruple cation CsRbFAMA perovskite and all-inorganic PVSC devices.46
