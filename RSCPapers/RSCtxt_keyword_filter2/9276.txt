    , Accepted 22nd October 2018First published on 23rd October 2018AbstractPhenol is introduced as a solvent additive in the perovskite precursor solution. In a wide concentration range between 5 and 75 mg ml−1, it can improve the quality of active layers by decreasing the concentration of defect states, leading to a 20% enhancement in perovskite solar cell performance. O–Pb coordination and complete removal of the additive contribute to the high quality of the perovskite film.
Owing to its excellent optoelectronic properties and simple processing techniques, organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite has become one of the most attractive absorber materials in the field of photovoltaics. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has increased drastically from less than 4% in 2009 to over 23% in 2018.1,2 The quality of a perovskite film is vital to device performance, so a number of deposition methods have been developed to achieve a dense and flat film morphology, such as vacuum evaporation deposition,3,4 a vapor-assisted solution process,5,6 a one-step method,7,8 two-step sequential deposition,9,10etc. Among these methods, the one-step method is very attractive due to its simplicity that industry has highly sought for.
Film quality control in a one-step method can be difficult because the kinetics of crystal growth is easily influenced by many factors, e.g. molar ratio of reactants, reactant purity, processing solvent, drying conditions, annealing temperature, etc. To solve such a problem, considerable efforts have been made to develop processing techniques for better film quality, including additive engineering,11–31 interface engineering32–34 and post-solvent annealing.35–37 Among them, additive engineering is the simplest and easiest technique. Fullerene derivatives,11–13 metal halide salts,14–16 inorganic acids,17,18 organic halide salts,19–21 and nanoparticles22,23 have been reported as additives in perovskite films. Besides, several works demonstrated that interactions between organic solvents and components of the perovskite can be utilized to control the crystallinity of the perovskite film.24–28 Su et al. and Zhao et al. reported poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as an additive in the perovskite precursor solution. Long chains of the PEG molecule and strong hydrogen bonding between O atoms in PEG and H atoms in CH3NH3+ contribute to a desirable morphology and an excellent device stability.24,25 Furthermore, halogen atoms in some solvent additives like 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) can coordinate with Pb2+ during crystal growth, changing the kinetics of crystal growth.26,27 Atoms possessing lone pairs of electrons (e.g. N and S atoms) can interact strongly with Pb2+, which in turn alters the crystallization kinetics of the perovskite film.28 However, most of the improved PSC devices are obtained at a precisely small amount of additive, which is inconvenient for industrial manufacturing.
In this work, we introduce phenol, a simple organic compound that is widely available, as an effective additive for perovskites. The choice of phenol is twofold: first, the O atom in phenol can coordinate with Pb2+ in PbI2,38,39 which was found to promote the crystallinity and morphology of the perovskite layer, thus effectively decreasing the density of defect states; second, the boiling point of phenol is 182 °C, which is similar to that of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) whose boiling point is 189 °C and lower than that of γ-butyrolactone (GBL) with a boiling point of 204 °C. Thus, phenol can be removed together with the processing solvents from the perovskite film after the vacuum and thermal annealing treatment, leading to negligible residues in the perovskite layer, which ensures high purity of the perovskite film.

Fig. 1 shows the device architecture and the current density–voltage (J–V) curves for PSCs with or without a phenol additive. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) are employed as hole transport layer (HTL) and electron transport layer (ETL), respectively. A bipolar layer containing rhodamine 101 and LiF is introduced between the ETL and the cathode to facilitate efficient electron extraction from the active layer.32 For the control samples without a phenol additive, the highest PCE reaches 14.2% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.96 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.2 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 73.1%. In comparison, devices fabricated with phenol as an additive in the precursor solution exhibit an obvious performance improvement, achieving a PCE of 17.0% with enhanced Voc (1.04 V), Jsc (20.9 mA cm−2) and FF (77.9%). Both control samples and modified devices show negligible hysteresis.

Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra for devices with or without a phenol additive are depicted in Fig. S2 (ESI†); the device with a phenol additive exhibited a slightly higher IPCE value than its control counterpart in the range of 400 nm to 700 nm, which illustrates that the introduction of phenol facilitated the separation and transport of charge carriers. To evaluate device stability, control and phenol-based devices were stored in an ambient environment (45 ± 5 RH%, 30 ± 2 °C) without encapsulation. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), phenol-based devices exhibited similar stability with control samples upon 150 hours of exposure to air.
Statistical values based on devices with different doping concentrations are presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†) and Table 1. At a low doping concentration of 5 mg ml−1, device performance shows a slight improvement. Further increasing the phenol concentration leads to an obvious performance enhancement. When the doping concentration reaches 50 mg ml−1, a champion efficiency of 17.0% is achieved. With a further increase of the doping concentration to 75 mg ml−1, phenol cannot be fully dissolved, so the photovoltaic performance drops. It is worth noting that the average PCE of control samples is 13.2%, while an average PCE over 15.3% is observed for a wide additive concentration range from 20 to 50 mg ml−1. This places a less stringent requirement on the preparation of the precursor solution.

To explore the underlying mechanism, perovskite film morphologies with or without a phenol additive are recorded via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As presented in Fig. 2, the PEDOT:PSS layer is completely covered by perovskite crystalline grains without an obvious pinhole under both conditions. Some rod-like bright particles are observed at the grain boundaries; they are ascribed to excessive PbI2 for interface passivation.5 Comparing the distribution of the grain size for perovskite films without (Fig. 2c) or with phenol (Fig. 2d), it is noticeable that the average size of perovskite crystals is enlarged after phenol doping. In general, grain boundaries can act as recombination centers if passivation is incomplete.5 The increase of average crystal grain size suggests a reduction of overall area of grain boundaries and the number of recombination centers, which contribute to the improvement of Voc and the FF.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement is conducted to analyze the role of phenol in perovskite crystallization. As shown in Fig. 3a, both reference and doped films exhibit distinct peaks at 14.1°, 28.5°, and 31.9° that are ascribed to (110), (220) and (310) crystal planes of the typical MAPbIxCl3−x phase, respectively. In addition, a conspicuous diffraction peak at 12.6° that is assigned to the (001) face of PbI2 is also observed.32,40 The excess PbI2 was reported to play a role in defect passivation at grain boundaries.5 The expanded (110) peaks are illustrated in Fig. 3b, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (110) peak for the perovskite film with or without phenol doping is 0.17 and 0.14 degree, respectively. These results imply that the doped film has a bigger crystalline grain size than the control sample, which is in good agreement with the SEM images. Unchanged peak positions and sharper diffraction peaks together suggest that phenol does not change the crystal structure of the perovskite but facilitates high quality crystal formation, which is important for charge carrier transport in the active layer.

The additive influence on the optical properties of the MAPbIxCl3−x films is investigated via UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy. As depicted in Fig. 4a, on one hand, both spectra exhibit an absorption band edge at about 780 nm, which is consistent with the optical bandgap of MAPbIxCl3−x (∼ 1.6 eV).41 The comparable optical bandgap implies that the discrepancy of the Voc values between control devices and doped devices is more related to charge recombination.42 On the other hand, in the range of 300 to 800 nm, pristine and doped films display almost the same absorption spectra, which illustrates that the increase of Jsc does not arise from absorption enhancement.
 Fig. 4  (a) UV-vis absorption spectra, (b) steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra and (c) time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay curves of perovskite films with or without phenol doping. 
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) are employed to evaluate the defect state in the active layer. As depicted in Fig. 4b, both films exhibit prominent peaks positioned at 765 nm, while the phenol-doped film holds a relatively stronger PL intensity as compared to the un-doped counterpart. Moreover, as illustrated in Fig. 4c, the phenol addition leads to a longer PL lifetime in the TRPL measurement. The steady-state and transient PL results together suggest that the defect-induced non-radiative recombination is suppressed and the charge carrier lifetime is enhanced due to phenol-induced reduction of defect states.43,44 The decrease of defect concentration is beneficial to Voc, Jsc and the FF.
To understand the underlying mechanism at the molecular level, liquid-state 1H NMR measurements are performed to record the changes in resonance signals before and after the addition of phenol into deuterated DMSO-d6 solution of PbI2. Fig. 5 shows the amplified 1H NMR spectra of neat phenol as well as mixtures of phenol and PbI2 with different mixing ratios. The proton signal at δ ≈ 9.30 ppm is assigned to –OH, and peaks at δ ≈ 7.15 ppm and δ ≈ 6.75 ppm are assigned to –H of the benzene ring. As depicted in Fig. 5, except for the solvent signals located at δ ≈ 2.50 ppm, all resonance signals in phenol–PbI2 samples present a slight chemical shift as compared to neat phenol. Besides, UV-Vis and XRD measurements were conducted to investigate the interaction between phenol and PbI2. UV-Vis spectra for PbI2, PbI2–phenol, and phenol dissolved in a mixture solution of DMSO and GBL are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). After the introduction of phenol to PbI2, the absorption peak shifted from 288 nm to 283 nm, indicating the formation of the PbI2–phenol complex. Furthermore, as depicted in Fig. S5 (ESI†), new diffraction peaks at 9.1°, 18.1°, 27.2° and 9.6°, 19.2°, 28.6° were observed in the PbI2–phenol sample as compared to PbI2, which can be a further evidence of this complex.45 Previous works reported the possibility of interaction between Pb and oxygen due to the formation of Pb–O coordination bonds.38,39 So we propose that the coordination between the O atom in phenol and Pb in PbI2 exists when phenol is introduced in the perovskite precursor solution. Such a molecular interaction contributes to the crystal growing process, resulting in an increased size of perovskite grains.38

1H NMR spectra of pristine phenol as well as the mixture of phenol and PbI2 in deuterated DMSO-d6. The –OH signal of phenol shifts from 9.30 to 9.27 indicating the interaction of the –OH group with PbI2 in solution. 
Apart from 1H NMR spectra, we also performed Liquid Chromatography using a Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS) to probe whether phenol is presented in the perovskite film after a thermal annealing process. LC-MS running in a negative ionization mode was recorded in Fig. S6 (ESI†), an obvious deprotonated molecule signal peak is found in the phenol sample at 93 m/z, which is ascribed to phenol with a relative molecular mass of 94. As for the perovskite-phenol sample, a prominent signal observed at 127 m/z is attributed to I−. Most importantly, the phenol peak at 93 m/z is missing in the phenol-perovskite sample, implying that there is no phenol molecule in the perovskite films. This conclusion is further supported by the NMR result, as no phenol signal is observed in 1H NMR spectra of the doped perovskite film (Fig. S7, ESI†).
Based on the characterizations mentioned above, we propose a schematic diagram as shown in Fig. 6. After adding phenol into the perovskite precursor solution, it can coordinate with PbI2. This interaction retards the kinetics of crystal growth of the perovskite, leading to high crystallinity and a bigger average grain size of the perovskite. Upon vacuum and thermal annealing treatments, phenol with a slightly lower boiling point than that of the processing solvents can be removed completely from the perovskite film, facilitating higher purity of the perovskite crystals.

In summary, we introduce phenol, a common and low-cost material in the chemical industry, as an additive in the perovskite precursor solution. It is demonstrated that incorporation of phenol in perovskite solution is a facile and effective method to facilitate crystal growth of the perovskite. Due to the inter-molecular coordination between the O atom in phenol and Pb2+ in PbI2, the addition of phenol leads to larger average grain sizes, less grain boundaries, and decreased concentration of trap states. Meanwhile, phenol has a slightly lower boiling point than the processing solvents, i.e. DMSO and GBL. LC-MS and NMR results indicate that the additive can be removed completely from the perovskite films after vacuum and thermal annealing, thus resulting in high purity of the perovskite. Consequently, at the optimal doping concentration of 50 mg ml−1, the device with the additive achieves a champion PCE of 17.0%, compared favourably with the control sample of 14.2%. The Voc, Jsc and FF are all improved due to less non-radiative recombination. Noticeably, the additive is effective in a wide concentration range between 5 and 75 mg ml−1. Therefore, the method is ideal for industrial processing that places less stringent requirements on concentrations. Together the results suggest that this work provides an industrial compatible method to promote device performance by enhancing crystal growth of the perovskite and suppressing the formation of defect states.
