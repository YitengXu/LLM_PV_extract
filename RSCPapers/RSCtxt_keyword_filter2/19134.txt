    , Accepted 7th October 2014First published on 7th October 2014AbstractAll-polymer and polymer/fullerene inverted solar cells were fabricated by spin-coating and roll-coating processes. The spin-coated small-area (0.04 cm2) devices were fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates in nitrogen. The roll-coated large-area (1.0 cm2) devices were prepared on ITO-free flexible substrates under ambient conditions. The use of a solvent additive, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), facilitated phase separation and enhanced power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). The PCE of polymer/fullerene solar cells increased from 4.58% to 8.12% with 2.5% (v/v) DIO when using the spin-coating process, and increased from 1.37% to 2.09% with 5% (v/v) DIO in the roll-coating process. The PCE of all-polymer solar cells increased from 1.44% to 3.51% with 4% (v/v) DIO when employing the spin-coating process. For the roll-coated large area devices the PCE increased from 0.15% to 0.73% with 9% (v/v) DIO. The optimal amounts of DIO, when using the roll-coating process for the two different active layers (5% and 9% respectively) are significantly higher than those for the spin-coating process (2.5% and 4%, respectively), which is ascribed to a fundamentally different drying mechanism.
Introduction
In the past two decades, solar cells have attracted considerable attention to overcome traditional energy depletion and environmental pollution. Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) which present numerous advantages, such as simple preparation, low cost, light weight and large area flexible fabrication, have been the focus of research in both the academic community and industry.1–9 To date, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.5% has been achieved.10
Roll-to-roll (R2R) coating and printing11–15 is an ideal and promising way for industrial mass production of OSCs because of high speed, ambient conditions, no vacuum, large area, flexibility and the possibility of preparing indium tin oxide (ITO)-free OSCs. One of the main challenges for R2R fabricated OSCs is the lack of conformity between the PCE obtained for small area spin-coated (SC) and large area R2R coated (RC) devices under similar optimized conditions and is directly related to the different fabrication techniques. Thus the development of a small roll coater16 enabling the preparation of devices using the same methods as R2R coated devices has been of great importance.
Morphology control of the active layer17–27 is of crucial importance for OSCs since it affects the dissociation of excitons at donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces, transport and recombination of charge carriers and their extraction at the electrodes.28 In recent years, researchers have developed a number of methods to control the morphology of the active layer, among which, the use of solvent additives has been demonstrated to be the most effective and widely used method29–37 resulting in PCEs above 8% for single junction OSCs.34,36,38–44 Solvent additives can purify domain composition,45,46 control the size of nanoscale phase separation,47,48 reduce non-geminate and geminate recombination of charge carriers,49 and enhance crystallinity of donor or acceptor materials.50,51 Solvent additives were also employed in R2R fabricated OSCs to control the active layer morphology.52–54
The optimal content of solvent additives used in OSCs varies between small area SC and large area RC devices due to differences in fabrication. During SC, a portion of solution is dropped onto the substrate followed by solvent evaporation, while the RC technique is governed only by solvent evaporation. The morphology of the deposited thin films depends on solvent evaporation55 which occurs within the initial seconds post deposition of the ink. Therefore, the solvent additives usually play a significant role in this step. Due to different volatilities of solvent and solvent additives, it is not possible to ensure that the dynamic composition of the solution during the SC deposition process is the same since the real contents of solvent additives are hard to measure or calculate. However, the drying dynamics (drying rate and drying process) of SC and RC methods are different. Therefore, we cannot assume that the optimum contents of solvent additive used for small area SC and large area RC devices are equivalent.
In this paper, we are focusing on two different types of OSCs: polymer/fullerene and all-polymer22,24,56–65 to investigate the optimum content of solvent additive (1,8-diiodooctane, DIO) which results in the highest PCE for small area (0.04 cm2) SC and large area (1.0 cm2) RC inverted solar cells, using PBDTTT-C-T35 as a polymer donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric-acid-methyl-ester (PC71BM) or PPDIDTT56 as acceptors (Fig. 1).

Experimental section
Materials
Unless stated otherwise, solvents and chemicals were obtained commercially and used without further purification. PBDTTT-C-T35 and PC71BM (purity > 99.0%) were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. and American Dye Inc., respectively. PPDIDTT56 and PDI-2DTT (non-volatile additive) were synthesized according to our previous reports.24,66 DIO and o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) were obtained from J & K Chemical Inc.
For RC solar cells, the poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET) substrate Melinex ST506 was obtained from Dupont–Teijin. The PET/Ag substrates were prepared according to the literature procedures.67,68 The metal grid had a slanted comb pattern. Two types of highly conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) were employed, i.e. Clevios PH1000 from Heraeus was used at the bottom Ag diluted with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in a ratio of 10:3 (w/w), and Orgacon EL-P5010 was used as top PEDOT:PSS diluted with IPA in a ratio of 2:1 (w/w). Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles in acetone with a concentration of 55 mg mL−1 were employed for the electron transport layer. The Ag electrodes were printed using a flexographic printing silver paste (bottom: PFI-722 from PChem Associates, top: 5025 from Dupont). The front PEDOT:PSS electrode had a sheet resistivity of 60–90 Ω □−1, and the substrate with metal grid had a sheet resistivity of 10 Ω □−1. The sheet resistivity of the back PEDOT:PSS electrode was 60 Ω □−1 on its own and the sheet resistivity of the top silver electrode was 0.1 Ω □−1. The PET substrate with Ag grid, PEDOT:PSS layer and ZnO layer has the maximum transmittance of 74.8% at 436 nm, and the transmittance at 550 nm is 70.7%.
For the SC solar cells (fabricated at Peking University), the patterned ITO glass has a sheet resistance of 15 Ω □−1. ZnO thin films coated on top of the ITO glass substrate were obtained from solution by the sol–gel method. Zinc acetate dihydrate [Zn(CH3COO)·2H2O] (Aldrich, 99.9%) with 0.5 M concentration was first dissolved in anhydrous ethanol (99.5+%, Aldrich) and then ethanolamine was added to the solution as sol-stabilizer followed by a thorough mixing process with a magnetic stirrer for 12 h.
Fabrication and characterization of RC solar cells
RC solar cells were fabricated (at DTU) with the structure: PET/Ag/PEDOT:PSS PH1000/ZnO/PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT or PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM/PEDOT:PSS EL-P5010/Ag. The substrate consisted of a PET foil, silver finger grids, conductive layer and electron transport layer. The Ag finger grids (bottom and top layers) were printed using flexographic printing by a patterned rubber roller whereas all other layers were fabricated by slot-die coating on a lab-scale mini roll-coater.67 The ink, comprising a blend of PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT (1:1, with 2% non-volatile additive PDI-2DTT) or PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM (1:1.5) with a concentration of 24 mg mL−1 in total in DCB solvent with or without solvent additive DIO, was transferred from an external container via a pump to the slot-die head, and roll-coated on four stripes on the flexible PET substrate, pre-coated with ZnO and high conductive PEDOT:PSS PH1000 cathodic stripes (Fig. 2a). The coating was conducted at 40 °C with a web speed of 0.65 m min−1 affording a wet thickness in the range of 10–14 μm. The back PEDOT:PSS EL-P5010 layer was slot-die coated on the active layer with a further offset of 1 mm (to prevent shorting of the device). The coating was conducted at 70 °C with a web speed of 0.8 m min−1 affording a wet thickness in the range of 150 μm. The ink formulation and coating took place in ambient atmosphere, with the roll kept at 70 °C to facilitate drying of the films. The Ag electrodes were applied by flexographic printing of a heat curing silver paste. The Ag paste was added to the flexographic roll and further transferred to the substrate. The completed solar cells (Fig. 2b) were then divided into ca. 320 individual cells each with an active area of 0.9–1.1 cm2 (measured accurately by light beam induced current, LBIC).69

The solar cells were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter under a KHS 575 solar simulator with an AM 1.5 G 100 mW cm−2 intensity. The EQE spectrum was measured using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QEX10.
The LBIC mapping experiments were carried out using a custom made setup with 405 nm laser diode (5 mW output power, 100 μm spot size ≈65 W cm−2, ThorLabs)69 mounted on a computer controlled XY-stage and focused to a spot size of <100 μm. The short circuit current from the device under study was measured using a custom made computer controlled source measure unit. A custom written computer program was used to scan the solar cell devices in a raster pattern in 100 μm steps in the X and the Y directions, logging the coordinates and current. Current profiles along selected directions were taken from these maps to visualize the relative differences in different regions. The nanoscale morphology of blended films was observed by using a Veeco Nanoscopy V atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode.
Fabrication and characterization of SC solar cells
SC solar cells were fabricated (at Peking University) with the structure: ITO/ZnO/PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT or PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag. The patterned ITO glass was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and isopropanol, and treated in ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Jelight Company, USA) for 23 min. The prepared ZnO sol–gel was spin-coated onto the ITO glass and baked at 200 °C for 60 min. A mixture of PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT (2% non-volatile additive PDI-2DTT) in DCB solvent (1:1, 20 mg mL−1 in total) or a mixture of PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM in DCB solvent (1:1.5, 25 mg mL−1 in total) with or without solvent additive DIO was spin-coated on the ZnO layer to form a photosensitive layer (Fig. 2c). The thicknesses of PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT blend films and PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM blend films were 80 and 110 nm, respectively, as measured by Ambios Technology XP-2 profilometer. A molybdenum oxide (MoO3) (ca. 3 nm) and Ag layer (ca. 50 nm) was then evaporated onto the surface of the photosensitive layer under vacuum (ca. 10−5 Pa) to form the positive electrode (Fig. 2d). The active area of the device was 4 mm2.
The J–V curve was measured using a computer-controlled B2912A Precision Source/Measure Unit (Agilent Technologies). An XES-70S1 (SAN-EI Electric Co., Ltd) solar simulator (AAA grade, 70 × 70 mm2 photobeam size) coupled with AM 1.5 G solar spectrum filters was used as the light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. A 2 × 2 cm2 monocrystalline silicon reference cell (SRC-1000-TC-QZ) was purchased from VLSI Standards Inc. The EQE spectrum was measured using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using a standard single crystal Si photovoltaic cell. The nanoscale morphology of blended films was observed by an atomic force microscope (AFM) (NanoMan vs., Veeco, USA) in contact mode. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization was carried out on JEM-1011. The samples for the TEM measurements were prepared as follows: The active-layer films were spin-casted on ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates, and the ITO glass with the active layers were submerged in deionized water to make the active layers float onto the air-water interface. Then the floated films were picked up on unsupported 200 mesh copper grids for the TEM measurements.

For all-polymer OSC (Tables 1 and 2), the volume ratio of DIO strongly affects open circuit voltage (VOC), short current density (JSC), fill factor (FF) and PCE. Addition of DIO lowers VOC, whereas the JSC, FF and PCE increase first and then decrease with increasing volume ratio of DIO. The all-polymer solar cells exhibit the best performance with a 4% volume ratio of DIO for the SC process: average JSC increases from 4.413 to 8.470 mA cm−2, average FF increases from 40.56% to 52.28%, and average PCE increases from 1.382% to 3.297%. The best DIO content for RC devices is 9%: average JSC increases from 0.717 to 2.507 mA cm−2, average FF increases from 29.59% to 42.52%, and average PCE increases from 0.142% to 0.673%.

For polymer/fullerene OSC (Tables 3 and 4), the trend of VOC, JSC, FF and PCE is similar to that of all-polymer OSC after the use of different volume ratios of DIO. The polymer/fullerene solar cells exhibit the best performance with 2.5% DIO volume ratio in case of SC process: average JSC increases from 10.13 to 16.55 mA cm−2, average FF increases from 54.87% to 63.25%, and average PCE increases from 4.338% to 7.865%. The best DIO content for RC devices is 5%: average JSC increases from 5.474 to 7.026 mA cm−2, average FF increases from 34.84% to 43.59%, and average PCE increases from 1.314% to 1.927%.

As shown in Fig. 3b and 4b, the trend of EQE is similar to JSC. To evaluate the accuracy of the photovoltaic results, the JSC values were calculated from integration of the EQE spectra with the AM 1.5 G reference spectrum. The calculated JSC is similar to the J–V measurement (the average error is 1.1%, Tables 1–4).
Effects of DIO content
The PCEs of RC and SC devices with different ratios of DIO additive for all-polymer and polymer/fullerene OSC are shown in Fig. 5a and b. The PCE curves exhibit a similar tendency for all device types and materials: the PCE increases first and then decreases with increasing volume ratio of DIO. The best contents of DIO used in RC devices (9% for all-polymer OSCs, 5% for polymer/fullerene OSCs) are much higher than those used in SC devices (4% for all-polymer OSCs, 2.5% for polymer/fullerene OSCs). These results suggest a possible variation in the solution composition during SC fabrication due to different volatilities of the solvent DCB and DIO. DIO has a higher boiling point (332 °C) than that of DCB (180 °C) and lower volatility. Lower volatility of DIO may be the reason for the higher effective content of DIO in the wet film during SC relative to that in the prepared solution.

Morphology
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) height and phase images of PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT and PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM films using RC and SC methods without or with DIO are shown in Fig. 6. After the use of solvent additive, the blend films exhibit a typical cluster structure with many aggregated domains. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness is 8.40 (Fig. 6c), 8.31 (Fig. 6g), 2.26 (Fig. 6k) and 3.85 (Fig. 6o) nm, respectively, which is much larger than that of the films without DIO (0.727, 0.758, 0.253 and 0.310 nm, respectively, Fig. 6a, e, I and m). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT and PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM films using SC method without or with DIO are shown in Fig. 7. We also tried to measure the TEM images of RC samples, but it is impossible to peel off the active layer from the PET substrate because both the active layer and substrate are polymers. The films of PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT and PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM with DIO showed clearer phase separation, larger domain sizes and more obvious network of donor and acceptor relative to those without DIO. The changes in TEM images of the blend films caused by addition of DIO are consistent with those in the AFM images. Both all-polymer and polymer/fullerene solar cells exhibited much better performance with the use of DIO. For PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM blend, DIO can't dissolve PBDTTT-C-T but can dissolve PC71BM,40,70 leading to larger phase separation of PBDTTT-C-T and PC71BM (Fig. 6l and p). For PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT blend, DIO leads to larger domain sizes of the donor due to enhanced aggregation and crystallization of PBDTTT-C-T.24 The larger scale of phase separation leads to smaller D/A interfacial areas for both blends, which provides reduced recombination interfaces and reduced carrier traps, thereby reducing bimolecular recombination. The more obvious network of both blends can enhance charge transport. Thus, by use of solvent additive DIO, higher JSC, FF, EQE and PCE can be achieved.

Conclusions
All-polymer (PBDTTT-C-T/PPDIDTT) and polymer/fullerene (PBDTTT-C-T/PC71BM) inverted OSC were fabricated by SC and RC processes. The use of solvent additive DIO facilitates efficient phase separation and enhances performance. In the SC processed polymer/fullerene OSC, the PCEs increase from 4.58% to 8.12% with 2.5% (v/v) DIO, while an increase from 1.37% to 2.09% with 5% (v/v) DIO in the RC process is observed. In SC processed all-polymer OSC, the PCEs increase from 1.44% to 3.51% with 4% (v/v) DIO, while an increase from 0.15% to 0.73% with 9% (v/v) DIO in the RC process is observed. The contents of DIO resulting in the highest PCE for RC processed (5% and 9% DIO content) are much higher than those in SC processed (2.5% and 4% DIO content), i.e. twice the amount of solvent additive is used in the RC process compared to the SC process. This demonstrates the importance of the individual optimization approach for small area SC and large area RC processed devices.
