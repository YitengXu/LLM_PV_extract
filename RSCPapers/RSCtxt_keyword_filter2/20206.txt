    , Accepted 18th April 2022First published on 20th April 2022AbstractIn recent years, donor-acceptor based pyridine derivatives have significantly been used in organic solar cells (OSCs), thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and many more. Pyridine derivatives are used as charge carriers i.e. hole transporting materials (HTMs) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to improve the power conversion efficiency and stability of photovoltaic devices due to the enhanced open circuit voltage, film uniformity and improved hydrophobicity which further increase the long term durability. Pyridine derivatives are suitable electron transporting materials (ETMs) used in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) to improve the current efficiency, external quantum efficiency and thermal stability of the optoelectronic devices through high triplet energy to avoid the exciton quenching, low operating voltage, and smooth film formation ability. The frontier energy levels of pyridine based ETMs are controlled by aromatic π-conjugated moieties at the ortho, meta, and para positions of the pyridine unit, which provides deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels to block the holes/excitons and appropriate lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels for smooth electron injection. We have explained the intermolecular and intramolecular interactions in the pyridine derivatives, which facilitate charge injection and enhance the electron transporting mobility of the ETMs used in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). In the review, we provide a better outlook of the recent developments in the design and synthesis of various donor-acceptor based pyridine derivatives as 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) additive free and dopant free hole-transporting materials (HTMs). The pyridine could form a Lewis acid-base adduct in the HTM and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF) interacted with methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), resulting in the MAPbI3/HTM interface becoming more selective for holes in the perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

1. Introduction
The emerging global energy crisis is driving the development of smart energy-efficient display and lighting systems.1–3 Energy-efficient optoelectronic technologies, particularly future energy-saving illumination sources, are considered to be one of the most competitive choices for next-generation smart displays.4–6 Emerging optoelectronic technologies such as perovskite solar cells (PSCs), organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), and phototransistors have received a lot of attention recently because of their promising power conversion efficiencies and ease of fabrication in a variety of colors on arbitrary substrates.7,8 Organic semiconducting materials that transport charge are essential in electronic and optoelectronic devices (such as OLEDs, organic thin-film transistors, and photovoltaic cells). The fabrication of OLED and PSC devices in general demands engineering the mobilities and recombination processes of holes and electrons in an organic solid in such a way that radiative emission is maximized. Extensive research over the last few decades has revealed that organic solids with high electron and hole charge mobilities can be designed and synthesized to further improve the efficiency of OLEDs and PSCs.9–13 Under an applied voltage, the single layer device made of organic materials emits light via electron–hole recombination.14–18 However, due to the imbalance of the charge carriers, these devices suffer from a fundamental disadvantage of differing charge mobilities, in which the hole mobility is significantly larger than the electron mobility, resulting in reduced recombination of holes and electrons.19–23 The device structure of OLEDs and PSCs was improved by adding an electron transporting layer into a multilayer architecture to overcome this problem. Depending on whether an electron-transport layer (ETL) or a hole-transporting layer (HTL) is deposited over the transparent conducting oxide (TCO), PSCs are classified as normal (n–i–p) or inverted (p–i–n) devices.24 The highest PCE of 20.0%97 attained by PSC without HTL is still far lower than for devices with HTL, which indicates that device interface modification is required for effective extraction of holes from the perovskite layer. Proper alignment of HOMO and LUMO energy levels of HTMs with the energy levels of perovskite layer for better hole extraction and transportation through the HTL are important requirement for minimizing potential loss of perovskite device and charge recombination loss. 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (C81H68N4O8) spiro-OMeTAD is the most studied HTM for PSCs to date, with a power conversion efficiency of 25%.25 Unfortunately, spiro-OMeTAD synthesis is time-consuming and low-yielding, and purification needs costly sublimation processes, making it excessively expensive. In its natural state, it has low conductivity and hole mobility, therefore it needs addition of chemical p-dopants such as bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonamide lithium salt (LiTFSI), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), and cobalt(III) complexes to boost conductivity and hole mobility.26–29 However using an ionic salt to boost charge-carrier mobility degrades the perovskite layer due to their low boing temperature and seen as a compromise for device thermal stability. A range of organic small molecules, conducting polymers, organometallic complexes, and inorganic semiconductors have been explored as HTMs for PSCs with remarkable solar characteristics to solve these disadvantages.30–35 In comparison to the development of several high-performance light-emitting materials (LEMs) and hole-transporting materials (HTMs), there are few reports on good electron-transporting materials (ETMs) for use in OLEDs. After three decades of research, in 1987, Tang and VanSlyke reported, the first bright OLEDs using tris(8-hydroxyquiniolato)aluminum(III) (Alq3) as an electron transporting material (ETM).36–40 Despite of its slow electron mobility, it is still commonly used as an ETM due to its relatively good working durability. To improve electron charge balance, ETMs should have good hole blocking and electron transport capability.41–43 Because of Alq3 poor hole-blocking ability, another traditional hole-blocking material is frequently required for use with it to improve electron charge balance.44–46 This would inevitably increase the complexity of device fabrication. There are currently just a few materials that meet these criteria. One such substance is 1,3,5-tris(phenyl-2-benzimidazolyl)benzene (TPBI), which has good electron-transporting and hole-blocking characteristics. Unfortunately, in an amorphous film, TPBI molecules prefer to crystallize, which might cause stability issues.47 Another extensively used ETM with good hole-blocking properties is 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline BPhen (C24H16N2). As a result, a lot of effort has gone into developing ETM with good electron transport and hole blocking capabilities.48
Pyridine is an electron-deficient heterocyclic ring and its derivatives play diverse roles in medicinal as well as material applications. Pyridine derivatives are mainly introduced in medicinal chemistry due to their excellent properties such as small molecular size, better water solubility, and also form hydrogen bond with different receptor. In the recent years, pyridine derivatives are often used in optoelectronic applications due to its strong electron withdrawing properties. The pyridine based derivatives are also used in acid sensors due to presence of lone pair of electron on nitrogen atom.49–51 In 1994 Yamamoto and his colleagues discovered polypyridine (PPy) and polypyridine vinylidene (PPyV) having n-type charge carrier properties.52 These studies prove the importance of pyridine heterocycles in OLEDs. In the past few years, a series of multifunctional pyridine-containing electron transport materials (ETM) have been developed as hole/exciton blocking layers for electron transporting layer (ETL) and phosphorescent OLEDs, thereby simplifying the device structure and improving external quantum efficiency (ηext). In addition, the simultaneous introduction of other heterocycles to produce compounds containing hybrid heterocycles is also an attractive method to adjust the electron and hole transporting properties of pyridine based derivatives via adjusting the highest occupied molecular energy level. Hence it is important to consider pyridine for the design of HTM/ETM. Combining the pyridine unit with continuous-conjugation and using the electron-donating fragment to create prospective HTM/ETM is the most efficient technique for designing ETM/HTM. To improve the stability and efficiency of HTM for use in PSCs, it is also necessary to identify suitable non-hygroscopic dopants. The Lewis acid tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF) is the most effective organic dopant in the HTM design strategy, which intended to improve the performance and stability of PSC devices.53
In this review we have addressed the development of pyridine based charge carriers in PSCs and OLEDs to provide a better clarification on the various limitations (low yielding synthetic processes, requirement of additional dopants, thermal stability and low charge carrier mobility etc.), and delivers a future outlook in the field of charge carriers. We provide an overview of recent advances in the design and development of pyridine based organic small molecules/polymer as HTM/ETM materials. The pyridine based organic small molecules are classified based on their different active positions (ortho, meta and para positions), effect of intermolecular and intramolecular interactions on film formation ability and charge carrier mobility. A relative study of photophysical, electrochemical and thermal properties is described for better understanding the structure–property relationship of the different pyridine derivatives.
2. Applications
2.1. ETM for Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs)
OLED is a double charge injection device that provides both electrons and holes to the electroluminescent (EL) material sandwiched between the cathode and anode at the same time in the device of OLED (Fig. 1). In organic semiconductors the electron mobility is several orders lower in magnitude compared to the hole mobility. To overcome this limitation, electron transport materials (ETM) with high electron mobility and good hole blocking characteristics are needed. To prevent hole leaking from emitting layer while simultaneously promoting electron injection from the cathode to the electron transport layer (ETL). In order to improve the performance of OLED, ETMs should have low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. Despite the instability of Alq3 cations (Hq), the well-known ETM tris(8-quinolinyl)aluminum Alq3 is still employed in OLED which causes OLED device degradation. As a result, ETMs with excellent electron transport and hole blocking capabilities as well as strong thermal stability should be investigated. To improve the material's hole-blocking performance, extensive efforts have been made to raise its HOMO energy level. Aza-aromatic compounds like phenanthroline, quinoline, pyridine, and triazole have been introduced into the conjugated system to increase the electron mobility of organic semiconductors.54–60 In the past few years, a series of multifunctional pyridine-containing electron transport materials (ETM) have been developed as hole/exciton blocking layers for ETL and phosphorescent OLEDs, thereby simplifying the device structure and improving the external quantum efficiency (ηext).61–66 The ETM properties demonstrated that the position of the nitrogen atom of the substituted pyridine ring is a key factor in determining the electron injection and transport properties and the performance of the OLED.67,68 Hence, the synthesis of pyridine-containing compounds with substitution at different positions in a single molecule is of high importance to further regulate the characteristics of the pyridine-containing ETM.
 Fig. 1  Schematic representation of device architecture of OLED. 
In 2008 Kido et al. reported two pyridine based ETMs 1 and 2 for application in the OLEDs due to their suitable triplet energy levels and high electron mobility.69 ETMs 1 and 2 were synthesized via the Pd-catalysed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction of the pyridyl boronate ester with 1,3,5-tri(m-bromophenyl)benzene to prepare the ETM 1 and similarly with 1,3,5-tri(p-bromophenyl)benzene to form the ETM 2 (Scheme 1). The ETM 1 showed absorption band at lower wavelength region around 254 nm, whereas the ETM 2 showed a red shifted absorption band at wavelength region around 296 nm due to better π-conjugation. To evaluate the turn-on voltage, both the ETMs were fabricated with FIrpic (C28H16F4IrN3O2)(bis[2-(4,6-difluorophenyl)pyridinato-C2,N](picolinato)iridium(III) and Ir(PPy)3 as phosphorescent emitters. The device system of ETM 1 exhibits a low turn-on voltage of 2.85 V and a low drive voltage of 3.25 V at 100 cd m−2 and 1000 cd m−2, respectively. In contrast, ETM 2-based devices exhibit a lower turn-on voltage of 2.64 V at 100 cd m−2, and lower drive voltages of 2.95 V and 3.30 V at 100 cd m−2 and 1000 cd m−2, respectively. The low driving voltages for ETMs 1 and 2 could be ascribed to the higher electron mobility values of 7.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 and 3.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1, respectively.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route of ETM 1 and 2. 
Li et al. reported two polyaryl-substituted pyridine derivatives 3 and 4 (Chart 1) for application in ETM as well as in hole blocking layer.70 The ETMs 3 and 4 were synthesized via cyclo-condensation reaction. The ETMs 3 and 4 possess suitable HOMO and LUMO values for effective electron transport in the device. The high triplet energy ET value of HTM 3 (3.04 eV) as compared to 4 (2.99 eV) was due to the presence of more electron withdrawing cyano group at the para position which can lower the value of triplet energy level. The calculated LUMO value (>−3.50 eV) and HOMO at −6.87 eV was reasonable for effective electron injection (Fig. 2(a)). The organic layers included α-napthylphenylbiphenyl diamine (NPB) as the hole-transporting layer, 9,10-di(2-naphthyl)anthracene (ADN) as the light-emitting layer (LEL), and 3 or 4 as the ETL with a hole-blocking property. The ETL facilitates the electron injection from the cathode (Mg/Ag) to the organic layer owing to the comparable LUMO energy levels of ETM 3 and 4. Simultaneously, the HOMO energy level are higher than standard ETMs which helps to prevent the movement of holes from light emitting layer (ADN), hence act as hole blocking layer (Fig. 2(a)). By introduction of a methyl group at pyrimidine, unfavorable impacts due to the sub-atomic growth and crystallization can be avoided during the film formation which causes both the ETMs to show great electron-mobility and hole blocking capacities. The device fabricated with ETM 4 as the ETL showed a maximum current efficiency of 2.51 cd A−1 at 20 mA cm−2, although the current efficiency at 80 mA cm−2 is slightly lower i.e. 2.40 cd A−1. The external quantum efficiency of the corresponding devices based on 3 and 4 were 2.44% and 1.28%, respectively.

Kido et al. reported a series of pyridine-containing ETMs 5–7, in which pyridine was substituted at 2-methylpyrimidine skeleton and the effect of pyridine was studied on the optical properties and charge mobility of ETMs.71 For the synthesis of ETMs 5–7, the precursor a′ was prepared by the Pd-catalyzed regioselective Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between a and boronic acid of dichlorobenzene in 81% yield. The obtained tetrachloride intermediate a′ was further coupled with excess amount of 3-pyridine boronate ester and 4-pyridine boronate ester to obtain 5 and 6 with a yield of 77% and 67%, respectively. On the other hand, the tetraborate (a′′) was prepared by the Miyaura Borylation reaction of a′ and bis(pinacolyl)diborane). The tetraborate (a′′) was obtained with a yield of 61%. The ETM 7 was prepared by the Pd-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura reaction between (a′′) and 2-bromopyridine in 84% yield. The synthetic route of all the derivatives are shown in Scheme 2. The DSC and TGA measurements of ETM 7 showed a weight loss of 5% (Td) at 465 °C, and glass transition temperature (Tg) of 7 was at 107 °C. The melting point of ETM 6 was higher than ETM 5 and 7 due to the stronger H-bonding interactions. All the ETMs differ only in the position of the substituted pyridine rings, which results in the various degree of H-bonding interactions and follows the order 7 < 5 < 6. The strength of H-bonding was explained with help of thin layer chromatography (TLC) and DSC studies. The value of the calculated electron mobility of 5, 6 and 7 was about 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. From the estimated values of the electron mobility, it was observed that ETM 7 shows higher mobility due to positional difference of N-atom of pyridine.

Further, Yokoyama et al. studied the effect of C–H⋯N hydrogen bonding which induced the molecular stacking, leading to higher carrier mobility in the vacuum deposited organic films using reported ETMs 5, 6 and 7.72 The authors have discussed the importance of various position of nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring. They have also prepared a series of ETMs 8–10 (Chart 1) via replacing methyl unit by phenyl ring to confirm the versatility of reported HTMs. The existence of H-bonding was ensured by performing IR studies of vacuum deposited films of ETMs 5–7 The results explained that the molecular planes of 5, 6, 8 and 9 ETMs were parallel to the surface of substrate, and in the molecular film singular orientation is caused due to the intermolecular C–H⋯N hydrogen bonding interactions. Compared to ETM 7 film, the anisotropy of 5 and 6 film was much larger, which can only be explained by the C–H⋯N hydrogen bonds in the para and meta substituted pyridine derivatives. In ETMs 5 and 6, the out facing nitrogen atoms in the pyridine ring are more feasible for intermolecular C–H⋯N hydrogen bonding interactions (Fig. 2(b) and 1(c)). The electron mobility of the ETM 5 film is one order higher than that of the 7 film, and the electron mobility of the 6 film is further one step higher as compared to ETM 5.
Lee et al. reported the application of spirofluorene-benzofluorene derivative as ETM in blue fluorescent OLEDs with an increased efficiency up to 20%.73 The pyridine-substituted spirofluorene-benzofluorene HTM (11) (Chart 1) was synthesized via the Pd-catalysed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between pyridine boronic acid (a′) and bromo derivative of spirofluorene (a) in 99% yield (Scheme 3). The UV-Visible absorption spectra of HTM 11 showed strong absorption band at 298 nm with a shoulder peak at 318 nm which arises from the collective π–π* transition in the spiro(fluorene-benzofluorene) unit. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of HTM 11 was determined by the cyclic voltammetry at −6.35 eV and −2.88 eV, respectively. The electrochemical studies of HTM 11 showed that HOMO and LUMO was much affected by insertion of pyridine on spirofluorene-benzofluorene moiety, and a shift of about 0.13 eV was observed in the HOMO and LUMO levels of HTM 11 due to the additional pyridine unit. The OLEDs based on ETM 11 exhibit maximum quantum efficiency of 7.72% at luminance of 3000 cd m−2, which was comparatively higher than the device based on Alq3.
 Scheme 3  Synthetic route of ETM 11. 
Ichikawa et al. developed two ETMs 12 and 13 (Chart 1), which enhance OLEDs power efficiency due to their better electron-transporting and hole-blocking properties. The ETMs 12 and 13 were synthesized by the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of bipyridine or terpyridine bromides with tris(pinacolboryl) benzene, respectively.74 The neat thin-film absorption spectra of ETM 12 and ETM 13 exhibited the absorption maxima at 274 nm and 293 nm, respectively. The optical band gap was calculated from recorded absorption spectra in the neat film and further HOMO and LUMO energy levels were determined from UV absorption spectra. Owing to the three additional acceptor pyridine units, ETM 13 attains a low lying LUMO energy level at −3.00 eV in the solution state, while the solid-state LUMO of ETM 13 was obtained at −2.85 eV, which is suitable for the transfer of electrons to the metal electrode. In addition, for these ETMs, the HOMO energy level (−6.45 eV for 12, and −6.60 eV for 13) was deep enough to prevent holes from leaking from the emitting layer of the OLED device. In the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curve, multiple numbers of heating scans were performed, and the glass transition temperature (Tg) was observed to be at 75 °C for ETM 12 and at 110 °C for 13. These findings indicate that both the molecules can form a stable glassy film under vacuum processing of device fabrication. The luminous efficiency (4.0 cd A−1) exhibited by the device with ETM 12 was almost the same as that of the reference device with Alq3. Due to the deeper HOMO level, the device with 13 as an ETM showed an excellent luminous efficiency (5.0 cd A−1). Electron mobility calculated as a function of electric field (μ = Dd/tTV) for ETM 12 and 13 (10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) was comparatively higher than that for Alq3 (Fig. 3).

Sun et al. reported symmetrical pyridine substituted anthracene ETM 14 (Chart 1) for application in OLEDs in place of widely used tris (8-quinolinolato aluminum) Alq3.75 The ETM 14 was synthesized via the Pd-catalysed Suzuki cross–coupling reaction between 9,10-bis(3-bromophenyl) anthracene with pyridin-3-ylboronic acid (Scheme 4). The UV-visible absorption spectra of ETM 14 exhibited a strong absorption band at 375 nm and 381 nm in solution and solid state, respectively, which may be caused by the collective π–π* transition of the pyridine ring and the benzene ring connected to the anthracene core. There was red shift of 11 nm in the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the film with respect to the emission spectra in the solution state. The HOMO value calculated from the anodic oxidation potential (σ) was at −5.9 eV, and the LUMO level of the compound was estimated to be at −2.6 eV. ETM 14 has bipolar transport properties, and both the electron and the hole mobilities were at 10−3 cm−2 V−1 s−1; that was about 2 times higher than Alq3. The OLED devices based on 14 as ETM were very reliable: ETM 14-based devices have a half-life of 67000 h (longer than those based on Alq3), and the basic brightness was 5000 cd m−2.
 Scheme 4  Synthetic route of ETM 14. 
Liu et al. reported a series of pyridine-containing ETMs 15–20, in which pyridine was substituted through different positions (ortho, meta, and para) at the central pyrimidine ring, and all the pyridine derivatives were synthesized via the Pd-catalyzed regioselective Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between different pyridine boronic pinacol esters and aryl halide (I) (Scheme 5).76 The UV-Visible absorption spectra for both the ETM 15 and 16 exhibited strong absorption band at 262 nm, similarly both the ETM 17 and 18 showed absorption peak at 254 nm which could be from the collective π–π* transition of the benzene ring and pyridine ring. Shoulder peaks were observed at longer wavelength of 326 nm and 346 nm due to the n–π* transition. The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of 15–20 are at −6.68, −6.42, −6.57, −6.51, −6.65, and −6.62 eV, and −2.68, −2.42, −3.10, −3.01, −3.21, and −3.17 eV, respectively (Table 1). Among these ETMs, 17-based devices attained the highest current efficiency (CEs) of 102 and 94.9 cd A−1 at luminescence of 100 and 1000 cd m−2, respectively, and the corresponding ηext was 28.5% and 26.4%. In contrast, 18–20 based devices showed relatively low CEs values of ∼97 and ∼88 cd A−1 at 100 and 1000 cd m−2, respectively.

By taking ETM 1 as a reference, Ye et al. reported a series of ETMs 21–27 (Chart 2) containing pyridine rings with different orientations of nitrogen atoms on the periphery and in the central core of the ETMs.77 Three additional phenyl rings were inserted at the periphery of ETM 1 to yield ETM 21, and three more pyridine rings with different nitrogen atom orientations were inserted with ETM 1 to give ETMs 22, 23, 24, 25 and 26, respectively. ETMs 25 and 27 are analogues of ETM 26 with the same framework but different combination sites at the peripheral pyridine rings. In the same molecular framework of ETMs 25, 26, and 27, the change in positions of the nitrogen atom of the peripheral pyridine rings (ortho to meta to para) lowered the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of ETMs. The glass transition temperature (Tg), melting temperature (Tm) and the decomposition temperature (Td) of ETM with six pyridine rings were higher than ETM 1 (Tg = 99.2 °C), except for ETM 25 (Tg = 97.8 °C) and 26 (Tg = 91.3 °C). The lowest Tg value and the smallest dipole moment of ETM 26 were explained by intermolecular interaction calculated from the DFT studies. The introduction of the pyridine rings with nitrogen atoms at different orientations (at the periphery of the molecule and in the molecular framework) exhibits exceptionally low working voltage of 2.61 and 3.03 V under the application of 1 cd m−2 and 100 cd m−2, respectively.
 Chart 2  Chemical structure of pyridine based materials as ETMs (21–45) in OLEDs. 
Wang et al. developed three pyridine-containing phenanthroimidazole based ETMs 28, 29 and 30, and studied their photophysical properties, energy levels and electron mobilities by altering the connecting position of the pyridine ring.78 The Pd-catalysed Suzuki cross–coupling reaction was carried out between the phenanthroimidazole intermediate (I) and the pyridin-3-ylboronic acid to synthesize the final ETMs 28, 29 and 30 in 86%, 82% and 79% yields, respectively (Scheme 6). The UV-Visible absorption spectra for ETMs 28–30 showed strong absorption band at 260 nm which could arise from the mutual π–π* transition of the pyridine ring and benzene ring. However, the delocalized π–π* electronic transition in phenanthroimidazole results in the weaker absorption band at 300–370 nm. In comparison to 29, ETMs 28 and 30 showed additional absorption band at higher wavelength between 300 and 370 nm, respectively, which can be attributed to the π-conjugation among the phenanthroimidazole and pyridine moieties. The optical band gap (Eg) calculated from the onset of optical absorption is 3.17 eV, 3.30 eV and 3.17 eV for ETMs 28, 29, and 30, respectively. The maximum emission wavelengths of ETMs 28, 29, and 30 determined by exciting at 330 nm in dichloromethane solution were observed at 419 nm, 370 nm and 415 nm, respectively. In OLEDs, maximum current efficiency of 15.17 cd A−1 (corresponding EQEmax = 7.75%), for ETM 30 exhibited a low turn on voltage of 2.8 V and a negligible efficiency roll-off.
 Scheme 6  Synthesis of pyridine ETMs 28–30. 
Kido et al. studied the synergistic effect of intermolecular and intramolecular H-bonding interactions on the operating voltage of pyridine substituted 1,3,5-triphenyltriazine ETMs 31 and 32 (Chart 2).79 The calculated HOMO energy level of triphenyltriazine substituted ETMs 31 and 32 were estimated to be −6.80 eV and −7.14 eV, respectively. The LUMO energy for ETMs 31 and 32 was estimated to be −2.56 eV and −2.73 eV, respectively, which were more appropriate with the traditional ETL used in OLEDs. The X-ray crystal structure explained that ETM 32 showed a planar molecular framework due to the intramolecular and intermolecular H-bonding in the molecule. The planarity of ETM 32 was favorable for the (triazine) TZ part to exhibit c-axis extension π–π stacking (Fig. 4(a)). Therefore, due to the intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding, ETM 31 produces horizontally oriented films to fabricate the traditional fac-tris(2-phenylpyridine)iridium [Ir(ppy)3] OLED. The thermal characteristics of triphenyltriazine ETMs 31 and 32 were investigated by DSC and TGA measurements. The high decomposition temperature of 472 °C (5% (Td5) weight loss) was recorded for the triphenyltriazine ETMs 31 and 32 could be responsible for the enhanced stability of OLEDs device. ETM 32 has a melting point (Tm) approximately 60 °C higher than ETM 31. The ability of intermolecular H-bonds in the solid-state was principally responsible for these outcomes (Fig. 4). This device had a power efficiency (ηp) of 73.9 lm W−1, current efficiency (ηc) of 67.7 cd A−1, and external quantum efficiency (ηext) of 18.8%) at 1000 cd m−2 luminescence.

Later, Wang et al. studied the effect of different numbers of pyridine rings on the periphery of anthracene moiety.80 The ETMs 33–36 (Chart 2) were synthesized via the Pd-catalysed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between different bromo-9,10-diphenylanthracene intermediates and the corresponding aryl boronic acid to produce the ETMs 33, 34, 35 and 36, respectively (Scheme 7). ETM 33 has resulted in 87% yield, and ETMs 34–36 were resulted in comparatively low yield of 55%. The UV-visible absorption spectrum of ETMs 33–36 exhibited a strong absorption band at 350 nm, which may be caused by the collective π–π* transition of the pyridine ring and the benzene ring connected to the anthracene core. At around 380–425 nm, a weaker absorption band can be accredited to the delocalized π–π* electronic transition in anthracene. However, a redshift in the absorption spectra of ETM 35 and 36 (in which pyridine rings were attached at the 2 or 6-position of anthracene) showed that the absorption band could be effectively altered by substitution at 2,6-position through increasing the molecular conjugation. The emission maxima wavelengths of 33, 34, 35 and 36 were observed at 417, 426, 434 and 443 nm, respectively, via exciting in dichloromethane solution. The HOMO levels of 33–36 determined by the cyclic voltammetry were at −5.77, −5.78, −5.8 and −5.79 eV, respectively, and the respective LUMO levels were at −2.82, −2.84, −2.96 and −3.05 eV. In OLEDs, the ETM 35 showed a maximum current efficiency of 14.4 cd A−1 with a low turn-on voltage of 2.8 V.
 Scheme 7  Synthesis of pyridine ETMs 33–36. (a) Toluene, 2 M K2CO3 aq, EtOH, pyridine boric acid, Pd(PPh3)4, reflux. 
Kido et al. reported fluorine substituted pyridine derivatives 37–43 (Chart 2) to investigate the influence of F-atom on the molecular orientation as well on the electron mobility of ETM.81 The ETMs 37–43 were synthesized via the Pd-catalysed Suzuzki cross-coupling reaction of fluorine-substituted tetrachloride with pyridine boronate ester in 55–60% yield. The melting point of ETM 37 (Tm = 312 °C) was much higher than that of ETM 39 (Tm = 264 °C) due to strong intermolecular interactions. The Tm of ETM 38 was 50 °C lower than that of 37, which indicates that the intermolecular interaction of 38 was weaker than that of ETM 37. The results indicates that the contribution of CH–F interactions was comparatively weaker than the CH–N interactions owing to the lesser bond energy of (5–9 kJ mol−1)99 is weaker than that of CH–N, H-bonds (10–20 kJ mol−1).98 As ETM 38 may generate additional CH–F intermolecular H-bonding, as a result, difluorinated ETM 38 was anticipated to have a higher molecular orientation order parameter than mono and non-fluorinated counterparts. ETM 38, on the other hand, had a lesser orientation order parameter of S = −0.15 than ETM 43 (S = −0.21) and 37 (S = −0.23) (Fig. 5). All these studies indicate that the positions of fluorine atoms in the pyridine derivative are significant to improve the intermolecular interactions (H-bonding of nitrogen and fluorine atoms with adjacent phenyl ring) in ETM derivatives.

Kido et al. developed two pyridine based ETMs 44 and 45, the device showed excellent OLED properties with an external quantum efficiency of 21% due to their horizontal molecular orientations in the thin solid films.82 The ETMs 44 and 45 were synthesized by using tetrachloride precursors with 3-pyridine boronate ester in the presence of Pd catalyst in 81% and 92% yield (Chart 2). The HOMO energy levels determined by cyclic voltammetry were −6.79 eV for ETM 44 and −6.51 eV for ETM 45. The optimized structures from X-ray analysis showed that ETM 44 was more twisted with a dihedral angle of 37.0°, and possess additional steric hindrance compared to ETM 45, which have comparatively planar structure with reduced dihedral angle to 16.1° owing to the locked H-bonding (Fig. 6(a) and (b)). In ETM 44 due to twisted structure, the HOMO was mainly located at terminal 3,5-dipyridylphenyl units, and that of ETM 45 HOMO was localized at molecular framework (Fig. 6(c)). The LUMO energy levels were evaluated to be −2.10 eV for 44 and −2.01 eV for 45, and these observed LUMO levels were deeper than those of conventional ETMs, suggesting a better electron-injection property. Owing to the more planar structure, ETM 45 exhibited higher electron mobility ranging from 2.0 × 10−4 to 3.0 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1 as compared to ETM 44. The electron mobility was almost one order of magnitude higher than that of 2,2′,2′′-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole) TPBi (conventional ETM used in OLEDs).

For application of pyridine based polymers as ETM by orthogonal solution processing in ETL, Krüger et al. developed four electron transport polymers 47–50 (Chart 3) functionalized with alcohol-soluble side chains.83 It was observed that the solubility of pyridine polymers in alcohol depends on the ratio of pyridine and phenyl units. The polymers 47–50 were synthesized via the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction followed by free radical polymerization and the polymers were purified from unreacted monomers through repeated precipitation. To attain a better solubility in alcohol the relative pyridine content should be more than 0.5 of overall aromatic side chain units (Fig. 7). They have taken m-terphenyl (mTP) based units as reference and modified the basic structure by introducing pyridine at the periphery as well as pyridine substituted phenyl group to induce the electron transport functionality. The pyridine based polymers 47, 48 and 50 showed absorption bands at 248, 253 and 257 nm, respectively, similar to the reference polymer 46 (253 nm). In comparison, due to the extended conjugation in polymer side chain, the para substituted polymer 48 showed highly red shifted absorption band at 293 nm. The electrochemical properties explained that due to the presence of pyridine unit, the HOMO energy levels of pyridine based polymers 47–50 lies between −7.3 to −7.1 eV, which were comparatively lower to the reference polymer 46. Due to the electron deficient pyridine rings, the pyridine based polymers 47–50 showed excellent hole blocking properties. The LUMO energy level of polymer 47 was estimated to be −2.6 eV. For polymers 48–50, LUMO energy levels were at −2.7 eV. In DSC and TGA measurements, the polymer 47 showed weight loss of 5% (Td) at around 376 °C and glass transition temperature (Tg) at 192 °C, which was higher than polymer 46 due to the stronger molecular interactions and high polarity. Polymers 48 and 50 showed Tg of 241 and 247 °C, respectively.

Cui et al. developed pyridine based ETMs 51–54, which contain 1,2,4-triazole as main core to study the effect of pyridine ring on film morphology and solvent resistance in the performance of OLEDs.84 The ETMs 51–54 (Chart 3) were synthesized via the Pd-catalysed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between boron ester-substituted 1,2,4-triazole and dibromopyridine derivatives. The UV-visible absorption spectrum of ETMs 51–54 showed a strong absorption band at 256 nm, which may be caused by the collective π–π* transitions. At 285–323 nm, there is weaker absorption band which can be accredited to the delocalized π–π* electronic transition in1,2,4-triazole. In TGA measurement, the decomposition temperature (Td) at weight loss of 5% was observed in range of 305–354 °C, for ETMs 51–54. In the electrochemical properties, the calculated LUMO energy levels for ETMs 51–54 were −3.19, −3.43, −3.20 and −3.22 eV, respectively, and HOMO energy levels were −6.57, −6.58, −6.55 and −6.49 eV, respectively. These HOMO and LUMO energy levels were suitable for effective electron injection (Fig. 8) in the OLEDs. In the ETMs 51–54, the triplet energies were varied from 2.51 to 2.82 eV by the substitution of end-capping units at ortho, meta and para positions of the pyridine units. However, the ETM 53 has the highest value of triplet energy level at 2.82 eV due to the substitution of end-capping entities at 2,5-positions of the pyridine moiety. Moreover, the new materials do show great solubility and film forming abilities. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of ETM 53 based device was 12.1% in the inkjet-printed blue OLEDs. The EQE of the corresponding blue OLED device based on ETM 53 was 11.1%.

Three pyridine substituted star shaped ETMs 55–57 were reported by Yang et al. for application in OLEDs as a solution processed electron transporter.85 The ETMs 55–57 were synthesized via Diels–Alder reactions of cyclopentadienone with the acetylene unit to get the final compounds through cyclotrimerization. The UV-Visible absorption spectra for compounds 55–57 shows a strong absorption band at 330 nm, which could be instigated from the collective π–π* transition of the fluorene units. Intense deep-blue fluorescence emission spectra at around 380–390 nm was recorded for all the derivatives. In thermogravimetric analysis, a weight loss of 5% (Td) was observed at around 418 °C for 55, 421 °C for 56, and 426 °C for 57. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of ETM 55, 56, and 57, was observed at 153 °C, 141 °C, and 151 °C, respectively using DSC measurements. The value of triplet energy level for 55, 56, and 57, were at −2.44 eV, −2.47 eV, and −2.44 eV, respectively. By using the cyclic voltammetry, HOMO energy levels were determined at −6.04 eV, −5.90 eV, and −5.98 eV for 55, 56, and 57, respectively. The LUMO levels of 55, 56, and 57 were at −2.75 eV, −2.79 eV, and −2.72 eV, respectively. The maximum current efficiency of 56 based device was 5.63 cd A−1, and the EQE of the corresponding devices was 4.68%, which was higher than device with 55 and 57 derivatives.
The pyridine substituted spirofluorene based ETM 58 was developed by Liu et al. and showed high (triplet excited state) T1 for better confinement of triplet excitons and improved device stabilities of TADF-PhOLED.86 The spiro molecule was synthesized via the Pd-catalysed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between boronate ester of spirofluorene (a) and bromo-terpyridine (a′) in 43% yield (Scheme 8). The UV-visible absorption spectrum of ETM 58 shows two absorption bands at 297 and 308 nm which can arise due to the collective π–π* transition of fluorene units in spirobifluorene derivative. The electrochemical studies were performed by using cyclic voltammetry and the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were determined to be −6.2 eV, and −2.7 eV, respectively for ETM 58. The thermogravimetric studies on ETM 58 shows good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature at 468 °C and glass transition temperature at 195 °C. The maximum external quantum efficiency (ηext,max) was recorded up to 24.5%. In the presence of bis(2-phenylpyridine)iridium(III) (2,2,6,6-tetramethylheptane-3,5-diketonate) (Ir(ppy)2tmd) as emitter, the derivative 58 showed a maximum power efficiency (ηPE,max) of 129.3 lm W−1 and maximum external quantum efficiency ηext,max of 28.2%.
 Scheme 8  Synthesis of pyridine ETM 58. 
Duan et al. reported pyridine based ETM incorporated with anthracene unit and studied the effect of H-bonding on the operating voltage and power efficiency of OLEDs.87 The UV-Visible absorption spectra for ETM 59 shows strong absorption bands at 378 and 400 nm, which could be instigated from the collective π–π* transitions. By using cyclic voltammetry, the HOMO and LUMO levels were determined at −5.9 eV and −3.0 eV respectively. In TGA and DSC measurements, a weight loss of 5% (Td) was observed at around 397 °C for 59, and glass transition temperature (Tg) of 59 was at 135 °C. The measured bond distance in the CH⋯N inter- and intramolecular interaction was 2.718–2.929 Å and 2.557–2.598 Å, respectively (Fig. 9). Low driving voltages of 2.76 and 2.92 V were recorded at applied brightness of 5000 and 10000 cd m−2, respectively. The device optimization at voltage of 3 V leads to an unprecedented record-high PE nearly 110 lm W−1 at 10000 cd m−2. Further device tuning leads to an exceptional PE of approximately 110 lm W−1 at 10000 cd m−2 with a voltage less than 3 V, holding a new record. Anthracene substituted ETM 59 exhibited extremely higher EQEs/PEs of 28.0%/102 lm W−1 and 27.9%/97 lm W−1 with brightness of 5000 and 10000 cd m−2, respectively at low voltage of 2.76 and 2.92 V. In the device system, the derivative 59 showed excellent electron transporting mobility with better charge injection properties due to the presence of strong intermolecular H-bonding.

Further, Duan et al. reported asymmetric and symmetric ETMs 60 and 61 for application in thermally activated delayed fluorescent sensitizers (TSF-OLEDs).88 As compared to the symmetrical ETM 59, they have changed terminal of anthracene with imidazole unit in ETM 60, which showed high charge transfer and excellent exciton confinement simultaneously. The ETM 60 was synthesized via the Pd-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction of the 5-(10-bromoanthracen-9-yl)-2-phenylpyridine moiety (a) with the boronic ester of imidazole moiety (a′) with a good yield of 80% (Scheme 9). The UV-visible spectra of ETM 60 showed absorption peaks at 360, 376, and 396 nm, which are attributed to the π–π* transitions of anthracene core. The energy gap for ETM 60 was obtained around 3.0 eV from the onset absorption wavelength at 417 nm. Further, the HOMO and LUMO was calculated to be at −5.81 and −2.81 eV, respectively, by cyclic voltammetry using ferrocene as reference. ETM 60 showed a good thermal stability, glass transition temperature (Tg) at 140 °C and a decomposition temperature (Td, corresponding to 5% weight loss) at 383 °C due to its bulky and rigid structure. The device performance of ETMs 59, 60 and 61 was studied with the reference conventional ETM, 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Bphen). ETM 60 as ETL in TSF-OLEDs exhibited maximum external quantum efficiency of 24.6%, and power efficiency of 76.0 lm W−1 as compared to 59 (23.4%) and 61 (24.1%). At low operation voltage 3.14 V, there was a decrease in external quantum efficiency up to 23.8%, at high luminance of 5000 cd m−1 (Fig. 10).

2.2. HTM for perovskite solar cells
The power conversion efficiencies of Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on conventional hole-transporting materials (HTMs) are comparable to those of typical inorganic solar cells; however, the dopants used to increase the hole mobility and film-forming ability, reduce the long-term stability of these devices, preventing PSCs from being commercialized. Therefore, for potential HTM, effective design strategies must be adopted in the emerging areas of the current PSCs. Organic HTMs play a vital role in promoting effective charge transport and collection in the device and reduces the cell degradation (as a protective layer on top of the perovskite crystals). In the conventional architecture of n–i–p perovskite solar cell (Fig. 11), hole transporting layer (HTL) is deposited on a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) and a perovskite layer is sandwiched between the electron transporting layer (ETL) and the HTL. Therefore, the function of HTM in PSC is very important to improve the device performance and stability. In most high-efficient PSCs, triphenylamino derivatives 2,2′,7,7′-tetra(N,N′-di-p-methoxyaniline)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (C81H68N4O8) (Spiro-OMeTAD) and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] ((C21H19N)n) (PTAA) is still an obvious choice for HTM due to their high PCE of 20.8%100 and 20.2%,101 respectively. However, synthesis of spiro-OMeTAD is time-consuming and low-yielding, and its purification needs costly sublimation processes, making it prohibitively expensive. In its natural state, it has low conductivity and hole mobility, therefore, it needs addition of chemical p-dopants such Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), and cobalt(III) complexes to boost the conductivity and hole mobility. A range of organic small molecules based on heterocyclic molecules i.e. phenothiazine, carbazole, triazine, triphenyamine, imidazole, quinoxaline and benzothiadiazole etc. have shown remarkable hole transporting characteristics in the PSCs. In recent years, the development of organic HTMs containing pyridine rings showed significant improvement in the device performance of PSCs due to the electron deficient character of pyridine and free lone electron pairs at the nitrogen atom. The pyridine based HTMs have attained more than 20% PCE in the PSCs even without using additional dopants.

In 2016, Cheng et al. reported three new HTMs 62, 63 and 64 based on ethylhexyloxy substituted benzodithiophene (BDT) core with end-capped pyridine (HTM 62) and ionized pyridine (HTMs 63 and 64) units.89 The PSCs with 63 as HTM exhibited the maximum PCE of 17.4% without any external additives. The UV-Visible spectrum in dichloromethane showed a strong absorption of light with sharp peak in range of 300–600 nm for HTM 62. It has been observed that the absorption spectra of HTM 63 and 64 were red shifted by 50 nm due to ionization of pyridine unit. There was a negligible change in the absorption spectrum of counterions exchange which shows that absorption and molecular energy levels are primarily controlled by the internal π-conjugation of cations. The optical band gap calculated from the absorption edge of the UV-Visible spectrum were at 1.84, 1.70, and 1.70 eV, for HTMs 62, 63 and 64, respectively. By using cyclic voltammetry, the HOMO levels were determined at −5.33, −5.28, and −5.28 eV for HTMs 62, 63, and 64 respectively, and the LUMO levels of 62, 63 and 64 were at −3.49, −3.58 and −3.58 eV, (Fig. 12). The calculated value of hole mobility for HTM 62 was 1.11 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was comparatively lower than currently doped Spiro-OMeTAD (3.48 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) used in manufacturing of PCSs device. The calculated hole mobilities of ionized pyridine HTM 63 (3.03 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and 64 (3.24 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) without any external dopant was comparable to that of doped Spiro-OMeTAD (Table 2).

Xu et al. reported a series of organic HTMs 65, 66, 67 and 68 based on spiro[fluorene-9,9′′-ton] (SFX), with covalently linked ortho, meta, and para substituted pyridine rings for tBP free PSCs.90 All the HTMs were synthesized using 4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamine through Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling reaction. In the UV-Visible spectrum of HTMs 65–68, a strong absorption maximum around 385 nm was observed, and the emission spectra were recorded around 425 nm in dichloromethane (DCM) for all the HTMs. The absorption spectra could be ascribed due to the similar π-conjugated molecular structure of HTMs 65–68. The electrochemical measurements were performed and the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were determined at −5.15 eV and −2.11 eV, respectively, which was similar for all the HTMs (Fig. 13(b)). A device was fabricated with photoactive layer thickness of ≈400 nm and the HTL thickness of ≈100 nm to check the photovoltaic properties of PSCs (Fig. 13(a)). The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of HTMs 65–68 used in the device fabrication were equivalent to the spiro-OMeTAD and C60 was used as an ETL. All the HTMs show same hole mobility around 1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The tailor-made HTM 68 with two para-substituted pyridines showed a high PCE of 17.2% in the planar CH3NH3PbI3-based PSC without tBP under 100 mW cm−2 AM of 1.5G sunlight. Comparatively high PCE of HTM 68 was explained on the basis of binding interaction of HTM with the perovskite layer. Due to para substituted pyridine in HTM 68, both the nitrogen atom of pyridine could make a strong chemical bonding with Pb of perovskite made of CH3NH3PbI3. In case of HTMs 66 and 67, only one nitrogen atom of pyridine was available for binding with the perovskite layer. Under the same conditions, the observed value of PCE was significantly higher than the efficiency of well-known 2,2′,7,7′-tetra(N,N′-di-p-methoxyaniline)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (C81H68N4O8) Spiro-OMeTAD as HTM (without tBP) (Fig. 13(c)). In addition, in the mixed ion-based planar PSC without adding tBP as an additive, the PCE of the 68-based device also reached a record 19.5% (Fig. 13(d)).

Zhu et al. reported two HTMs 69 and 70 for conventional planar perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3−XClX) solar cells, which shows an excellent power conversion efficiencies of 17.71% and 18.48%, respectively.91 HTMs 69 and 70 were synthesized by the palladium-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling reaction, both the HTMs have similar absorption characteristics in the UV-Visible absorption spectra, with the major absorption band around 300 nm. The HTM 69 had a high thermal decomposition temperature (Td) at 442 °C and a glass transition temperature (Tg) at 162 °C, whereas HTM 70 had a Td at 380 °C and a Tg at 151 °C. Bipyridine's electron-withdrawing characteristic lowers the HOMO energy levels of HTMs, owing to increase the open circuit voltage of perovskite solar cells. In addition, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra and transient PL attenuation further confirmed the good hole extraction and hole transport capabilities of HTM 69 and 70. As a result, HTM 70 showed an optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.48% under the conditions of a high open-circuit voltages (VOC) at 1.11 V, short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) at 21.01 mA cm−2 and a high fill factor (FF) i.e. 0.79. HTM 69 showed the comparable PCE of 17.71%, at VOC at 1.05 V, the JSC at 21.26 mA cm−2, and the high FF i.e. 0.79 (Fig. 14).

Reddy et al. reported pyridine based HTM 72 (Chart 4) with thiophene spacer which can form Lewis acid-base adduct with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF), which help in smooth film formation, improved morphology and long term stability to the PSCs.92 The UV-Vis absorption spectra showed the peak at 309 nm which was ascribed to the n–π* transition of TPA and thiophene, while the peak at 402 nm could be due to the intramolecular charge transfer of TPA/thiophene and pyridine. The Cyclic voltammetry was performed to calculate the HOMO energy level of HTM 72, which shows multiple oxidation peaks, the HOMO energy level calculated from the first onset oxidation peak was at −5.06 eV and LUMO at −2.42 eV. The HTM 72 showed good thermal properties with 5% weight loss, glass transition temperature (Tg) at 120 °C and thermal decomposition temperature (Td) at 439 °C. The Lewis acid-base adduct formation of pyridine moiety of HTM with BCF enhances the selectivity of perovskite layer for holes (Fig. 15(a)). This resulted in the improved hole mobility of 2.03 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (with BCF) and 4.12 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (without BCF). The device performance of HTM 72 (JSC at 19.71 mA cm−2, VOC at 0.99 V, and FF i.e. 63.32%) was comparatively better than devices based on Spiro-OMeTAD (12.36%, HI, 0.108). The PSCs based on HTM 72 has an average PCE of 16.57%, with excellent long-term durability of more than 720 hours (Fig. 15(b)).

Recently two phenothiazine based HTMs 73 and 74 (Chart 4) were reported by Wang et al. for application in NiOx based PSCs.93 The central phenothiazine as well as the terminal pyridine rings simultaneously improve the interaction of HTMs with NiOx and perovskite layers through coordination interactions. These interactions resulted in the enhanced hole extraction ability as well as conductivity of NiOx layer. One terminal pyridine group of HTM interacts with the NiOx layer, while the other terminal pyridine was coordinated with the Pb atom of the perovskite layer CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3), establishing an interface hole transport bridge between NiOx and the perovskite. The HOMO energy levels of HTM 73 and 74 was calculated from cyclic voltammetry were at −5.28 and −5.36 eV, respectively, which are lower than the VB (−5.19 eV) of NiOx. The PSC device based on NiOx with 74 as HTM shows a higher value of open circuit voltage (VOC) i.e. 1.043 V as well as high short circuit current (JSC) at 21.45 mA cm−2 than the device based on NiOx with 73 with VOC (1.028 V) and JSC (20.91 mA cm−2). The increased VOC of HTM 74 was explained due to its ability to retard charge recombination at the HTL than that of HTL layer made up of HTM 73. The power conversion efficiency of HTMs 73 and 74 with bridged NiOx increased from 12.53 to 16.25 and 17.00% (Fig. 16).

Xue et al. reported three HTMs 75, 76 and 77 based on 2,4,6-triarylpyridine and their comparative optical and photovoltaic properties were studied.94 In the UV-Visible absorption spectra, all three HTMs 75, 76 and 77 showed two absorption peaks in range of 300–320 nm and 320–430 nm. The absorption peak with maxima at lower wavelength was ascribed to the π–π* interactions. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels for 2,4,6-triarylpyridine functionalized HTMs 75, 76 and 77 were calculated at −5.29 eV, −5.30 eV, −5.36 eV and −2.46 eV, −2.55 eV, −2.50 eV, respectively by using cyclic voltammetry. The observed HOMO energy levels were deeper than the HTM based on the p-type polymers poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate)(PEDOT:PSS) (−4.90 eV) and better match with the valence band of MAPbI3 (−5.4 eV). The LUMO value of the HTMs was higher than the positive value of MAPbI3 (−3.9 eV), indicating that the movement of electrons transferred from the perovskite to the ITO electrode can be effectively suppressed. It was found that the Tg values of HTMs 75, 76 and 77 were at 70 °C, 98 °C and 114 °C, respectively. HTM 77 has the higher hole mobility with better dissolution compared to HTM 75 and 76, due to incorporation of additional three peripheral groups bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine on the pyridine core. The HTM 77 showed higher hydrophobicity of HTM, which enhanced the charge transfer, closer contact with perovskite, and lower carrier recombination rate. Therefore, the device with HTM 77 achieved an impressive PCE of 18.24% without increasing the hysteresis, and after 275 hours of storage, the device retained more than 75% of the initial PCE (Fig. 17).

Recently, our group has reported two pyridine based HTMs where pyridine core was attached with diphenylamine-substituted carbazole at different position to give HTM 78 and 79 (Chart 4) with a PCE of 17.7% and 13.1%, respectively.95 Both of the HTMs were synthesized by the palladium-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling reaction. The absorption spectra recorded in dichloromethane gives maximum absorption peak at 309 and 308 nm for HTMs 78 and 79, respectively. The HOMO energy levels calculated from the cyclic voltammetry was nearly similar for both the HTM at −5.5 eV, and LUMO energy level was calculated to be −2.7 eV, by using energy band gap and observed HOMO energy level (ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg opt). Both the HTMs 78 and 79 were thermally stable with a high glass transition temperature (Tg) at 132 °C and 126 °C, respectively. In order to study the influence of the connection topology on the molecular structure, the representative dihedral angle between the pyridine core and the substituted arm group was calculated. HTM 78 with 56.76° and 35.95° dihedral angles has lower flatness than 79 with 46.61° and 38.58°, which reduces molecular stacking and helps HTM 78 in a uniform film formation. The conductivity values of undoped HTMs 78 and 79 were about 3.7 and 3.1 μS cm−1, respectively. In the case of doped HTMs 78 and 79, the conductivity values were increased to 5.5 and 4.7 μS cm−1, respectively. Whether it was doped or undoped, the conductivity and mobility of 78 was higher than that of 79. The performance of devices with different HTMs and the stable power output tracking was evaluated.
Recently, Lui et al. reported two star shaped HTMs 80 and 81 (Chart 4) to study the effects of core structure (pyridine/phenyl unit) on dihedral angels as well as on the device performance of PSCs.96 The theoretical calculations explained that HTM 81 shows extended π-conjugation with a decreased dihedral angle as compared to HTM 80. The calculated dihedral angles between central pyridine ring and the adjacent benzene ring of triphenylamine in HTM 81 were −21.1°, 21.6° and −36.4°, whereas in the case of HTM 80 were −38.4°, −38.5° and −38.5°, respectively (Fig. 18). The results explained that the HTM 81 showed more planar structure and strong molecular packing compared to HTM 80. Owing to the planar structure, HTM 81 exhibited enhanced π-conjugation. For this reason, the pyridine substituted derivative 81 showed excellent hole transport properties. HTM 81 showed the hole mobility (3.48 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1), which is higher than of HTM 80 (2.08 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1). In the doped condition, the HTM 81 showed best efficiency of 17% which is much higher than that of PEDOT:PSS (12%).

In recent years, great progress has been made toward highly efficient and long lifetime OLEDs. High-performance OLED devices can be obtained by building the multilayer structure105 comprising of an ITO glass substrate anode, a hole transporting material (HTM), an electron-transporting material (ETM), and a cathode. One approach that has been widely used to achieve an efficient OLED device is the effective hole-transporting layer, which decreases the energy barrier between the anode and an organic emitter in a multilayer structure.102–106 Therefore, there has been a strong focus on developing new hole-transporting materials to achieve good OLED devices. During the past few years, several carbazole, triphenylamine, phenoxazine, and tolylamino cyclohexane-based compounds have been studied as hole-transporting materials in electronic devices because of their good electron-donating properties and suitable hole mobility.107–115
In 2021, Kumar et al. developed pyridine incorporated pyrene based HTMs 82–85 and studied their optical, thermal and hole transporting properties for application in the OLEDs. The desired HTMs were synthesized via the cyclization reaction of pyrene aldehyde with acetophenone derivatives in the presence of ammonium acetate and further purified by column chromatography. The optical band of HTMs 82, 83, 84, and 85 are observed at 3.28, 3.28, 3.30, and 3.26 eV, respectively, calculated using the onset value of absorption spectra. The HOMO energy levels were evaluated using oxidation potentials obtained from cyclic voltammetry. The estimated HOMO energy levels of 82, 83, 84, and 85, are −5.63, −5.61, −5.63, and −5.65 eV, respectively, and their corresponding lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are −2.35, −2.33, −2.33, and −2.39 eV, calculated from the subtraction of HOMO energy levels from the optical band gap values. In TGA studies, HTMs 82, 83, and 84 exhibited high thermal stability with decomposition temperature (Td5) of 357 °C, 355 and 367 °C, respectively and irrespective to that HTM 85 show lower Td5 of 249 °C due to the presence of C–Br bond. The absence of π–π stacking in solid-state, donor–acceptor properties of molecules (83 and 84), and the less π-electron flow from pyrene to pyridine might help in achieving the balanced carrier transport, which results in obtaining high stability and improved device performance at a higher voltage. All of the compounds were tested as hole-transporting layers in multilayer OLED devices, and it was found that the device with a hole-transporting layer of 85 offered the highest performance (a maximum luminance of 17300 cd m−2, a maximum current efficiency 27.6 cd A−1, and a maximum EQE 9% at 3500 cd m−2 with 7% roll-off from 1000 to 10000 cd m−2). Among all of the devices, a 85-based device exerted the highest EQE of 9% followed 83 (8.8%), 82 (8.5%), and NPB (6.7%) (Chart 5).

3. Conclusion
Emerging optoelectronics such as PSCs, OLEDs, and phototransistors have received a significant attention due to their promising power conversion efficiencies, ease of fabrication, low turn on voltage and high mobility of charge carriers which improves the driving voltage, and thermal stability. In OLEDs and PSCs, the charge carriers (ETM and HTM) play a vital role to enhance the power conversion efficiency as well as the external quantum efficiency. Although a number of organic/inorganic based ETMs/HTMs derivatives (small molecules and polymer) have been explored, still there is a wide scope to improve the power conversion efficiency as well as thermal stability of OLEDs and PSCs device. In this review, we have discussed various pyridine based derivatives used as charge carriers (ETMs/HTMs) in OLEDs and PSCs. The pyridine unit has three reactive positions (ortho, meta, and para) which are more feasible for substitutions of various donor/acceptor moieties to tune the photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties. We have summarized the development of donor-acceptor based derivatives with pyridine unit at central core as well as at end-capping positions of the ETM/HTM in OLEDs and PSCs. The advantages of various active positions, lone pair of nitrogen in pyridine, and the ability to form intramolecular/intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the pyridine derivatives on the optical properties of OLEDs and PSCs are:
1. The incorporation of electronically active pyridine unit in the molecular design favors the multiple strong intermolecular interaction and electronic coupling between the Frontier Molecular Orbitals (FMOs) of the adjacent molecules and consequently benefits charge transport.
2. The appropriately designed pyridine ring containing molecules to improve intermolecular interaction, which arises from hydrogen bonding, can control the molecular stacking. It has been demonstrated that intermolecular stacking helps to improve the charge carrier ability of HTM/ETM and improves the film forming ability. The lone pair of pyridine ring with N-atom at para and meta positions are more feasible for hydrogen bonding to the adjacent molecules compared to the ortho position due to the inner facing of lone pair of N-atom in the pyridine ring. These hydrogen bonding interactions helps to increase the electron mobility of ETMs in the following order i.e. para > meta > ortho.
3. The widely used ETM Alq3 possess good electron mobility but possess poor hole blocking properties and needs additives to improve the hole blocking capacity. However, pyridine based ETMs show excellent electron mobility and better hole blocking properties.
4. The HTMs used in PSCs possess high cost and low thermal stability due to the use of hygroscopic dopants i.e. (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), tert-butyl pyridine (TBP), and [tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III)] tris(bis(tri-fluoromethylsulfonyl)imide). Therefore, the introduction of pyridine in the development of HTMs can avoid the use of external dopant due to the ability of pyridine lone pair to make the Lewis acid-base adducts with the Pb of CH3NH3PbI3 in the PSC device.
5. The incorporation of pyridine in HTMs provides a new strategy to develop dopant free small organic derivatives with high external quantum efficiency and better thermal stability for PSCs.
6. The electron-withdrawing nature of pyridine lowers the HOMO level of the respective derivatives and enhances the open-circuit voltage of perovskite solar cells.
7. The efficiency and steady state performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) can be improved via using 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) as an additive in triarylamine-based organic hole-transporting materials (HTMs). However, the long term stability and device performance of PSCs is significantly impacted due to the low boiling point of tBP (196 °C).
8. We speculate that the Lewis acid-base adduct (LABA) formation of pyridine in the HTM and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF) interacted with methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), resulting in the MAPbI3/HTM interface which becomes more selective for holes. This also enhanced the film uniformity and afforded a smoother morphology with improved hydrophobicity that further increased the long-term durability.
This review provides an outlook on the importance of pyridine based charge carriers, their photophysical, electrochemical, thermal and photovoltaic properties of the OLEDs and PSCs. The structure property relationship gives a better strategy to design and synthesize pyridine derivatives with improved charge mobility and better device performance for the future research.
