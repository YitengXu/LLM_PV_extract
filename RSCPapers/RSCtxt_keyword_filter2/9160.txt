    , Accepted 21st October 2019First published on 24th October 2019AbstractThe side-chain conjugation strategy is adopted in the synthesis of heptacyclic non-fullerene electron acceptors, ITIC2, ITIC-S, and ITIC-SF, for application in organic solar cells (OSCs). The new ITIC-SF molecule features a BDT-SF building block which is the electron-donating component in the widely used donor PBDB-T-SF. Compared with ITIC-S without fluorine substituents, fluorination weakens the crystallinity of ITIC-SF, while the intermolecular interaction between the PBDB-T-SF donor and ITIC-SF acceptor, containing the same BDT-SF building block, results in the increased crystallinity of the corresponding blend films. The OSC based on PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-SF exhibits a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.1%, higher than the PCE of 10.1% for the device based on PBDB-T-SF:ITIC2 and the PCE of 11.6% for the device based on PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-S. The better photovoltaic performance of the OSC based on PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-SF is benefitted from the weaker bimolecular recombination and more efficient charge transfer and extraction of the device. The structure–property relationship of the non-fullerene acceptors revealed in this work will play an important role in instructing the molecular structure design of high performance photovoltaic materials for the development of OSCs.
Introduction
Non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have overturned the predominant position of fullerene acceptors and have become a hotspot in the research area of bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs).1–17 In comparison with fullerene derivative acceptors,18,19 NFAs have high absorption coefficients and can be easily tailored to match different donors in terms of complementary absorption and electronic energy level matching.20–25 In addition, facile synthesis and simplified purification of NFAs effectively cut down the cost of OSCs.26–32 Recent developments in NFAs have significantly boosted the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs to ∼16%,33–35 which encourages OSC commercial future.
NFAs with a fused ring, denoted as ITIC12 and Y6,13 typically comprise an electron-donating planar fused-ring core, side chains, and electron-pulling terminal groups, all of which can be flexibly modified to improve the photovoltaic performance.36 Side chains, typically, exert a minor effect on the optoelectronic properties, while they have notably influenced intermolecular interactions, between adjacent acceptor molecules and between the donor molecules and acceptor molecules,37 whereby side chains can tailor solubility, crystallinity, electron mobility and the donor:acceptor nanoscale morphology.38–44
Polymeric donors with conjugated side chains45,46 usually excel the 1D conjugated counterpart, as the side chain conjugation can extend intramolecular conjugation and facilitate intermolecular interaction and π–π overlap. This strategy also shows the potential in designing high-efficiency NFAs.47 Moreover, introducing thiol and alkyl side chains into an organic conjugated molecule skeleton can influence effectively orbital energy levels including HOMO energy levels for polymer donors and LUMO energy levels for small molecular acceptors.48–50Voc is proportional to the difference between the LUMO of the acceptor (LUMOA) and the HOMO of the donor (HOMOD), ΔE (LUMOA − HOMOD). A decreased HOMO offset (ΔEHOMO(D−A)) benefits enlarging ΔE (LUMOA − HOMOD) and, thereby, results in the improvement of Voc and mitigation of energy loss for OSCs, improving effectively charge separation and increasing the efficiency of OSCs.21,51 In our previous work, along with a polymeric donor PBDB-T-SF (Scheme S1 in the ESI†), we reported that ITIC-S with a thioether bond demonstrated a PCE of 11.6% with a fill factor (FF) of 66.8%, exceeding those of the corresponding acceptor ITIC2 with alkyl side chains (PCE = 10.1% with FF = 59.7%).38,52 In addition, fluorination as a simple and effective molecular modification strategy and fluorinated organic conjugated molecules have shown several outstanding advantages: (1) fluorination can down-shift simultaneously the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels and it doesn't cause strong steric hindrance of molecules conjugated skeletons;53,54 (2) in fluorinated molecules, inter/intramolecular interactions were enhanced effectively through the noncovalent interactions of F⋯H and S⋯F, which increase their crystallinity and hence improve greatly charge transport, which eventually improves the PCE of OSCs.55 For example, the Hou group reported that the combination of a fluorinated and thiol–thienyl polymer donor (PBDB-T-SF) and a small molecule acceptor (IT-4F) obtained a record high efficiency of 13.1%, due to the better miscibility of blends via F⋯H and S⋯F interactions.56 Likewise, Li and coworkers reported that OSCs, based on a polymer donor PM6 containing a fluorinated thienyl benzodithiophene unit and IT-4F, yielded an impressive PCE of 13.5% due to the synergistic effect of fluorination on both the donor and acceptor;57 (3) for fluorinated molecules, relatively high polarization and a decreased coulombic potential were demonstrated between holes and electrons.58 In addition, fluorinated organic molecules sometimes displayed higher absorption coefficients than their nonfluorinated counterparts.59 Importantly, the strategy of side-chain engineering using alkyl, thiol, fluorinated and thiol–thienyl groups offers a simple molecular design for high-performance OSCs. Herein, we designed and synthesized a new 2D conjugated heptacyclic acceptor, ITIC-SF, by fluorinating the thiophene ring in the benzodithiophene segment of ITIC-S. The new ITIC-SF molecule featured a BDT-SF building block, which was the electron-donating component in the widely used donor PBDB-T-SF. The fluorine atom in the thienyl side chains led to the weaker crystallinity of ITIC-SF than ITIC-S, while the intermolecular interaction of the PBDB-T-SF donor and ITIC-SF acceptor, containing the same conjugated building block (BDT-SF), resulted in the enhanced crystallinity of PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-SF blend films in comparison to the blend film of PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-S. The OSCs based PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-SF achieved a higher PCE of 12.10%, with a Voc of 1.05 V, a Jsc of 16.85 mA cm−2 and a FF of 68.60%, which is improved in comparison with the PCEs of 10.10% and 11.60% for the devices based on PBDB-T-SF:ITIC2 and PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-S, respectively.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes to ITIC-SF were depicted in Scheme 2 in the ESI.† ITIC-SF was systematically characterized by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy (see the ESI†). At room temperature, ITIC-SF dissolved well in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene. ITIC-SF exhibited excellent thermal stability, with a decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of 313 °C (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). Fig. S2† shows differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms of the three small molecule acceptors, and the melting point (Tm) of ITIC2, ITIC-S and ITIC-SF was not observed during endothermic processes. The semicrystallinity of the three acceptors was observed obviously during the exothermic process (Scheme 2).

Fig. 1a and b show the normalized optical absorption spectra of the polymer donor PBDB-T-SF and acceptors ITIC2, ITIC-S and ITIC-SF in chloroform solution and thin films, respectively. The polymer donor PBDB-T-SF displayed three absorption peaks with π–π* transition of the donor unit, internal charge transfer (ICT) and the π–π overlap peak in solution and films. The absorption profile of the acceptors ITIC2, ITIC-S and ITIC-SF in films showed four peaks at 343/341/342, 492/489/482, 669/663/652 and 738/736/718 nm due to the π–π* transition of the donor unit, π–π* transition of the end group acceptor unit, intramolecular charge–transfer transition (ICT) peak and π–π overlap peak from the central BDT core to the terminal acceptor units, respectively. And in solution, ITIC-SF showed an absorption maximum at 694 nm, a shorter wavelength than that of ITIC2 (716 nm) and ITIC-S (708 nm). The absorption maxima of ITIC2, ITIC-S and ITIC-SF pure films were at 738, 736 and 718 nm, respectively, red-shifted by 24, 28 and 24 nm respectively compared with those in solution, indicating self-aggregation in the solid state of these acceptors. Calculated from the absorption edge of pure films, ITIC-SF displayed a wider optical bandgap (Eg) of 1.58 eV than ITIC2 (1.53 eV) and ITIC-SF (1.55 eV) (Table 1).

The electronic energy levels of ITIC2, ITIC-S and ITIC-SF were measured by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S3 in the ESI†). The onset oxidation and reduction potentials were measured to estimate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (Table 1).60 The HOMOs were downshifted from −5.48 eV (ITIC2) to −5.50 eV (ITIC-S), and then to −5.57 eV (ITIC-SF). The corresponding LUMOs also gradually downshifted from −3.88 eV (ITIC2) to −3.91 eV (ITIC-S) and −3.94 eV (ITIC-SF). Obviously, the alkylthio and fluorine substitution downshifted the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of ITIC-SF.61
Photovoltaic properties
The polymeric donor PBDB-T-SF with a wide Eg of 1.80 eV was used in fabricating OSCs for investigating the photovoltaic performance of the small molecule acceptors, as it matches with these narrow-bandgap heptacyclic acceptors in terms of light absorption and energy levels. Fig. 2a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized OSCs, and Table 2 summarizes the open circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE of the corresponding devices. Note that all these devices obtained a Voc of >1 V. As reported previously, the OSC based on PBDB-T-SF:ITIC2 gave a PCE of 10.1% and the device based on PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-S displayed a PCE value of 11.6% with a Jsc of 16.43 mA cm−2 and a FF of 66.8%. Importantly, the PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-SF-based device afforded a champion PCE of 12.1%, with the highest Jsc of 16.85 mA cm−2 and the highest FF of 68.6%, which are superior to those of the OSCs based on PBDB-T-SF:ITIC2 and PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-S.

These optimized devices exhibited a broad photoresponse from 300 to 850 nm (Fig. 2b). PBDB-T-SF mainly harvested photons with wavelengths from 300 to 650 nm, while the acceptors contributed to the photo-response of 650–850 nm. The PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-SF-based device displayed an external quantum efficiency (EQE) maximum of 74.2%, much higher than that of the devices based on PBDB-T-SF:ITIC2 (62.7%) and PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-S (65.9%). The Jsc of ITIC2, ITIC-S and ITIC-SF based OSCs integrated from EQE spectra was 15.49, 16.27 and 16.72 mA cm−2, respectively, in good agreement with the Jsc values directly measured from the J–V curves. The error was less than 2%, demonstrating the reliability of the J–V curve measurements (Table 2).
To investigate the charge generation and extraction properties, we plotted the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. 2c).62Jph is defined as Jph = JL–JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 and in the dark respectively. And Veff = V0 − Vappl, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph = 0, and Vappl is the applied bias voltage. At a high Veff, the photocurrent is fully saturated, being independent of temperature and voltage, as photogenerated excitons can be fully dissociated into free charge carriers, and then all the carries can be extracted by electrodes. The Jsat of the ITIC2, ITIC-S and ITIC-SF based devices was 17.56, 17.51 and 17.83 mA cm−2, respectively, which demonstrated that these blends had a similar number of absorbed incident photons under the illumination of AM 1.5G. The exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss = Jph/Jsat) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll = Jsc/Jsat, where Jsc is the compensation electric current under the maximum power output) were calculated under short-circuit and maximum power output conditions, respectively. The PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-SF based device exhibited an ηdiss of 94.5% and an ηcoll of 79.4%, higher than those of the devices based on PBDB-T-SF:ITIC2 (ηdiss of 89.1% and ηcoll of 67.9%) and PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-S (ηdiss of 93.8% and ηcoll of 76.9%), indicating more efficient charge transfer and charge extraction in the PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-SF based devices.
Charge recombination was explored by measuring Jsc with various incident light intensities (Plight) (Fig. 2d).63 The relationship between Jsc and Plight follows the formula Jsc ∝ PS. S = 1 represented the ideal state where all free carriers are swept out and collected at the electrodes prior to recombination, while S < 1 indicated the existence of bimolecular recombination. The closer the S value to 1, the weaker the bimolecular recombination. The S value increased from 0.87 for the PBDB-T-SF:ITIC2 OSC to 0.93 for the PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-S OSC and 0.96 for the PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-SF OSC. The weakest bimolecular recombination in the device based on PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-SF was in accord with its most efficient charge extraction and highest FF of 68.6%.
The electron mobilities of acceptor pristine films, as well as the electron mobilities and the hole mobilities of the PBDB-T-SF:acceptor blend films were measured by the space charge limited current method. The ITIC-SF pure film exhibited an electron mobility (μe) of 5.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, lower than that of ITIC2 (6.41 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and ITIC-S (6.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) (Fig. S4 in the ESI†). For blend films, the hole mobilities of PBDB-T-SF:ITIC2, PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-S, and PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-SF were 7.81 × 10−4, 7.51 × 10−4 and 6.35 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The corresponding electron mobilities are 4.17 × 10−4, 4.41 × 10−4 and 3.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S5a and b in the ESI†). The PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-SF blend demonstrated the best balance between hole and electron mobilities, presumably contributing to its high FF.
Morphological studies
The morphology of the PBDB-T-SF:acceptor blend films was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). Fig. S6a–f in the ESI† show AFM height images and phase images, which displayed that all these PBDB-T-SF:acceptor blend films had a clearly and uniformly distributed nanofiber morphology across the surface. The root-mean-square roughness (Rq) values of the blend film surfaces of PBDB-T-SF:ITIC2, PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-S, and PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-SF were 1.03, 1.12 and 1.18 nm, respectively, illustrative of their smooth surfaces.
GIWAXS was utilized to study molecular packing and orientation in films.64,65 Fig. S7, S8 and Table S1† show the 2D GIWAXS patterns of PBDB-T-SF, ITIC2, ITIC-S and ITIC-SF neat films. The ITIC2 neat film exhibited a π–π peak at qz ≈ 1.57 Å−1 (d = 4.00 Å), while the ITIC-S neat film displayed a π–π peak at a smaller qz ≈ 1.53 Å−1 (d = 4.11 Å), and obviously, ITIC2 and ITIC-S showed similar π–π stacking diffraction. For the ITIC-SF pure film, the π–π peak was barely observed. And the ITIC-SF film also had the weakest lamellar peaks among the pure films of all the acceptors. This observation indicated that the thioether bond and fluorine atom disrupted the acceptors' π–π stacking together. Fig. 3 presents the two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns of PBDB-T-SF:ITIC2, PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-S and PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-SF blend films and the corresponding profiles along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. The PBDB-T-SF:ITIC2 blend film exhibited bimodal lamellar peaks at qr ≈ 0.28 Å−1 and qz ≈ 0.28 Å−1 (d ≈ 22.40 Å) and the π–π peak at qz ≈ 1.69 Å−1 (d ≈ 3.70 Å). Likewise, the PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-S blend film exhibited bimodal lamellar peaks at qr ≈ 0.28 Å−1 and qz ≈ 0.29 Å−1 (d ≈ 22.40 Å and d ≈ 21.70 Å) and the π–π peak at qz ≈ 1.69 Å−1 (d ≈ 3.70 Å). The PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-SF blend film exhibited lamellar peaks at qr ≈ 0.28 Å−1 and qz ≈ 0.30 Å−1 (d ≈ 22.4 Å and d ≈ 20.90 Å) and the π–π peak at qz ≈ 1.73 Å−1 (d ≈ 3.60 Å). Note that the crystalline coherent length (CCL) of the π–π peak first decreased from 17.90 Å for PBDB-T-SF:ITIC2 to 13.90 Å for PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-S and then increased to 17.50 Å for PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-SF. The weaker crystallinity of PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-S than PBDB-T-SF:ITIC2 can be well explained by the weaker crystallinity of PBDB-T-SF with the thioether bond. However, although ITIC-SF exhibited the weakest crystallinity in the pure films, as verified by the negligible π–π peak, the intermolecular interaction of PBDB-T-SF and ITIC-SF, induced by the same building block (BDT-SF), resulted in the increased crystallinity of PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-SF blend films compared to that of PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-S.

Conclusions
In this work, we utilized the BDT-SF building block of PBDB-T-SF to design a new heptacyclic core and synthesized an NFA of ITIC-SF. Fluorination of the thiophene side chain weakened the crystallinity of the ITIC-SF pure film, while the intermolecular interaction of PBDB-T-SF and ITIC-SF, induced by the shared BDT-SF building block, resulted in the increased crystallinity of PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-SF blend films compared to their counterparts. Besides, the OSCs based on PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-SF exhibited weaker bimolecular recombination and more efficient charge transfer and extraction. Therefore, the PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-SF device demonstrated a champion PCE of 12.1%, better than that of the devices based on PBDB-T-SF:ITIC2 and PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-S. These results afforded some insight into the structure–property relationship of the non-fullerene acceptors, which will play an important role in instructing the design of high performance photovoltaic materials for the development of OSCs.
