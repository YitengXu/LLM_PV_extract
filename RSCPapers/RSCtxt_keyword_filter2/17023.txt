    , Accepted 25th February 2016First published on 26th February 2016AbstractIt is shown that coating graphene–silicon (Gr/Si) Schottky junction based solar cells with graphene oxide (GO) improves the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the cells, while demonstrating unprecedented device stability. The PCE has been shown to be increased to 10.6% (at incident radiation of 100 mW cm−2) for the Gr/Si solar cell with an optimal GO coating thickness compared to 3.6% for a bare/uncoated Gr/Si solar cell. The p-doping of graphene by the GO, which also serves as an antireflection coating (ARC) has been shown to be a main contributing factor to the enhanced PCE. A simple spin coating process has been used to apply GO with thickness commensurate with an anti-refection coating (ARC) and indicates the suitability of the developed methodology for large-scale solar cell assembly.
Introduction
Graphene has been one of the most intensively researched materials, over the past decade,1 for various applications incorporating batteries,2 super capacitors,3 transistors,4 photo detectors,5 sensors etc.6,7 The unique characteristics of graphene, incorporating high transparency (97.7% for single layer graphene), in addition to high electrical conductivity (106 S cm−1), and mechanical flexibility have suggested the use of graphene as a transparent electrode for solar cells.8,9 Indeed, the first graphene/silicon (Gr/Si) Schottky junction based solar cell with an efficiency of 1.5% was demonstrated five years ago.10 Various methods have since been proposed to further increase the efficiency of Gr/Si solar cells through acid doping,11 reducing the sheet resistance of graphene,12,13 and texturing the underlying silicon surface for efficient light harvesting.14,15 However, the stability of the Gr/Si devices, while maintaining high efficiency, is still a major issue, e.g., due to the observed loss of acidic doping as well as the oxidation of the underlying silicon. Moreover, the existing methods aimed at improving efficiency involve multiple steps involving surface passivation, doping of graphene, and applying an anti-reflection coating (ARC) layer, often through diverse layers.13,16
Considering that the stability of the solar cell devices was a major issue, we initially sought to tackle this specific problem by using an oxidation barrier facilitated through a graphene oxide (GO) coating. GO was particularly chosen due to its stability in ambient air,17 and high transmittance in the electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from the ultra-violet to the near-infra-red regimes.18 We have also found, subsequently, that GO can function both for doping graphene and through the use of suitable thickness, as an ARC layer. As will be shown later, GO coating yields superior performance and enhanced environmental stability for Gr/Si solar cells. For instance, a three-fold enhancement in the efficiency along with device stability over a 20 day period, which seems to be among the most durable reported thus far for Gr/Si solar cells, has been observed.
Experimental
The Gr/Si solar cells, the schematic of which is illustrated in Fig. 1(a) along with the actual device as displayed in Fig. 1(b), were fabricated through well known lithographic processes. Briefly, an n-type Si (resistivity: 0.5 Ω cm–1 Ω cm) wafer was covered with a 350 nm silicon oxide (SiO2) layer deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). A 9 mm2 (3 mm × 3 mm) window was defined by photolithography and a buffered oxide etch (BOE: with NH4F/HF in a 6:1 ratio) was employed to remove the top SiO2 layer. Subsequently, gold/titanium (Au/Ti) and aluminum (Al) were sputtered to provide Ohmic contacts on the front and back-side, respectively. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) based mono-layer graphene (MLG, obtained from ACS Materials) was placed on the Si substrate using a wet transfer method.19 Graphene oxide (GO), synthesized using a modified Hummer's method, was dispersed in deionized water with a concentration of 1 mg mL−1.20 Well-dispersed, highly stable GO solution was spin coated on a Gr/Si solar cell for a uniform film, which was confirmed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis (see the ESI for more detail: Experimental methods and Fig. S1†).

Results and discussion
Current density (J)–voltage (V) measurements were carried out through illumination (using AM1.5 standard @100 mW cm−2) for bare and GO coated devices: Fig. 2(a). The open circuit voltage (Voc), the short-circuit current density (Jsc), and the fill-factor (FF) of the bare Gr/Si solar cell were measured to be 0.440 V, 27.2 mA cm−2, and 29%, respectively, resulting in a PCE of 3.6% (black line). After the GO coating, the Voc, Jsc, and FF of the sample (red line) increased to 0.512 V, 38.4 mA cm−2, and 53%, respectively, boosting the PCE to 10.6%, – a factor of three higher than that of the bare Gr/Si solar cell (see also ESI, Fig. S2†). External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) measurements, as indicated in Fig. 2(d), show a comparison of bare Gr/Si solar cells with the GO coated Gr/Si solar cells. For the wavelength in the range of 400 nm–900 nm the EQE of the bare Gr/Si solar cell was around 70%, comparable to the state-of-the-art.11,21 However, the EQE of GO coated solar cells was increased to ∼90%, with a corresponding enhancement of the Jsc to ∼37 mA cm−2 (from ∼29 mA cm−2 for the Gr/Si basis). Through the analysis of such results, we propose that the beneficial effect of GO arises from two reasons: (i) the doping of Gr by a GO coating, which increases the work function of graphene (Wg), and improves the conductivity, and (ii) the functioning of the GO as an anti-reflection coating (ARC) layer.

The blue and green lines represent the characteristics of bare Gr/Si and GO coated Gr/Si solar cells without illumination, respectively. (b) J–V plots of bare Gr/Si solar cells compared with GO coated Gr/Si solar cells. The inset indicates the lnJ vs. V curve for calculation of ΦB. (c) dV/d(lnJ) vs. J plots were used to determine the series resistance (Rs) and diode ideality factor (n). (d) External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) measurements on bare and GO coated Gr/Si solar cells, in the wavelength range of 400 nm–900 nm. A larger EQE was obtained through the GO coating, due to enhanced short-circuit current density (Jsc). 
We first consider the rationale for doping of Gr by GO. To extract the Schottky barrier height (ΦB), series resistance (Rs), and diode ideality factor (n), J–V measurements were carried out in a dark room (Fig. 3b). From the slope of lnJ vs. V curve (Fig. 2(b), inset figure), the ΦB of Gr/Si and GO/Gr/Si cells was estimated through a diode equation of the form:22 (1)where Js is the saturation current density, q is the elementary electronic charge, n is the ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and A* is the Richardson constant (112 A cm−2 K−2 for n-Si). The ΦB of the Gr/Si and GO/Gr/Si samples were estimated to be 0.791 eV and 0.868 eV, respectively. A 77 meV increase of ΦB is in accordance with the experimentally observed 72 mV increase in the Voc, indicating a possible influence of the GO coating on the Wg. Additionally, from the dark J–V curve analysis, the Rs was seen to be lowered by ∼50% to 9.5 Ω for the GO layer coated Gr/Si cells (compared to 17.3 Ω for the bare Gr/Si cells), contributing to the FF increase: Fig. 2(c). From eqn (1), we deduce:22 (2)

The work function of the graphene (Wg), the electron affinity of n-Si (χSi), the Schottky barrier height (ΦB), and the built-in potential (Vbi) are indicated. (b) The energy level diagram after GO coating the Gr/n-Si Schottky junction based solar cell. It is hypothesized that p-doping through the GO further increases the Wg, with an enhancement of the ΦB and the Vbi and the photon to electrical carrier conversion efficiency and the fill factor. 
Here, RsAeff is the slope (with Rs as the diode series resistance and Aeff being the effective diode area), β is q/kT, and n/β is the intercept related to the diode ideality factor, n. While an ideal diode, would have n = 1, it was seen that the n improved11,23 for the GO coated cells to ∼1.42 (compared to ∼1.65 for the bare Gr/Si cells). It was also interesting to note that the J–V characteristics seem to be altered in a manner similar to that reported16 for nitric acid (HNO3) based doping of Gr (see also ESI, Fig. S3†). Through experimentation, we have confirmed that such acid treatment indeed increased the Voc and FF from 0.442 to 0.510 V and 29% to 52%, respectively, resulting in an increased PCE from 3.6% to 7.6%, similar to that observed through the GO coating. However, the Jsc was not enhanced. Generally, in a Schottky junction based diode, the difference between the Wg and the electron affinity of n-Si (χSi) causes a built-in potential (Vbi) and a concomitant electric field to separate electron–hole pairs generated in Si on photon absorption: Fig. 3(a). A schematic of the hypothesized energy band diagram of the Gr/Si solar cell, upon doping the Gr, say through GO, is indicated in Fig. 3(b). Note that p-doping through GO further increases the Wg of graphene, with an enhancement of the ΦB and the Vbi and the photon to electrical carrier conversion efficiency. Moreover, the increased number of holes in the Gr, due to p-doping, would also reduce the sheet resistance of Gr and contribute to a greater FF.
The possible doping of Gr by a GO coating was also verified through Raman spectroscopy. As indicated in Fig. 4(a), the D- (1352 cm−1), G- (1598 cm−1), 2D- (2702 cm−1), and 3S- (2917 cm−1) peaks are representative of the synthesized GO/oxidized graphite. The D- to G-peak intensity ratio ID/IG is around 0.92, consistent with previously reported values.24,25 The doping of Gr is indicated through a peak shift as well as through a change in the peak width. Indeed, blue shifts of both the G and the 2D peaks of Gr indicate p-doping whereas a red shift of the 2D peak is an indication of n-doping.26 Here, the Raman spectra of: (i) Gr on the SiO2 substrate alone, and (ii) Gr coated on the GO/SiO2 substrate, was considered. From (ii), subtracting the Raman spectra of GO/SiO2 from Gr/GO/SiO2, the Raman peaks of the doped Gr (due to the GO coating) were obtained. The blue shift of both G and 2D peaks of the doped Gr, compared to the pristine/bare Gr indicates p-doping of Gr, through the GO coating.

A blue shift (24 cm−1) of the 2D peak of GO coated Gr (2709 cm−1) compared to the position of the peak in the bare Gr (2685 cm−1) indicates enhanced p-doping in the former. (c) The optical reflectance of bare silicon (black), GO coated silicon (blue), and GO coated Gr/Si sample (red). It is feasible that the GO coating reduces the loss of light from the silicon, resulting in better light harvesting. (d) Ellipsometry measurements of refractive index (of the order of 2, the geometric mean of the refractive indices of the air and the underlying silicon) as a function of the GO coating layer thickness. The GO thickness is concomitant with that of an ideal anti-reflection coating (ARC) layer. 
As seen in Fig. 4(b), a considerable blue shift (24 cm−1) of the 2D peak of the GO coated Gr (2709 cm−1) as compared to the position of the peak in the bare Gr (2685 cm−1) indicates enhanced p-doping in the former.27,28 The G peak of the GO coated Gr overlaps the G-peak of GO, hence no significant blue shift has been observed for the G peak: Fig. 4(b).
We next examined the rationale for the use29,30 of GO as an ARC, which was hypothesized as further contributing to the PCE of the Gr/Si solar cells. If the GO coating thickness (do) was of the order of λ/4nGO, where λ is the free space wavelength and nGO (the refractive index of the GO coating) is the geometric mean of the refractive indices of silicon and air, it would constitute an ideal ARC layer,31,32 and yield high light to electrical power conversion efficiency. To evaluate the possibility of GO functioning as an ARC, reflectance measurements were carried out on the GO/Gr/Si cells (using a Lambda 1050 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer). Fig. 4(c) shows the reflectance measurements (in diffuse and specular configurations) of bare Si, GO coated Si, and GO coated Gr/Si samples. For calibration, the bare Si sample has a reflectance around 35% at λ = 600 nm (black line), consistent with the literature.33 After coating with a GO layer (blue line), the reflectance was reduced to 15% at the same wavelength. It is feasible that the GO coating reduces the loss of light from the silicon, resulting in better light harvesting which creates more electron–hole pairs and consistent with the increase in Jsc. For the GO/Gr/Si solar cell (red line), the reflectance was further reduced to 12%, consistent with the expected absorption in Gr.18 The lowest reflectance of the GO coated Si (14.5%) and GO coated Gr/Si (11.5%) has been observed around 700 nm and 750 nm, respectively (Fig. S4†). The ARC layer thickness at these wavelengths would correspond to ∼88 nm and ∼94 nm, respectively. The thickness values, concomitant with the refractive index variation, where nGO was of the order of 2, were further confirmed through ellipsometry measurements: as shown in Fig. 4(d). Moreover, the highest EQE (93%), e.g., see Fig. 2(d), which was observed around 785 nm, seems to correspond well with the lowest reflectance value brought about by the ARC characteristics of the GO layer (also see the ESI for specular reflectance: Fig. S4†). However, the GO layer was not very smooth and may be wrinkled, as seen in Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) imaging (see ESI, Fig. S4†). Consequently the ARC effect of the spin coated GO could be improved upon in future work. It is also plausible that the rough surfaces may contribute to internal reflections, which may trap light and contribute to variations in the reflectance.
It is notable that the ARC effect of GO persists over a relatively large wavelength range (from 300 nm–1000 nm). Such a broadband response may arise due to the flake-like structure of GO mimicking a broad range of roughness (as seen in Fig. S4†) in addition to the wide stoichiometry that may be present in the GO. Additionally, the refractive index of GO would be expected to change with the porosity of the coating layer, which would be a function of the thickness: Fig. 4(d).34 The influence of porosity of GO on the optical response would be a promising topic of investigation,32 with relevance to its influence on the ARC efficiency. It was also noted that thermal exposure/annealing of GO seems to reduce the oxygen content, affecting the work-function and reducing the efficiency (see ESI, Fig. S5†).
As the original hypothesis, related to the use of GO, was to enhance the stability of the Gr/Si solar cells, the devices (without encapsulation) were placed in ambient air and tested over multiple days to examine the stability: Fig. 5. As a basis, it was noted that the uncoated Gr/Si solar cells exhibit an ∼40% decrease of the PCE after ∼10 days (ESI, Fig. S6†), presumably due to silicon oxide formation at the graphene–silicon interface. Such a degradation mechanism is based on an observed s-shaped kink in J–V curves, which was previously attributed to the oxide formation,35 due to exposure of the Si through defects in the overlaid Gr, and which considerably reduces the FF. Alternately, GO coated Gr/Si solar cells were much more stable, showing negligible (∼1%) decrease in the PCE as well as the other attributes (Voc and Jsc). Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the corresponding J–V characteristics and the variability of the performance and efficiency parameters (such as the Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE), respectively, during a 20-day testing period. It was also observed that the FF was reduced at most by ∼2% (Fig. 5b). Generally, a more uniform GO coating17 would be expected to further enhance the corrosion resistance of the Gr/Si solar cells, through reducing the Si exposure to ambient air.

Conclusions
In summary, we have reported that a single layer Gr/Si solar cell efficiency of 10.6% can be obtained through a simple and cost effective GO spin coating. While the original intent of using GO was to enhance the stability of the Gr/Si solar cell through reducing the propensity of oxidation of the underlying Si, we have seen significant additional benefits. For instance, GO has also shown to p-dope the Gr/Si solar cell, contributing to a reduced sheet resistance. Additionally, we have shown, for the first time, that an optimal thickness of GO could function as an ARC layer for the solar cell, further increasing the Jsc and the EQE. The stability of the GO coated solar cell seems to be unprecedented from a comparison with the literature.13,16,36 Future work would focus on further increasing the overall efficiency and the FF, and investigating means to further reduce the sheet resistance of graphene.

(c) dV/d(lnJ) vs. J plots were used to determine the series resistance (Rs) and diode ideality factor (n). (d) External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) measurements on bare and GO coated Gr/Si solar cells, in the wavelength range of 400 nm–900 nm. A larger EQE was obtained through the GO coating, due to enhanced short-circuit current density (Jsc).

 	Fig. 3  The influence of GO as a dopant for graphene. (a) A schematic energy level diagram of an uncoated Gr/n-Si Schottky junction based solar cell. The work function of the graphene (Wg), the electron affinity of n-Si (χSi), the Schottky barrier height (ΦB), and the built-in potential (Vbi) are indicated. (b) The energy level diagram after GO coating the Gr/n-Si Schottky junction based solar cell. It is hypothesized that p-doping through the GO further increases the Wg, with an enhancement of the ΦB and the Vbi and the photon to electrical carrier conversion efficiency and the fill factor.	 

 	Fig. 4  Raman and optical spectroscopy characterization of the GO and graphene. Raman spectra of the (a) as-synthesized graphene oxide (GO), The inset indicates the blue shift of the G and 2D peaks of the graphene due to the p-doping effect of GO, and (b) GO coated graphene (red), and pristine graphene (black). A blue shift (24 cm−1) of the 2D peak of GO coated Gr (2709 cm−1) compared to the position of the peak in the bare Gr (2685 cm−1) indicates enhanced p-doping in the former. (c) The optical reflectance of bare silicon (black), GO coated silicon (blue), and GO coated Gr/Si sample (red). It is feasible that the GO coating reduces the loss of light from the silicon, resulting in better light harvesting. (d) Ellipsometry measurements of refractive index (of the order of 2, the geometric mean of the refractive indices of the air and the underlying silicon) as a function of the GO coating layer thickness. The GO thickness is concomitant with that of an ideal anti-reflection coating (ARC) layer.	 

 	Fig. 5  Enhanced stability of the Gr/Si device due to the GO coating. (a) J–V curves of the GO coated Gr/Si solar cell over a twenty-day testing. (b) A very small variability (<1%) of the performance and efficiency parameters (such as the Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE) was observed during testing.
