, Accepted 16th July 2013First published on 19th July 2013AbstractNovel triphenylamine (TPA)-based organic dyes were synthesized and assessed for their performance in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In the dyes considered the TPA group and the cyanoacetic acid have the role of electron-donor and -acceptor, respectively, whereas a thienyl–fluoro-phenyl-substituted was introduced as π-linker to improve the dye performance in DSSCs. Experimental characterizations empasize that the presence of electron withdrawing substituents in the linker close to the electron-acceptor moiety leads to a more efficient intramolecular photoinduced charge transfer. In fact, photovoltaic experiments reveal that the DSSCs based on the thienyl–o-fluoro-phenyl substituted dyes yield a better solar-energy-to-electricity conversion efficiency.
Introduction
The increasing demand for power supply as well as the environmental concern for the consumption of fossil fuel have triggered global research towards the exploitation of clean and renewable energy sources.1 In this context, solar energy has emerged naturally as a key option. Therefore, in recent years much effort has been dedicated to the development of efficient solar cells. In particular, recently, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been increasingly proposed as a valuable alternative to conventional silicon-based devices, especially due to their lower cost and simpler fabrication. However, to date, the efficiency of DSSCs is still lower than those of the best performing silicon-based devices. Thus, intensive research is currently performed in order to increase the photoconversion efficiency in DSSCs.
A typical DSSC consists of a dyed semiconductor TiO2 photoanode, a Pt counter electrode and a redox electrolyte.2 The photosensitizer plays a crucial role in these devices and it is fundamental for the cell's performance and stability. It absorbs visible light and injects electrons into the conduction band of the TiO2 after solar light excitation generating the photocurrent via a redox mediator. At present, DSSCs based on Ru(II)–polypyridyl complexes have an overall solar energy conversion efficiency (η) higher than 11% under simulated AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2).3–8 Nevertheless, the use of environmentally friendly metal-free organic dyes able to replace the expensive and source-limited ruthenium dyes, is highly demanded and certainly is a state of the art research topic. Compared with the traditional ruthenium dyes, metal-free organic dyes have many advantages such as low cost, easier structural modification, a higher molar extinction coefficient. The organic dyes commonly consist of a donor (D), a π-linker and an acceptor (A) group. In recent years, several groups have developed DSSCs using metal-free organic sensitizers based on coumarin,9–11 merocyanine,12,13 cyanine,14,15 indoline,16,17 hemicyanine,18–20 triphenylamine,21–30 dialkylaniline,25,31,32 [bis(dimethylfluorenyl)amino]phenyl,33–36 phenothiazine,37 tetrahydroquinoline38,39 and carbazole,40,41 reaching efficiencies ranging between 4 and 8%. These studies indicated that triarylamine and cyanoacetic acid moieties are desirable units for the design of the dyes, being very good electron donor and electron acceptor/anchoring groups, respectively. On the other hand, the function of the π-linker is twofold, acting both as a part of the light absorbing chromophore and as a transport channel in the charge-transfer process. Different studies focused on conjugate linkers (vinyl, phenyl, thienylphenyl), that can fulfill the above mentioned requirements. One efficient solution was thus identified in the use of an alkyne group, which favors the π-conjugation extension, together with a thienyl–phenyl moiety, which enhances the electron separation.30,42,43
Other works reported on the fluorine substitution of the π-system,44–46 in order to make use of the high electronegativity of this element, favoring the extension of π-conjugation between the donor and the acceptor and promoting charge separation. This approach has also the advantage that fluorinated dyes display a higher hydrophobicity, originating a large shielding which minimizes the direct contact between the electrolyte and the anode. Thus, water-induced desorption of the dye from the TiO2 surface is strongly reduced. In the spacer structure the insertion of a fluorine in the ortho-position to the cyanoacetic acid enhances DSSC's quantum efficiency.44–46 This improvement is mainly due to the introduction of the additional electron-withdrawing group that favors the charge separation and the extension of the conjugation from the TPA donor to the acceptor. Furthermore, the corresponding non-fluorinated and meta-fluorinated dyes were already tested, demonstrating a certain ability to produce a photocurrent with a solar to electric power conversion efficiency of about 2–4%.42,43
In this paper we consider these strategies to investigate the effect of a modified π-linker by introducing the ethynyl–phenyl or ethynyl–thienylphenyl groups. Moreover, to improve the charge transfer as well as the DSSC performance a fluorine-powered electron withdrawing group is introduced.
According to Scheme 1, two sets of dyes were synthetized, differing in the presence of a thiophene moiety in the π-linker. For each set of dyes, different fluorine substitution schemes were also considered (fluorine-free, ortho-, and meta-substituted). Thus, the role of different electron-withdrawing groups on the optical, electronic, and photovoltaic properties of the dyes could be fully assessed.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic pathways of the AS series are illustrated in Scheme 1. 2-(Tributylstannyl)thiophene was added to 4-bromo-2-fluorobenzaldehyde or 4-bromo-benzaldehyde adopting the palladium-catalyzed Stille reaction to obtain 2-fluoro-4-thiophen-2-yl-benzaldehyde (1a) and 4-thiophen-2-yl-benzaldehyde (1b) (i). 2-Bromothiophene and Pd(PPh3)4 were added to 2-fluoro-4-formylphenylboronic acid, Na2CO3, toluene, ethanol and water to synthesize 3-fluoro-4-thiophen-2-yl-benzaldehyde (1c) (iii). Compound (1a–c) was then reacted with N-bromosuccinimide yielding 4-(5-bromo-thiophen-2-yl)-2-fluoro-benzaldehyde (2a), 4-(5-bromo-thiophen-2-yl)-benzaldehyde (2b) and 4-(5-bromo-thiophen-2-yl)-3-fluoro-benzaldehyde (2c) (ii). Compounds (3) and (4) were synthesized according to our previously reported procedure47 and used as building blocks for the AS series.
In particular, Sonogashira coupling with 4-bromo-2-fluoro-benzaldehyde gave (5) and (6), whereas using 4-bromo-benzaldehyde compound 7 was obtained (7) (iv). The same procedure, using 4-(5-bromo-thiophen-2-yl)-2-fluoro-benzaldehyde (2a) yielded compounds (8) and (9), employing 4-(5-bromo-thiophen-2-yl)-benzaldehyde (2b) gave (10), and using 4-(5-bromo-thiophen-2-yl)-3-fluoro-benzaldehyde (2c) gave compound (11) (iv). Finally, the target molecules (AS1–7) were obtained introducing the cyanoacetic acid group by means of Knoevenagel condensation.
These dyes have been applied successfully to sensitization of nanocrystalline TiO2-based solar cells. The corresponding optical, electronic and photovoltaic characterization are reported in next sections.
Photophysical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the dyes in CHCl3 solution at the concentration of 3 × 10−5 M, are shown in Fig. 1a and b. Absorption and emission data for the dyes are reported in Table 1. All dyes exhibit two major absorption bands in the range 300–360 nm and 400–450 nm. The former is attributed to the π–π* transition and the latter is assigned to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition from the triarylamine donors to the cyanoacetic acid as confirmed by the negative solvatochromic shifts in more polar solvents (see ESI†).

This behavior may be ascribed to the deprotonation of the carboxylic group, which weakens the electron-withdrawing ability of the acceptor.45 At the same time a blue shift is observed in chloroform solution when an organic base (triethylamine) is added (see ESI†).
Comparing AS1 to the analogue fluorine-free Dye2 synthesized by Song et al.,42 it can see that the F-substitution has the effect to red-shift the absorption maximum to 415 nm with an increase of 16 nm. Introduction of the methoxy electron-donating group, with the aim of enhancing the intramolecular charge transfer, leads to a further red shift of 12 nm (AS2, λmax = 427 nm). Finally, the methoxylated and fluorine-free AS3 (λmax = 428 nm) shows a similar maximum as AS2, but a smaller molar absorptivity. Therefore, we can identify the fluorinated AS2 dye as the best candidate for sensitizing the TiO2 photoanode.
For this reason the copresence of both the –OCH3 and –F substituents was always maintained in the second set of dyes (AS4–7), where the π-system was extended with the presence of a thiophene unit. No substantial variation of the absorption maximum was recorded in the AS4–6 series, with λmax about 418 nm for all the dyes about 418 nm. An increase of the molar absorbivity as well as an increasing band broadening is instead observed from AS4 (ε = 24592 M−1 cm−1) to AS6 (ε = 26798 M−1 cm−1), as reported in Table 1. On the other hand when the fluorine substituent is in the meta position (AS7) the absorbance dramatically drops over the whole wavelength interval, showing an improper behaviour of the AS7 dye as DSSC sensitizer.
Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical characterization of the AS1–7 dyes is presented in Fig. 2a and b. Cyclic voltammetry experiments in DMF containing 0.1 M TBABF4 as electrolyte were performed to evaluate the dyes' highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels through the determination of the first oxidation potential (Eox) for each dye, as reported in Table 2. Eox was calculated by averaging the anodic and cathodic peak potentials (Epa and Epc, respectively).48 The presence of the thiophene ring and methoxy groups shows a certain influence on the electrochemical features of the dyes. The introduction of a thiophene ring in AS4, AS5, and AS6 may produce a very slight (but detectable) decrease in Eox compared to their “counterparts” AS1, AS2, and AS3 due to higher conjugation (see Table 2).

Except for the behaviour of AS7, the other dyes present a peak separation close to 59 mV (but generally higher) indicating a quasi-reversible process.49
It is evident, from the figures and the Eox values, that the presence of a particular functional group on the triphenylamine (TPA) donor unit changes drastically the electrochemical properties of AS2, AS3, AS5, and AS6 in comparison to AS1 and AS4. The electron-donating methoxy groups in p-position on TPA are in fact responsible for the decrease of Eox in the former dyes with respect to the latter two50,51 (as it will be discussed in the Theoretical results section).
Moreover, the higher stability of the first radical cation in AS2, AS3, AS5, and AS6 may cause the appearance of a second irreversible oxidation peak around 1.4 V vs. NHE (which is not visible in AS1 and AS4). This may be ascribed to the formation of oxidizable species due to the coupling of the dye’s cations.50
A particular case is represented by AS7 which does not show a clear redox couple ascribed to Eox. Such a result is not surprising as the occurrence of fluorine in meta- instead of ortho-position may cause a significant reduction in terms of electron resonance and charge delocalization (see Theoretical results section).
Finally, it should be pointed out that all the dyes except AS7 present Eox values that are more positive than the potential of the I−/I3− redox mediator (about 0.4 V vs. NHE)52 indicating that the oxidized dye formed after electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band can be reduced by I− ions. Additionally, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (Table 2, calculated as Eox − E0–0) were found to be more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE) according to the electron injection process into the TiO2 conduction band.

All the excitations reported in Table 3 have large oscillator strengths: in particular the series AS4–7 shows an oscillator strength larger than AS1–3, in agreement with experiments (see Table 1). They are also characterized by a single-particle transition from an occupied orbital, mainly localized on the TPA moiety, to a virtual orbital, which is essentially localized on the cyanoacetic acid group (see Fig. 3). For most systems this corresponds to an HOMO to LUMO transition, but in deprotonated AS1 and AS2 in the gas phase, where it corresponds to HOMO−3 → LUMO and HOMO−2 → LUMO transitions, respectively. Therefore, the photoinduced transition has a charge-transfer character which assures the charge separation and localization near the cyanoacetic anchoring group (the localization of the LUMO is greater for the dyes AS4 and AS5; see the isodensity surfaces in Fig. 3). In order to quantify the extent of the charge-transfer character in each excited state we follow the method proposed by Peach et al.53 where the spatial overlap between the occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals involved in the excitation is computed. Because the lowest excited state of these push–pull dyes is essentially described by the HOMO to LUMO transition (see Table S2 in ESI† for instance), here we get an approximate estimation of the degree of charge-transfer (Λ) simply as the spatial overlap between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals. The results of this numerical integration on the DFT grid are reported in Table 3 for all the dyes in the gas phase. Note that smaller values of Λ (i.e. a lower overlap between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals) indicate a greater charge-transfer character (when Λ = 0 an electron is completely transferred).
 Fig. 3  Computed ionization potential (I.P.) and electronic affinity (E.A.) for the dyes AS1–3 (left panel) and AS4–7 (right panel) in DMF solution (note that I.P. and E.A. are sign changed). The experimental I.P. is obtained from Table 2, including the shift due to the NHE electrode. Isodensity surface plots of HOMO (bottom) and LUMO (top) are also reported. 
From the analysis of the data reported in the last column of Table 3 it is clear that the inclusion of methoxy groups is required in order to assure a greater charge separation and localization near the cyanoacetic group. A comparison between AS2 and AS1 reveals an increase of the push–pull effect (ΛAS2 − ΛAS1 = −0.03), which is bigger when comparing the dyes AS5 and AS4 (ΛAS5 − ΛAS4 = −0.06) because of the combined effect of the thiophene and electro-donating methoxy groups. The thiophene group alone, however, is not able to yield charge separation (ΛAS4 − ΛAS1 = 0.00). Furthermore, the use of an o-fluorophenyl-substituted linker yields a greater charge-transfer only if combined with the thiophene group due to the simultaneous effects of an increased π-conjugation and the electron-withdrawing effect of substituents (ΛAS5 − ΛAS6 = −0.01; ΛAS3 − ΛAS2 = 0.00).
These findings agree well with the computed quasiparticle ionization potential (I.P.) and electron affinity (E.A.) reported in Fig. 3. The ionization potentials are also in good agreement with the electrochemical results reported in Table 2 and show that the inclusion of the methoxy and/or thiophene groups produces an increase of the I.P. energy due to the increased π-conjugation. On the other hand, the E.A. is almost constant among the different systems. The quasiparticle gaps of different systems are thus well correlated with the computed TD-DFT excitation energies (see Table 3).
TD-DFT excitation energies are in good agreement also with the experimental data, for the series AS1–6. For AS7, instead, an inconsistency is found in the comparison between TD-DFT and experimental excitation energies because of the blue-shift of the major absorption band of AS7 (see Tables 1 and 3), against any empirical and theoretical expectation. There can be several causes to justify this unexpected behavior. First, exchange-correlation approximations in DFT can underestimate the excitation energy for those systems with high intramolecular photoinduced charge-transfer,54 as in the case of the AS7 dye (ΛAS7 = 0.346). Second, molecular systems with polarized electron densities can lead to more intense interactions with the solvent, that can not be properly described by the COSMO solvation model. Finally, the fluorine atom in the meta-position on the phenyl group can induce a twist around the bond between the m-fluorophenyl and thienyl–phenyl moieties, reducing the extent of the π-conjugation. Actually, DFT tends to underestimate the torsional angle in π-conjugated systems.57 Thus, the torsional angle between the m-fluorophenyl and thienyl–phenyl moieties is predicted to be about 15 degrees using B3LYP but about 20 degrees when using second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). As a consequence, due to the underestimation of the torsional angle, the TD-DFT excitation energy may be underestimated.59
Photovoltaic performance in dye-sensitized solar cells
The performance of the new sensitizers was investigated by constructing test devices. The photovoltaic parameters in terms of short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and the resulting power conversion efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 4. While the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves are plotted in Fig. 4a and b.

 Fig. 4  (a and b) J–V curve of DSSCs prepared with double-layered photoanodes 13 μm thick. 
Using AS1 and AS2 as dyes, the devices showed a short circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of 6.91 and 8.12 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.77 V and a fill factor of 0.75 and 0.74, respectively, resulting in an efficiency of 4.00% and 4.59%.
As expected, the performance of the AS4 and AS5-based devices are considerably better, especially in terms of Jsc. Dyes AS4 and AS5 gave a photocurrent density of 9.01 and 10.65 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.75 and 0.76 V and a fill factor of 0.76 and 0.72, respectively, achieving an efficiency of 5.14% and 5.81%. These results indicate that the short circuit photocurrent increases significantly with the extension of the π-spacer as well as with the introduction of the methoxy group on the TPA moiety.
On the other hand, for the corresponding fluorine-free dyes (AS3 and AS6) we observed a small decrease in the photocurrent density: AS3 and AS6 reached a short circuit current of 7.98 and 10.22 mA cm−2, respectively, a little bit lower than the values, 8.12 and 10.65 mA cm−2, achieved with the similar fluorinated AS2 and AS5, respectively. The overall efficiency was 4.30% for AS3 and 5.50% for AS6. It should be underlined that in the same test cell configuration the efficiency of the N719 dye was 7.78%.
Finally, the meta-fluorinated AS7 dye exhibited both the lowest photocurrent density (5.50 mA cm−2) and VOC (0.63 V) leading to an energy conversion efficiency value of 2.59%. This result, in good agreement with the physical–chemical properties of the AS7 dye, confirms that the fluorine substitution in the meta-position is not suitable for highly efficient light conversion.
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra, which reflect the efficiency of photoelectric conversion at various wavelengths, are reported in Fig. 5a and b. Because of the strong absorption bands in the UV-to-near visible region (300–360 nm) and in the visible range (400–500 nm), these molecules have good IPCE in a large section of the solar spectrum, in good agreement with the absorption spectra of the dyes. Furthermore, it is possible to observe that the IPCE plateaus of AS4, AS5 and AS6 dyes are higher than those of the AS1, AS2 and AS3 dyes, indicating that the introduction of a thienyl unit has a positive effect on the light harvesting capability. On the other hand, the insertion of the methoxy groups results in an extended spectral response for the devices based on AS2, AS3, AS5 and AS6 dyes compared to those based on AS1 and AS4 dyes.
 Fig. 5  (a and b) IPCE spectra of DSSCs. 
Finally, the thienyl–phenyl ortho-fluorine substituted dye (AS5) shows a significantly improved performance with respect to the unsubstituted one. The good behavior is explained by the influence of the substitution scheme on the donor–acceptor strength and the electronic coupling with the nanostructured semiconductor.46
Experimental section
Materials and instruments
All reactions were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. Solvents were distilled freshly according to standard procedures. Commercial products were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich All chemicals were purified before use. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer. LC-MS spectra were acquired with an Agilent 6300 Series Ion Trap interfaced to an Agilent 1200 HPLC adopting the following general conditions: atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, positive ions, eluent chloroform, flow rate 0.200 mL min−1, drying gas flow 5.0 L min−1, nebulizer pressure 60 psi, drying gas temperature 350 °C, vaporizer temperature 325 °C, mass range 100–2200 m/z. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian-Cary 500 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were obtained on a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter.
Electrochemical characterization
The electrochemical characterization of the dyes was carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a CHI114b potentiostat (CH Instruments). A typical three-electrode cell was assembled with a glassy carbon disk working electrode, a Pt-wire auxiliary electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ non-aqueous reference electrode. Cyclic voltametries were acquired at 0.1 V s−1 scan rate on 1 mM dye solutions prepared in the electrolyte solution which consisted of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TBABF4) in dimethylformamide (DMF). All the solutions were degassed previously and N2 atmosphere was kept in the cell. After the measurement, ferrocene was added as an internal reference for calibration of the potential scale versus Fc+/Fc couple. Potentials referred to ferrocene were then converted to Normal Hydrogen Electrode (NHE) by addition of 0.63 V.
Computational details
All computations have been carried out with the TURBOMOLE55 package using the TZVPP basis set56 and the COSMO solvation model60,61 to simulate solvation effects in CHCl3 (ε = 4.8) and in DMF (ε = 36.71).
The ground state geometries of all dyes analyzed in this work were optimized in gas phase at the density functional theory (DFT) level, using the hybrid B3LYP62,63 exchange-correlation functional. A preliminary study was performed to evaluate the relative stability of two possible configurations of the double bond involving the cyanoacetic acid group, namely Z and E, for the AS1 dye. The isomer E was found to be more stable by 4.38 kcal mol−1 than the Z one, because of its larger degree of π-conjugation due to planar geometry. Thus, only the E isomer was considered in our calculations. The excitation energies of the dyes were obtained from Time-Dependent Density Functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations at the BHLYP64 level of theory. The non-local exchange-correlation functional BHLYP was chosen in order to minimize the well known drawbacks of TD-DFT for the description of excitations of charge-transfer character. Recent studies47,54 showed in fact that hybrid functionals with a sufficiently large Hartree–Fock exchange contribution can be used for TD-DFT theoretical investigations of push–pull dyes, yielding an accuracy comparable to that of highly correlated ab initio approaches. This is further confirmed in Table S2 (see ESI†), where we report the energies of the first three singlet excited states of AS1 in the gas phase, calculated using the BLYP,62,65 B3LYP and BHLYP exchange-correlation functionals (0%, 20% and 50% of Hartree–Fock exchange respectively) and compare them with reference values computed at the second-order approximated couple-cluster (CC2) level.58

Conclusions
We reported an assessment of the photophysical and photovoltaic characteristics of two sets of TPA-based dyes to study the effect of the simultaneous insertion in the π-linker of different functionalization groups, namely ethynyl, thienyl, and phenyl or fluorophenyl groups, and especially understand the role of the thiophene functionalization on the efficiency of DSSCs.
Our results indicate that indeed dyes including an ethynyl-thienyl-ortho-fluorophenyl-substituted linker yield a significant enhancement of a photovoltaic efficiency (5.81% vs. 4.00% for the fully unsubstituted dye). This result was rationalized in terms of an improved absorption in the solar spectrum range and a better light harvesting capability, as it is evident in the IPCE and UV-vis spectra, due to the increased conjugation of the HOMO and stronger localization of the LUMO orbital. We showed that the improvement of the performance is related to proper functionalization of the molecules. In particular, AS6 has a better performance due to the ortho-fluorine position, with respect to meta or fluorine-free dyes, due to the additional aromatic moiety, with respect to AS1–3, and due to the methoxy functionalization on the donor group.
In addition, we have found that the introduction of the ethynyl-thienyl-ortho-fluorophenyl enhances the light harvesting capability of the dye, favoring the photoinduced charge separation. Of particular importance in this sense is the observed localization of the LUMO orbital on the cyanoacetic acid moiety which strengthens the charge-transfer character of the excitation and may favor, upon photoexcitation, the localization of charge near the TiO2 surface.
Our investigation is therefore a clear indication that the strategy explored in this work is a promising way to the optimization of DSSCs and that a clever functionalization of the π-linker is a fundamental step towards the development of better dyes for photovoltaics applications. Future work can thus be foreseen in this direction starting from the present results.
In addition, our work can be seen also as a base for further studies on the role of different functional/substitution groups in the D–π–A system, in order to elucidate the detailed interplay between the intrinsic photochemical properties of the dye, which can be tuned by appropriate modifications of the molecule, and the overall cell functioning. In particular, we highlight, with reference to the present work, the need for a better understanding of the role played by the ethynyl–thienyl–fluoro-phenyl substitution on the coupling of the dye with the TiO2 substrate and the redox mediator, to clarify the details of the charge injection and of the recombination processes.
