    , Accepted 28th November 2013First published on 16th December 2013AbstractBulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices consisting of a novel non-fullerene acceptor based on a decacyclene triimide core and the common polymer donor poly(3-hexylthiophene) exhibit good power conversion efficiency (∼1.6%) as-cast. However, thermal annealing results in a drastic decrease in both the efficiency and the electron current. Polarized soft X-ray spectroscopy and grazing incidence X-ray scattering reveal that thermal annealing results in a reorientation of the acceptor molecules to an edge-on orientation with their π–π stacking direction predominantly in-plane with the substrate and overall hexagonal packing among planar columnar structures. This packing motif greatly hinders vertical electron transport in bulk heterojunction films. Furthermore, in situ X-ray scattering studies show that this critical reorientation occurs even at relatively low temperatures (∼60 °C). These results are some of the first to highlight differences between the morphology of non-fullerene and fullerene-based bulk heterojunctions and critical parameters that must be controlled when designing future high-performance non-fullerene acceptor molecules.
1 Introduction
Photovoltaics based on conjugated organic polymers and small molecules have been the focus of intense study in recent years. Technological progress has resulted in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). To date, nearly all OPVs utilize a fullerene derivative such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the electron accepting material, and these acceptors have been the champion performers resulting in PCEs greater than 10%.1 Acceptors such as PCBM have the advantages of large electron affinity and good electron mobility.2 However, they suffer from weak absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum compared to many donors and an electron affinity that limits the open circuit voltage (VOC). Therefore, there is an impetus to develop non-fullerene based materials that are simpler to synthesize and have a more tunable energy band gap to compliment fullerenes as acceptor molecules.
Although there has been significant progress in non-fullerene based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells,3 non-fullerene polymer–small molecule OPVs still typically have PCEs of about 1–2%,4–7 and have only recently reached ∼4%.8 All-polymer based solar cells have also seen noticeable improvements reaching efficiencies of about 4% as well.9–12 Geometrically, these materials are different from fullerenes because they are not nearly spherically symmetric molecules. Therefore, the self-assembly and transport properties of non-fullerene acceptors are fundamentally different. This difference provides unique opportunities to study charge generation originating from light absorption in the acceptor and charge transfer to the donor.13–15 In order to fabricate more efficient devices, it is essential to better understand the assembly and morphological properties of this class of materials, and to date, there is a very limited understanding on the link between variation in photovoltaic performance and structural changes in non-fullerene acceptors compared to the extensive number of reviews focusing on the P3HT:PCBM system.2,16–19
Here, we show how performance in non-fullerene based solar cells is closely linked to molecular orientation and organization. The acceptor in this study is based on a decacyclene triimide core functionalized with octyl side groups, which will be referred to as DTI. The molecular structure is shown in Fig. 1. The synthesis and initial performance of a BHJ solar cell consisting of a blend of DTI and the well-studied polymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), were recently reported.4 Decacyclene and DTI have been shown to form stacked columns with the π–π stacking direction down the length of the column.4,20,21 Large steric interactions that lead to significant twisting of the molecular core can disrupt packing, as shown recently for truxenone-based acceptors.7 However, both decacyclene and DTI have a gently twisted propeller-like geometry (see ESI, Fig. S1†) that maintains good π–π stacking among molecules. It is expected that there is sufficient orbital overlap and charge conduction in the π–π stacking direction, but limited conduction perpendicular to the π–π stacking direction. These anisotropic transport properties of DTI make it an ideal material to study the interplay between molecular orientation and solar cell performance.

It is known that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and discotic columnar liquid crystals, similar to decacyclene, often pack into columns that can arrange hexagonally.23,24 Techniques including thermal treatment and altering growth kinetics have been used to impart control over the orientation of columns between homeotropic (columns perpendicular to the substrate) and planar (columns in-plane with the substrate) arrangements.25–27 Further studies have shown that discotic liquid crystals have the capability for high time-of-flight mobilities on the order of 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1.28,29
In order for such discotic materials to properly transport charge in OPVs, they must maintain satisfactory orientation and charge carrier properties when blended with a second material. Blending a columnar discotic liquid crystalline material with an amorphous polymer can lead to geometric confinement that alters the spatial correlation lengths of the columnar structures, hence changing their optical and electronic transport properties.30 Although blends with amorphous polymers reveal interesting physics, OPVs require these discotic materials to be mixed with semiconducting polymers or small molecules and maintain proper electrical function. This has been shown for a hexabenzocoronene based discotic liquid crystal that self-assembles into vertical stacks when blended with a perylene dye and exhibits a photovoltaic response with a power efficiency maximum of 1.95% and an external quantum efficiency over 34% at 490 nm.23 Also, solar cells consisting of a trisubstituted decacyclene acceptor and poly[2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)–1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH–PPV) as the donor have been demonstrated.31 These devices attained a high VOC (1.3 V), but the overall PCE of 0.14% under 500 nm monochromatic light was limited due to a poor short circuit current (JSC) of 3.6 μA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.22.
DTI also shows promise as a successful discotic-based photovoltaic material. The P3HT:DTI solar cells studied here exhibit good as-cast performance (PCE = 1.6%) with high FF. Interestingly, the efficiency degrades significantly when thermally annealed. P3HT:PCBM-based devices, on the other hand, can reach efficiencies up to ∼5% with thermal treatment.2,32 Soft X-ray spectroscopy and scattering reveal that thermal annealing induces DTI to orient and assemble such that vertical charge transport is hindered, limiting solar cell performance. These results provide insight into the fundamental relations between morphology and electronic performance in non-fullerene acceptors and the subtleties and important parameters involved in designing such materials.
2 Results and discussion
2.1 Thermal annealing reduces solar cell performance
Many organic solar cells require thermal annealing to improve efficiency, however, thermal annealing greatly reduces the performance of P3HT:DTI-based solar cells. Here, we focus on how this can be understood through changes in the morphology of the blend. First, it is of interest to determine directly how thermal treatment influences solar cell performance. Conventional P3HT:DTI-based BHJ solar cells consisting of a PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer and LiF/Al top contacts exhibited a respectable PCE of 1.6% resulting from a JSC of 4.87 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.58 V, and a FF of 0.57. Interestingly, annealing at 120 °C, a temperature chosen because it is above the thermal transitions of DTI but below the melting point of P3HT, causes a detrimental decrease in performance (PCE ≈ 0.3%), as shown in Fig. 2a. Annealing at various other temperatures in the range of 50 °C to 120 °C also results in significant drops in PCE (ESI, Fig. S2†). This is in contrast to P3HT:PCBM solar cells which typically require thermal annealing to optimize efficiency.2,33 In fact, many of the previously reported non-fullerene acceptors require thermal annealing to optimize efficiency with P3HT.5,34–36 Additionally, the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of an electron-only device (Al/P3HT:DTI/Ca/Al) show that the electron current is much lower, about one order of magnitude, in the annealed device (Fig. 2b). Also, the electron mobility dropped from about 4.1 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the as-cast film to about 1.8 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the annealed film. However, no such decrease in the hole current is observed (see ESI, Fig. S12†). This suggests that it is changes in the morphology of DTI acceptor molecules that are mostly responsible for the decreased performance upon annealing.

The dark current curves for the as-cast and annealed devices are shown with the dotted and dotted-dashed lines, respectively. (b) Current density vs. voltage plot taken in the dark for a P3HT:DTI electron-only device. The as-cast device is given by the blue circles, and the annealed device by the red triangles. 
Despite the drastic decrease in the performance of thermally annealed solar cells, photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments suggest no appreciable decrease in charge transfer from P3HT to DTI upon annealing, and even a significant improvement in charge transfer from DTI to P3HT (greater degree of PL quenching) after annealing (see ESI, Fig. S5†). The small decrease in charge transfer from P3HT to DTI upon annealing is likely a result of slightly larger P3HT crystallites and suggests no extensive change in the exciton diffusion length within P3HT. Conversely, the drastic improvement in charge transfer from DTI to P3HT after annealing indicates a potential change in the exciton diffusion length in DTI, which has been shown to be quite large in ordered discotic liquid crystals along the transport direction.37 Energy transfer also occurs because the emission of DTI overlaps with the absorption of P3HT. Furthermore, it is reasonable to expect cofacial molecular alignment between chains of P3HT that are oriented edge-on with respect to the substrate (observed by X-ray scattering) and edge-on DTI molecules. Such an alignment likely maximizes electronic coupling of the π-orbitals and may improve charge transfer in annealed films. These factors strongly suggest that the main reason for the drop in efficiency after annealing is hindered electron transport in the DTI domains.
2.2 Thermal annealing has limited effect on vertical stratification
Considering the severe decrease in photovoltaic performance upon thermal annealing, it is important to determine if significant changes in the vertical segregation of P3HT:DTI blends occurs. For blends of flexible polymers, surface segregation depends strongly on the surface energy of the polymers.38–40 It is known that vertical phase segregation can occur in polymer–small molecule blends with a preference of one material to segregate to the film/air or film/substrate interface. Recent studies have shown that in a blend of a semiconducting small molecule and a binder polymer, the segregation of the small molecule to either the film/air, the film/substrate or both interfaces can be tuned. This depends on the polymer molecular weight and the type of polymer, where effects such as confinement entropy, interaction energy, and solidification could all play a role.41,42 Furthermore, the presence of an insulating polymer does not necessarily reduce the charge transport capabilities of a semiconducting polymer, and can even enhance it.43,44 Vertical segregation could potentially be harmful to charge collection in solar cells. An excess of the electron transport material near the hole-collecting interface may reduce device characteristics. An excess of the hole transport material at the electron-collecting interface may also limit performance, but is potentially less detrimental.45 However, the overall effects of vertical phase segregation in BHJ solar cells are not very well understood, and in some cases may not result in significant changes in performance.46,47
To examine the vertical profile in these materials, depth profiling dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry (DSIMS) was performed on as-cast and annealed P3HT:DTI blends. P3HT can be tracked in the active layer through the 34S− (m/z = 34) mass fragment, since sulfur is not present in DTI, and DTI is tracked with the CN− (m/z = 26) ion. Fig. 3 shows the vertical profile of the P3HT:DTI active layer region and underlying Si/PEDOT:PSS substrate. A 150 nm polystyrene film was floated on top of the active layer to allow the O2+ beam to establish a steady-state damage profile before the top interface of the blend is reached. The etch rate is estimated to be ∼0.45 nm s−1 based on the initial thickness of the polystyrene film. It should be noted that the absolute intensity of the CN− signal and the 34S− signal are not directly related since the formation probability of CN− is much higher than 34S−.
 Fig. 3  Depth profiling DSIMS data for as-cast and annealed (120 °C) P3HT:DTI blend films. The 34S− signal (triangles) corresponds to P3HT and its intensity is plotted on the right axis. DTI is tracked through the CN− signal (circles) with corresponding intensity plotted on the left axis. The boxed regions indicate approximately where the P3HT:DTI film and underlying Si/PEDOT:PSS substrate reside. 
The DSIMS data do not reveal extensive changes in the vertical composition profile between as-cast and annealed films. Looking at the as-cast film, there is a very slight excess of P3HT at the film surface relative to the amount of P3HT in the interior of the film. There also is a greater excess of P3HT at the buried interface between the active layer and the PEDOT:PSS layer. Interestingly, the profile of DTI suggests that it is mostly concentrated in the bottom half of the film, without significant excess close to either interface relative to the bulk.
The annealed film exhibits an overall similar profile as the as-cast one. There is still a very slight excess of P3HT at the film/air interface, however there is less of an excess at the BHJ/PEDOT:PSS interface. Correspondingly, there is a slight shoulder in the DTI profile toward the BHJ/PEDOT:PSS interface suggesting there is some additional DTI at the bottom of the film compared to the as-cast case. As alluded to earlier, this vertical segregation profile may reduce charge extraction, but the change in vertical composition is not significant enough for it to be a major cause for the limited performance in annealed devices.
The surface topography of the blend films determined from atomic force microscopy (AFM) shows little change with annealing besides a slight increase in root mean squared (rms) roughness from about 2.1 nm to 2.8 nm for the as-cast and annealed films, respectively (ESI, Fig. S3†). However, the tendency of the alkyl side chains of both components to inhabit the film/air interface to minimize surface energy could lead to similar film surface structures.
Previous work on polymer–small molecule blends suggests that small molecules tend to segregate to interfaces. However, this can be suppressed by using a semicrystalline polymer with fast crystallization.41 It is possible that a similar phenomenon is occurring in the P3HT:DTI system where P3HT crystallizes before DTI. This is evident because the crystallization onset temperature of P3HT does not increase when DTI is introduced (see ESI, Fig. S20†), which would be expected if DTI acted as a nucleating agent.48
2.3 Changes in molecular orientation and domain size reduce solar cell performance
Considering the geometry and the stacking motif of DTI, where good charge transport is possible in the π–π stacking direction, it is reasonable to expect that the orientation of these columnar structures would have a direct impact on electron transport and efficiency. Here, we use a combination of near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) and X-ray scattering to elucidate the effects of thermal annealing on molecular orientation and order. NEXAFS utilizes polarized soft X-rays where the incident energy can be tuned to specific atomic transitions.49 Overall molecular orientation can be determined by examining the intensity dependence as a function of incident angle for a specific transition.49–55 The application of NEXAFS to examine the tilt of the conjugated core in organic semiconductors has proven to be successful previously.56–60
Here, we focus on molecular orientation of as-cast and annealed P3HT:DTI blends, relevant to photovoltaic devices. Similar trends in molecular orientation were observed for the bulk of the film, determined from the fluorescence yield (FY) data, as for the surface-sensitive partial electron yield (PEY) data presented here. FY data and analysis of the molecular orientation for pristine DTI films are provided in the ESI (Fig. S9 and S10†). PEY data for as-cast and annealed (120 °C) films of P3HT:DTI blends taken at various incident angles are shown in Fig. 4. In both cases, it is evident that the intensity of the C 1s → π* transition near 285 eV increases and is greatest at an incident angle of 90°. However, this effect is stronger in the annealed film. In this experimental geometry, 90° corresponds to the electric field vector in-plane with the substrate surface (incident X-ray normal to the substrate surface). This result suggests that the 1s → π* transition vector is mostly parallel to the substrate. The average orientation of the conjugated plane of the molecules can be quantified by an orientational order parameter, S, which ranges from +1 for a vertical transition (face-on) to −1/2 for a horizontal transition (edge-on),55S decreases from −0.093 in the as-cast sample to −0.15 in the annealed sample (Fig. 4), suggesting more edge-on character in the annealed blend. It is difficult to separate the contributions from P3HT and DTI to this overall orientation change. NEXAFS analysis on a pristine DTI film shows that DTI has little orientational preference as-cast (S = −0.0038), but is more edge-on after thermal annealing (S = −0.33), as shown in the ESI (Fig. S9†). DTI becomes significantly more edge-on after annealing than what is expected for P3HT, and this is supported by X-ray scattering data discussed later. Therefore, it is suspected that the DTI molecules are the main contributor to the observed overall orientational change in the blends. If this is true, then the increase in the amount of DTI character in the π* peak when going from 30° to 90° should be greater for the annealed blend compared to the as-cast blend. Indeed, this trend is observed (ESI, Fig. S11†).

A simple conclusion that can be drawn is that the molecules, especially DTI, adopt a more edge-on orientation after thermal annealing. The anisotropic charge transport of DTI suggests that this reorientation is a culprit for the reduced performance in thermally annealed solar cells.
Crystallinity is a critical component in organic solar cells, and the ability to probe the crystalline regions in the film and distinguish between changes occurring in both DTI and P3HT is essential. Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) is able to probe order and orientation of the crystalline regions of organic semiconductor thin films.16,58,61,62 GIWAXS experiments were performed on pristine DTI and P3HT:DTI films to further examine the formation and orientation of ordered DTI structures. Fig. 5a and b show 2D GIWAXS patterns of as-cast and thermally annealed DTI films. A broad, diffuse scattering ring at ∼1.5 Å−1, typical for amorphous scattering, is clearly visible and suggests low overall crystallinity. There is also a strong reflection at ∼0.3 Å−1. Since it is quite broad (FWHM ≈0.07 Å−1) and the intensity is relatively distributed over all polar angles, it is most likely due to small DTI aggregates or crystals with no preferred orientation.

The characteristic reflections for P3HT are labelled in (c). The missing wedge along qz represents the inaccessible region of the Ewald sphere in grazing incidence geometry.63 
Scattering reveals noticeable changes in DTI films with thermal annealing, as shown in Fig. 5b. The broad amorphous ring has mostly disappeared, suggesting greater relative crystallinity. A unique feature of the annealed films is the appearance of a reflection centered at 1.8 Å−1, with greatest intensity in-plane with the substrate, along qxy. This corresponds to a d-spacing of 0.35 nm, typical of a π–π stacking distance in conjugated organics.58 The fact that the intensity of this reflection is concentrated along qxy reveals that stacks of DTI molecules are predominantly oriented with the π–π stacking direction parallel to the substrate, i.e. most molecules in crystalline regions are edge-on to the substrate. Furthermore, in the annealed film, the main reflection, centered at qz = 0.29 Å−1, has become narrower, indicative of larger crystallites. Interestingly, the intensity distribution for this reflection is not constant. There is a one spot of enhanced intensity in the nearly out-of-plane direction and another 60° from the surface normal. Considering the gentle propeller geometry of a DTI molecule, it is expected that they would stack one on top of the other, with adjacent molecules rotating to reduce steric interactions. DTI has been observed to stack into long columns when drop-cast from tetrahydrofuran.4 The hexagonal pattern seen in GIWAXS suggests that annealing causes separate DTI columns to adopt a hexagonal packing motif and lie parallel to the substrate, a morphology that has been observed for discotic hexagonal columnar liquid crystals.23,24,26 Based on the reflection at 0.29 Å−1, the hexagonal lattice can be described by a parameter, ahex = 2.47 nm, which is the distance between adjacent columns.
It is important to see if the packing of DTI is disrupted when blended with P3HT. The scattering from P3HT:DTI blends reveals the characteristic reflections for P3HT, as seen in Fig. 5c and d. The as-cast blend film exhibits the typical out-of-plane (100), (200), and (300) reflections of P3HT located close to the qz axis at 0.38, 0.77, and 1.17 Å−1, respectively, that correspond to stacking along the hexyl side chain extent. There is also an in-plane peak at 1.65 Å−1 corresponding to the π–π stacking distance.64 The as-cast film shows noticeable amorphous scattering and an isotropic reflection at 0.29 Å−1 originating from the DTI molecules. Similar to the NEXAFS data, GIWAXS results show that upon casting, DTI has little preferred orientation, even when mixed with P3HT. The annealed P3HT:DTI film shows a qualitatively similar scattering from P3HT, but the main DTI reflection at 0.29 Å−1 reveals a hexagonal pattern once again, and the in-plane π–π stacking peak for DTI appears as well. This suggests that annealing mostly affects the formation and assembly of DTI crystallites, as the scattering pattern from P3HT remains qualitatively similar. The GIWAXS data is in agreement with the NEXAFS results indicating that thermal annealing leads to an increased degree of edge-on orientation of DTI that hinders electron transport.
Wide angle X-ray scattering can be used to estimate crystallite sizes. Crystallite correlation lengths, which are related to crystallite size, were determined from the width of the diffraction peaks using Scherrer analysis.65,66 Correlation lengths along the alkyl chain stacking direction were determined in the near out-of-plane (close to qz) direction for the low-q reflections of P3HT and DTI. For the as-cast P3HT:DTI blend, the out-of-plane correlation length of DTI is relatively small (∼14 nm), suggesting aggregates of only several molecules high. The vertical correlation length for P3HT crystallites is about 21 nm determined from the (100) alkyl stacking reflection. In the annealed P3HT:DTI blend, the correlation length for P3HT remained somewhat similar. However, the correlation length for DTI crystallites increased noticeably to nearly 45 nm (Fig. 6a). This is significant considering the film thickness is ∼100 nm. This suggests that thermal annealing leads to separate parallel columns of DTI that stack quite high. It is likely that the thermally induced reorientation allows multiple nearby columnar aggregates to stack together, hindering vertical electron transport in annealed films. Less dramatic changes were observed for the in-plane (π–π stacking reflection) correlation lengths (ESI, Fig. S18†).

(b) Transmission RSoXS scattering profile taken at 284.4 eV of P3HT:DTI blend film both as-cast (purple circles) and annealed (gold squares) at 120 °C. The data is plotted with a Lorentz correction (I × q2). 
Periodicities on a larger length scale, often relevant to domain size or phase separation, can be accessed with small angle X-ray scattering. However, the similar electron density of P3HT and DTI makes typical hard X-ray small angle scattering experiments difficult. To overcome this, we utilized transmission resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS), which takes advantage of the absorption difference near elemental edges (e.g. carbon K edge) between materials to enhance scattering contrast.49 RSoXS data on as-cast and annealed P3HT:DTI blends suggest that the average in-plane separation between DTI-rich domains increases with thermal annealing. As shown in Fig. 6b, the main peak in the scattering curve shifts from about 0.015 Å−1 (∼40 nm) in the as-cast blend to about 0.0033 Å−1 (∼190 nm) in the annealed blend. This indicates an increase in the overall domain separation distance and agrees with the large DTI crystallites formed in annealed films.
Morphological characterization reveals significant changes in P3HT:DTI blend films with thermal annealing. Cross-sections of as-cast and annealed films are shown schematically in Fig. 8. In as-cast films, aggregates of DTI are relatively small and have little preferential orientation, providing potential pathways for electrons to travel to the electrodes. In thermally annealed films, larger stacks of DTI crystallites pack hexagonally with the π–π stacking direction mostly in-plane. This orientation hinders vertical electron transport and reduces solar cell performance. Furthermore, a larger separation distance between DTI domains also limits charge transport.
2.4 
          In situ experiments reveal cold crystallization of DTI
It is clear that annealing at 120 °C leads to significant changes in the assembly of DTI molecules and the corresponding solar cell performance. However, it was found that annealing at lower temperatures (50 °C) also resulted in greatly diminished performance. This brings to question what temperature is required to cause DTI to form the planar columnar structures that limit charge extraction. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on P3HT:DTI blends and is shown in Fig. 7a. DSC data on pristine P3HT and DTI is provided in the ESI (Fig. S20†). Upon heating the blend, there is a subtle exothermic peak around 50 °C, probably due to cold crystallization of DTI, which appears right before an endothermic transition at 57 °C. Interestingly, no other melting-type transitions occur even far above 120 °C until the melting temperature of P3HT at about 230 °C. On cooling, there is a characteristic crystallization peak for P3HT at 200 °C, and an additional exothermic transition at 25 °C. The main endothermic transition during heating at 57 °C is likely not a melting transition of DTI to an isotropic liquid since GIWAXS scans taken at elevated temperatures well above 57 °C show diffraction patterns of ordered structures, as seen in the ESI (Fig. S16 and S17†). This peak, and the corresponding exothermic transition at 25 °C, could be due to disordering and reordering of the octyl side chains of DTI.

 Fig. 8  Schematic representation of cross sections of (a) an as-cast P3HT:DTI film and (b) a thermally annealed P3HT:DTI film. Stacks of DTI molecules are represented as green pillars, and P3HT crystallites as stacked purple rectangles. The panels in the middle depict close-ups of the hexagonal packing among separate stacks of DTI and how each of the pillars represents a stack of multiple DTI molecules. 
In order to better understand the structural transitions of DTI, in situ GIWAXS experiments were performed at various temperatures during heating. In this way, the sample was heated to a specific temperature and a GIWAXS scan was taken. The sample was then incrementally heated to higher temperatures where additional scattering patterns were obtained at temperature. After starting at room temperature (RT), where the GIWAXS pattern is very similar to that shown in Fig. 5c, the hexagonal pattern and in-plane π–π stacking start to become visible at 60 °C (Fig. 7b). This becomes more clear at 80 °C (Fig. 7c), and even sharper at higher temperatures (ESI, Fig. S14†). This in situ study is in agreement with the GIWAXS data in Fig. 5, which indicates that annealing leads to hexagonally packed DTI columns with a predominantly in-plane π–π stacking direction. Furthermore, in situ scattering reveals that this critical reorientation can occur at a much lower temperature than 120 °C. In fact, for a pristine DTI film, the characteristic pattern of an annealed film is seen even at 40 °C (ESI, Fig. S16†). P3HT only marginally inhibits the thermally-induced ordering of DTI, and it is likely that the softening of P3HT allows DTI to have reasonable molecular mobility in the blend. These results suggest that the exothermic peak at about 50 °C in the DSC is likely cold crystallization, which is where the DTI molecules have enough thermal energy to order and orient. The in situ experiments bring to light the importance of controlling the ordering transitions in these types of discotic columnar materials.
3 Conclusions
Morphology and molecular orientation are critically important for efficient charge extraction and operation of organic photovoltaics based on non-fullerene acceptors due to their anisotropic charge transport properties. Our study here of a model BHJ with a decacyclene triimide-based acceptor clearly demonstrates how morphological changes upon annealing can be directly related to the PCE. Using a combination of X-ray scattering methods, spectroscopy and device measurements, we find that thermal processing leads to an increase in DTI crystallite size, molecular reorientation, and an increase in overall domain separation distance at relatively low temperatures and short annealing times. The reorientation of DTI molecules to a predominantly edge-on orientation with the π–π stacking direction in-plane with the substrate inhibits electron transport in solar cells.
The results in this work highlight the importance of controlling thermal transitions and the molecular orientation of novel materials for successful use in BHJ photovoltaic devices. As evident here, the possibility for non-fullerene molecules to change orientation and influence electron transport at relatively low temperatures (∼60 °C) is a potential disadvantage in real-world solar cells that could reach such temperatures under ambient sunlight. Molecular design becomes critical in tailoring the thermodynamics and kinetics of such structural rearrangements associated with these transitions to improve the properties of photovoltaics based on future decacyclene-based or other non-fullerene acceptors.
4 Experimental
DTI was synthesized as reported previously,4 and P3HT obtained from Rieke Metals (Sepiolid P200). All solutions were prepared with a total concentration of 20 mg mL−1 in o-dichlorobenzene and stirred at 80 °C. Thin films were prepared by spin-casting at 1000 rpm for 60 s and then 2000 rpm for 10 s. Near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) was performed at beamling U7A at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) at beamline 11-3 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Light source (SSRL), and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) at beamline 11.0.1.2 at the Advanced Light Source (ALS). Further experimental details on device fabrication and testing and characterization methods are provided in the ESI.†
