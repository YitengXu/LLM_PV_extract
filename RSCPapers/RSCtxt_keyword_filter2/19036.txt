The performance enhancement of polymer OTFTs and OPVs is largely attributed to the progress made in the development of polymer semiconductor materials. Therefore exploration of new building blocks for developing high-performance polymer semiconductors has been an area of extensive research. This article provides an overview of new building blocks including 21 electron acceptors and 20 electron donors, which were developed over the past three years for constructing π-conjugated polymers, particularly donor–acceptor (D–A) type polymers. Polymers containing these building blocks have shown very promising performance as active semiconductors in OTFTs and OPVs. Rationales for the structural design and the device performance of the polymers based on these new building blocks are discussed.
1. Introduction
π-Conjugated polymer semiconductors as active constituent materials for organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have been extensively studied since their first reports in 1983 and 1993, respectively.1,2 The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of a polymer semiconductor determine the type of charge carriers under an electrical bias. A polymer semiconductor with a high HOMO level tends to transport positive electron holes and the polymer is called a p-type semiconductor or an electron donor material, a term widely used for OPVs. In contrast, a polymer with a low LUMO level favors the transport of negative electrons and behaves as an n-type semiconductor or an electron acceptor material. The HOMO and LUMO levels of a polymer semiconductor are governed by the basic π-conjugated building blocks of the polymer; an electron deficient or electron-accepting moiety would decrease the energy levels, while an electron rich or electron-donating moiety would increase the energy levels. However, whether a moiety is an electron donor (D) or acceptor (A) is relative to its adjacent moiety.3 For the convenience of discussion here, we arbitrarily use non-substituted 1,4-phenylene as a neutral building block; we consider the moieties that are more electron-rich than 1,4-phenylene to be electron donors and the ones that are more electron-deficient to be electron acceptors. Donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers refer to those whose backbone is comprised of electron-rich and electron-deficient moieties in an alternating arrangement. Hybridization of the molecular orbitals between the donor and acceptor in D–A polymers typically leads to small band gaps, which provides a useful tool to optimize the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPVs.4–6 It has also been found that the intermolecular D–A interaction is capable of shortening the π–π stacking distance to help bring about efficient charge transport in D–A polymers.7–9 In recent years, substantial progress has been made in the development of conjugated polymers, particularly D–A polymers, for OTFTs10,11 and OPVs.12,13 These remarkable recent achievements are largely attributed to the material's innovation.14 For example, side chain engineering has been used to control the film morphology and molecular stacking to greatly improve the charge carrier mobility.15 It was also found that fluorinated building blocks could lower the energy levels while keeping the band gaps almost unchanged.16,17 However, much effort has been directed to the development of new building blocks. In this paper, we review the progress over the past three years or so in the development of novel acceptor and donor building blocks for constructing polymer semiconductors, which have shown promising performance in OTFTs and OPVs. The optoelectronic properties of these new polymers discussed throughout this article are summarized in Table 1.

2. Acceptor building blocks
2.1. Benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole derivatives (Scheme 1)
The benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BTz, Scheme 1) unit has been frequently used to construct high performance D–A polymers, particularly for OPVs.4,6 However, the band gap of most BTz-based polymers (1.7–1.9 eV) is inadequately small for the optimal harvesting of solar energy, which requires a band gap between 1.2 eV and 1.7 eV.18 Therefore, effort was made to modify BTz in order to achieve a smaller band gap. Naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (A1, Scheme 1) can be viewed as a fused structure of two BTz rings. Compared to BTz, A1 has more extended conjugation and a slightly stronger electron-withdrawing capacity.19 The first D–A copolymer incorporating A1, P1a, was reported by Wang et al.,19 which has a smaller band gap of 1.58 eV than that of the BTz-based polymers. This polymer reached a high PCE of 6% in OPVs. Later, another A1-based polymer P1b achieved a slightly improved PCE of 6.3%.20 A high hole mobility of 0.56 cm2 V−1 s−1 was also obtained for this polymer in OTFTs. Dong et al. replaced sulfur in A1 with nitrogen, resulting in A2.21 An A2-containing polymer P2 exhibited an enhanced PCE of 7.11%. Fusing two BTz rings through a pyrrole ring affords a new acceptor block A3. However, the A3-containing polymer P3 exhibited a low PCE of 2%.22 Furthermore, BTz was fused to two thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole moieties to form A4.23 A D–A polymer P4 based on A4 achieved a PCE of 3.11%. In order to strengthen the electron accepting ability, Wang et al. fused a dicarboxylic imide group to the 4 and 5 positions of a BTz moiety, affording A5.24 A polymer P5 based on this building block showed lower energy levels (EHOMO/ELUMO = −5.51 eV/−3.76 eV) than those of its BTz-based analogous polymer (EHOMO/ELUMO = −5.29 eV/−3.67 eV)25 and achieved an impressive PCE of 5.19% in OPVs. Recently, a new extensively fused BTz building block A6 was incorporated into D–A polymers for OTFTs.26 Ambipolar charge transport was observed due to the deep-lying LUMO of the resulting polymer (P6).

2.2. Diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole derivatives (Scheme 2)
Diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (DPP, Scheme 2) is one of the most widely investigated acceptors for constructing D–A polymers for OTFTs and OPVs.9 Since it was first reported for OTFTs in 2008,27 the mobility of DPP-based polymers has improved from ∼0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 12 cm2 V−1 s−1.28 Given the remarkable achievements on DPP based polymers, one would intuitively consider exploring the derivatives of DPP. The use of an isomer of DPP, diketopyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrrole (A7, Scheme 2), for polymers was reported by Lu et al.29 A D–A polymer (P7) of A7 and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole achieved a hole mobility up to 0.034 cm2 V−1 s−1 for OTFTs and a PCE of 5.1% for OPVs. Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dipyrrole-2,6-dione (A8) can be viewed as an extension of A7 by inserting a para quinoid ring into A7. The first A8-based polymer (P8a) was reported for the OTFT application by Cui et al.,30 which showed ambipolar charge transport performance with hole and electron mobilities on the order of 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Later, Hong et al. used an acetal substituent, 2,2-bis((3,7-dimethyloctyl)oxy)ethyl, to allow the combination of A8 with a larger donor unit, bithiophene, to afford a very soluble D–A polymer (P8b).31 This polymer showed unipolar p-type performance with a higher hole mobility of 0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1. The A8 unit in the above polymers was flanked with two sterically encumbered benzene rings, which results in twisting of the polymer backbone and thus a reduced effective π-conjugation length. To overcome this drawback, Rumer et al. flanked the A8 block with two thiophene units.32 The resulting polymer P8c achieved ambipolar charge transport performance with high hole and electron mobilities of 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Another novel acceptor, dipyrrolo[2,3-b:2′,3′-e]pyrazine-2,6(1H,5H)-dione (A9), is an extension of A7 with insertion of an electron-deficient pyrazine unit. D–A polymers (P9a and P9b) based on A9 showed ambipolar performance in OTFTs with hole and electron mobilities as high as 0.066 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.021 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.33

2.3. Diimide derivatives (Scheme 3)
Diimide building blocks, e.g., naphthalenediimide (NDI), perylenediimide (PDI) and coronenediimide (CDI), shown in Scheme 3, are frequently used for small molecule n-type semiconductors.34–36 They have certain common features: extended π-conjugation, short π–π stacking distances, high coplanarity and strong electron affinity. Naphthalenediimide (NDI) was first used for the synthesis of an n-type polymer comprising NDI and bithiophene in 2009 by Chen et al.37 This polymer showed stable electron transport performance, reaching high electron mobilities of 0.06 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.85 cm2 V−1 s−1, in bottom-gate top-contact37 and top-gate bottom-contact38 devices, respectively. A modification of NDI was made by Fukutomi et al., who reported the synthesis of a thiophene-fused NDI (A10) and its D–A polymer (P10).39P10 showed ambipolar transport behaviour with a hole mobility of 0.10 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobility of 0.27 cm2 V−1 s−1. Li et al. successfully transformed one side of each imide group into a fused pyridine ring to form A11.40 The D–A polymer of A11 and terthiophene, P11, exhibited a hole mobility up to 0.135 cm2 V−1 s−1. Recently a linear electron acceptor A12 (Scheme 3) was horizontally incorporated into a D–A polymer (P12) by Li et al. in order to achieve 2-dimentional charge transport.41P12 is an n-type semiconductor, showing a high electron mobility of 0.30 cm2 V−1 s−1. Usta et al. fused two thiophene units to CDI to form A13.42 The A13-containing polymer P13 exhibited good ambipolar charge transport performance with an electron mobility of 0.30 cm2 V−1 s−1 and hole mobility of 0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1 under ambient conditions. Zheng et al. reported the first use of an isomeric structure of NDI, A14, for D–A polymers.43 A D–A polymer (P14) based on A14 exhibited a high hole mobility of 0.3 cm2 V−1 s−1.44

2.4. Other new acceptors (Schemes 4 and 5)
In recent years, isoindigo (IID, Scheme 4) has been used as an acceptor building block in D–A polymers for high performance OTFTs.45,46 However, the repulsion between the oxygen atom of the carboxyl group and the hydrogen atom of the neighboring benzene ring causes twisting of the IID unit, which may hinder close π–π stacking and thus negatively affect the charge transport. To overcome this steric effect, Ashraf et al. replaced the benzene rings in IID with thiophene rings to form A15.47P15a based on this building block and BTz showed ambipolar performance with both hole and electron mobilities of ∼0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is one order of magnitude lower than those achieved for the IID-based polymers. The intrinsic merit of A15 was not realized until very recently by Kim et al., who reported another A15-based polymer P15b having a naphthalene comonomer unit.10P15b showed p-type semiconductor performance with an ultrahigh mobility of 14.4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OTFTs. In order to strengthen the electron accepting capability of IID to realize unipolar electron transport of the resulting polymers, Yan et al. incorporated an electron deficient benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']difuran-2,6-dione moiety to form a large acceptor building block A16 for two D–A polymers: P16a and P16b.48 However, due to the strong intermolecular interaction, P16b suffered from poor solubility. Nonetheless, the readily soluble P16a showed unipolar n-type semiconductor performance with an electron mobility of ∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the OTFT devices encapsulated with PMMA and measured in air. Interestingly, ambipolar charge transport performance with higher mobilities (∼10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) was observed for the devices without encapsulation. Later, Lei et al. overcame the solubility issue of the A16-based polymers by introducing a very large alkyl side chain, 4-octadecyldoeicosyl, which contains 40 carbon atoms.49 A polymer P16d similar to P16b using this C-40 substituent showed good solubility and excellent n-type semiconductor performance with a high electron mobility of 1.74 cm2 V−1 s−1 achieved in top-gate bottom-contact devices fabricated in nitrogen and operated in air (Fig. 1). Similar to P16a,48P16d showed ambipolar charge transport in devices both fabricated and operated in air. The same group reported another copolymer (P16c) of A16 with a weaker electron donor, vinylene, which showed an electron mobility up to 1.1 cm2 V−1 s−1.50 The mobility remained greater than 0.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 after 30 days of exposure to air. These results demonstrated that A16 is a very promising electron acceptor building block for high performance n-type polymers.

Several other new acceptors are shown in Scheme 5. Guo et al. reported a head-to-head alkoxy-substituted bithiazole block (A17).51 By introducing alkoxyl side chains, backbone twisting due to head-to-head linkage was effectively circumvented with the sulfur–oxygen van der Waals interaction. A polymer (P17) based on A17 showed a hole mobility up to 0.25 cm2 V−1 s−1. Dai et al. developed a thiophene-fused naphthalimide block (A18) and the resulting polymer P18 achieved a hole mobility of 0.15 cm2 V−1 s−1.52 Kim et al. fused an imide moiety to thieno[3,4-b]thiophene to form A19.53 OPVs using the A19-based polymer P19 exhibited a PCE up to 5.3%. Ie et al. reported A20 and its polymer P20a.54 OPV devices using P20a achieved a moderate PCE of 2.7%. Later, Qian et al. reported another A20-based polymer P20b, which demonstrated a very high PCE of 6.67%.55 (E)-[4,4′-Biimidazolylidene]-5,5′(1H,1′H)-dione (A21) was used as an acceptor to form polymer P21, which showed hole transport properties with mobilities on the order of 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.56

3. Donor building blocks
3.1. Thieno[3,2-b]thiophene and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene derivatives (Scheme 6)
Thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT, Scheme 6) was used in high performance polymers for OTFTs.7,57 To obtain polymers with a lower band gap for OPVs, Zhong et al. synthesized a fused heteroaryl donor moiety D1 by bridging two TT units with a germanium atom.58 A copolymer of D1 and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD), P22, showed excellent photovoltaic performance with a high PCE of 7.2%. Biniek et al. synthesized a hexacyclic donor unit, D2.59 The resulting polymer P23 showed a decent field effect hole mobility of 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 and PCE of 3.3%. Cheng et al. designed another hexacyclic donor, D3.60 Polymer P24 based on D3 showed a very high open circuit voltage of 1.14 eV and a high PCE of 5.8% in OPVs.
 Scheme 6  TT- and BDT-derived building blocks and polymers. 
A number of D–A polymers incorporating the electron donor benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT, Scheme 6) are high performance hole transport materials for OTFTs61 and OPVs.13 Particularly, a high PCE exceeding 8% was achieved with BDT-containing polymers.13 Effort was made to investigate the derivatives of BDT in order to achieve improved device performance. A close analogue of BDT is benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (D4). It was believed that the furan rings would exert less steric effect on the neighbouring units since oxygen is smaller than sulfur.62 A copolymer (P25) of D4 and bithiophene achieved a PCE of up to 5%.62 Naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (zNDT, Scheme 6) is an extension of BDT. An analogue of zNDT, D5, was incorporated into P26 by Liu et al.63 OPV devices based on this polymer exhibited a PCE of up to 4.5%. The linear anthra[2,3-b:6,7-b′]dithiophene (lADT) is an extended BDT. However, lADT-based polymers showed limited solubility and poor OPV performance.64 To tackle the solubility issue, Wu et al. synthesized an angular isomer D6 and the resulting D–A polymer P27 showed an improved PCE of up to 4.24%.65
3.2. Cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophene and s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-derivatives (Scheme 7)
Cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT, Scheme 7) has proven to be a very useful donor building block for constructing D–A polymer for OTFTs66,67 (reaching a mobility of 18 cm2 V−1 s−1)67 and OPVs.68 Recently You et al. reported D7, which is a modified CPDT structure with insertion of an oxygen atom in the central ring.12 A copolymer of D7 and 5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole, P28, achieved a high PCE of 7.9% for single cells and a record high PCE of 10.6% for tandem cells (Fig. 2). Two CPDT-derived donor blocks, benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′:6,5-b′′]trithiophene (D8)69 and benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′:5,6-c′′]trithiophene (D9),70 were used for preparing new D–A polymers. A PCE of 5.6% (P29)71 and hole mobility of 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 (P30)72 were achieved by the polymers based on these building blocks. Chen et al. developed a heptacyclic moiety with two CPDT moieties fused to a benzene ring, D10.73 A D–A polymer (P31) of this donor with an electron acceptor TPD achieved a high PCE of 6.6%. Cai et al. reported D11, which was used for constructing a polymer P32 for OPVs and a PCE of 4.17% was obtained.74 It was found that the use of a sulfur atom as the bridge could improve the thin film morphology and thus the OPV performance. Recently, they reported another novel hexacyclic donor, D12.75 A good PCE of 5% was achieved for OPV devices by using a D12-based polymer P33.

Over the past few years, s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDT, Scheme 7)-based polymers have attracted substantial interest due to their excellent photovoltaic performance.76,77 Xu et al. replaced thiophene in IDT with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene to form D13.78 A D13-based polymer (P34) achieved a high PCE of 7% in OPVs. The excellent photovoltaic properties were attributed to the enhanced coplanarity (in favour of charge transport) and absorption coefficient (in favour of solar energy harvesting). Previous studies showed that replacing thiophene with selenophene in polymers can induce a stronger intermolecular interaction because selenium is more polarizable.79 Chang et al. synthesized a new selenophene-modified IDT donor, D14.80 The D14-containing polymers exhibited good OTFT performance (hole mobility of 0.08 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P35a) and photovoltaic properties (PCE of 4.6% for P35b). Schroeder et al. replaced the central phenylene in IDT and used silicon bridges to form D15.81 The silicon bridge in D15 has longer Si–C bonds than the C–C bonds in the carbon bridges, which could lower the frontier energy levels of this building block. A D15-based polymer P36 showed a high PCE of 5.52%.
3.3. 2,7-Carbazole derivatives (Scheme 8)
A well-known 2,7-carbazole-containing polymer for OPVs is poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-dithienylbenzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT, Scheme 8), which achieved a high PCE over 7%.82 To further explore the potential of PCDTBT, Wu et al. studied the silicon- and nitrogen-bridged carbazole-thiophene structures, D16 and D17.83 Polymer P37 containing D16 exhibited a PCE of 5.2% in OPVs, which is better than that of the D17-based polymer P38 (2.6%). To extend the aromatic system, Chen et al. fused thiophene rings to the benzene rings in carbazole to form a novel donor, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-h]carbazole (D18).84 Polymer P39a based on D18 showed a hole mobility as high as 0.39 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OTFTs. Another D18 based polymer P39b showed an excellent mobility of up to 1.36 cm2 V−1 s−1.85 However the observed high mobility for P39b might be largely attributed to the presence of the DPP unit, which is known to be an excellent acceptor building block for high mobility D–A polymers.9 The same group also investigated an isomer of D18, dithieno[2,3-b:3′,2′-h]carbazole (D19). However, OTFT devices using D19-based polymers such as P40 exhibited a much lower mobility of ∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The difference was attributed to the large backbone curvature of D19. However, we believe that the less effective conjugation across D19 (there is no alternating double bond–single bond pathway from one side to another) is probably the main reason for the poor charge transport performance of the D17-based polymers. Phenanthro[1,10,9,8-cdefg]carbazole (D20) is a fused structure of carbazole with biphenyl. A D20-based polymer P41 showed moderate performance in OTFTs (hole mobility: 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1) and in OPVs (PCE: 3.2%).86

4. Conclusions
π-Conjugated polymers, particularly donor–acceptor (D–A)-type polymers consisting of alternating electron donor and acceptor building blocks in their repeat units, have come under the spotlight as the enabling semiconducting materials for OTFTs and OPVs in recent years. Over the past few years, numerous new electron donor and acceptor building blocks have been explored and developed. Among them, many are derived from the known building blocks, which have shown improved performance and/or new properties. A number of entirely novel structures have also been developed, which demonstrated their great potential as building blocks for constructing high performance semiconducting materials. We believe that the exploration and development of new conjugated structures and modification of existing building blocks for polymer semiconductors will continue to contribute significantly to the field of printed OTFTs and OPVs. On the other hand, side chain engineering, screening the combination with existing building blocks, as well as optimization of material processing and device fabrication are proven and will be tedious, challenging, yet critical to gain insight into the potential of a new building block for target applications. With a better understanding of the structure–performance relationship, next-generation polymer semiconductors based on novel building blocks are expected to bring the performance of OTFTs and OPVs to the next level that will reveal the amorphous and even polycrystalline silicon based devices for widespread application in printed electronics.
