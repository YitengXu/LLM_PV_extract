    , Accepted 19th May 2015First published on 21st May 2015AbstractA new low band gap conjugated polymer containing a dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTS) donor unit and a fluorinated 4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTffBT) acceptor unit was synthesized by Stille cross-coupling polymerization. The structural and thermal properties of the copolymer were characterized by using nuclear magnetic resonance, gel permeation chromatography and thermogravimetric analysis. This copolymer shows good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature of 325 °C and a broad absorption band from 300 to 800 nm. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated to be −5.28 and −3.66 eV, with an electrochemical band gap of 1.62 eV. Efficient bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated by blending this copolymer with PC71BM, and they reached a power conversion efficiency up to 5.26% under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 illumination, indicating that PDTS–DTffBT is a potential candidate for polymer solar cells.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted wide attention in recent years due to their advantages of low cost, easy processing, light weight, being mechanically flexible and suitable for large-area fabrication.1 The most efficiently used architecture of polymer photovoltaic devices is the so-called bulk heterojunction (BHJ) in which the active layer consists of a blend of conjugated polymer donors and fullerene derivative acceptors.2 Over the past decade, BHJ solar cells based on regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) blend have been extensively studied and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have reached 4–5%.3 Although P3HT exhibits good charge transfer and separation properties, further improvement in PCE is difficult due to its relatively large band gap.4 To enhance light harvesting ability, many low band gap conjugated polymers have been designed and synthesized successfully.
One feasible approach for obtaining low band gap polymers is to design donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated copolymers with alternating electron donor and electron acceptor units among the polymer main chains.5 Thus, through the design and selection of donor and acceptor building units, the electronic and optical properties of D–A copolymers can be tuned. The intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the electron donor to the electron acceptor unit can enhance the π–π stacking between polymer main chains and effectively reduce the band gap.6 Many D–A low band gap copolymers have been applied in PSCs as donors and exhibited high short circuit current and PCE. However, these devices usually exhibit a low open circuit voltage (Voc), which limits their PCEs.7 According to the BHJ photovoltaic device model and experimental results, the Voc is determined by the energy difference between the HOMO level of the copolymer and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the PCBM.8
Introduction of fluorine atoms into the polymer backbone is very popular, since their small size is expected to minimize the undesired steric hindrance, and their high electron affinity property could reduce the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the resulting polymers.9 Therefore, solar cell devices based on fluorinated polymers showed higher Voc and PCE in comparison with the corresponding non-fluorinated polymers. For instance, Luping Yu and co-authors reported higher Voc by introducing a fluorine atom into the thieno[3,4-b] unit, and a PCE of 6.1% was achieved.10 Hou and co-authors synthesized PBDTTT-C with a fluorine atom to lower the HOMO energy level and obtained a relatively high Voc of 0.76 V, and a PCE of 7.73%.11 Recently, a novel fluorinated electron acceptor unit, 5,6-difluoro-4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTffBT), has been developed and the conjugated polymers based on that have attracted much attention and showed PCE up to 8%.12
Recently, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTS)-based conjugated copolymers have shown very promising properties for use in PSCs, since the planar conjugated structure is favorable for cofacial stacking, thus benefiting charge transportation and absorption in long wavelengths.13 DTS was copolymerized with the electron acceptor 4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) unit, and the resulting polymer, PDTS–DTBT, exhibited PCE up to 3.45%.14 However, the Voc of these devices was only 0.6 V, which limits their PCEs.
Here, we introduced a DTffBT unit as an acceptor unit to synthesize a DTS-based copolymer, poly{4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole-alt-5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole} (PDTS–DTffBT). The DTffBT unit has strong electron affinity and should behave as an electron withdrawing unit in the polymer backbone leading to a low HOMO energy level, which is the desired property to increase the air stability of the polymer and the Voc in PDTS–DTffBT based photovoltaic devices. The UV-vis absorption spectrum showed that the PDTS–DTffBT solid film covered a strong broad absorption range from 300 to 800 nm, which is an extremely desirable absorption for PSC application. PDTS–DTffBT displayed a deeper HOMO energy level of −5.28 eV and the PCE of the PSC with PDTS–DTffBT as the donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor reached 5.26%.
Experimental
Measurements and characterization

1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 600 MHz spectrometer with chloroform-d as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. The elemental analysis was carried out with a Thermoquest CHNS-Ovelemental analyzer. The gel permeation chromatographic (GPC) analysis was carried out with a Waters 410 instrument with tetrahydrofuran as the eluent (flow rate: 1 mL min−1, at 35 °C) and polystyrene as the standard. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Perkin Elmer Pyris 1 analyzer under a nitrogen atmosphere (100 mL min−1) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. UV-visible absorption spectra were measured using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer. Electrochemical measurements of the copolymer were performed with a Bioanalytical Systems BAS 10 B/W electrochemical workstation.
Photovoltaic device fabrication and characterization
The solar cells were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Polymer:PC71BM blend/LiF/Al. The ITO glass substrates were pre-cleaned with a detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol sequentially. After UV/ozone treatment for 10 min, highly conducting poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P, Al 4083) was spincast (5000 rpm) at a thickness of ∼40 nm from aqueous solution (after passing through a 0.22 μm filter). The substrate was annealed at 140 °C for 30 min on a hot plate. The active layer contained a blend of copolymers as the electron donor and PC71BM as the electron acceptor, which was prepared using different weight ratios (1:1–1:4, w/w) in dichlorobenzene (10 mg mL−1) for copolymers. The active layers were obtained by spin coating the blend solutions on top of the PEDOT:PSS film and the thickness of the films was ∼95 nm, as measured with the Ambios Technology XP-2. Subsequently, LiF (0.6 nm) and Al (100 nm) electrodes were deposited via thermal evaporation in a vacuum (5 × 10−4 Pa) in thickness of approximately. The active area was about 6.4 mm2. Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter in the dark and under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation (Sciencetech SS-0.5K Solar Simulator). The light intensity was measured by using a photometer (International light, IL1400) and corrected by a standard silicon solar cell. All the measurements were performed under ambient atmosphere at room temperature.

All reagents were purchased from either Acros or Aldrich Chemical Co. and used without further purification, unless otherwise noted. In synthetic preparations, diethyl ether, THF and toluene were dried by distillation from sodium/benzophenone under nitrogen. Similarly, DMF and dichloromethane were distilled from CaH2 under nitrogen. 5,6-Difluoro-4,7-diiodo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (1),9a,15 4-(hexyl-2-thienyl)-stannane (2),16 5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (3),9a,15 and 4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (4)18 were prepared according to reported procedures.

Results and discussion
On the basis of the D–A concept, the strong electron donating DTS unit and strong withdrawing DTffBT unit were utilized to synthesize the low band gap PDTS–DTffBT copolymer. The synthetic routes to the monomers and the corresponding copolymer are shown (PDTS–DTffBT) in Schemes 1 and 2. The PDTS–DTffBT was obtained by reacting the corresponding bis(stannyl) monomer (DTS) with monomer (DTffBT) via Stille coupling polymerization. The resulting polymer was collected by precipitating the polymer solution in methanol and filtered. It was Soxhlet extracted sequentially with methanol, hexane, and chloroform to remove the residual catalyst and oligomers. The polymer PDTS–DTffBT exhibits an excellent film casting property, as well as good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, and chlorobenzene. The average molecular weight (Mw) of the resulting copolymer was measured to be 24300 g mol−1 with a polydispersity (PDI) of 1.52 by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with THF as the solvent. Fig. 1 shows the thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) curve of the resulting copolymer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. It shows high thermal stability at 325 °C, which indicates that the thermal stability of PDTS–DTFBT is good enough for its application in optoelectronic devices.

Optical properties
The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra measured for the copolymer PDTS–DTffBT in dilute solution and solid films are shown in Fig. 2, and the main optical properties are summarized in Table 1. PBDT–DTffBT in dilute chloroform solution exhibits two absorption peaks at 434 and 572 nm, respectively, covering a broad wavelength range from 300 to 700 nm, which benefits from its D–A polymer backbone. The absorption peak at 434 nm corresponds to the π–π* absorption of the conjugated copolymer backbone, and the strong absorption band in the longer wavelength region having an absorption peak at 572 nm is attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer transition from the DTS donor unit to DTffBT acceptor unit.19 In solid films, the absorption of the copolymer becomes broader and it significantly red shifted with the maximum absorption peak located at 652 nm. Compared to its counterpart in dilute solution, the absorption spectrum of PBDT–DTffBT in the thin film exhibited a red shift by about 80 nm, indicating a more planar polymer chain structure/or the degree of interchain π-stacking in the solid state.20 The optical band gap of PDTS–DTffBT is 1.58 eV, calculated from the absorption edge of the thin solid film.

Electrochemical properties
Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry is usually used to investigate the redox behavior of a polymer and to estimate its HOMO and LUMO levels. Cyclic votammetry of the polymer in films was performed in acetonitrile with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 with platinum button working electrodes, a platinum wire counter electrode, and an Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode under a N2 atmosphere. Ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was used as the internal standard.
The redox curve of the polymer is presented in Fig. 3. On the anodic sweep, PDTS–DTffBT showed a reversible oxidation with an onset potential of 0.57 V (versus Ag/Ag+). In contrast, the cathodic sweep showed an onset reversible reduction potential of 1.05 V.
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammogram of the PDTS–DTFBT film on a platinum electrode measured in 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6 acetonitrile solution at a rate of 50 mV s−1. 
From the onset oxidation potential and the onset reduction potential of the PDTS–DTffBT, its HOMO and LUMO levels as well as the band gap were calculated according to the following equations:21HOMO (eV) = −e(Eonsetox + 4.71)LUMO (eV) = −e(Eonsetred + 4.71)Eecg (eV) = e(Eonsetox – Eonsetred)where Eonsetox and Eonsetred are the measured onset potentials relative to Ag/Ag+.
The results of the electrochemical measurements and calculated energy levels of PDTS–DTffBT are listed in Table 1. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PDTS–DTffBT were estimated to be 5.28 and 3.66 eV, respectively. PDTS–DTffBT possesses deeply low-lying HOMO and LUMO energy levels than those of non-fluorinated polymers, which indicates the role of the incorporated electron deficient fluorine atom in decreasing the energy levels of HOMO and LUMO. In addition, the relatively low-lying HOMO level may be favorable for the improvement of the Voc when fabricating the photovoltaic devices with and PCBM as the acceptor. The electrochemical band gap of the copolymer PDTS–DTffBT was calculated to be 1.62 eV, which is slightly higher than the optical band gap within the experimental error.
Theoretical calculation

Fig. 4 depicts the electron state density distribution for the HOMO and LUMO of the analogous monomer PDTS–DTffBT based on the B3LYP/6-31G* level. To simplify the calculation, only one repeating unit of the copolymer was subjected to the calculation. The LUMO of the copolymer is mainly localized on the DTffBT acceptor unit, while the HOMO is distributed over the entire conjugated molecular backbone, which indicates that the introduction of the fluorine atoms significantly affects the LUMO and HOMO level of the corresponding copolymer. For comparison, the DFT-calculated results of the analogous monomer of the non-fluorinated copolymer are also shown in Fig. 4. Both the HOMO and LUMO levels of PDTS–DTffBT are slightly lower than that of the non-fluorinated copolymer, which is in agreement with the experimental results estimated from the electrochemical measurements.

Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic properties of PDTS–DTffBT were investigated with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (P VP AI 4083)/PDTS–DTffBT:PC71BM/LiF/Al, where poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was used to facilitate hole extraction and lithium fluoride (LiF) was used for hole blocking and electron extraction. The photoactive layers were spin-coated from dichlorobenzene (DCB) solutions at various PDTS–DTffBT:PC71BM blend compositions.

Fig. 5 shows the typical current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of various weight ratios under one sun of simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). Corresponding performance parameters of these devices are summarized in Table 2. The Voc values of all devices range from 0.71 to 0.72 V. Based on the explanation proposed by Scharber. M. C. et al.,8a the Voc value of a BHJ photovoltaic device is related to the energy difference between the HOMO energy level of the donor component and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor component, and can be theoretically calculated using the following formula, Voc = 1/e(|EDonorHOMO| − |EPCBMLUMO|) − 0.3 V. Finally the theoretically estimated Voc value is equal to 0.68 V, which is very close to the practically measured results ranging from 0.71 to 0.72 V for all devices. The Voc values of these devices are about 0.12 V higher than those of non-fluorinated copolymers, attributed to the much lower HOMO level. Among these devices prepared using DCB as the processing solvent, the best device performance was obtained at a weight ratio of 1:2, with Voc = 0.72 V, Jsc = 10.07 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.45, and an overall PCE of 3.26%. So we chose the 1:2 weight ratio for further device optimization by thermal annealing (TA). When the active layer is annealed at 120 °C for 5 min, the Jsc improves slightly from 10.07 to 10.85 mA cm−2, the FF increases from 45 to 48, and the Voc remains unchanged. As a result, the PCE improves from 3.26% to 3.78%.

It is worthwhile to note that the processing additive, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), played an important role in improving the performance of solar cell devices.22 When DIO (3%) was added into the blend solution of PDTS-DTffBT/PC71BM, and the fabricated active layer was annealed at 120 °C for 5 min, the device performance showed apparent improvement. The Jsc increased from 10.85 to 12.35 mA cm−2, and the FF increased from 48 to 60. As a result, the PCE of the device enhanced from 3.78 to 5.26%. Incorporation of DIO leads to around 39.1% enhancement of PCE due to the notably enhanced Jsc and improved FF. The J–V curves of the optimized devices (with annealing and additive) and the reference device (without annealing and additive) are shown in Fig. 6, with the corresponding performance parameters summarized in Table 2.

Fig. 7 displays external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PDTS–DTffBT:PC71BM devices prepared at 1:2 blend weight ratio.

The device with additive exhibits the highest improvement from 420 to 800 nm with the maximum EQE value of 49%. The maximum EQE values for the reference device and the thermal annealing device are 42% and 45%, respectively. The measured EQE enhancements are consistent with the increased Jsc values of the devices with thermal annealing and incorporation of DIO.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have synthesized a new D–A conjugated copolymer PDTS–DTffBT containing DTS donor and DTffBT acceptor units by the Stille-coupling reaction. This polymer possessed good thermal stability, low band gap and strong absorbance from 300 to 800 nm. PDTS–DTffBT exhibited a low-lying HOMO energy level, due to the presence of the strongly electron withdrawing DTffBT unit.
