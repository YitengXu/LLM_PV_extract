    , Accepted 16th September 2022First published on 16th September 2022AbstractDefects and energy-level offsets in distinct functional layers of perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) are recognized obstacles to achieving their high efficiency and long-term stability. Herein, we report the meticulous design and positioning of nitrogen-rich nitrogen carbide (g-C3N5) as a multifunctional additive to simultaneously optimize the intrinsic defects of a SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite layer for high-performance pero-SCs. The synergistic effect of the favorable band alignment and improved electrical conductivity, obtained by precisely positioning g-C3N5, enables the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of pero-SCs to be increased from 18.05% (g-C3N5-free) to 20.68% and significantly enhances the photo/thermal stability.

Theoretical and experimental analyses further reveal that the incorporating of g-C3N5 regulates the crystalline quality, passivates grain boundary/surface defects and boosts the moisture resistance of photovoltaic devices. This work proves the charming properties and ingenious design of g-C3N5 as a multifunctional material for a variety of optoelectronic devices, including light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, sensors, etc.
1. Introduction
In the past decade, solution-processed halide perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) have gradually occupied a dominant position in the photovoltaic field with superb power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 25% and simple manufacturing processes, demonstrating great commercial potential.1–4 The realization of this outstanding performance is due to the combination of the intrinsic merits of perovskite crystals, the most notable of which are their tunable bandgap, small exciton-binding energy, high absorption coefficient, and long photocarrier diffusion distance.5,6 Nevertheless, the theoretical efficiency of pero-SCs exceeds 30%, which means that the breakthrough of PCE is still expected. Moreover, the operational stability and moisture resistance of pero-SCs are also the main obstacles to further commercial application.
As we know, for pero-SCs as a multi-layer device, the final value of the overall performance depends on the optimization of each functional layer, as well as proper interface engineering.7,8 Furthermore, the development of a suitable electron transport layer (ETL) is crucial for realizing high-performance pero-SCs, and many potential materials have been explored (e.g., TiO2, SnO2, ZnO and MXenes).9–12 Compared with its powerful competitors, SnO2 has become one of the most widely studied ETLs in planar pero-SCs owing to its suitable energy band structure, excellent optical stability, and high electron mobility.13 Noticeably, SnO2 as a sensible choice for the ETL still needs further improvement and optimization; especially the inevitable high density of defect states will induce a band bending phenomenon and significantly deteriorate electrical conductivity.14,15 Moreover, an ideal perovskite active layer possesses the characteristics of large grain size, high crystallinity, and low defect density to ensure stable power output of photovoltaic devices.16 Unfortunately, perovskite films rapidly prepared by low-temperature solution processing are inclined to form small-sized perovskite grains and more grain boundaries, resulting in the generation of a large number of undesirable defects. Besides causing severe recombination and ion migration, these defects are also easily attacked by water molecules to induce the initial decomposition of perovskite films.17,18 Evidently, it is increasingly appreciated that the effective combination of multi-layer optimization will further improve the performance of pero-SCs and extend the shelf life.
Up to now, two main directions of multi-layer optimization engineering have been shown to be effective in enhancing device efficiency and stability, including multiple additive engineering and multiple interface passivation.19,20 Besides, the simultaneous optimization of multiple functional layers or interfaces by using the same functional material is further considered to synergistically improve the performance of planar pero-SCs and simplify the device fabrication process. Peng et al. used an ultrathin polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) film to simultaneously passivate perovskite-electron transport layer and perovskite-hole transport layer interfaces, resulting in pero-SCs with an efficiency of 20.8% accompanied by an outstanding open circuit voltage of up to 1.22 V for ≈1.6 eV bandgap perovskite.21 Zhang et al. utilized two-dimensional (2D) black phosphorene (BP) carries with a customized thickness to optimize the interface between perovskite and adjacent charge transport layers to construct high-performance pero-SCs. The significantly improved PCE in such pero-SCs is attributed to accelerated charge extraction/separation, as well as improved light absorption.22 Compared with interface passivation engineering, additive engineering possesses non-negligible advantages, such as improving the crystalline quality of thin films and optimizing grain boundaries/surface defects, while avoiding the creation of additional interfaces to reduce interfacial charge loss.23 Regrettably, there are few reports of multifunctional additives capable of simultaneously ameliorating perovskite absorbers and/or functional components, implying that this field is still in its infancy. In view of the recent progress in pero-SC additives, exploring novel functional materials to improve efficiency and simplify the manufacturing process is of great significance for the photovoltaic field.
Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been widely explored and applied in the photovoltaic field due to its good optoelectronic properties.24 Wang et al. optimized an ETL/perovskite interface by using thiazole modified g-C3N4 to achieve significant enhancement of PCEs.25 Chen et al. designed and fabricated SnO2/g-C3N4 quantum dot composites as functional electron transport layers to obtain efficient and stable photovoltaic devices.26 Interestingly, due to the transition between the weak local π–π* states of sp2 hybridization of C and N, nitrogen-rich graphitic nitride (g-C3N5) obtained by introducing triazole units into the triazine network has a smaller optical band gap (about 2.2 eV) than g-C3N4 (about 2.7 eV), which means that g-C3N5 has stronger visible light absorption ability.27 Meanwhile, g-C3N5 exhibits better electrical conductivity than g-C3N4 because its abundant pyrrole N sites can donate a large number of electrons.28 And these pyrrolic N sites can also establish strong interactions with uncoordinated Pb2+ ions in perovskites, which is beneficial to passivate defects and further enhance the open circuit voltage of photovoltaic devices.
Here, we report the utilization of g-C3N5 as a novel multifunctional modulator with simultaneous optimization of a SnO2 ETL and perovskite layer to fabricate high-performance pero-SCs for the first time. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that the incorporation of g-C3N5 into the SnO2 ETL can promote grain growth and advances conductivity by filling the electron traps. Simultaneously, the g-C3N5 incorporated perovskite layer will regulate the crystallization dynamics of perovskite crystals, passivate the charge recombination centers to reduce defect states and energy disorder, and optimize the energy level arrangement to boost the extraction of carriers from different functional interfaces. Therefore, the best-combination MAPbI3-based pero-SCs display a champion PCE of 20.68% with excellent light/thermal stability and shelf life. Furthermore, this multiple optimization strategy is generalized to CsFAMA-based pero-SCs, achieving a competitive PCE of 22.34% with an open-circuit voltage reaching 1.18 V, which is among the best in the same type of device (Table S1†). By incorporating novel multifunctional materials to achieve multi-layer optimization and energy level regulation, our efforts may provide new perspectives for realizing high-performance and durable perovskite-based photovoltaic devices.
2. Results and discussion
Metal-free g-C3N5 was successfully synthesized by a facile one-step thermal polymerization method (Fig. S1†). The crystal construction and phase component of g-C3N5 were expounded by performing powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). As exposed in Fig. 1a, the identifiable diffraction signals at 2θ = 13.4° (100) and 27.6° (002) can be well correlated with the in-plane structural order and the characteristic crystal plane packing of the aromatic system.26,27 The functional groups and structural features of g-C3N5 were further characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Fig. 1b). The broad peaks around 3167 cm−1 are identified as surface residual-NH2 and stretching vibration of –OH groups originating from adsorbed water molecules. The peaks at 1238, 1320, 1403, 1453 and 1624 cm−1 are correlated with the typical signals for CN and C–N bonds in heterocyclic stretching vibrations. The peaks at 803 cm−1 are attributed to the characteristic stretching mode of the triazine unit. These results are consistent with previous reports, confirming the successful construction of g-C3N5.28 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization reveals that the morphology of the pristine g-C3N5 powder is an ultra-thin 2D layered material (Fig. 1c). Notably, the crystallinity of the g-C3N5 nanosheets will decrease under electron beam irradiation. The surface functional groups and electronic states of g-C3N5 were inspected by performing the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) strategy. The survey XPS spectrum shows that the prepared g-C3N5 powder is mainly composed of C and N elements, accompanied by a small amount of O element brought about by adsorbed moisture and CO2 (Fig. S2†). The deconvoluted high-resolution C 1s spectrum shows that the signal peaks located at 288.3 and 289.2 eV can be attributed to NC–N2 and C–NH2 groups, while the peaks around 284.8 eV are mainly from adventitious C (Fig. 1d). As revealed in Fig. 1e, the high-resolution N 1s spectrum displays doublets at 398.8 and 400.9 eV, which are dominated by CN–C and C–NN–C/–NH2 groups.29 Meanwhile, the signal peaks at 294.1 eV in the C 1s spectrum and 405.2 eV in the N 1s spectrum are from π–π*.30 The UV-vis absorption spectrum indicates that g-C3N5 possesses superior light absorption in the visible region, and its absorption edge is about 650 nm (Fig. 1f). Furthermore, the interrelated band gap of g-C3N5 is calculated to be 1.96 eV, which is similar to the band gap (1.9924 eV) obtained by first-principles density functional theory (DFT) shown in Fig. S3.†

As a result of the excellent electronic properties of g-C3N5, it is expected to further reveal the positive effect of the incorporation of g-C3N5 on the SnO2 ETL. To explore the effect of the g-C3N5 additive on the growth of the SnO2 film, top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, compared with the pristine SnO2 film, the grain size in the SnO2:g-C3N5 film is larger without obvious pinholes, signifying that the introduction of g-C3N5 promotes the crystallization of the SnO2 film, which will be beneficial to reduce surface defects. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was also used to confirm the effect of the incorporation of g-C3N5 on the morphology of the SnO2 film (Fig. S4†). The results show that the root-mean square roughness (RMS) of SnO2 and SnO2:g-C3N5 films is about 13.1 nm and 8.85 nm, respectively, which imply that the effect of the introduction of g-C3N5 on the roughness of the SnO2 film is positive. The lower roughness of the SnO2 ETL will facilitate the growth of precursor PbI2 thin films to obtain high-quality perovskite crystals, and establish a good interfacial contact between the perovskite layer and SnO2 ETL. As revealed in Fig. 2c, the characteristic signals of Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 in the Sn 3d scanned spectra for both films can be identified as the tetravalent oxidation state of Sn in rutile SnO2.31 Moreover, the Sn 3d peak of the SnO2:g-C3N5 film is slightly shifted by about 0.3 eV towards a lower binding energy compared with the pristine SnO2 film, signifying that the charge transfer from g-C3N5 to SnO2 enhances the electron cloud density of Sn4+, which will increase the charge density of SnO2 films to improve the conductivity. Furthermore, both pristine SnO2 and SnO2:g-C3N5 films exhibit excellent light transmittance, which helps to ensure good light absorption in the perovskite layer (Fig. 2d). Based on Tauc plots evolved from the UV-vis absorption spectra, the bandgaps of SnO2 and SnO2:g-C3N5 films can be calculated to be 4.02 and 4.05eV, respectively (Fig. S5†). UPS analysis was also employed to check the energy band structures of SnO2 and SnO2:g-C3N5 films (Fig. 2e). On the basis of the linear intersection method, the ECB/EVB of SnO2 and SnO2:g-C3N5 films is estimated to be −4.06 eV/−8.08 eV and −3.97 eV/−8.02 eV, respectively. The optimized energy level of the SnO2 ETL can ensure better selective extraction of electrons from the perovskite layer and reduce the energy loss at the interface.

To elucidate the critical effect of g-C3N5 on the photoelectric performance of the SnO2 ETL, the electrical conductivity of the resultant films was investigated with and without light irradiation (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) (Fig. 2f). In the absence of light irradiation, the electrical conductivity of the SnO2:g-C3N5 film is higher than that of the pristine SnO2 film. Intriguingly and importantly, the electrical conductivity of the SnO2:g-C3N5 film is significantly ameliorated after illumination compared to the pristine SnO2 film. Furthermore, the transient photocurrent of the SnO2:g-C3N5 film from Fig. S6† shows that the time required for the current to reach its maximum value with illumination is less than the time required for the current to recover its initial value without illumination. These results indicate that the incorporation of g-C3N5 can enhance the electron transport ability of the SnO2 film, and the related electrical conductivity is further improved under illumination. And this conclusion is also sustained by space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement, and electron-only devices (ITO/SnO2/PCBM/Ag) were manufactured to accurately quantify the trap density (Ntrap). Fig. 2g and h display the corresponding I–V curves, in which the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) can be derived from the kink point between ohmic linearity and space current nonlinearity.32,33 The trap-state density is resolved vis a vis VTFL according to the following formula: VTFL = eNtrapL2/(2εε0), where L and e are the thickness of the film (30 nm) and the elementary charge, respectively. ε0 and ε are the vacuum permittivity and the relative dielectric constant. It can be observed that the calculated Ntrap value can be decreased from 2.04 × 1016 cm−3 to 6.82 × 1015 cm−3 after incorporating g-C3N5, and the relevant parameters are summarized in Table S2.† More importantly, compared with the pristine SnO2 film, the defect density of the SnO2:g-C3N5 film decreased significantly under continuous irradiation. This is attributed to the fact that electrons moving from g-C3N5 to SnO2 can fill the electron traps in the SnO2 ETL. The significantly reduced trap density and ameliorated electrical conductivity can effectively retard the charge accumulation in the SnO2 ETL to advance the rapid transmission and transfer of electrons at the interface.34,35 As shown in Fig. 2i, based on the above characterization analysis and the energy band information of g-C3N5 reported in the previous literature, a schematic diagram of the improved electrical conductivity of the SnO2 ETL after the incorporation of g-C3N5 is obtained.26,27 When exposed to light radiation, the electrons on the VB of g-C3N5 are easily activated and jump to its CB. As the CB potential of g-C3N5 is more positive, the high-energy electrons accumulated in the CB of g-C3N5 will spontaneously flow to the CB of SnO2, further filling the electron defects on the deep energy level of SnO2. Thus, the electrical conductivity of the SnO2 ETL is significantly improved, and electron loss is alleviated, resulting in better device performance.

Fig. 3a and b display the top-view SEM images of the pristine perovskite and the perovskite@g-C3N5 films. The results show that the perovskite@g-C3N5 film possesses larger grain sizes and fewer grain boundaries compared with the pristine perovskite film, which shows that the incorporation of g-C3N5 can promote the better crystallization of the perovskite layer. The g-C3N5 distributed at the grain boundary can well improve the moisture resistance and stability of the film, which is reflected in the increase of the water contact angle of the perovskite film from 20.9° to 42.7° (Fig. 3c). XRD analysis elucidates the structural information of the resultant perovskite films, as portrayed in Fig. 3d. Apparently, compared with the pristine perovskite film, the main diffraction peak (14.3° (110)) of the perovskite@g-C3N5 film is significantly enhanced, indicating that the introduction of g-C3N5 can improve the crystallization quality of the perovskite layer. Simultaneously, the characteristic signal (12.7°) of PbI2 is decreased, which is attributed to the strong interaction between g-C3N5 and PbI2.36,37 Furthermore, the (110) crystal plane of the g-C3N5 incorporated perovskite film has a smaller full width at half maximum (FWHM) value, implying a larger domain size (Fig. S7†). The improved crystallization of the perovskite layer is attributed to the fact that g-C3N5 can act as an efficient heterogeneous nucleation site to reduce the Gibbs free energy required for nucleation, thereby significantly lowering the energy barrier to promote crystallization. As depicted in Fig. 3e, the FTIR spectra show that the vibrational signals of N–H bending and N–H stretching of MAPbI3 are slightly negatively shifted after the incorporation of g-C3N5, indicating the formation of hydrogen bonds between the H atoms of MA+ and the N atoms of g-C3N5.38 These results demonstrate that the incorporation of g-C3N5 can promote crystallization and terminate the sub-surface defects of perovskites. Additionally, the UV-vis absorption spectra in Fig. 3f show that the absorption intensity of the perovskite film is slightly enhanced after the introduction of g-C3N5. The results of Tauc plots and UPS spectra in Fig. S8 and S9† show that the bandgap energies of the prepared perovskite films are the same about 1.60 eV, while the slightly upward shifted Fermi level in the perovskite@g-C3N5 film is attributed to the passivation effect of the amino group of g-C3N5, and Table S3† further summarizes the relevant energy band information.39,40

A series of photoelectrochemical measurements were executed to further explicate the internal properties of the resultant perovskite films. The surface properties of perovskite films were inspected by performing the XPS strategy. As revealed in Fig. 3g, the XPS signal peak of the Pb 4f orbital in the perovskite@g-C3N5 film displays a slight negative shift compared to the pristine perovskite film, demonstrating that the lone pair electrons from N in g-C3N5 can interact with uncoordinated Pb2+ to passivate defects and inhibit ion migration.41,42 Furthermore, since there is no significant binding effect, no change in the core-level I 3d peak is observed (Fig. S10†). Additionally, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra measurements were applied to monitor the carrier transport dynamics in the perovskite films after the incorporation of g-C3N5 (Fig. 3h and i). Intriguingly and prominently, the PL intensity of the perovskite@g-C3N5 film is 2.6-fold higher than that of the pristine perovskite film, further supporting the higher perovskite crystallinity. The blue-shift of the emission peak from 770 nm to 767 nm also indicates a good passivation effect.43 TRPL measurements were further performed to gain insight into carrier transport and recombination in the perovskite layer. All the analysis results were investigated by implementing a bi-exponential model, and the fitting parameters are summarized in Table S4.† Evidently, the average carrier lifetime (τave) is significantly prolonged from 13.96 ns to 23.44 ns after incorporating g-C3N5, which also indicates lower defect density and better optoelectronic properties.44 SCLC measurements were performed to explore the passivation and annihilation of defects based on an electronic-only device (ITO/SnO2/perovskite film/PCBM/Ag). As depicted in Fig. S11,† the Ntrap values with and without the addition of g-C3N5 were calculated to be about 1.27×1015 cm−3 and 2.96×1015 cm−3, respectively, evidencing the availability of defect-remediation by g-C3N5 in the perovskite film. In addition to considering deep level defects, we further explored the tail defects of the band edge (Fig. S12†). The Urbach tail profiles of the resultant perovskite films are calculated according to the following formula: α = α0exp(hν/EU), where α is the absorption coefficient, α0 is a constant and EU denotes the Urbach energy.45 Compared with the pristine perovskite films (72.81 meV), the decreased EU value of perovskite@g-C3N5 (66.21 meV) implies a lower level of electronic disorder in the lattice and better film crystallization, which is consistent with the previous XRD, SEM, and SCLC results. These characterization results show good uniformity, which strongly confirms that the multifunctional effect achieved by the addition of g-C3N5 improves the crystallization quality and moisture resistance of perovskite films and effectively passivates defects and reduces energy disorder.
To further elucidate the modulation effect of g-C3N5, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were executed to reveal the changes in the interfacial properties between perovskite and g-C3N5 (Fig. S13 and S14†). The charge density difference isosurfaces of g-C3N5 with different perovskite terminations are depicted in Fig. 4a and b. Evidently, there is a strong charge accumulation between the N atom of g-C3N5 and the H atom of the MAI-terminated slab, which implies the formation of hydrogen bonds. This will help stabilize the MA+ ions to reduce the energy disorder of the device. Furthermore, the strong charge transfer at the interface between PbI2-terminated slab and g-C3N5 not only indicates a strong coupling effect between N atoms in g-C3N5 and Pb atoms in PbI2-terminated slab, but also indirectly indicates that g-C3N5 can act as a charge transport medium between perovskite grains.46–48 These results indicate that g-C3N5 can stabilize MA+ and Pb2+ ions to improve the stability of perovskite films, while optimizing charge transport between perovskite grains to reduce charge loss. And the defect passivation effect of g-C3N5 is further verified by obtaining the relevant density of states (DOS). As shown in Fig. 4c and d, in the case of the MAI-terminated MAPbI3 slab, obvious trap states introduced by iodide vacancies are observed in both the conduction and valence bands. Besides, the DOS of the trap states did not change significantly after g-C3N5 modification compared with the control, which reflects that g-C3N5 has no potential to passivate the iodine vacancy defect. Conversely, in the case of the PbI2-terminated MAPbI3 slab, the trap states introduced by the Pb–I antisite are mainly observed in the conduction band. Meanwhile, the trap states are effectively eliminated after g-C3N5 modification, signifying that the incorporation of g-C3N5 can suppress and eliminate the Pb–I antisite defects of perovskite.49,50 Based on the above characterization and analysis, a schematic diagram of the defect passivation of g-C3N5-incorporated perovskite is shown in Fig. 4e. The incorporated g-C3N5 can well inhibit ion migration and passivate Pb–I antisite defects to improve device stability and reduce charge loss. Simultaneously, the g-C3N5 present between perovskite grains also acts as an electron transport medium to facilitate charge transport and improve moisture resistance.

Based on the aforementioned series of characterization, we know that the introduction of g-C3N5 can advance the conductivity of the SnO2 ETL, reduce the defect density and promote the crystallization process of the perovskite layer, which instigates us to further inspect the performance of photovoltaic devices under the influence of multiple optimization effects of g-C3N5. As shown in Fig. 5a, the photovoltaic devices were manufactured with a typical architecture consisting of ITO/SnO2:g-C3N5/perovskite@g-C3N5/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, and the cross-view SEM image of the complete pero-SC structure is displayed in Fig. S15.† On account of the test results of UPS and the energy band gap for SnO2 and SnO2:g-C3N5 films (Fig. 2e) as well as pristine perovskite and perovskite@g-C3N5 films (Fig. S9†), the energy level diagram of the complete device is shown in Fig. 5b. Conspicuously, the incorporation of amino-rich g-C3N5 increases the proportion of electron-donating groups on the surface of the SnO2 layer or perovskite layer, which is beneficial to reduce its work function and regulate the ECB and EVB of the corresponding layer to move slightly upward.15,51 This beneficial energy level alignment in perovskite solar cells can promote the rapid extraction of charge carriers and reduce energy loss, therefore supporting better device performance.

To inspect the effect of g-C3N5 on the photovoltaic performance of the device, we obtained the J–V curves of the resultant devices. Primarily, the concentration of g-C3N5 in the SnO2 layer or perovskite layer was optimized, and the corresponding concentrations can be determined to be 0.15 mg mL−1 and 0.3 wt%, respectively (Fig. S16 and S17†). Under the premise of the optimum concentration conditions, the J–V curves of SnO2/perovskite (control), SnO2:g-C3N5/perovskite (A1) and SnO2:g-C3N5/perovskite@g-C3N5 (A2) devices are revealed in Fig. 5c, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are recorded in Table 1. Noticeably, through the incorporation of g-C3N5 with multiple optimization effects, the photovoltaic performance of the device is greatly improved. Particularly, the A2 device displays a champion PCE of 20.68% with an excellent open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.14 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 23.04 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 78.73% under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). The significantly improved Voc, Jsc and FF in the device can be attributed to the enhanced conductivity, accelerated charge separation/extraction and optimized energy band arrangement after adding g-C3N5 into the SnO2 layer or perovskite layer. Simultaneously, the hysteresis of the device is also alleviated, and the suppressed hysteresis is intuitively displayed by calculating the hysteresis index (HI): HI = ((PCEreverse − PCEforward)/PCEreverse) × 100%. Compared with the control and A1 devices, the significantly reduced HI in the A2 device also means effective defect passivation and improved charge transport. Furthermore, the reproducibility of pero-SCs is also improved by reasonable incorporation of g-C3N5, which is revealed by the highest efficiency and narrowest PCE distribution of the A2 device (Fig. 5d). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the three cells are presented in Fig. 5e. The integrated photocurrent density derived from measured EQE spectra is calculated to be 22.16, 22.47 and 23.02 mA cm−2, respectively, which exactly matches with the Jsc value in the J–V curves. Besides, the steady-state output of the as-fabricated cells at the maximum power point (MPP) is shown in Fig. 5f. Noticeably, the A2 device maintains superb long-term stability, which is due to fewer defects and traps. Meanwhile, this passivation strategy was also applied to CsFAMA-based pero-SCs to explore its universality. As shown in Fig. S18† and Table 2, under the best optimized conditions, the CsFAMA-based pero-SCs exhibit a champion PEC of 22.34%, and maintain good repeatability and output stability. This implies that the multiple optimization effects of g-C3N5 can be extended to other types of perovskite systems for high-performance and durable pero-SCs.

The recombination mechanism of photoexcited charge carriers in the A2 device was further discussed exhaustively via the Jscversus light intensity curves (Fig. 6a). Generally, for ideal devices without an interface barrier or carrier imbalance, the corresponding slope index will approach 1.25,27 More specifically, the slope of the A2 device (0.98) is closer to the ideal value compared with the control (0.89) and A1 devices (0.95), indicating inhibited bimolecular recombination and boosted charge extraction. Fig. 6b reveals the dependence curves of Vocversus light intensity to probe the dynamic behavior of charge carriers in the whole device. The linear plots are fitted according to the following formula: Voc = n(kBT/q) ln(I′) + a, where n is the ideal factor, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, q is the elementary charge, I′ is the light intensity and a is a constant.25 The reduced ideal factor in the A2 device is indicative of an inhibited trap-assisted recombination procedure. The dark J–V curves were also obtained to determine the diode characteristics of the device, as shown in Fig. 6c. Evidently, the leakage current density of the A2 device is greatly reduced compared with that of the control and A1 devices, implying that the charge carrier recombination in the A2 device is significantly inhibited, resulting in enhanced carrier transfer and extraction. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were executed in the dark, as depicted in Fig. 6d. The results show that the A2 device possesses a smaller charge transfer resistance (RCT) and a higher carrier recombination resistance (Rrec), signifying a lower charge-transfer impedance and ameliorated interface contact that permits rapid transfer and extraction of charges in photovoltaic devices. As exposed in Fig. 6e, the PL intensity of the ITO/SnO2:g-C3N5/perovskite@g-C3N5 film is significantly attenuated in comparison with the control and ITO/SnO2:g-C3N5/perovskite films, which is mainly because the multiple optimization effect realized by the incorporation of g-C3N5 further promotes the rapid transmission of charges and reduces the recombination rate at the interface. The fitting results of TRPL analysis also show that the fluorescence lifetime of the ITO/SnO2:g-C3N5/perovskite@g-C3N5 film is greatly shortened, which is consistent with the improved performance of the A2 device (Fig. 6f and Table S4†). In terms of the above analysis results, the crucial reason for the significant improvement of the photovoltaic performance in the A2 device can be identified. The introduction of g-C3N5 improves the conductivity of the SnO2 ETL, promotes the crystallization of the perovskite layer and passivates surface defects, which is conducive to reducing non-radiative recombination and accelerating the rapid transmission of electrons. Simultaneously, the SnO2 ETL or perovskite layer after the incorporation of g-C3N5 optimizes the energy level alignment of the device, meaning reduced interface electron loss and improved energy conversion efficiency, thus providing a steady stream of forceful power for solar energy conversion.

Afterward, the operational stability data of non-encapsulated pero-SCs under the same ambient conditions were recorded to reflect the stability property (shelf life) of the resultant devices. As illustrated in Fig. 6g, the PCEs of the control and A1 devices decay dramatically after being stored in a N2 atmosphere for more than 1200 h, retaining only 89% and 92% of their initial values. In sharp contrast, the stability of the A2 device is superb under the same operating conditions, and its PCE can preserve over 96% of its initial value. Furthermore, the long-term thermal stability of non-encapsulated modules was also explored at 85 °C in the dark (Fig. 6h). Perceptibly, the A2 device shows excellent thermal stability with its PCE remaining at 82% within 200 h. Nevertheless, the A1 device maintains 64% of its initial efficiency and the control device is almost destroyed. As shown in Fig. S19,† the g-C3N5 modified perovskite film still maintains good structural stability after aging for 480 h in a high humidity environment (air conditions, >50% humidity), which also supports that the introduction of g-C3N5 can improve the moisture stability of the perovskite film. Simultaneously, the stability of three cells was further investigated under continuous one-sun irradiation (AM 1.5, Fig. 6i). The A2 device maintains over 92% of its initial efficiency within 200 h, while the efficiency of the control and A1 devices is 78% and 84%, respectively. The excellent stability allows the A2 cell to maintain more than 80% of its initial efficiency after 200 h of operation under maximum power point tracking conditions (Fig. S20†). Combined with the above series of results, the crucial reason for the significant improvement of device stability can be identified. On the one hand, the addition of g-C3N5 greatly promotes the crystallization quality and improve the moisture resistance of the device. On the other hand, the addition of g-C3N5 can effectively passivate the surface defects of perovskite films, thereby suppressing the initial decomposition caused by the defects.
3. Conclusion
In this work, we have confirmed that g-C3N5 is an effective multifunctional additive to significantly advance the photovoltaic performance and stability of pero-SCs. The results of systematic characterization and theoretical calculation show that the multiple optimization effect of g-C3N5 has great potential for reducing defects and improving charge transfer in the SnO2 ETL or perovskite layers, as well as optimizing the crystallization quality and water resistance of the whole device. Simultaneously, alleviated charge recombination and better energy band arrangement also promote the improvement of parameters in the photovoltaic device, such as Voc and FF. Therefore, the best optimized MAPbI3-based pero-SC has a champion efficiency of 20.68% with excellent long-term stability, which preserved over 96% of its initial efficiency after 1200 h. Furthermore, the multiple optimization effects of g-C3N5 were further applied to CsFAMA-based pero-SCs, achieving a competitive PCE of 22.34%. This study will provide new insights for exploring novel carbon-based materials to further realize high-performance perovskite optoelectronic devices.
