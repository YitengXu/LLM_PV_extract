By tuning the content of selenium in such quantum dots, the optical absorption spectra can be controllably widened to cover the most of the visible light range. The electron transport of such QDs can be modulated by changing the interfacial electronic energy between CdS1−xSex QDs and TiO2 nanoparticles. The QDs with optimized selenium content (x = 0.72) give a balance between a broad optical absorption and a suitable energy band alignment. The homogenous alloy CdS1−xSex QDs achieve a maximum light-harvesting efficiency over 90%, and generate a photocurrent density larger than 10 mA cm−2, which is 2.6- and 1.4-times that of binary CdS and CdSe QDs sensitized photovoltaic devices.1. IntroductionSemiconductor quantum dots (QDs) hold the promise of light harvesting due to their high extinction coefficients1,2 and size dependent bandgaps.3–5 Various binary QDs, such as CdS,6–8 CdSe,9–12 CdTe13,14 and PbS,15–17 have been thoroughly investigated as light harvesters in quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). Among these QDs, the tuning span of optical absorption by the size-dependent quantum confinement effect is usually limited to within 100 nm in the visible light range. For example, the absorbent peak of CdS QDs was adjusted between 380 and 480 nm,4 while that of CdSe QDs was tunable from 505 to 580 nm.5 The scaling law18,19 that emerges upon spherical nanocrystals suggests that the bandgaps of QDs are larger than those of the corresponding bulk materials. Therefore, greater energy is needed to excite the electrons in QDs, which leads to a shift of the absorption peaks towards ultraviolet (UV) light. One way to realize dual-directional regulation of optical absorption is to employ ternary QDs. By continuous variation of their composition, we could gain a novel approach to tune the bandgap toward the infrared, broadening the optical absorption in the whole visible light spectrum region.Far more than tuning the bandgaps, a suitable alignment of energy levels is necessary for efficient electron injection from a photoexcited QDs to a wide bandgap semiconductor in the photosensitizing architecture. On one hand, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of sensitizers have to lie sufficiently above the conduction band minimum (CBM) of wide bandgap semiconductor where the density of states (DOS) is large enough to inject electrons into the semiconductor.20 On the other hand, the excess energy of the photoinjected electrons that is over the CBM is rapidly thermalized by electron–phonon scattering and cannot be recovered as electric energy.21 The ability to tune the electronic energy alignment at the semiconductor and QD interfaces contributes to maximising the photocurrent of solar cells.The Cd chalcogenide family of QDs is being investigated for sensitized solar cells because the band diagram of such dots matches that of TiO2, thus offering an efficient pathway for charge injection.22–25 Compared with CdSe QDs, CdS QDs have a higher monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE),26 which is attributed to higher conduction band edges with respect to those of TiO2. However, the relatively large bandgap of CdS (2.25 eV in bulk) triggers a narrow light absorption below 550 nm, compared to that of CdSe (1.70 eV in bulk). This difference raises the possibility to better engineer the QDs by creating the ternary alloy CdS1−xSex to simultaneously optimize both band alignment and light harvesting over the whole visible light spectrum range.The difficulty in synthesis of ternary alloyed QDs lies in the control of their crystal structure, be it homogeneous or segregated nanocrystals. To achieve a homogeneous alloy, the growth rates of the constituents must be equal.27 As the solubility product constant (Ksp) of CdSe (1.4 × 10−35) is much smaller than that of CdS (8 × 10−27), synthesizing a homogeneous CdS1−xSex alloy by mixing all components in precursors would be extremely difficult, although some attempts have been reported by Jang et al.28 Instead of generating alloyed CdS1−xSex QDs, segregated structures have been formed by current research.29,30 Other compound QDs, like core–shell CdS/CdSe QDs have been reported.31 The two different zinc blende structures were synthesized without the presence of any defect or polytypism. In addition, another interesting structure of CdSe/CdS dot-in-rod nanocrystals has been synthesized by G. Rainò et al. These heteronanostructures offer new prospects to tailor their optical properties, as they take advantage of a small conduction band offset allowing tunability of the electron delocalization from type-I toward quasitype-II.32 The heterostructure of quantum dot-quantum well nanocrystals has also been investigated in recent years, which holds promise of tunable photoluminescence (PL) over the whole visible range.33 To date, reports of facile methods to produce homogeneous ternary CdS1−xSex QDs have been exclusively via an organic solvent method.34 The QDs prepared via this approach have a linear change in lattice parameters but are wrapped by surface ligands of tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO), which prevent charge injection from QDs to TiO2 nanoparticles in QDSSCs.35To surmount the imperfections induced by surface ligands, here we report a novel surface ion transfer method to grow ternary alloy CdS1−xSex QDs in situ on TiO2 nanoparticles. By tuning the content of selenium in such QDs, the optical absorption band-edge can be controllably widened to 650 nm. We investigated quantitatively the electronic energy alignment at the interface between CdS1−xSex QDs and TiO2 nanoparticles, while the QDs with optimized Se content (x = 0.72) gave a balance between a broad optical absorption and a suitable band alignment. The electron transport was determined by employing intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS). The relationship between electron transport time and interfacial electronic energy alignment provided us a way to modulate the electron transfer by tuning the CBM of QDs. The homogenous alloyed CdS1−xSex QDs generated a maximum short circuit current density of 10.19 mA cm−2, which is higher than those of binary CdS and CdSe QD-sensitized devices.2. Experimental2.1 Preparation of TiO2 photoanodesA dense TiO2 nanoparticle film (∼10 μm in thickness, 20 nm in diameter) and a scattering layer (∼5 μm, 400 nm in diameter) were prepared by a screen-printing method onto fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass. The substrate was sintered at 500 °C for 1 h to form anatase nanocrystals. After sintering, the TiO2 electrode was immersed in TiCl4 (50 mM) aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min. The film was then annealed at 450 °C for 30 min.2.2 In situ synthesis of binary CdS QDsThe TiO2 electrodes were first treated by dipping into thioglycolic acid, kept for 5 min and dried in a nitrogen flow. The electrodes were then immersed in ethanol and methanol based solutions for 1 min each, the first containing Cd(NO3)2 (0.1 M) and the second containing Na2S·5H2O (0.1 M). Following each immersion, the electrodes were rinsed for 30 s in order to remove the excess of each precursor. This alternate dipping procedure is referred to as one cycle. After 5 cycles, the CdS QDs were successfully deposited onto the TiO2 films.2.3 Controlled growth of ternary CdS1−xSex QDsThe gradient CdS1−xSex QDs were obtained by surface selenization of a CdS QD-decorated TiO2 substrate. A Se2− source solution was prepared by dissolving 5 mM of NaBH4 and 2.5 mM of Se in distilled water under Ar gas protection. Gradient CdS1−xSex QDs were formed by immersing the CdS QD decorated TiO2 substrate in the Se2− source solution at 50 °C with reaction times from 30 s to 3 h. The samples were then washed with deionized water and dried in a nitrogen flow. We annealed the samples at a temperature between 150 and 300 °C under Ar atmosphere to transfer the gradient CdS1−xSex QDs into homogeneous ternary alloys.2.4 Characterization of ternary CdS1−xSex QDsMorphological and phase structural studies were performed with an SEM (JSM-6500F) and a TEM (JEOL-2100F). Elemental mapping and composition analysis on the nanoscale was carried out by the EDX integrated in the SEM and TEM, respectively. Absorption spectra were recorded with a Lambda-750 UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer). Photo-electron spectroscopy (AC-3, Riken) was used to study electronic structures of the interfacial deposits.2.5 Light harvesting efficiency (LHE) measurementThe LHE study was carried out on thin cover glass (0.14 mm) to avoid scattered light leaking from the glass substrate side.36,37 TiO2 was deposited onto a thin glass plate and covered by a drop of aqueous solution and the other thin glass plate. Aqueous solution was employed to represent the electrolyte solvent in quantum dot sensitized solar cells. Both transmittance and absorbance spectra of bare and QDs sensitized TiO2 films were measured by the integrating sphere detector in a Lambda-750 UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer).2.6 Preparation of counter electrodeThe Cu2S counter electrode was fabricated by a chemical bath deposition (CBD) process on FTO glass. Firstly, the 25 mM Na2S2O3·5H2O and 25 mM Cu(SO4)2·5H2O was mixed in aqueous solution. Then, the clean FTO glass was immersed into the solution and kept at 70 °C for 1 hour under Ar gas protection. Finally, the second step was repeated twice by changing aqueous solution to achieve a desired thickness of Cu2S film.2.7 Assembly of solar cell devicesA thin ZnS layer was coated onto each CdS1−xSex QD-decorated TiO2 photoanode before device construction, to passivate the charge carrier traps induced by dangling orbitals and surface defects. The coating of ZnS was accomplished by dipping the CdS1−xSex QD decorated TiO2 substrates alternately into Zn(NO3)2 (0.1 M) and Na2S (0.1 M) aqueous solutions. This dipping procedure was repeated once. The assembly of complete photovoltaic cells was accomplished by hot pressing the TiO2/CdS1−xSex electrode, Cu2S coated counter electrode, and 30 μm thick sealing spacer (Surlyn, Solaronix). The redox pair in this study was polysulfide (S2−/Sx2−) with the following composition: Na2S (1 M), S (1 M), and NaOH (0.1 M).2.8 Device measurementCurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured by using a black metal mask with an aperture area of 0.2304 cm2 under standard air mass 1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm−2, WXS-90S-L2, Wacom Denso Co., Japan).10 The scan mode was conducted from Jsc to Voc. IPCE were measured with mono-chromatic incident light of 1016 photon per cm2 under 100 mW cm−2 white bias light in DC mode (CEP-2000, Bunko-Keiki).3. Results and discussionThe strategy for synthesis of ternary CdS1−xSex QDs is illustrated in Fig. 1a. The solubility product constant (Ksp) of CdSe (1.4 × 10−35) is eight orders of magnitude smaller than that of CdS (8 × 10−27). This implies that the CdS QDs can be used as sacrificial templates to synthesize more stable CdSe by an anion exchange process. Firstly, the CdS QDs were in situ decorated onto a TiO2 substrate using thioglycolic acid (TGA) as linker molecules.8,38 After surface selenization of the CdS QDs with Se2− ions in aqueous solution, some of the S2− ions were replaced by Se2− from the surface to center of the QDs; this process was controlled by adjusting the ion exchange time and temperature. The reaction process can be expressed by reaction (1) and (2): Se + 2BH4 → Se2− + 2BH3 + H2(1) CdS + Se2− → CdSe + S2−(2) Fig. 1  (a) Schematic illustration for the formation processes of the ternary CdS1−xSex QDs. (b) The bright field TEM image of CdS1−xSex QDs. The inset is the HRTEM of the crystalline structure of a QD. (c) EDX spectrum taken from a single CdS1−xSex QD. (d)–(f) HRTEM images of CdS QDs, CdS0.28Se0.72 QDs and CdSe QDs, respectively. The Se concentration decreases from the surface to the center in these CdS1−xSex QDs, while the concentration of S increases correspondingly. However, there is no proof of lattice change between the binary QDs and as-prepared gradient QDs. The anions would start to cross the crystal grain boundary of the QDs after annealing at 230 °C in an Ar atmosphere, producing the homogeneous alloy structure for ternary CdS1−xSex QDs (0 ≤ x ≤ 1).The bright field transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image demonstrates that the diameters of CdS1−xSex QDs range from 3 to 5 nm (Fig. 1b). Each CdS1−xSex QD had a uniform lattice structure with no obvious stack faults or core–shell structure (Fig. 1b inset). Peaks in energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectrograms confirm the coexistence of Cd, S and Se in the QDs (Fig. 1c).To evaluate the lattice change between binary and ternary QDs, we examined the atomic structure in CdS, CdS1−xSex and CdSe QDs in high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. 1d–f). The fringe spacing of 0.24 nm in the crystalline structure of a single CdS QD (Fig. 1d) matches well to the interplanar spacing of the {004} planes of anatase TiO2,39 whereas the fringe spacing of 0.29 nm in the QD matches the interplanar spacing of the {200} planes for cubic CdS. In the HRTEM image of a QD consisting of a CdSe nanoparticle (Fig. 1f), the fringe spacing of 0.21 nm matches well to the interplanar spacing of the {220} planes of cubic CdSe. In the crystal lattice of ternary alloyed CdS1−xSex (x = 0.72) QDs (Fig. 1e) we attribute the fringe spacing of 0.22 nm to the interplanar spacing of the {220} planes of alloy cubic CdS1−xSex QDs. The change in interplanar spacing indicates the lattice change in ternary CdS1−xSex QDs, compared to those of CdS and CdSe QDs.We investigated the actual Se ratio (Se/(S + Se)) of the ternary CdSxSe1−x QDs by EDX analysis (ESI, Fig. S1†). The relative intensity of Se and S peaks varied in each QD prepared with different ion exchange times. The spectrum allows a quantitative analysis to determine the Se ratio (x value) in the QDs. The relationship between the incorporation of Se content in the CdS1−xSex QDs and ion exchange time was nonlinear (Fig. 2a). Presumably, this nonlinearity results from the entropy change in ternary QDs. The ion exchange rate was extremely fast in the beginning due to the large surface energy of small diameter QDs, which leads to instability at the surface region. With increasing ion exchange time, the ion transfer rate will slow as the surface of the QDs becomes stabilized, leading to a decrease in entropy inside the QDs. Fig. 2  (a) Se content as a function of ion exchange time. (b) Normalized absorbance spectrum of CdS1−xSex QDs samples. The plots presented for pristine CdS QDs (curve I) and CdS1−xSex QDs with Se contents of 0.26, 0.43, 0.58, 0.72 and 1 (curve II to VI). The inset is the quadratic relationship of the bandgaps of the ternary CdS1−xSex QDs as a function of the Se/(S + Se) molar ratio. The normalized absorbance of the synthesized CdS1−xSex QDs is indicated by the UV-Vis absorbance spectra (Fig. 2b). The characteristic absorption region in the collected spectrum for the CdS QDs (I) was between 370 and 430 nm, which we attribute to the bandgap of these QDs. Compared to that for the CdS QD, the absorption spectral range of the CdS1−xSex QDs was broadened (spectra (II)–(VI) in Fig. 2b. The red shift of the absorbance band-edge was achieved in the spectral range of 460–650 nm by controlled incorporation of Se into CdS QDs.We evaluated the optical bandgaps of the CdS1−xSex QDs by applying Tauc's law on direct band gap semiconductors, plotting (αhν)2 against the photon energy (ESI, Fig. S2†), where α is the absorption coefficient, and hν is the photon energy.39,40 For pristine CdS QDs and CdS1−xSex QDs with Se ratios of 0, 0.26, 0.43, 0.58, 0.72 and 1, the optical bandgaps were 2.82, 2.48, 2.62, 2.32, 2.18 and 2.06 eV, respectively. We further evaluated the nonlinearity of the relationship between Se content and bandgap of the QDs (Fig. 2b) with Vegard's law: Eg(CdS1−xSex) = (1 − x)Eg(CdS) + xEg(CdSe) − bx(1 − x)(3)where Eg is the energy band gap and b is the bowing constant, which describes the extent of nonlinearity. We used the Least-Squares Parabola method to successfully fit our experimental data to a polynomial: Eg(CdS1−xSex) = 2.83 − 0.97x + 0.20x2. By comparing this expression with eqn (3), we determined the value of the bowing constant to be 0.20.The formation of homogeneous CdS1−xSex QDs from the gradient structure depends on the annealing conditions. Too low a temperature may not realize the lattice change while too high a temperature would devolve and enlarge the QDs. We selected CdS1−xSex QDs (x = 0.43) to study how QD diameter changes at different annealing temperatures (ESI, Fig. S3†). Compared with the QDs obtained at room temperature (25 °C), the QDs annealed at 230 °C have no obvious band-edge shift. At the annealing temperature of 300 °C, an obvious red shift of absorbance band-edge was observed, which implies that the diameter of CdS0.57Se0.43 QDs increased. After annealing at 230 °C, the two individual absorbance peaks from CdS and CdSe were merged between 450 and 500 nm, owing to the formation of a ternary alloy compound from separated the nanocrystals. It indicates that a crystal phase change occurred and alloy ternary QDs started to be formed at the annealing temperature of 230 °C, but the diameters of the QDs were not changed during annealing.The Raman study was carried out to further confirm the lattice change and homogeneity of CdS1−xSex QDs (Fig. 3a). We attribute the peaks near 300 and 200 cm−1 to zone-center longitudinal optical (LO) phonons of CdS- and CdSe-like modes in alloy QDs, respectively.41 The peaks of the first-order LO phonon modes gradually decreased with the increasing of Se content: 306 cm−1 for CdS, 290 cm−1 for CdS0.57Se0.43 and 275 cm−1 for CdS0.28Se0.72. The peaks for LO phonons of CdSe-like mode shifted from 198 cm−1 for CdS0.57Se0.43 to 206 cm−1 for CdSe. The two peaks changing position with alloy composition in a standard two-mode behavior is consistent with published work on bulk CdS1−xSex crystal samples.42 The continuous peak shift confirms that the QDs are ternary alloys with a tunable composition instead of a mixture of CdS and CdSe.43 Fig. 3  (a) Raman spectra taken from the binary CdS QDs, CdSe QDs and ternary CdS1−xSex QDs samples. (b) Raman spectra of binary CdS QDs, CdSe QDs and the gradient CdS1−x/CdSex QDs samples. (c)–(e) Atomic model of CdS QDs, gradient CdS1−x/CdSex QDs and CdSe QDs. In contrast, no Raman peak shift was observed in the spectra of gradient QDs (Fig. 3b). The LO phonon mode remained at 306 cm−1 for CdS QDs and at 206 cm−1 for CdSe QDs. The Raman peaks are attributed to the vibration of Cd–S and Cd–Se chemical bonds, respectively.41Fig. 3c illustrates the atomic model of CdS QDs. We attribute the disappearance of the CdS-like peaks in CdS1−x/CdSex QDs to the existence of CdSe shell layers in the gradient structure (Fig. 3d). Lattice changes and alloy nanocrystal formation are realized during a favorable annealing process, leading to the homogenous CdS1−xSex QDs (Fig. 3e).To demonstrate the light harvesting ability of prepared QDs, we evaluate their light harvesting efficiency. A 10 μm thickness of a dense TiO2 nanoparticle film with a 5 μm scattering layer was deposited onto thin cover glass, which is in accordance with that used in our photovoltaic cells. Fig. 4a shows the transmittance and reflectance spectra of bare TiO2 film, and its light collection obtained by adding the transmittance and reflectance spectra together. The light loss below 400 nm is assigned to the light absorption of the film itself, while the light collection of TiO2 film reaches 100% above 400 nm. This indicates the LHE of QDs sensitized films beyond 400 nm region would not be affected by the absorption of TiO2. Fig. 4  (a) Reflectance, transmittance spectrum and their sum for bare TiO2 film. (b) LHE spectra of binary CdS QDs, CdSe QDs and CdS1−xSex QDs with different Se content. Both transmittance (R%) and absorbance (T%) of bare and QDs sensitized TiO2 films were measured by the integrating sphere detector. The output light from the sample was monitored at the forward and backward sides. The LHE of QDs can be obtained from the difference in the spectra between the sensitized and unsensitized films (eqn (4)).A1% = 1 − R1% (bare TiO2) − T1% (bare TiO2)A2% = 1 − R2% (QDs sensitized TiO2) − T2% (QDs sensitized TiO2) LHE% = A2% − A1%(4)The LHE spectrum of CdS QDs, CdSe QDs, and CdS1−xSex QDs samples (x = 0.43, 0.58, and 0.72) is shown in Fig. 4b. As the Se ratio increases, the band-edge of the LHE spectrum extends from 510 for CdS QDs to 660 nm for CdS0.28Se0.72, and 670 nm for CdSe QDs. Compared to the absorbance spectrum of QDs in Fig. 2b, the wider LHE spectrum is attributed to the top TiO2 scattering layer, which is capable of absorbing more light. The highest LHE reaches above 90% in the range of 430–530 nm for both CdS0.28Se0.72 and CdSe, which demonstrates their good absorption in respectively visible light region. This high LHE to due to the high extinction coefficient of QDs, its concentration, and the suitable thickness of the absorbing layer we use.Next we fabricate sensitized solar cells to evaluate their photovoltaic performance. The synthesized CdS1−xSex QDs were effectively loaded onto the TiO2 film (∼10 μm in thickness, 20 nm in diameter as light absorption layer; ∼5 μm in thickness, 400 nm in diameter as scattering layer). Mapping of Cd, S and Se for a cross-section SEM image (Fig. 5a) demonstrates their distribution in the constructed photoanode. The line scan of Cd, S and Se (ESI, Fig. S4†) further confirms the loading of QDs in the 15 μm TiO2 films. Compared with the scattering layer, the higher concentration of elements achieved within the 10 μm dense TiO2 film is due to the larger surface area of small TiO2 nanoparticles (∼20 nm), leading to the more efficient loading of QDs, while the counts of electrons from Ti remained almost constant. We attribute the dramatic increase of Si at the initial scan range to the bottom glass substrate (ESI, Fig. S4†). Fig. 5  (a) Cross-section SEM image of mesoporous TiO2 substrate. It is composed by a 10 μm dense TiO2 nanoparticles (∼20 nm) layer and a 5 μm scattering layer (∼400 nm in diameter). Elemental mapping of Cd, S and Se is shown in the right part of the Figure. (b) J–V characteristics of CdS QDs, CdS1−xSex QDs (x = 0.72) and CdSe QDs sensitized solar cells. The inset Table lists the performance parameters of corresponding devices. (c) IPCE spectrum of the solar cell devices based on the CdS QDs, CdS0.28Se0.72 QDs and CdSe QDs. A high short circuit current density (Jsc) can be obtained by improving the IPCE of QD-sensitized TiO2 film, as expressed in eqn (5) Jsc = ∫qIPCE(λ)F(λ)dλ(5)where q is the elementary electric charge, F(λ) is the incident photon flux density under AM 1.5 spectral irradiance. The IPCE of the devices depends on the LHE of CdS1−xSex QDSSCs, the energy difference of the CBM between TiO2 and QDs, as expressed in eqn (6).44 IPCE = (LHE)Φη(6)Herein, Φ is the quantum yield of charge injection, and η is the charge collecting efficiency by the glass supported electrode.The sensitizer of CdS1−xSex QDs with a smaller bandgap results in broader optical absorption and more effective generation of e−–h+ pairs. Consequently, larger JSC values were obtained for CdS1−xSex QDs than for binary CdS QDs (Fig. 5b). The extended IPCE illustrated in Fig. 5c confirms the superiority of CdS1−xSex QDs.Note that the JSC for CdSe was lower than that for CdS1−xSex QDSSCs, even though the optical absorption spectrum of the former was broader (Fig. 2b). This can be explained by the relatively lower electron transfer yield for binary CdSe QDs, which may be attributed to their low conduction band edges with respect to that of TiO2. To confirm this, we investigated the interfacial band alignment between TiO2 and CdS1−xSex QDs. By photo-electron spectroscopy we determined the valance band maximum (VBM) values of the QDs (Fig. 6a). The bottom spectrum was obtained from the pristine CdS QDs. Relative to those for the CdS QDs, the secondary electron cutoffs for the CdS1−xSex QDs were shifted towards lower ionization potentials. The position of the VBM with respect to the vacuum level can be determined from the secondary electron cutoffs of pristine CdS, CdS0.57Se0.43, CdS0.28Se0.72 and CdSe QDs, which were −6.40, −6.24, −6.12 and −6.09 eV, respectively. Fig. 6  (a) Ionization spectra of (I) CdS QDs, (II) CdS0.57Se0.43 QDs, (III) CdS0.28Se0.72 QDs and (IV) CdSe QDs. (b) Band diagram at TiO2 and QDs interfaces. Herein, the atomic ratios of Se are 0, 0.43, 0.72 and 1, correspondingly. We had determined the bandgaps for the QDs based on Tauc's plots (inset in Fig. 2b). So, the positions of the CBM with respect to the vacuum levels can be obtained by adding both VBM and bandgaps; the bandgaps were −3.58, −3.76, −3.94 and −4.03 eV for CdS, CdS0.57Se0.43, CdS0.28Se0.72 and CdSe QDs, respectively. As reported elsewhere, the CBM of TiO2 is −4.2 eV with respect to the vacuum level.45 With these values, we obtained the band diagram at TiO2 and CdS1−xSex interfaces (Fig. 6b).Both the CBMs and bandgaps of the CdS1−xSex QDs decreased with increasing Se content. Thus, the methodology of controlling the elemental ratio in QDs facilitated production of suitable bandgaps and band alignments. The optimized conditions can be prepared by controlling the value x in the CdS1−xSex QDs. Compared with CdS1−xSex (x = 0.72) QDs, the CBM of CdSe is closer to that of the TiO2, with a difference smaller than 0.2 eV. The excited electrons in CdSe QDs cannot be effectively injected into TiO2, resulting in lower IPCE for QDSSCs than for those made with ternary QDs (Fig. 5b). Consequently, Jsc in CdSe QDs (7.47 mA cm−2) is only 69% of that for CdS1−xSex QDs (10.19 mA cm−2).The electron transport time (τsc) of CdS, CdS1−xSex and CdSe QDs were determined by employing IMPS under various illumination levels,10 as illustrated in Fig. 7. The electron transport time decreases with increasing light intensity in a manner consistent with a power law relationship. The calculated τsc of CdS and CdS1−xSex QDs demonstrates similar values, while it is five times higher in CdSe QDs at large light intensity (43 mW cm−2). It is known that the parameter τsc can be affected by the TiO2 film thickness45 or the band offset between the sensitizer and the CBM of TiO2.46 As the same thickness of TiO2 film was used in the experiment (Fig. 4a), we should attribute the difference of τsc between CdS and CdSe QDs to the influence of the interfacial band alignment. The larger value of τsc for CdSe QDs further demonstrates their lower CBM with respect to that of TiO2, compared with that of CdS1−xSex QDs, leading to reduction of Jsc in binary CdSe QDs. The analysis also enables a way for us to modulate the electron transfer by changing the interfacial electronic energy alignment between QDs and TiO2. Fig. 7  Light intensity dependence of recombination lifetime and electron transport times in a CdS (squares), CdS1−xSex (circles) and CdSe (triangles) QDSSC by IMPS and IMVS measurements. Incorporation of Se into QDs reduces the open circuit voltage (VOC). VOC values are dependent on the energy levels of both the TiO2 conduction band and the electron density in the TiO2 film47 (7)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature (K), q is the elementary charge, n0 is the saturation electron density, and n is the electron density correlated to electron lifetime in TiO2.We derived the electron lifetime (τoc) as a function of the light intensity (Fig. 7) with the use of intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS). At higher illuminations the electron lifetime become shorter, while at a certain light intensity the electron lifetime was larger in the CdS QDSSC than the cell sensitized with CdSe QDs. It is suggested that adsorption of CdS QDs onto the TiO2 surface exposed to the redox electrolyte had resulted in the formation of a more compacted layer via the TGA linker, that could effectively suppress the recombination of electrons in the TiO2 film with polysulfide with a resultant high value of the VOC. Besides, incorporation of Se in CdS QDs would introduce defects, which enhance the charge recombination, reducing the Voc in QDSSCs. The open circuit voltage of full ion transferred CdS1−xSex QDs (x = 1) is 0.48 V, which is in accordance with reported value (Voc = 0.482 V) of binary CdSe QDs sensitized devices.10Fill factors (FF) of solar cells are dependent on the series resistance (RS) of the devices. The smaller RS will contribute to higher FF. The RS can be expressed as RS = Rh + Rct + Rdiff, where Rh is the resistance of FTO, Rct is the charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode–electrolyte interface, and Rdiff is the diffusion impedance in the electrolyte.48,49 Comparing the solar cells sensitized by CdS, CdS0.28Se0.72 and CdSe QDs, the value of Rh is kept at 2.6 ohm per cm2 (see electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) in Fig. S5†). The similarity is due to our same conditions of device fabrication. Meanwhile, the estimated Rct are 7.54, 2.55 and 1.76 ohm per cm2 for CdS, CdS0.28Se0.72 and CdSe QDSSCs. The value of Rct is dependent on the redox reaction rate between QDs and the polysulfide electrolyte 2h+(QDs) + S2− → 2QDs + S(8) S + S2− → S2−(9) Cathode: S2− + 2e−(counter electrode) → 2S2−(10)During the reactions, CdSe QDs able to generate more e−–h+ pairs than CdS QDs due to their broad absorbance, which has been demonstrated by our LHE results (Fig. 4b). The higher concentration of excited holes leads to faster reaction in the electrolyte, reducing the value of Rct. Thus, the QDs with higher ratio of Se/S result in a larger FF.The FF we obtained (57%) is higher than that of reported binary CdSe QDSSCs by Lee et al. (49%),50 which may be due to our Cu2S counter electrode with a high catalytic activity. However, it is relatively lower than that of the reported QDSSCs by S. Emin et al. (60%).10 This is due to the 5 μm scattering layer used in this work, as indicated in Fig. S4a.† The scattering layer normally reduces the FF and increases the Jsc of cells, which has been discussed in other reports.51 In this study, the power conversion efficiencies reached 1.0, 2.89 and 2.03% for the devices sensitized with CdS, CdS1−xSex and CdSe QDs, respectively. Power conversion efficiency and Jsc were highest for the films with a suitable Se content in CdS1−xSex QDs (x = 0.72).4. ConclusionsIn summary, we used a novel surface ion transfer method to synthesize ternary alloy CdS1−xSex QDs; the method facilitates continuous tuning of optical absorption and electron transport. The suitable Se content (x = 0.72) in CdS1−xSex QDs struck a balance between optical absorption and band alignment. An amazing LHE beyond 90% has been achieved for CdS1−xSex QDs in the range of 430–530 nm. We obtained a short circuit current density of 10.19 mA cm−2 with a ternary CdS0.28Se0.72 QDSSC, which is 2.6- and 1.4-times those obtained with QDSSCs with CdS and CdSe, respectively. Ternary QDs are novel materials that would be useful in development of highly efficient devices because of the ability to tune both optical bandgap and electronic energy alignment.AcknowledgementsWe acknowledge financial support by Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) of the Japan Science and Technology Agency.
