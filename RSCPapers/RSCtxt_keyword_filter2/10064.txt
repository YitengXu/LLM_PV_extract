    , Accepted 27th November 2018First published on 27th November 2018AbstractA new A–π–D–π–A small molecule with a Ni-porphyrin core (MV143) has been synthesized and employed as a donor, along with PC71BM, for the fabrication of solution-processed bulk heterojunction OSCs organic solar cells. The device exhibited an overall PCE of 9.14% (JSC = 13.87 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.08 V and FF = 0.61) and a low photon energy loss of 0.52 eV.
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layers are promising for the fabrication of lightweight and low cost large area devices for the conversion of solar energy into electrical energy.1–12 BHJ-OSCs based on conjugated polymers as donors have shown overall power conversion efficiencies of around 11%13–15 and 13–14%16–19 for fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors, respectively. In comparison to conjugated polymers, small molecules (SMs) offer exceptional advantages such as well-defined structures, low cost synthesis, easy control of the energy levels and batch to batch reproducibility.20–28 OSCs based on SM donors along with fullerene as an acceptor have shown overall PCE values of 10–11%.29–31 These encouraging achievements indicate that appropriate tailoring of the absorption spectra and energy levels of the SMs by chemical modification can improve the overall PCE of OSCs based on SM donors.
Porphyrins show a high absorption coefficient in the UV/visible region of the solar spectrum. The optical and electrochemical properties can be easily tuned by changing the central metal and functionalization of the periphery. The use of porphyrins as the donor component in the BHJ active layer in OSCs has been explored.32–36 In the early years, the PCE values of OSCs based on porphyrin were very low, but the introduction of ethynylene bridges between the porphyrin core and the electron acceptor units37 led to an enhancement in the PCE up to 9–10%.38,39
In our earlier communication, we described one porphyrin SMs containing a Zn-porphyrin central donor core and N-ethyl-rhodanine end-capping acceptor units linked through bisthienylenevinylene groups as π-conjugated bridges (MV71). The resulting OSCs had an overall PCE of 7.61% when MV71 was used as a donor along with PC71BM as the electron acceptor.40 Although the JSC and FF values of the OSC based on MV71 are quite reasonable, the VOC value is only 0.85 V. The main issue with OSCs based on SM donors is how to obtain both high open circuit voltage (VOC) and short circuit current (JSC) simultaneously.41,42 It would be interesting to evaluate whether metalloporphyrins with a lower HOMO than Zn-porphyrins, such as Ni-porphyrins, would give a higher open circuit voltage while retaining high values for JSC and FF.
Here we have designed a new porphyrin SM, MV143 (Scheme 1), which is an analogue of MV71 but the central donor core is a Ni-porphyrin. The optical and electrochemical properties of this new molecule were investigated. Although MV143 had a higher optical bandgap (1.60 eV) than MV71 (1.52 eV), it has a deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and almost the same LUMO energy level. MV143 was employed as a donor along with PC71BM as the electron acceptor for BHJ-OSCs and, after optimization, an overall PCE of 9.14% was achieved with a high VOC value of 1.08 V and energy loss of 0.51 eV. The energy loss for MV143 is lower than that for MV71 (0.68 eV). The deeper HOMO energy level of MV143 and the low energy loss value are the reasons for the higher VOC and overall PCE for the resulting OSC.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of MV143. 
The synthetic route for the preparation of MV143 from porphyrin 143 is shown in Scheme 1. Reaction of 1 with nickel(II) acetylacetonate afforded quantitatively metalloporphyrin 2, which was reacted with NBS to give 3 (quantitative yield). Sonogashira coupling of 3 and ethynyltrimethylsilane catalyzed by Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 yielded compound 4 (91% yield). Next, 4 was deprotected with TBAF to yield 5 as a red solid, which was used in the next step without further purification. Copper-free Sonogashira coupling of 5 and 643 gave bisaldehyde 7 (55% yield). Finally, MV143 was obtained in 67% yield by Knoevenagel condensation between 7 and 3-ethylrhodanine. All new compounds were satisfactorily characterized (see ESI†). The thermal stability of MV143 was studied by TGA (Fig. S22, ESI†) under a nitrogen atmosphere and gave a weight loss of <5% up to 363 °C, thus meeting device fabrication requirements.
Theoretical calculations (Fig. S31–S33, ESI†) were carried out (Gaussian 09, DFT B3LYP/6-31G level of theory) in order to study the influence of the Ni atom on the geometry and electronic properties of MV143.
The absorption spectra of MV143 in CH2Cl2 and thin film are shown in Fig. 1 (left) and optical data are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†) along with those of MV7144 for comparison. The absorption spectrum of MV143 covers the whole visible spectrum up to 750 nm and shows two intense (logε > 5) broad bands with maxima at 540 nm and 682 nm, which are attributed to the Soret band and charge transfer, respectively; both bands are blue shifted with respect to those of MV71 (λmax = 547 nm and 716 nm, respectively). The charge transfer character of the band at 682 nm is clearly demonstrated by the red shift observed when the spectrum was registered in benzonitrile (λmax = 691 nm) when compared to the spectrum in less polar toluene (λmax = 681 nm) (Fig. S28, ESI†). Interestingly, the absorption spectrum in film is red shifted by 32 nm in comparison to that in CH2Cl2 solution (Fig. 1, left), thus indicating the existence of J-aggregates.45

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements on MV143 in ODCB–acetonitrile (4:1) solution (Fig. S29, ESI†) were performed using the Fc/Fc+ redox couple as the standard to determine the oxidation and reduction potentials (Table S1, ESI†). Both the first oxidation (at 0.43 V) and reduction (−1.61 V) potentials are reversible. While the first reduction potential is similar to that of the Zn-porphyrin based MV71 (−1.60 V), the first oxidation potential of MV143 is higher by 290 mV than that of MV71 as the oxidation potential increases with the electronegativity of the metal ion.46
The HOMO (−5.53 eV) and LUMO (−3.49 eV) energy levels of MV143 were estimated from the electrochemical data. The HOMO of MV143 is deeper than that of MV71 (−5.24 eV). The deeper HOMO energy level for MV143 can be related to the weaker electron donating ability of Ni-porphyrin and it is beneficial for a high VOC value for the resultant OSCs. Considering that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PC71BM are −4.10 eV and −6.05 eV, respectively, the LUMO and HOMO offsets between MV143 and PC71BM are about 0.61 eV and 0.52 eV, respectively. This indicates that efficient photo-induced charge transfer from MV143 and PC71BM is possible, which is a prerequisite for efficient OSCs.42,47,48
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pristine MV143 and MV143:PC71BM (as cast and SVA treated) were also investigated to obtain information about the photo-induced charge transfer between MV143 and PC71BM (Fig. 1, right). MV143 showed a PL peak at 776 nm and this is significantly quenched in the mixture with PC71BM and further quenched when the MV143:PC71BM blend film is subjected to SVA treatment. These results indicate that after the absorption of light, the photogenerated excitons are effectively dissociated into free charge carrier and charge transfer at the D–A interface.
The OSCs were fabricated using MV143 along with PC71BM with a conventional device structure (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN/Al). The active layer consisted of a mixture of MV143 and PC71BM with different weight ratios in chloroform (CF) as solvent. After optimization, the weight ratio of 1:2 (MV143:PC71BM) showed the best photovoltaic performance. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OSCs based on the optimized active layer are shown in Fig. 2a and the photovoltaic parameters, i.e. short circuit current (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are gathered in Table 1 along with those of the OSCs based on MV71 processed under identical conditions. The OSCs based on MV143:PC71BM showed an overall PCE of 3.80% with a JSC of 9.42 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.12 V and FF of 0.36. Since the overall PCE of OSCs based on an as-cast active layer is low, we further optimized the active layer by solvent vapour annealing (SVA) (details are provided in the experimental section). After SVA treatment of the active layer, the resultant OSC showed a significant enhancement in the PCE up to 9.14% with JSC and FF values of 13.97 mA cm−2 and 0.61, respectively, and the VOC value was a remarkable 1.08 V.

The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the OSCs contain three bands (see Fig. 2b). The band observed in the UV region (350–450 nm) corresponds to the photocurrent generation due to the PC71BM whereas both bands in the visible region (450–600 nm and 600 nm onwards) correspond to the photocurrent generation due to MV143. The similarity between the IPCE spectra of the OSCs and the absorption spectra of the active layer (Fig. S34, ESI†) indicates that both, MV143 and PC71BM, contribute to the photocurrent generation and JSC. In the case of the SVA-treated blend film Fig. S34 (ESI†), the absorption intensity corresponding to MV143 increased and was also red-shifted compared to as-cast blend film, which indicates that the light harvesting efficiency of the active layer is enhanced. The high values of IPCE between Soret and Q band in this region is attributed to the light absorption by both PC71BM and MV143. The JSC values estimated from the integration of the IPCE spectra of the OSCs based on as-cast and SVA-treated active layers are about 9.35 mA cm−2 and 13.86 mA cm−2, respectively, and are in good agreement with the values obtained from the J–V characteristics of the OSCs under illumination.
Studies of the hole and electron mobilities were carried out to evaluate the charge transport towards the electrodes within the active layer in OSCs (for more details see ESI†).
The exciton dissociation efficiency and the charge collection efficiency for as-cast and SVA-treated active layer based OSCs, we measured the variation of photocurrent density (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff) for both the devices49 (Fig. 3). The Veff is calculated as Veff = Va − V0, where Va is the applied voltage and V0 is the voltage at which Jph is zero. The Jph value is expressed as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current density under illumination and in the dark, respectively. It can be seen from this figure that for the OSC based on the SVA-treated active layer, at low Veff values the Jph increases in a linear manner and reaches a plateau and subsequently reaches the saturation value (Jphsat). This behaviour suggests that at sufficient internal electric field, all of the photogenerated charge carriers are efficiently swept out. However, in the case of the OSC based on the as-cast active layer, the Jph did not reach the saturation value even at maximum Veff, which indicates that the internal electric field is not sufficient to extract the charge carrier effectively and significant electron–hole recombination is expected.50 Moreover, the Jphsat value is higher for the OSCs based on the SVA-treated active layer when compared to the as-cast counterpart. We estimated the exciton generation rate (Gmax) from the expression Gmax = Jphsat/qL, where q is electronic charge and L is the thickness of the active layer and the values are 0.94 × 1028 m−3 s−1 and 1.09 × 1028 m−3 s−1 for as-cast and SVA-based OSCs, respectively. The higher Gmax value for the SVA-treated OSC is consistent with the higher light harvesting efficiency of the active layer (see absorption spectra of the active layer in Fig. S34, ESI†) and consistent with corresponding JSC value. The exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) were estimated from the expressions Jph/Jphsat at short circuit and Jph/Jphsat at the maximum power point, respectively. The ηdiss/ηcoll values are 0.73/0.54 and 0.95/0.83 for the devices based on as-cast and SVA-treated active layers, respectively. The higher values of both ηdiss and ηcoll for the SVA-treated active layer device, when compared with the as-cast device, indicate that exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency are effectively promoted upon SVA treatment. A study on variation of JSC and VOC at different illumination intensities (Pin) is included in ESI.†

The change in the morphology of the active layer after the SVA treatment has been investigated from TEM and shown in Fig. S37 (ESI†). After the SVA treatment, more clear interpenetrating pathways are formed, which contribute to the higher charge transport efficiency, resulting to the improved values of JSC and FF.
One of the important factors in the OSCs is the energy loss (Eloss) and is related to VOC and Egopt as Eloss = Egopt − qVOC where Egopt is the optical band gap of either donor or acceptors whichever is smaller.51 We have estimated the values of Eloss for the OSCs based on both MV143 (Egopt = 1.60 eV) and MV71 (Egopt = 1.52 eV) and values are the 0.52 eV and 0.67 eV, respectively. The low value of Eloss for MV143 may be related to reduced Eloss during the exciton dissociation and charge transfer processes.
In summary, a new symmetrical A–π–D–π–A small molecule (MV143) containing Ni-porphyrin donor core and end-capping N-ethyl-rhodanine acceptors linked by thienylenevinylenes-thiophene bridges has been designed and synthesized. When compared to its Zn-based analogue MV71, MV143 had higher band gap (1.60 eV) than MV71 (1.52 eV) but a deeper HOMO energy level (−5.53 eV vs. −5.24 eV for MV71) due to the weaker electron donating ability of Ni-porphyrin. MV143 was used along with PC71BM for the fabrication of solution-processed small molecule BHJ-OSCs. After optimization of the active layer, the MV143:PC71BM-based OSC gave an overall PCE of 9.14% (JSC = 13.87 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.08 V and FF = 0.61), which is higher than that for the MV71 (7.61%) counterpart. The enhanced PCE value is due to the high VOC, which is related to its deeper HOMO energy level and low photon energy loss of 0.52 eV. This value is one of the lowest obtained for a porphyrin-based small molecule with overall PCE above than 9%. We are actively working investigating other metalloporphyrins.
