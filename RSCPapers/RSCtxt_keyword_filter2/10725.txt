    , Accepted 17th December 2016First published on 19th December 2016AbstractThe hydrophobic and conductive polymer poly-N-vinylcarbazole (PVK) has been successfully utilized as a multifunctional interlayer between perovskite and the hole transporting material (HTM) for highly stable and efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) for the first time. The very thin PVK interlayer can not only protect the perovskite structure from moisture and degradation, but also modulate the interface to reduce charge recombination and promote hole transportation simultaneously. Benefited by coupling this PVK-protection method with the molecular design of an economical and synthetically facile triazatruxene-based HTM (SP-12) featuring good stability, planarity and hole mobility, a reliable power conversion efficiency of 18.8% has been achieved, which is superior to that using the well-studied spiro-OMeTAD (16.9%), demonstrating a promising fabrication approach to efficient and long-term stable PSCs.
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are rapidly evolving into a promising technology to convert solar energy into electricity owing to the rapid increase of their power conversion efficiency (PCE) from less than 3.8% to over 20% in the past few years.1–18 Besides the unique optical and electrical properties of the hybrid organo-lead trihalide CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, or I) perovskites,19 the optimization of the cell structure and different layer morphology plays a key role in achieving high performance, which is strongly related to the material composition and processing conditions.20–22 The long-term stability remains a great challenge for PSCs, particularly when subjected to environmental stresses such as moisture,23 under which the device deteriorates quickly.24 Therefore, deliberate attempts have been made to replace the CH3NH3 group with a more stable unit25 or to utilize hydrophobic HTMs to improve moisture resistance,26 but little attention has been paid to introduce a polymeric interlayer which could play a protective role by shielding volatile perovskites from atmospheric moisture.
On the other hand, hole-transport materials (HTMs), which separate photo-excited electron–hole pairs and transport the holes to the external circuit, represent another important factor determining the device performance.27 Among various promising HTMs so far reported,28 the triarylamine-based 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is the most effective one.29 However, the tedious synthesis and purification steps make it expensive for large-scale applications.30 Very recently, a new class of star-shaped triazatruxene-based HTMs has been reported as a low-cost but effective alternative of spiro-OMeTAD,31,32 in which long n-hexyl chains are attached to make it soluble and protect the perovskite surface from moisture. Based on the present research in perovskite solar cells, the perovskite layer could hardly cover the surface of the TiO2 layer totally.33,34 Therefore, the uncovered traps on the TiO2 layer could be in contact with HTMs directly, resulting in electron recombination from the conduction band of TiO2 to HTMs.35
To solve these problems, herein we propose a new protection approach by introducing a thin polymer interlayer featuring hydrophobicity and conductivity in between perovskite and the HTM to resist moisture and suppress charge recombination simultaneously. As a widely used conductive organic polymer, poly-N-vinylcarbazole (PVK) is proven to be effective as a hole carrier in photorefractive applications36–38 and organic solar cells.39–41 However, PVK as the polymer interlayer between perovskite and the HTM of PSCs has never been reported. Considering that PVK is hydrophobic and capable of good film formation, incorporation of a PVK-protective interlayer may benefit interfacial modulation instead of direct contact of perovskite with hydrophobic chains deliberately attached to HTMs. Therefore, new triazatruxene-based derivatives, 2,7,12-tris(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline)-5,10,15-triethyltriindole (SP-11) and 2,7,12-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-5,10,15-triethyltriindole (SP-12), are designed to attach short ethyl groups into 2,7,12-positions of the triazatruxene aromatic core (Fig. 1), in order to preserve its two-dimensional planar π-system to facilitate intermolecular charge transfer. SP-11 and SP-12 are soluble in common organic solvents, and thus integration of a perovskite/PVK/HTM multiple layer can be performed via a convenient solution process. The optimized devices reach a PCE as high as 18.8%, offering a new direction of processing method for stable and efficient PCSs by means of introducing a multifunctional polymer interlayer in devices.

To investigate the protective effect of the PVK layer on PSCs, planar perovskite solar cells based on the structure of FTO/compact-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/PVK/spiro-OMeTAD/Au with a 580 nm FTO glass and 50 nm Au layer, are designed for the first time, in which sequential deposition of a 240 nm CH3NH3PbI3 layer from precursors PbCl2 and CH3NH3I,42 a 10 nm PVK layer sandwiched between perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD, and a 240 nm spiro-OMeTAD layer is performed by spin-coating (Fig. 2). For comparison, a similar device using spiro-OMeTAD alone is also fabricated. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) is employed to observe the morphology of PVK on perovskite at different deposition concentrations (Fig. S1†). When spin-coated by 4 mg mL−1 PVK, the perovskite layer is only partially covered. Upon increasing PVK concentration to 8 mg mL−1, a continuous and uniform PVK film is formed on top of perovskite, implying close matching of PVK surface tension with perovskite surface energy. Further increase in concentration to 12 mg mL−1 results in a thicker but uneven PVK film, while a concentration of 16 mg mL−1 leads to an overwhelmed rough PVK film. Hence, 8 mg mL−1 is selected as the optimized concentration of PVK.

The influence of the hydrophobic nature of PVK on the perovskite layer is examined by the contact angles (α) of deionized water on the different perovskite surfaces (Fig. 3). Pure perovskite films show a rather small α, indicative of easy infiltration of water molecules into the perovskite layer. After coating a PVK film, a big α of 100.7° is obtained, confirming the effective modification of the polar character of the perovskite surface. In comparison with the perovskite film only covered by spiro-OMeTAD, which shows an α of 82.1° with obvious water affinity, introduction of a PVK interlayer between perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD increases α to 96.2°, apparently changing the perovskite surface from being hydrophilic to hydrophobic, thereby effectively preventing water penetration to improve moisture stability of the whole cell.
 Fig. 3  Water contact angles on the perovskite surfaces under different conditions. 
The protective impact of the PVK layer on the degradation of perovskite has been verified by comparing the color alteration and X-ray diffraction patterns of different films (pure perovskite, pure PVK, perovskite/PVK, perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD, and perovskite/PVK/spiro-OMeTAD, see Fig. S2†) exposed to ambient air. The color change from dark brown to yellow is believed to associate with perovskite degradation initiated by infiltration of water molecules to form weak hydrogen bonds with hygroscopic methylammonium cations, leading to bond dissociation between the crystal constituents and liberating unbound methylammonium iodide to leave behind a residual layer of PbI2.23 As seen from Fig. S2,† the degradation of the pure perovskite film progresses significantly within 96 h, when the color turns to pale yellow and the XRD patterns largely transfer to PbI2. For the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD film, discernible color change is retarded to 96 h but the transition to PbI2 is obvious in the XRD pattern. In contrast, the perovskite film coated with PVK displays much slower degradation with little color alteration and phase change of only a small portion in 96 h. Similar slow degradation is observed for the perovskite/PVK/spiro-OMeTAD film, indicating that the hydrophobic PVK interlayer plays a significant role in shielding the perovskite structure from atmospheric moisture, thus preventing its degradation.

Fig. 4a shows the current–voltage (J–V) curves reflecting the influence of PVK interlayers coated at different concentrations on the performance of corresponding PSCs. A striking finding is that, compared with the pristine spiro-OMeTAD-based device, all characteristic parameters of the PVK/spiro-OMeTAD-based cells are generally enhanced (Table 1), including the open circuit photovoltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). The best cell conversion efficiency of 16.9% is achieved with the PSC using 8 mg mL−1 PVK, which is much higher than that of the bare spiro-OMeTAD-based solar cell (14.1%). Further increase of the PVK concentration to 12 and 16 mg mL−1 leads to gradual decrease of PCE. This concentration-dependent trend in performance is in good agreement with the above mentioned morphological evolution of the PVK films on top of perovskite, implying that an optimal PVK interlayer can not only suppress the electron recombination from the conduction band of TiO2 to HTMs for avoiding direct contact between TiO2 and the HTM layer through traps, but also facilitate efficient charge separation and transportation owing to modulation of the perovskite-HTM interface. To testify this speculation, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is employed to study the interfacial charge transfer processes. As seen in Fig. S3a,† the bare perovskite film shows an intense PL peak at around 785 nm, which dramatically decreases after the formation of perovskite/HTM layers due to hole injection from perovskite to spiro-OMeTAD. Further quenching of this emission is evident upon introduction of the PVK interlayer, reaching the largest quenching effect at 8 mg mL−1 PVK coating concentration. These findings indicate improved exciton dissociation and more efficient charge transport among the perovsktie/PVK/spiro-OMeTAD interfaces. Such PVK-facilitated interfacial charge transfer is also supported by the time-resolved PL decay measurements (Fig. S3b and Table S1†), which reveal the same decay time downtrend as the quenching effect, consistent with the above concentration-dependent PVK film morphologies and cell performance. It is noteworthy that a negligible efficiency of 0.004% is observed when just employing PVK as the HTM, suggesting that PVK itself is not competent for charge transport. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to probe the HOMO energy level of the thin perovskite film, perovsktie/PVK layer, and PVK film.43 The HOMO values of both the perovsktie/PVK layer (−5.55 eV) and PVK film (−5.59 eV) are lower than that of the valence band of perovskite (−5.43 eV), which is unfavourable for hole extraction (Fig. S4†). This observation implies that a faster hole transport mechanism through a thin film at the interface between PVK and the HTM can have no relation to the energy levels of the polymer film. Moreover, direct doping of spiro-OMeTAD with PVK (e.g. 10 wt%) as a composite HTM layer only affords a lower efficiency of 12.9% relative to pure spiro-OMeTAD, suggestive of a deleterious effect. Based on these results, we conclude that the PVK-protecting interlayer is also useful, besides moisture resistance, to enhance the overall PCE of PSCs via an optimized pervoskite/PVK/HTM fabrication method.

In order to check if the PVK-protection method is effective for generalization, we designed two new triazatruxene-based HTMs, SP-11 and SP-12, as shown in Fig. 1. Different from the reported triazatruxene analogs,31,32 we engineered a 2,7,12-substituted triazatruxene model to incorporate different donor branches and short ethyl groups into the aromatic core. Thanks to the PVK interlayer, long hydrophobic alkyl chains are no longer required to diminish their influence on the conjugated π-system planarity and interfacial contact order. SP-11 and SP-12 were prepared by a facile synthetic route through Suzuki coupling reactions of readily available 2-Br-TAT44 with 4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-aniline (SP-11, 72% yield) and p-methoxy-benzene boronic acid (SP-12, 86% yield). Their chemical structures have been identified by virtue of 1H/13C NMR spectroscopy, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and elemental analyses (details described in the ESI†).
The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies unveil good thermal stability of SP-11 and SP-12 comparable with spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. S5 and S6†), of which TGA curves indicate thermal decomposition at about 420 °C and DSC data show a higher glass transition temperature (Tg = 125 °C) of SP-12 than that of SP-11 (Tg = 98 °C). The normalized absorption and PL spectra in CH2Cl2 (Fig. S7†) disclose that SP-11, SP-12 and spiro-OMeTAD have maximum absorption peaks at 367, 340, and 387 nm and major emission peaks at 439, 423, and 428 nm, respectively. The largest Stokes shift is found for SP-12, implying that the small SP-12 molecule could undergo significant geometrical change upon excitation, in favor of hole-transfer in solar cells.45 The intersection wavelengths for SP-11, SP-12 and spiro-OMeTAD are 410, 388, and 413 nm, which correspond to optical bandgaps (Eg) of 3.02, 3.19, and 3.00 eV, respectively.
Molecular orbital calculations of SP-11 and SP-12 are performed by the TD-DFT program at the B3LYP/3-21G* level to mimic their electronic structures. The HOMOs of the two HTMs are found to delocalize over the whole molecule, while the LUMOs are mainly located on the linking phenyl rings (Fig. S8†). The experimental HOMO levels of SP-11, SP-12 and spiro-OMeTAD were derived from cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. S9†). The three HTMs exhibit quasi-reversible redox peaks in CV, indicative of good electrochemical stability. The HOMO levels of SP-11 and SP-12, calculated as 5.34 and 5.41 eV from the first oxidation potentials, are lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD (−5.22 eV), but higher and closer to the valence band of perovskite (−5.43 eV). Therefore, relatively high open circuit voltage (Voc) values are anticipated, especially for SP-12. An energy level diagram of the relevant materials is shown in Fig. 5, from which we can see that all HTMs have enough over potential to lead to efficient photo-generated charge transfer through the interfaces.
 Fig. 5  The relative energy level diagram of relevant HTMs. 
To understand the charge-carrier transport properties, their hole transporting mobilities were evaluated by space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement. The hole mobility (μ) follows the order of μSP-12 (2.41 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) > μSP-11 (9.45 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) > μspiro-OMeTAD (8.38 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). The hole transporting capability of SP-11 and SP-12 as HTMs in PSCs is also estimated by PL spectra of perovskites underneath (Fig. S10†). The remarkable diminution of PL intensity in the presence of HTMs confirms efficient hole injection from the valence band of perovskite into the HOMO of the HTM. The PL quenching effect follows an order of SP-12 > SP-11 > spiro-OMeTAD, which indicates that carriers created in the excited perovskite layers are more efficiently extracted by triazatruxene-based HTMs, especially for SP-12. Faster hole injection rate of SP-11 and SP-12 than that of spiro-OMeTAD is also evident from the time-resolved PL measurements (Table S2†). The relatively longer life time of pristine perovskite decreases dramatically after incorporation of the HTMs, and the averaged decay times follow a similar order and are thus in accordance with the PL quenching results of perovskite containing the three HTMs. Therefore, it can be concluded that the hole extraction and charge dissociation from perovskite to triazatruxene-based HTMs should be more efficient as compared to spiro-OMeTAD. Indeed, the PSC performance with SP-11 as the bare HTM (PCE = 13.9%) is comparable with spiro-OMeTAD (PCE = 14.1%) under the same conditions, while SP-12 offers a higher PCE of 15.5% (Fig. S11† and Table 1).
To evaluate the performance of PVK-protected PCSs containing SP-11 and SP-12 as HTMs, a similar planar PSC structure of FTO/compact-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/PVK/HTM/Au as above is adopted by replacing spiro-OMeTAD with the alternative HTM and incorporating an optimized PVK interlayer. The J–V curves of thus fabricated PSCs are illustrated in Fig. 4b and detailed parameters are summarized in Table 1. The SP-12-based device exhibits a PCE of 18.8%, higher than 16.9% of the spiro-OMeTAD-based PSC containing a PVK interlayer. The reverse scans of the PVK-protected PSCs are also performed, which give rise to a slightly lower PCE due to the known hysteretic behavior (Fig. S11c and Table S3†). The measurements over 20 SP-12-based devices offer an average PCE value of 18.0 ± 2.0% (Fig. S12†). It is noticeable that both the Voc and Jsc values in the SP-12-based PSC are enhanced relative to the spiro-OMeTAD-based one, although their FF values resemble each other, implying that SP-12 is an excellent alternative HTM of spiro-OMeTAD and especially suitable for this PVK-protection approach. In comparison, the SP-11-based PSCs achieve the same PCEs as the spiro-OMeTAD-based reference, of which the Voc and Jsc values are also enhanced but the FF is lower, suggesting a poorer film quality with SP-11. The better Voc and Jsc in both SP-11- and SP-12-based PSCs may be attributed to their deeper HOMO energy level and more efficient charge transfer, in agreement with the CV and PL results. This makes the triazatruxene-based HTMs promising lead structures for further molecular engineering. Moreover, the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of all devices show a similar profile ranging from 400 to 750 nm with a maximum at ca. 520 nm (Fig. S10†). Compared with spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs, SP-11- and SP-12-based PSCs display slightly higher IPCE throughout the broad range, consistent with the J–V measurements. The integrated Jsc values based on IPCE match well with those from J–V curves (Fig. S13†).
The protective effect of PVK on the device stability has been investigated by aging control experiments of spiro-OMeTAD- and SP-12-based PSCs with or without the PVK interlayer under identical conditions (ca. 35% humid atmosphere at room temperature). As seen from Fig. 6 and S14,† the PCEs of pristine PSCs with bare spiro-OMeTAD and SP-12 HTMs retain 68% and 73% of their initial efficiencies after 700 h, respectively. In contrast, the corresponding devices incorporating the PVK interlayer lose their efficiency much more slowly, exhibiting retention of 87% and 90%, respectively. It is clear that the performance of PVK-protected devices has better durability against degradation, confirming that the PVK interlayer can effectively slow down the penetration of moisture into the perovskite layer. Moreover, SP-12-based devices present superior efficiency and stability relative to spiro-OMeTAD-based devices throughout the aging test, no matter in the presence of PVK interlayer or not, justifying the quality and capability of SP-12 as an excellent HTM for PSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, a polymer-protection approach is demonstrated for the PSC fabrication process by using hydrophobic and conductive PVK as a dual-functional interlayer to shield perovskite from moisture, suppress charge combination, and promote hole transport simultaneously. The concentration-dependent PVK-protective effect has been studied, revealing that the optimization of the PVK interlayer for enhancement of device stability and performance is correlated with the film morphology. A new type of triazatruxene-based SP-11 and SP-12 HTMs is designed, available via a facile synthetic route for practice of this PVK-protection method. SP-12 is proven to be an excellent small and simple molecular HTM candidate featuring a suitable HOMO level and efficient charge transfer ability. A remarkable PCE exceeding 18% is realized using SP-12 as the HTM and PVK as the interlayer, surpassing that of spiro-OMeTAD (16.9%). Superior stability against cell degradation has been verified for the proposed protection method. Interestingly, although the energy levels between perovskite and PVK are not matched, the PCEs of this device are magically increased owing to less charge combination and faster hole transport. This surprising phenomenon implies that other similar polymers could be effective for generalization as a functional interlayer to improve the efficiencies of PSCs. This interlayer between perovskite and the HTM could be a promising avenue for the PSC architecture and open a new direction of process development for highly efficient and stable PSCs. Further advancement is expected via optimizing the polymer interlayer, HTM structure and processing conditions.
