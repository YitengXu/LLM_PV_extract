    , Accepted 7th May 2013First published on 7th May 2013AbstractA series of bis(oxalate)borate ionic liquids (ILBOBs) were developed for the first time as the necessary components of the electrolyte system for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). It was found that the photovoltaic performances of DSCs were significantly improved by 26% to 45% with these ILBOBs in the organic solvent electrolytes. Systematic investigations were carried out to reveal the effects of the chain lengths of the quaternary ammonium BOB as well as the cations of the ILBOBs on the performances of the DSCs. Among them, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) was achieved by the DSC based on the electrolyte containing 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(oxalate)borate (EmimBOB). Specifically, the addition of EmimBOB increased the short circuit current densities (Jsc) from 11.87 mA cm−2 to 15.99 mA cm−2, and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) from 0.721 V to 0.742 V, accompanied by a final 45% improvement of the overall PCE from 6.01% to 8.73% under AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 illumination. As an ionic liquid, EmimBOB was also used to develop a solvent-free electrolyte system. Compared with the one containing pure 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII), the hybrid solvent-free electrolyte system based on the EmimBOB/PMII combination notably increased the PCE of the DSCs from 3.48% to 5.38%. Finally, using solvent-free electrolytes, the long-term stability of the DSC devices were remarkably improved.
1. Introduction
Since the breakthrough achieved by Grätzel and colleagues in 1991, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted significant attention because of their high efficiency, low cost, and simple assembly procedure.1 DSCs are mainly composed of three parts: the TiO2 photoanode coated with monolayer dye molecules, the electrolyte containing the redox couple, and the counter electrode plated with Pt. To date, the highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 11.18% and 12.30% have been obtained with two different electrolyte systems containing I−/I3− and cobalt complex as redox couples, respectively.2,3
Electrolyte, an important component of DSCs, allows the regeneration of the dye and serves as the hole transport medium between photoanode and counter electrode, thus significantly affecting photovoltaic performance. With this consideration, various efforts have been exerted by researchers to investigate, optimize or develop electrolyte systems for DSCs. As is well known, introducing some functional organic compounds into the electrolyte system can obviously improve the photovoltaic performances or durability of the DSCs.4 For example, 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), N-methylbenzimidazole (NMBI), N-butylbenzimidazole, 3-(4-(benzimidazolyl)butyl)-1-methylimidazolium bromide ([BMImB]Br), and 3-(4-(benzimidazolyl)butyl)-1-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMImB]BF4) can be used to suppress the charge recombination, thus minimizing energy loss.5–7 For the purpose of improving the stability of the DSCs, for instance, we can also introduce guanidine thiocyanate (GuSCN) into the electrolyte.8 In addition, another type of additive, the ionic liquid, has been proved an important component for the electrolyte.2,9 On one hand, the ionic liquids can be used to suppress the volatility of the organic solvents. More importantly, using ionic liquids can improve the conductivity of the electrolyte and thus promote the conversion efficiency of the DSCs.10,11 Up to now, imidazolium type ionic liquids, such as 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), and 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), have been frequently used for highly efficient DSCs.
As an alternative to replace the commonly used LiPF6 in lithium rechargeable batteries, lithium bis(oxalate)borate (LiBOB) has shown superior passivation to Li and Li–graphite electrodes.12–14 Besides, the quaternary ammonium bis(oxalate)borates have also exhibited better performance in capacitors. However, presently no report on the application of bis(oxalate)borate ionic liquids (ILBOBs) in DSCs is available. In view of the indispensability of ionic liquids in electrolytes, and the excellent performance as well as the superior stability of ILBOB, it is necessary to evaluate and investigate this novel ionic liquid in the electrolyte system of DSCs.
In this study, a series of ILBOBs are introduced into the electrolyte system. For these ILBOBs, systematic investigations were carried out to reveal the effects of their different functional groups and cations on the electrochemical properties of the electrolytes as well as the photovoltaic performances of the DSCs. With these ILBOBs as additives in the organic solvent electrolyte systems, DSCs exhibited high PCEs. Especially, using 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(oxalate)borate (EmimBOB) as an additive in the electrolyte, a PCE of 8.73% was achieved by the DSC. Subsequently, together with PMII, EmimBOB was used to develop a solvent-free electrolyte system. This EminBOB/PMII conjugate could enhance the PCE obviously when compared to the pure PMII electrolyte system. Finally, it was proved that using the solvent-free electrolyte system, the long-term stability of the DSCs were significantly improved when compared with the device based on the organic solvent electrolyte systems.
2. Experiments
Preparation of TiO2 photoanode and fabrication of DSCs
The TiO2 paste of commercial P25 powder (Degussa, Germany) using polyethylene glycol 600 (PEG 600) as the dispersant was prepared according to our previous paper.15
A 14 μm thick layer of 20 nm TiO2 (P25, Degussa) with an area of 0.16 cm2 was attached to FTO glass by screen printing technique. The obtained film was sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the TiO2 film was treated in 40 mM TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and then sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the TiO2 films were immersed in 5 × 10−4 M solution of N719 dye (Solaronix SA, Switzerland) in ethanol for 20 h.
The dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and a sputtered-Pt counter electrode were sealed by 60 μm Surlyn film and the electrolyte was filled by the vacuum backfilling method, and then the hole was sealed by UV light adhesives and cover glass.
Synthesis of ILBOBs and preparation of electrolytes
The ILBOBs were synthesized based on a previous study conducted by the China Ionic Liquid Laboratory.16 In this paper, there are two electrolyte systems, organic solvent based and solvent-free ionic liquid based, respectively. Electrolytes A–H belong to the first electrolyte system. Electrolyte A was composed of 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.5 M TBP, the solvent was acetonitrile. Electrolytes B, C, D, E, F, G, and H were prepared by adding to electrolyte A with 0.1 M N1122BOB, N1123BOB, N1124BOB, N2223BOB, N2224BOB, EmimBOB, or ethyl pyridinium bis(oxalate)borate (EpyBOB), respectively. For preparation of the second system, solvent-free electrolyte, 0.1 M I2 and 0.1 M LiI were dissolved into the mixture of PMII/EmimBOB with the volume ratio of 3:1.
Characterization
Current–voltage curves of the DSCs were measured by a Keithley digital source meter (Keithley 2601, USA). The intensity of the incident light simulates an AM 1.5 solar light through a solar simulator (PEC-L15 Japan). The incident light intensity was calibrated using a silicon photocell (BS-520, Japan) and was set at 100 mW cm−2. The ionic conductivities of the liquid electrolytes were measured with a BEC-307 digitized conductivity meter (Bell, China). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, Zennium Zahner, Germany) was actualized with the cell in the dark at a −0.65 V bias. The measured frequency ranged from 100 mHz to 1 MHz, and the AC amplitude was set at 10 mV. The Mott–Schottky analysis was performed on the same equipment based on a DSC cell with the potential range of 0 to −0.8 V, using the two electrode system with the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode as the working electrode and sputtered-Pt as the counter electrode. The stability testing was performed under 100 mW cm−2 simulated solar illumination. The devices were measured after a certain amount of time under AM 1.5 simulated sunlight.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the structures of the ILBOBs, with quaternary ammonium, imidazole and pyridine as their cations, respectively. In this section, we firstly focused our research on quaternary ammonium-based ILBOBs, revealing the influence of the chain length on the properties of the electrolytes and the photovoltaic behaviors of the DSCs. To be emphasized, electrolyte A can be regarded as the reference in which no ILBOB was added.
 Fig. 1  The structures of the ILBOBs in this work. 

Fig. 2a shows the photovoltaic performance of the DSCs based on the six kinds of electrolytes (A–F) under one sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). The I–V parameters are summarized in Table 1. Obviously, the performances of electrolytes B, C, D, E, and F in DSCs were superior to that of electrolyte A. With the addition of ILBOBs in the electrolytes, the improved photovoltaic performances could be mainly ascribed to the enhanced short-circuit current densities (Jsc). The conductivity was regarded as one of the key factors that affect the photovoltaic performance of electrolytes in DSCs. The relationship between Jsc and conductivity is summarized in Fig. 2b, in which variations of the Jsc for the DSCs are in good accordance with the conductivities of the electrolytes. Among the electrolytes, C, D, E, and F exhibited similar performances, whereas the highest efficiency was obtained by electrolyte B with N1122BOB as the additive. The values for the open circuit voltage (Voc), Jsc, and fill factor (FF) of the DSCs based on electrolyte B were 0.727 V, 15.81 mA cm−2, and 0.73, respectively, yielding an overall PCE of 8.33%. The values of Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE for electrolyte A are 0.721 V, 11.87 mA cm−2, 0.71, and 6.02%, respectively. The PCE of the electrolytes improved by 26% to 38% with the addition of the ILBOBs. Meanwhile, the PCEs of electrolytes B–F are inversely proportional to the chain length of the cations. Further mechanistic investigations are needed. Meanwhile, the Voc of the devices based on electrolytes A–F increased gradually along with the lengthening of the chain on the quaternary ammonium cations of the ILBOBs. This may arise from the recombination process between the electrons of the TiO2 conduction band and the I3− in the electrolyte, one dominant energy loss process we need to suppress.17 To investigate this aspect, as shown in Fig. 3, we carried out EIS characterizations on the DSCs based on three representative electrolyte systems, B, D and F, respectively. In the Figure, typical Nyquist plots of DSCs are demonstrated, in which three semicircles are involved.18–20 As has been stated many times in previous publications, the one in the middle-frequency region reflects the resistance of the charge recombination, Rct2. Meanwhile, the charge transfer resistance of I−/I3− on the counter electrodes appears in the high-frequency region (Rct1) and the information related to the Nernst diffusion within the electrolytes that should be exhibited in the low frequency range (usually below 1 Hz) has been overlapped by Rct2 in our case. For Rct1, no obvious difference can be found for these three DSCs. With lengthening the alkyl chain, Rct2 increased accordingly, suggesting a long alkyl chain on the quaternary ammonium cations of the ILBOBs was more favorable to suppress the charge recombination. On the other hand, the characteristic frequencies for the DSCs based on electrolytes B, D and F were 8.81 Hz, 6.04 Hz, and 4.0 Hz, respectively. Therefore, the lifetimes of the photogenerated electrons were also enhanced, another positive factor facilitating electron collection. Finally, it can be said that, except for enhancing the conductivity of the electrolyte, our ILBOBs could also modify the TiO2/electrolyte interface to reduce energy loss, which results in the higher Jsc and Voc as well as the superior conversion efficiency.

The Voc, Jsc, and FF values obtained for the DSCs based on electrolyte G were 0.742 V, 15.99 mA cm−2, and 0.74, yielding the highest overall conversion efficiency of 8.73% in this study. Compared with electrolyte A, the PCE of the DSCs was improved by 45.0%. In contrast, a PCE of 7.46% was obtained with electrolyte H, in which the cation of the ILBOB was ethyl pyridine. Parameters in Table 2 clearly show that Voc increased successively for electrolytes B, G, and H.

Mott–Schottky measurements are a useful method for detecting the flatband potential of oxides. A Mott–Schottky analysis was employed to detect the flatband potential of the TiO2 electrode by measuring the different capacitances as a function of the applied potential expressed by the following equation:21  
Where Csc is the space-charge capacitance, ε is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, Nd is the dopant density, Eap is the applied potential, and Efb is the flatband potential. The typical Mott–Schottky curves of the DSCs based on electrolytes B, G, and H are shown in Fig. 4b. The deviation from linearity can be attributed to the effects of the values of TiO2 in the DSCs with electrolytes containing different surface states, recombination processes, insufficient etching, and non-negligible contributions of the Helmholtz layer to the interfacial capacitance. The Vfb (X-intercept of straight line) for the ILBOBs are summarized in Table 2. The addition of ILBOBs based on N1122BOB, EmimBOB, and EPyBOB caused the Vfb of the TiO2 electrode to shift to a negative value from −0.56 V to −0.62 V. As we all know, the Voc of DSCs is determined by the difference between the Fermi level of TiO2 and redox potential of the redox couple in the electrolyte. Here, the latter can be regarded as a constant, correspondingly, the change of Voc is attributed to the move of the Fermi level of TiO2.22 Hence, the negative movement of the flatband potential of G and H lead to the increase in Voc. The EPyBOB electrolyte yielded the most negative flatband potential of TiO2, which is responsible for the high Voc and the slightly decreased Jsc.
As described in the experimental section, the EmimBOB was also used to fabricate an all ionic liquid and solvent-free electrolyte. In this novel electrolyte system, except for I2, LiI and ionic liquids, no any other components were added. The I–V curves and parameters are summarized in Fig. 5 and Table 3. For the DSCs based on PMII/EmimBOB hybrid solvent-free electrolyte, a high PCE of 5.38% was obtained, and the values of Voc, Jsc, and FF were 0.593 V, 13.91 mA cm−2, and 0.65, respectively. In contrast with the DSCs based on pure PMII electrolyte (PCE was 3.48%), the one based on EmimBOB/PMII improved the PCE by 54.6%. The high Jsc is responsible for the increased PCE, which is in agreement with the systems of organic solvents.

The addition of EmimBOB is a new and highly efficient method of enhancing the long-term operation of outdoor DSCs through resisting the evaporation of the solvent. The long-term stability of DSCs based on organic solvents and solvent-free electrolyte systems were tested by subjecting the cell to light at full solar intensity (100 mW cm−2) for 1000 h. As shown in Fig. 6, the PCEs of organic solvent electrolyte-based DSCs decreased obviously with prolonging the testing time, probably due to solvent evaporation and leakage. However, for DSCs based on electrolyte G, the stability was improved, indicating that using a solvent-free electrolyte system could largely enhance the long-term stability of the DSCs. Over a period of 1000 h, instead of a decrease, the PCE based on the solvent-free electrolyte showed a slight increase in the initial stages because of the further penetration of the ionic liquid into the porous TiO2 film, and then tended to be steady. The efficiency was perfectly maintained over the test period, indicating the superior stability of ILBOB-based electrolytes during long-term running.

4. Conclusions
A series of ILBOBs were developed for the first time for the electrolyte system of DSCs. Photovoltaic performances were improved by 26% to 45% with the addition of the ILBOBs to organic solvent electrolytes. The highest PCE obtained was 8.73% for the DSC based on the electrolyte with EmimBOB. The conductivity of the electrolyte, Jsc, and PCE increased with the decreasing chain length of the cations for the quaternary ammonium BOB. The presence of the imidazolium and pyridine cations caused the flatband potential of TiO2 to shift to a negative value, compared with that of the quaternary ammonium cation. The results are in good accordance with the open-circuit voltage. Furthermore, an excellent performance was also achieved by the organic solvent-free electrolyte system, based on which the DSCs also exhibited a better long-term stability. The results in this work thereby provide a new insight into the design of highly efficient additives and fabrication of stable DSCs for outdoor applications.
