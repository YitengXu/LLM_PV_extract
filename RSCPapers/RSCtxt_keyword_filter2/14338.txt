    , Accepted 24th January 2016First published on 25th January 2016AbstractFive different commercially available fullerenes are evaluated as hole blocking/electron transporting materials in p–i–n methylammonium lead iodide perovskite solar cells using a vacuum deposited perovskite absorber layer. A significant enhancement of the solar cell performance can be obtained by selecting a suitable fullerene derivative. Open-circuit voltages as high as 1.11 volts are obtained leading to a power conversion efficiency of 14.6%.
Organometal halide perovskites have recently attracted much interest in photovoltaic applications because of their impressive performance, now exceeding 21%.1–3 Several methods have been reported in order to deposit the perovskite layer; one of them is the physical vapour deposition technique. This presents some advantages over solution-based methods, such as high purity, compatibility with large area, and fine control over the film thickness and morphology, leading to high-efficiency photovoltaic devices.4–9 In general, two main device architectures have been used to fabricate perovskite solar cells. One of them (n–i–p) is derived from cells built on a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold with a typical configuration of a substrate/TiO2 (n)/perovskite (i)/organic semiconductor (p).10–13 The other configuration is the p–i–n structure, substrate/hole transporting layer (HTL) (p)/perovskite (i)/electron transporting layer (ETL) (n), in which the perovskite crystals are created on top of transparent substrates covered with a hole transport layer, mostly poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). The ETL materials used in this configuration are mostly fullerene derivatives.5,14–16 Jeng et al. were the first in using three fullerene derivatives (C60, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM)), and indene-C60 bisadduct (IC60BA) in a p–i–n configuration such as ETLs.14 They reported a PCE of 3.9% by employing PCBM and they verified the formation of a donor–acceptor interface at the CH3NH3PBI3/C60 interface. Soon after, Sun et al. demonstrated a pure bilayer CH3NH3PBI3/PC60BM solar cell with a PCE of 7.4%, the best reported until then for an all-solution-processable planar heterojunction device.17 More recently, Seo et al. reported the fabrication of a highly improved MAPbI3 perovskite solar cell using a solvent engineering approach and varying PCBM layer thicknesses, leading to 14% in the optimum device.18 Apart from PCBM, other fullerene derivatives have been used in perovskite solar cells. For example Wang et al. reported a high fill factor (FF) using a double layer structure to passivate trap states consisting of PC61BM/C60 or IC60BA/C60.19 Also Chiang et al. reported an efficiency of 16.3% using PC71BM as an electron transport material, in which solvent annealing of this layer was carefully conducted.20 Recently, Liang et al. demonstrated that the performance of a device follows the trend of increased electron mobility in the fullerene layer. They claimed that a higher electron mobility of the fullerene film promotes charge dissociation/transport in the device. They reported efficiencies of 8.06%, 13.37% and 15.44% for IC60BA, PC60BM, C60, respectively, as the mobility in C60 is higher than that in the PC60BM and in the IC60BA films, respectively.21 A lot of work on interface engineering between the PCBM layer and the metal contact has been carried out to overcome the mismatch in the energy levels of the metal contact (Al, Ag or Au) and the PCBM layer. In order to improve this, additional layers have been inserted between them, such as thermally evaporated LiF,18 Ba22 and C60/bathocuproine (BCP),23 or solution processed poly[(9,9-bis(30-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)](PFN),24 bis-C60-surfactant,25 TiOx,15 ZnO,26etc.
PCBM is the most used fullerene derivative in the p–i–n architecture, yet its room temperature solubility in aromatic solvents is limited to approximately 20 mg ml−1 limiting the achievable layer thickness. Recently, different alkyl esters, instead of the methyl ester were offered commercially by Solenne BV. Additionally, two different alkyl esters of a slightly different fullerene employing a different linker were reported to have improved solubility and when used in an organic solar cell to cause higher open-circuit voltages (Voc's). Sieval et al. claimed that these two new fullerene derivatives combine the advantages of [60]PCBM, i.e., good solubility and easy separation, with higher Voc values due to slightly lower reduction potentials.27
Most p–i–n type perovskite solar cells use PEDOT:PSS as the hole transporting layer yet as it is oxidized it does not block electrons. We have extensively studied the use of a thin electron blocking layer polyTPD (poly(N,N′-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine)) (a hole transporting arylamine based polymer) in between the PEDOT:PSS and the perovskite absorber.5,28–32 As the polyarylamine layer is apolar, wetting from perovskite precursor solvents such as dimethylformamide is not good complicating the processing from the perovskite layer using precursor solutions. However, when the perovskite layer is deposited using a vacuum based process, which is rather insensitive to the substrate layer, a homogeneous perovskite layer is formed on the electron blocking layer. Using this architecture Lin et al., achieved efficiencies of 16.5% in optimized cells using PCBM and a p-type polymeric semiconductor as the electron blocking layer.6
In this communication, five different commercially available fullerenes are evaluated as the hole blocking/electron transporting materials in p–i–n perovskite solar cells employing polyTPD as the electron blocking layer with a vacuum deposited perovskite absorber layer. The fullerenes are members of two distinct families; [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid with methyl (PCBM), butyl (PCBH), hexyl ester (PCBB) and indene-C60-propionic acid butyl ester and hexyl ester (IPB and IPH, respectively) (Fig. 1a). Improved processing and high power conversion efficiencies were obtained ranging from 13% to 14.6% depending on the particular fullerene employed. Hence, a significant enhancement of the solar cell performance can be obtained by selecting the suitable fullerene derivative.

Device preparation
Materials
Photolithographically patterned ITO covered glass substrates were purchased from Naranjo-Substrates (http://www.naranjosubstrates.com). PEDOT:PSS (Clevious PVP Al 4083) was obtained from Heraeus Holding and used as received. Poly-TPD was purchased from ADS Dye Source. PbI2 was purchased from Aldrich and CH3NH3I from Lumtec, both were used as received. All the fullerenes (PCBM, PCBB, PCBH, IPB, IPH) were purchased from Solenne BV. Devices (Fig. 1b) were prepared on cleaned ITO substrates, by spin coating a thin layer (70 nm) of PEDOT:PSS. On top of this a thin film of polyTPD was deposited from a chlorobenzene solution (7 mg ml−1). The substrates were transferred to a vacuum chamber into a nitrogen-filled glovebox (MBraun, <0.1 ppm O2 and <0.1 ppm H2O) and evacuated to a pressure of 1 × 10−6 mbar. Two ceramic crucibles were filled with CH3NH3I and PbI2 each of which were heated to 70 °C and 250 °C, respectively, the CH3NH3PbI3 was then thermally evaporated to a thickness of 320 nm, using a protocol described previously.5 The film thickness was controlled by the PbI2 evaporation rate maintained around 0.5 Å s−1. The fullerene layer was deposited using a chlorobenzene solution of 20 mg ml−1 under ambient conditions using spin coating. The devices were completed by the thermal evaporation of the metal electrode under a base pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar to a thickness of 10 nm of Ba and 100 nm of Ag. Device characterization was performed using a mini-sun simulator with a halogen lamp designed by ECN and calibrated with a Si reference cell. The unencapsulated solar cells were measured in a N2-filled glovebox. The current density (J) versus voltage (V) characteristics were obtained in the dark and under illumination using a shadow mask to prohibit lateral current collection from outside the active area. The current-density-versus-voltage (J–V) and irradiance-versus-voltage (L–V) characteristics were obtained using a Keithley Model 2400 source measurement unit and a Si-photodiode coupled to an integrated sphere, respectively.
Results and discussion
The crystallinity of the vacuum deposited perovskite was investigated by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements, revealing the typical CH3NH3PbI3 diffraction pattern (in terms of both peak position and relative intensity, see Fig. S1†). The absorption spectrum (Fig. S2†) also confirms the formation of the perovskite. The main difference between PCBM and PCB-Cn (PCBH and PCBB) is the increased length of the alkyl chains (Cn) used in the ester group that makes them more soluble. This leads to improved processing and to more homogeneous layers on top of the perovskite layer with fewer defects as evidenced by optical microscope images (Fig. S3 in the ESI†). The film morphology on a micrometer scale as observed from atomic force microscope characterization does not show significant differences between the different fullerene derivatives (Fig. S4†). In all cases the fullerene films on top of the perovskite absorbers are rather smooth with a root-mean-square roughness of around 10 nm. The absorption spectra of the PCB-R films are similar, yet differ from those of the films of the IP-R derivatives (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  Optical absorption spectra for thin films on quartz of the five different fullerene derivatives. 
The PCB-R show a higher absorption (350–450 nm), with weak tails extending as far as 600 nm (Fig. S5†). The origin of this absorption tail is the result of light scattering or other experimental artefacts. We note that films of C60 are reported to have similar absorption tails at low energies.33 The IP-R films have only one absorption peak with a maximum around 325 nm whereas the PCB-R films present two peaks with maxima at 300 and 350 nm, due to the differences in the chemical structure as seen before for the fullerenes.
The devices employing the different fullerenes were characterized by determining the current density versus voltage both in the dark and under approximate 1 sun illumination. Fig. 3a shows the dark current density versus voltage curves. The leakage current is low, indicating the high quality of the diodes independent of the fullerene employed for the whole series of devices. This is remarkable in view of the craters observed in the PCBM films (Fig. S3†) when deposited on top of the perovskite layer. It implies that such craters do not lead to ohmic leakage currents due to charge injection from the Ba/Ag electrode to the perovskite layer. A low leakage current density is beneficial for maximum open circuit voltages as the recombination due to leakage is diminished. The typical diode performance under approximately 1 sun illumination for the series of devices is shown in Fig. 3b. In line with the good diode quality the J–V curves under illumination are also rather squared showing good charge extraction up to voltages close to Voc. This is evidenced by the high fill factors obtained which are in between 75 and 80% (see Table 1). No clear trends in the FF with the different fullerenes employed were observed, although the devices with the PCBB fullerene showed consistently lower values than the others. The short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the solar cells was highest for the devices employing IPH as the n-type layer. There was not much difference in Jsc for the other devices employing the rest of the fullerenes, although the lowest Jsc values were obtained for devices employing PCBM. In the devices using PCBM the reduction in current density is most likely due to the defects (craters) in the PCBM layer (see Fig. S3†) as commented previously. These defects are positions in the device that lead to charge recombination.

The Voc values obtained were higher (10–20 mV) for the devices employing the IP-R derivatives. This is in line with the lower reduction potential of the IP-R fullerenes compared to PCBM as reported by Sieval et al.27 Hence, here a clear effect of the LUMO level of the fullerene on the obtainable Voc is shown, implying that further optimizations are possible. Due to both the higher current density and open circuit voltage for the devices using IPH as the hole blocking material, these devices exhibit the best power conversion efficiencies reaching 14.6% for the record cell. Considering that the thickness of the perovskite layer used is 320 nm these efficiencies are among the best obtained for vacuum deposited p–i–n type solar cells. No hysteresis was detected when a scan speed of 0.01 V s−1 was used for any of the devices using the different fullerenes. The forward and reverse J–V scans are virtually identical (Fig. S6†). The key device parameters are summarized in Table 1 (best data, represented) whereas the spreading of the data is represented in Fig. S7 of the ESI.†
The external quantum efficiency (EQEPV, Fig. 3c) of the diodes was determined by illuminating them with a white-light halogen lamp in combination with narrow bandpass filters. The EQEPV values of the devices employing the different fullerenes were high (0.7 to 0.8) in the visible range, while they diminished at wavelengths > 600 nm, where the perovskite is weakly absorbing (EQEPV ∼ 0.6). The onset response lies in the near-infrared, 770 nm. The trend in EQEPV is the same as previously observed for the Jsc, hence again the highest values are observed for the devices using IPH as the hole blocking material. The calculated current density is within 5% of the measured value under 1 sun illumination.
The increase in Voc of the solar cells employing IPH, compared to those that use PCB-R varieties, may be due to the lower reduction potential of IPH. Yet this also implies that the quasi fermi level splitting in the perovskite layer must be sufficient to yield such a high Voc. One of the major loss factors in the potential energy of the separated electron and holes is non-radiative decay.34 Hence, if the Voc is increased this may be related to a decrease in the non-radiative recombination of charge carriers in favour of radiative recombination. To test this, the diode series containing the different fullerene derivatives were also driven under forward bias at moderate voltages (above the Voc). The electroluminescence was monitored using a sensitive Si-photodiode coupled to an integrating sphere.
In Fig. 4a, the current density and irradiance as a function of the applied bias for all devices using the different fullerene derivatives are presented. A deviation from the leakage current occurs around 0.5 V, after which two regimes can be identified. First, an almost linear increase (in the log scale plot) is present, followed by a slower increase at higher voltages. The first regime is due to a diffusion current, whereas the second regime is indicative of an injection or space-charge limited current. Eventually, the current density reaches values higher than 100 mA cm−2 at 2.5 V, indicative of low carrier injection barriers and good charge transport in the diodes. Intense electroluminescence was observed in all the devices prepared, with only slight differences as a function of the fullerene derivative used. The turn-on voltage for the electroluminescence was found to be as low as 1 V for the complete series of devices, similar to that previously reported.22,35,36
 Fig. 4  (a) Current density and (b) radiance versus the voltage applied. (c) External quantum efficiency (EQE) versus the voltage applied for the different fullerene derivatives used. 
The maximum external quantum efficiency of the electroluminescence (EQEEL) of the diodes, however, did change depending on the fullerene derivative that was used. For the diode using PCBM an EQEEL of ∼0.04% (Fig. 4b) was obtained, very similar to that reported previously for similar diodes.22,35,36 Yet the EQEEL for the devices using fullerenes different from PCBM is increased, with the best values found for devices using the IP-R fullerenes reaching 0.12%. This is a 3 times increase compared to the EQEEL of the diode employing PCBM. Hence, the increase in Voc of the solar cells is accompanied by an increase in the radiative efficiency suggesting a reduction in non-radiative decay pathways.
Conclusions
In summary, five different fullerene derivatives (PCBM, PCBH, PCBB, IPB and IPH) were evaluated as the electron transporting/hole blocking layer in p–i–n solar cells. The fullerenes with alkyl esters longer than methyl lead to improved layers with fewer defects than the layers obtained with PCBM. In the devices employing the PCB-R fullerenes, the improved layer quality did not lead to a significant improvement in photovoltaic behaviour. For the devices that use the IP-R type fullerenes both the current density and open circuit voltage are improved, leading to improved photovoltaic performance of these devices. When operated as LEDs, it was shown that the external quantum efficiency of electroluminescence is improved for all devices with the longer alkyl ester fullerenes, which is indicative of a reduction in the non-radiative decay in these devices. Hence, the PCB-R and in particular IP-R are very promising fullerenes for perovskite solar cells and larger area processing where the layer formation is more critical than in the small area devices used here.
