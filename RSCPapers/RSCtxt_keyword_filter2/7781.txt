    , Accepted 24th May 2019First published on 31st May 2019AbstractA new alcohol-soluble AIE-active quaternary ammonium salt PTN-Br was prepared and developed as the cathode interfacial layer (CIL) between the Ag electrode and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) in p–i–n perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Excitingly, the device showed a reduced work function (WF) of the commonly used Ag electrode, improved cathode interfacial contact, accelerated electron transport mobility and suppressed interfacial recombination, directly leading to a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.44%, which exceeded that of the reference device without PTN-Br as the CIL (15.14%). Also, thanks to the absorption of PTN-Br in the UV region, the PTN-Br-based PVSCs showed superior UV stability, maintaining 72.2% of the original PCE, to the control device which maintained only 36.8% of the initial PCE after UV irradiation for 12 h.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have attracted increasing attention as promising photovoltaic solar cells because of their distinct merits including facile fabrication, inexpensive solution processing, and high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).1–6 Generally, the architectures of PVSCs could be sorted as mesoporous and planar structures, and planar PVSCs include n–i–p and p–i–n configurations.7–9 Even though the PCEs of regular and mesoporous PVSCs are higher than those of p–i–n ones,10–12 most of them show serious hysteresis effects and inferior stability under ultraviolet (UV) illumination.13,14 p–i–n PVSCs, featuring a configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/hole-transporting layer/perovskite/electron-transporting layer/cathode, have lower hysteresis effects due to the introduction of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), which could mitigate trap centres, prevent mobile ions from generating radicals, and improve electron extraction between perovskite films and electron-transporting materials (ETMs).15–17
However, regardless of the advantages of PCBM for p–i–n PVSCs, such as its appropriate energy level, good electron mobility and simple room-temperature solution process,18,19 there is still a large energy barrier between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PCBM and the Fermi levels of conventionally used metal cathodes (e.g., silver and aluminium), which results in poor contact between PCBM and the metal electrode accompanied by the poor performance of PVSCs.20,21 Besides, the PCBM layer spun on perovskite films shows incomplete surface coverage, causing undesirable contact of the perovskite and cathode and resulting in current leakage.22 To address the above issues, numerous materials, including inorganic and organic materials, have been utilized as cathode interfacial layers (CILs) to improve the interfacial contact at the interlayer of PCBM and the cathode in p–i–n PVSCs. For example, a thin bathocuproine (BCP) film,23 thermally evaporated Ca24 or Ba,25 fullerene, LiF,26 TiOx (ref. 27) or ZnO28 was employed to modify the interfacial properties and reduce the energy barrier. However, these materials demanded the costly vacuum deposition process and a complicated operating procedure. Hence, room-temperature solution-processed CILs have drawn more and more attention.29–39 Especially, organic solution-processed CILs with hydrophilic groups could provide an interfacial dipole between PCBM and the metal electrode without destroying underlying PCBM layers.31,36 For instance, Huang and co-workers fabricated a high-performance p–i–n PVSC device by using a Liq as a CIL. A Liq layer can mitigate the energy mismatch due to the dipole moment formed at the interlayer.40 Meng et al. showed that by introducing a solution-processable CIL (Phen-I), the PCE and stability in the dark were both largely improved. Despite the impressive improvement realized by introducing organic CILs, the issue of the inferior UV stability of p–i–n PVSCs is often ignored.41
Recently, π systems with aggregation induced emission (AIE) properties have demonstrated potential applications in photoelectric fields, such as LEDs, sensors, bioimaging, etc., because of their twisted structure and special packing in aggregated states.42–45 In 2017, we successfully utilized an AIE-based alcohol-soluble CIL of TPE-2 in organic photovoltaic cells for an improved PCE (from 3.89% of the control polymer solar cells to 8.94%) because of its special packing and symmetric zwitterionic chains. This prompted us to further develop new solution-processed AIE-based CILs.46 Accordingly, an AIE-active polymer (PTN-Br) containing a tetraphenylethylene (TPE) backbone and quaternary ammonium salt side chains was designed, and utilized to fabricate high-performance p–i–n planar PVSCs (Chart 1). Really, a champion PCE of 17.44% could be achieved as a result of the reduced work function (WF) of the metal cathode, accelerated charge transport mobility and improved interfacial contact. Furthermore, the stability of PVSCs was much enhanced under UV radiation; the enhanced UV stability may be due to the suitable absorption of PTN-Br in the UV region and intense emission in the visible region. Herein, we would like to present the synthesis, structural characterization, optical properties, electrochemical properties and device performance of PVSCs in detail.

Results and discussion
Synthetic procedures and characterization of the polymer
The alcohol-soluble TPE-based polymer PTN-Br was designed and prepared through the synthetic route outlined in Scheme 1. A bromo-substituted monomer (M1) was prepared by treating compound 1 with boron tribromide at −78 °C in a solution of anhydrous dichloromethane and further reacting it with an excess amount of 3-chloro-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine-hydrochloride under basic conditions. Then, M1 was reacted with another boronic ester monomer (M2) to successfully yield polytetraphenylethene 3,3′-(((2,2-diphenylethene-1,1-diyl)bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(oxy))bis(N,N-dimethylpropan-1 amine) tetraphenylethene (PTN) through a palladium-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction. PTN is a yellow solid with a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 10.5 kDa, and the polydispersity index of PTN is 1.08. The neutral polymer (PTN) was treated with excess bromoethane in the mixture solvents of THF and methanol at room temperature for 3 days, to produce the quaternary ammonium-functionalized polymer (PTN-Br) in a high yield of 91%. The detailed syntheses of monomers, PTN and PTN-Br, are described in the experimental section, with their structures characterized by multinuclear NMR (Fig. S1–S6†), mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and GPC. Chart 1 exhibits the chemical structure of PTN-Br, which possesses a TPE-based backbone and quaternary ammonium functionalized side chains. First, TPE is a widely used building block in the organic optoelectronic field with special packing and wide absorption in the UV region, which is beneficial to the UV stability of PVSCs. Second, quaternary ammonium functionalized side chains can reduce the WF of the Ag electrode by forming interfacial dipoles.33,35,47 Last, quaternary ammonium functionalized side chains are introduced to improve its solubility in alcoholic solvents.21PTN-Br is soluble in high polarity solvents (e.g., methanol, ethanol, and DMF), but possesses poor solubility in low polarity solvents, such as chloroform, THF and chlorobenzene, commonly used for the fabrication of PCBM layers. Generally, high polarity solvents could be sorted as polar aprotic solvents (e.g., DMF, DMSO and acetone) and polar protic solvents (e.g., 2-propanol and ethanol). Thanks to the sluggish dissolution kinetics of perovskites in protic polar solvents,48 the low boiling point of ethanol and the high vacuum evaporation process, the anhydrous ethanol should have a weak influence on perovskite films. Additionally, ethanol could not dissolve PCBM layers. Thus, ethanol could be utilized to prepare the cathode interlayer (CIL) by a solution process without destroying the underlying PCBM layer and perovskite layer in p–i–n planar PVSCs.

Optoelectronic properties of PTN-Br
UV-Vis absorption spectra of PTN-Br were recorded (Fig. 1a). In the methanol solution, PTN-Br exhibits an absorption band at 341 nm with a concentration of 10 μM, which should be attributed to the π–π* transitions of the TPE backbone. A broader and bathochromically shifted peak (from 341 to 385 nm) is observed in the film, indicating the intermolecular aggregation of the polymer in the solid state.45,49 The value of the molar absorptivity (ε) of PTN-Br, which is calculated according to the UV-Vis absorption of PTN-Br, is 4.41 × 105 L mol−1 cm−1 in THF solution at 341 nm, indicating that PTN-Br has relatively strong absorption in the UV region. Considering its absorption in the UV region, the PTN-Br films could protect the perovskite layer from UV illumination by absorbing some part of the UV light. Due to the existence of TPE moieties, PTN-Br exhibits an apparent AEE (Aggregation-enhanced Emission) feature. The fluorescence spectra of PTN-Br (at a concentration of 10 μM) in the mixture solvents of ether and methanol with different ether fractions (fe) were measured with the results summarized in Fig. S7a.† It shows weak emission (505 nm) in good solvents, such as methanol, ethanol and DMF. However, when ether, a poor solvent for PTN-Br, is added into its methanol solution, the soluble polymer could aggregate and induce an enhanced emission. When the fe is lower than 80%, the PL spectra of PTN-Br change little, because of the partial rotation of the benzene ring. However, when the fe is higher than 80%, the emission intensity of PTN-Br is much enhanced, due to the restriction of free rotation. And the PL spectrum of PTN-Br in the film was also measured (Fig. S7b†), which exhibited a broad and bathochromic shift emission (513 nm), due to the molecular packing in films. In comparison with the reported CILs, under UV illumination, PTN-Br shows broader UV absorption.

The energy level of PTN-Br was evaluated by using the CV curve (Fig. S8†). And the CV curve of ferrocene/ferrocenium was recorded (with a value of 0.44 eV) as the standard value for the reference electrode (AgCl/Ag+ electrode). The oxidation potential (Eox) of the bromine anion appeared to be 0.74 V, similar to those reported in the literature.50 Under uniform conditions, the oxidation potential (Eox) of PTN-Br was measured to be 1.05 eV. The EHOMO energy level of PTN-Br was calculated to be −5.41 eV, by using the equation EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.80 − 0.44) eV.(1)
Then the ELUMO energy level of PTN-Br was −2.48 eV according to the equation ELUMO = (EHOMO + Egopt.) eV,(2)with the optical bandgap (Egopt.) obtained from the absorption onset wavelength of PTN-Br.
To examine the cathode modification ability of PTN-Br as the CIL, p–i–n devices based on PTN-Br were fabricated with the device structure of ITO/NiOx/perovskite/PCBM/PTN-Br/Ag as shown in Chart 1. The CIL was obtained by spin-coating the PTN-Br solution (0.5 mg mL−1 in ethanol) onto the PCBM layer. For reference, devices without a CIL were prepared under identical fabrication conditions. To optimize device performance, the interlayer with different thicknesses is adjusted via tuning the concentration of PTN-Br from 0.2 to 1.0 mg mL−1. The thicknesses of PTN-Br with various concentrations were estimated with a step profilometer (Bruker Dektakxt). And the corresponding thicknesses at concentrations of 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 mg mL−1 were approximately 4.4, 5.8 and 8.1 nm, respectively (Table S1†). Fig. 1b presents the J–V curves of PVSCs incorporated with different concentrations of PTN-Br and detailed device performance parameters with the various concentrations are summarized in Table S1.† With the concentration increasing from 0.2 to 0.5 mg mL−1, the PCE improved; however, the PCE decreased when further increasing the concentration of PTN-Br to 1.0 mg mL−1. Excitingly, the device performance achieved a champion PCE of 17.44% when the concentration of PTN-Br was 0.5 mg mL−1: a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.89 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.023 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 77.88%, while the reference devices show the best PCE of 15.14% (with a Jsc of 20.67 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.004 V, and a FF of 72.93%) under the same conditions (Fig. 2a). And compared to the device without PTN-Br, the PCE value is largely improved by 13.2% (17.44% versus 15.14%). The improvement of device performance with PTN-Br should be ascribed to the higher Jsc and FF. Additionally, the thickness of PTN-Br under optical conditions is 5.8 nm. To confirm the improvement of Jsc, external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of PTN-Br based PVSCs and the reference one were also measured (Fig. 2b). When PTN-Br was present, the EQE was significantly improved between 300 and 750 nm. And the calculated Jscs of the devices with or without PTN-Br were 20.77 and 19.13 mA cm−2, respectively, matching well with those measured from the illuminated J–V curves. Under different scanning directions, the J–V curves under the conditions of the best device performance were measured to study the photocurrent hysteresis, which was caused by the less efficient electron extraction and ion migration. PTN-Br based devices exhibit PCEs as high as 17.44% under reverse scanning conditions and 16.83% under forward scanning conditions (Fig. 2c). However, the reference devices possess very different PCEs under forward and reverse scanning directions, with a PCE value of 15.14% under reverse scanning conditions and 13.25% under forward scanning (Fig. 2c). As listed in Table 1, the PCEs of devices incorporated with PTN-Br in various scanning directions showed little difference, demonstrating a faint hysteresis behavior. This is a key parameter for the improved performance and stability of PVSCs. Also, the steady-state photocurrent and PCE were recorded under an invariable bias of 0.90 V (with the presence of PTN-Br) or 0.88 V (without PTN-Br), which was the maximum power output point for PTN-Br (Fig. 2d) and the reference device (Fig. S9†). Consistent with the case of the above PCE values, the steady-state PCE of the PTN-Br device (16.8%) was higher than that of the reference device (14.7%), confirming the power output reliability of PVSC devices with or without PTN-Br as the CIL. Compared to the PCBM-based (without PTN-Br as the CIL) device, the improved PCE of the PTN-Br based device possibly resulted from the formed interfacial dipoles between the PTN-Br and Ag electrode, which could facilitate electron extraction, mitigate carrier recombination at the interface of Ag and PCBM and ultimately enhance the Jsc as well as FF.46,51

UPS was utilized to evaluate the formation of the interfacial dipole and the WF change of the Ag electrode after the insertion of PTN-Br.52,53 The samples for UPS were obtained via spin-coating the dissolved solution of PTN-Br (0.5 mg mL−1 in ethanol) on the Ag electrode, at the best modified concentration of PTN-Br in PVSCs. The WF value of the evaporated silver electrode is 4.60 eV (Fig. 3a). When a thin layer of PTN-Br was deposited, the WF of the Ag electrode drops to 4.10 eV, matching well with the ELUMO of PCBM (−4.0 eV). The reduction of the WF implies the formation of dipole moments at the surface between PCBM/Ag. And the lowered WF of the Ag cathode contributes to a better energy alignment between PCBM and the Ag electrode accompanied by a reduced energy barrier, which benefits charge extraction and ohmic contact at the interlayer (Fig. 3b).

(d) The Jsc of PVSCs with or without PTN-Br CILs under different light intensities. (e) Steady-state PL spectra of different films. (f) The SCLC model for the PTN-Br-based and reference devices (device configuration: ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/CIL/Ag). 
Dark J–V characteristics before and after insertion of PTN-Br were also measured to explore the interfacial contact properties (Fig. 3c).54 For the p–i–n PVSCs, the Shockley diode model was utilized to fit the J–V curve in the dark according to the following equation: J = J0[exp(qv/AKT) − 1],(3)where J0, q, A, K and T are the reverse saturation current, electron charge, ideality factor, Boltzmann constant and absolute temperature, respectively. The J–V curves of the PTN-Br based PVSC device and reference one in the dark conform to the typical diode behaviour, which possesses three regimes: a leakage contribution, an exponential regime and a space-charge-limited regime. Charge recombination could be evaluated by using the value of A, which is calculated according to the slope of the exponential regime in a semi-logarithmic plot by using the equation A = [(KT/q)(∂lnJ/∂lnV)]−1.(4)
Charge recombination could lead to the value of A being higher than 2.35 Compared to the reference device without PTN-Br (the value of A is 3.35), the PTN-Br based device possesses a much lower A with a value of 1.82, indicating mitigated charge recombination in p–i–n solar cells and improved ohmic contact of the PCBM layers and metal cathode (Ag electrode). The reverse saturation leakage currents of the device modified with or without PTN-Br are obtained by using eqn (3), with J0 values of 6.77 × 10−5 (without PTN-Br) and 4.13 × 10−8 mA cm−2 (with the presence of PTN-Br), respectively, suggesting that the incorporation of PTN-Br could suppress the charge recombination. The J–V curves in the dark clearly demonstrate that the PTN-Br layer could improve the interfacial properties and reduce the carrier recombination at the interface, accounting for the enhanced FF in PVSCs. To gain more information on the charge recombination, the variation of Jsc and Voc against light intensity (Plight) was measured and is presented in Fig. 3d and S10,† respectively. Jscvs. Plight is fit using the equation Jsc ∝ Plightα,(5)and the bimolecular recombination could be negligible when the α value is close to 1.55,56 The two parameters showed a good linear relationship on a log–log scale, and the α value of the PTN-Br based device (0.98) was closer to 1, in comparison with that of the device without PTN-Br (0.92). Thus, these results of the light intensity dependence on the Jsc indicated that more charge generated was swept out of the device, and then the bimolecular recombination was mitigated. For the function of Vocvs. Plight on a semilogarithmic scale, the two parameters showed a good linear relationship with the slope proportional to KT/e (Fig. S10†). The trap-assisted recombination was involved when the slope constant deviates from 1 KT/e. The slope constants of the device were 1.51 KT/e (with the presence of PTN-Br) and 1.62 KT/e (without PTN-Br) for PVSCs, disclosing that the PTN-Br CIL reduced the trap-assisted recombination in the PVSCs under open-circuit conditions.32 The variations of Jsc and Voc against light intensity (Plight) demonstrated that PTN-Br is an efficient CIL in PVSCs, which could suppress the charge recombination, including bimolecular recombination and trap-assisted recombination.
To reveal the role of the PTN-Br interlayer, the steady-state PL spectra were utilized to explore the electron transfer between the perovskite film and PCBM layer. Under excitation by 470 nm incident light, the PL spectra of the perovskite, PCBM layer covered perovskite or perovskite films deposited by PCBM and PTN-Br layers were recorded (Fig. 3e). All the films (perovskite, perovskite/PCBM and perovskite/PCBM/PTN-Br) showed PL peaks located at about 757 nm, which originated from perovskite layers. The PL intensity of those emission peaks was quenched when PCBM was coated onto the perovskite layer, indicating that the generated electron could be transferred from the perovskite to PCBM. After coating PTN-Br on PCBM, the PL intensity further decayed, suggesting that PTN-Br layers could enhance the electron transport between the perovskite and PCBM.57,58 The accelerated electron transport contributes to the improvement of Jsc. The electron mobilities of the devices after inserting the PTN-Br layer were obtained by utilizing the space charge limited current (SCLC) model, with the electron-only device configurations of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/Ag and ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/PTN-Br/Ag (Fig. 3f). The preparation conditions of the perovskite, PCBM and Ag electrode were identical to those of the PVSC device preparation. The modified Mott-Gurney law was used to fit the J–V curve on a log–log scale, in accordance with the equation J = 9εrεoμeV2/8L3,(6)where εrεo is the permittivity of the perovskite layers, μe is the electron mobility and L is the thickness of the perovskite layers.59 In comparison with the device without PTN-Br (electron mobility of the reference one is 4.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), the PTN-Br-based device showed an enhanced electron mobility of 7.37 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The enhanced electron mobility was ascribed to the reduction of charge recombination and improvement of charge extraction at the cathode interface.
Based on the above-mentioned discussions, the enhanced performance of the PTN-Br modified devices should be attributed to the improved contact properties at the cathode interlayer. For the p–i–n PVSCs, a thin PCBM layer may not realize full film coverage on the perovskite layer. Therefore, a complete coverage on the perovskite film was the prerequisite of efficient CILs.60,61 AFM was carried out to explore the influence of PTN-Br on the interfacial morphology of perovskite/PCBM. The devices with/without PTN-Br exhibited very different morphologies (Fig. 4a). For the film without PTN-Br, the perovskite was observed when a thin layer of PCBM was spin-cast, which indicated the incomplete coverage of PCBM on the perovskite surface.22,26,62 After the deposition of PTN-Br on the top of PCBM, a compact PTN-Br layer completely covered the PCBM layer, avoiding direct contact of the perovskite and Ag electrode. AFM results demonstrated that PTN-Br could improve the quality of the PCBM layers, forming a superior interlayer between the perovskite and Ag electrode. The CILs could restrain the formation of leakage current by preventing the direct contact of PCBM and the metal electrode, consistent with the results of dark J–V characteristics, which possessed a lower leakage current after the insertion of PTN-Br layers. The wetting characters of the PCBM films with or without PTN-Br were investigated by measuring the water contact angles (θ) (Fig. 4b). The contact angle of the PCBM film was about 95.3°, indicating the intense hydrophobicity of PCBM films, which was adverse to the contact between PCBM and the metal cathode. When PTN-Br (0.5 mg mL−1) was incorporated onto PCBM layers, the film exhibited an enhanced hydrophilic surface, with a θ value of 74.6°. The values at a concentration of 0.2 or 1.0 mg mL−1 were 79.3° or 70.0°, respectively (Fig. S11†). The improved hydrophilic films were beneficial to the interfacial contact between the Ag electrode and PCBM,21 leading to the increase of FF. The long-term stability of unencapsulated devices with/without PTN-Br was recorded by measuring the degradation of the PCEs after storage in a N2-purged glovebox. The normalized PCE of the reference PVSCs dropped quickly, with a PCE decrease of 50% after 20 days (Fig. 5a), while the device with PTN-Br showed a much improved stability after the same period, with 88% of the initial PCE maintained. Considering the complete coverage of PTN-Br and the hydrophobic conjugate backbone in the polymer, on one hand, the robust CIL films could impede the permeation of water and oxygen into the device, and on the other hand, it could also mitigate the corrosion of the metal cathode by preventing the reaction between the Ag electrode and perovskite, resulting in superior stability toward humidity and temperature.63–65 The humidity and thermal stability of the p–i–n device were also measured. The humidity stability of unencapsulated devices with/without PTN-Br was recorded by measuring the degradation of the PCEs after storage under ambient conditions (25 °C, relative humidity = 55%). The normalized PCE of reference PVSCs dropped to 36.1% of the initial PCEs after 10 days of storage under ambient conditions (Fig. S12a†). The decline in PCEs may be attributed to the degradation of the perovskite layer caused by interactions between the perovskite layer and water or oxygen permeating via the pinholes in the PCBM layer.63,66 However, the device with PTN-Br possessed a much enhanced stability toward humidity after the same period, with 60.6% of the initial PCEs being maintained. The main reason for the improved humidity stability was the existence of the robust CIL films (PTN-Br layer), which could reduce the ingress of water and oxygen into the device.37,61 Due to the robust PTN-Br layer, the PTN-Br-based device also showed superior thermal stability, as measured in a N2-purged glovebox at 50 °C (Fig. S12b†). The reference device without PTN-Br showed a sharp decline of the PCE after 60 h of heating and it finally dropped to 58.6% after 75 h of heating, due to the accelerated migration of silver toward the perovskite and severe diffusion of iodide ions toward the Ag electrode under heating conditions, similar to those reported in the literature.67,68 But the device with PTN-Br possessed better stability under heating, with 81.7% of the initial PCE after 75 h of heating. The much-enhanced thermal stability was attributed to the PTN-Br layer, which could isolate the perovskite layer and Ag electrode, prevent the contact with them and suppress the reaction between Ag and iodide ions. Additionally, the UV light stability of the devices with or without PTN-Br was also measured in a N2-purged glovebox under UV light illumination (365 nm, 12 W) (Fig. 5b). During the test of UV light stability, the UV light was incident from the Ag electrode. So the UV light was first absorbed by the PTN-Br layer protecting the perovskite films from UV light damage, and the schematic diagram is presented in Fig. S13.† The UV stability demonstrated here is toward the UV light in the environment and not toward the UV light in sunlight under working conditions. The reference device without PTN-Br exhibited inferior stability with a rapid decrease of PCE, which dropped to 36.8% of its original PCE after UV irradiation for 12 h. But the devices with PTN-Br have improved UV stability, maintaining 72.2% PCE under the same exposure conditions, indicating that the device with PTN-Br possessed improved resistance to UV irradiation. The enhanced UV stability may originate from the suitable absorption properties of PTN-Br, which could absorb some part of UV light and then emit visible light in the solid state.69 Generally, UV illumination could facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies and defects in the perovskite layer, leading to the inferior UV stability of PVSCs.36 Current research mainly focused on improving the UV stability of TiO2-based PVSCs; however, the UV stability of p–i–n PVSCs based on PCBM was rarely studied. Jen et al. prepared a solution-processed CuCrO2 film as a hole transport layer in p–i–n PVSCs, which exhibited a high PCE of 19.0% and enhanced UV stability.70 However, it was difficult to adjust the thickness of CuCrO2 because of its insulating properties. Fang and co-workers fabricated a stable p–i–n PVSC device by using a cross-linkable monomer as an additive. After cross-linking, ion migration was largely suppressed, resulting in improved stability towards UV irradiation.71 But, the cross-linking system requires heating at a temperature of up to 140 °C, which was adverse to the perovskite layer. Also, the introduction of down-conversion materials72 was utilized to improve the UV stability of p–i–n PVSCs. However, those approaches required additional processes on the device structure, such as the introduction of down-conversion materials by incorporating a polymer matrix on the top of FTO glass. In this work, solution-processed CILs, PTN-Br, could be conveniently utilized in p–i–n PVSCs by simply spin-coating without any additional process. And the thickness of the PTN-Br layer could be flexibly controlled by just changing its concentration or rotating speed.

Conclusions
In summary, by introducing a quaternary ammonium salt group into the TPE unit, an AIE-active polymer PTN-Br has been synthesized and developed as a CIL at the interlayer of the metal cathode and PCBM layers in p–i–n PVSCs for the first time. After optimization, the best PCE of 17.44% is obtained, which outperforms that of the control PVSCs without PTN-Br as the CIL (15.14%). Careful investigations demonstrate that, thanks to the presence of interfacial dipole moments, accelerated electron mobilities and suppressed charge recombination, the incorporation of PTN-Br leads to improved Jsc and FF in p–i–n planar PVSCs, resulting in higher PCE values. Also, PTN-Br can modify the morphology of PCBM layers, forming a compact coverage to avoid immediate contact of the Ag electrode with perovskite layers. The improved morphology also contributes to the enhanced PCE and device stability. Moreover, the PTN-Br based device shows enhanced resistance to UV irradiation, due to the suitable absorption in the UV region. Thus, this work possibly provides a new route to develop high-efficiency as well as long-term stable PVSCs.

A 400 MHz Varian Mercury spectrometer was used to record the 1H and 13C NMR spectra, and tetramethylsilane (TMS) was chosen as the internal standard (δ = 0 ppm). Mass spectroscopy was carried out on a ZAB 3F–HF spectrometer. A VARIO EL III elemental analysis instrument was utilized to perform elemental analyses. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was conducted using an Agilent 1100 series HPLC system, with polystyrene standards as calibration standards. UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy of PTN-Br in solution and the film were performed on a Shimadzu UV-2550 and a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer, respectively.

Solar cell fabrication
Acetone, detergent, water and isopropanol were utilized to clean indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) glass by sequential ultrasonication, and then a nitrogen stream was used to dry the glass. After cleaning, the ITO glass was treated with UV-ozone in a UV chamber for 5 min. To prepare the NiOx film (about 20 nm), an aqueous solution of NiOx (20 mg mL−1) was first added on the perovskite layer followed by spinning onto the ITO, and sequentially annealed at 120 °C for 30 min. To obtain the perovskite precursor solution (at a precursor concentration of 40 wt%), PbI2 and MAI with an equal molar ratio were dissolved in dry DMF. The precursor solution was spun onto the NiOx films at 5500 rpm for half a minute in a glovebox. In order to induce crystallization, 150 μL chlorobenzene was subsequently added on the substrates, and after about 6 s of the spin-coating, a hot plate at 100 °C was utilized to anneal the films coated with the perovskite precursor for 10 min. Subsequently, to prepare the PCBM layer, an anhydrous chlorobenzene solution of PCBM (20 mg mL−1) was first added on the perovskite layer followed by spinning at 2000 rpm for 30 s. To deposit the PTN-Br layer, ethanol solutions of PTN-Br with various concentrations were first added on the PCBM layer followed by spinning at 4500 rpm for about 1 minute. Finally, a thick silver electrode (100 nm) was evaporated. The active area of this metal electrode was 0.04 cm2. A Keithley 2400 was utilized to measure the illuminated and dark J–V curves. Under 100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G irradiation, illuminated J–V curves were recorded. Under monochromatic illumination, EQE spectra were measured. An Oriel Cornerstone 260 1/4 m monochromator was used to generate the monochromatic light and a monocrystalline silicon diode was utilized to calibrate the incident light. The UV stability was tested by using an ultraviolet analyzer (365 nm, 12 W) in a N2-purged glovebox. The stability was measured in a N2-purged glovebox. A Thermo Scientific Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) system was applied to measure the UPS spectra. The water contact angle was measured using a Krüss DSA100s drop shape analyser.
