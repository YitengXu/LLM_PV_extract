    , Accepted 22nd May 2017First published on 22nd May 2017AbstractThe well-established indoline dye D149 and three indoline dyes with improved binding stability (DN91, DN216 and DN285) were used as sensitizers for electrodeposited porous ZnO and studied in dye-sensitized solar cells and showed very similar cell characteristics. After storage of the cells in the dark for four weeks, an increase in short-circuit current density was observed. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy served to detect a shift of the conduction band edge energy to lower energies and, hence, an increased injection efficiency of electrons from the excited state of the sensitizer to the ZnO conduction band is detected as the main cause of this change. Additional photoelectrochemical experiments at different illumination intensities, intensity modulated photocurrent and photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS and IMVS), transient photocurrent measurements, as well as measurements of the open-circuit photovoltage decay (OCVD) were performed to confirm this conclusion and, further, to prove a reduced rate of recombination for these injected electrons which prevented a corresponding decrease in the open-circuit voltage for many cells, frequently observed earlier. It is therefore shown how the long-term stability of ZnO-based DSSCs can be improved.
Introduction
Since the successful introduction of mesoscopic dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) in 1991,1 many new materials have been developed, new material combinations tested and the efficiencies have been enhanced considerably.2–5 Presently, DSSCs consisting of nanocrystalline TiO2 sensitized by two differently anchored dyes in contact with a Co-based electrolyte reach a record efficiency of 14.3%,6 a quite promising value, even when compared to the higher efficiency of competing mesoscopic perovskite solar cells,7,8 considering the higher stability and smaller toxic risk of DSSCs. Beyond TiO2 as the most commonly used semiconductor material for DSSCs,6,9,10 ZnO offers an even wider variety of methods and electrode morphology,11 preparation in low-temperature synthesis and, thus, the use of cost-efficient and mechanically flexible polymeric substrates.12 Electrodeposition of porous ZnO from aqueous solutions, e.g., was already successfully applied on conductively coated plastic foils or wires and conductive textile threads.12,13 Efficiencies of electrodeposited ZnO, however, until now could not reach values higher than 5.6%,12 reported for an optimized combination with the indoline dye D149 on FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide)-coated glass substrates.
Indoline dyes have shown chemical degradation by decarboxylation under operation in DSSCs when adsorbed to TiO2,14 whereas desorption of the intact molecules was observed on ZnO nanoparticles sensitized with D149 in contact with an ionic liquid as an electrolyte.15 Further, a much higher stability of indoline dyes against this desorption at widely maintained efficiency was achieved by the addition of a second carboxylic anchor group to the outer rhodanine ring of D149,16,17 reaching a power conversion efficiency of 5.9% on ZnO prepared using atomized-spray pyrolysis.18 For such dyes a faster injection of electrons from the excited state of the indoline dye into the conduction band of electrodeposited ZnO could be shown.16 The cells in that study, however, had to allow partial transmission for experimental reasons and were based on ZnO electrodes with a small dye loading.
In the present study, these double-anchor indoline dyes, DN91, DN216 and DN285, were applied in cells of electrodeposited ZnO with optimized dye loading to directly compare their performance in fully operative DSSCs with state-of-the-art D149-sensitized cells.12,19,21 A detailed analysis of the electrode kinetics of the different cells based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under different illumination conditions, intensity modulated photocurrent and photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS and IMVS), transient photocurrent measurements, as well as measurements of the open-circuit photovoltage decay (OCVD) will be presented and it will serve to discuss different contributions to cell efficiency, namely injection and recombination of charge carriers. Experiments were performed directly after cell preparation of freshly prepared and aged ZnO samples as well as after up to four week storage time of completed cells to analyze the influence of long-term effects and discuss the stability of cell performance.
Methods
Sample preparation
The porous ZnO films used for the cells in this work were electrodeposited by the reduction of oxygen in an aqueous zinc salt solution with KCl as an electrolyte as described in detail in ref. 19 and DSSCs were prepared from the films by sensitization of dried ZnO films in a solution of the respective indoline dye (D149, DN91, DN216 or DN285, see Fig. 1 for the dye structure) obtained from Chemicrea Co. (Japan)22,23 and an added coadsorbate (lithocholic acid, LCA, obtained from Sigma, ≥98%) in a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile (Roth, ≥99.9%, ≤10 ppm H2O) and tert. Butanol (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.5%, anhydrous) for a sensitization time of 15 min. An iodide-containing electrolyte and a platinized counter electrode completed the cell setup.19 At least two cells were prepared for the dyes under investigation whereas only one reference cell was prepared for D149 to test for reproducibility of cell values reported earlier.19

Measurements
Current–voltage curves were measured using a Zahner IM6 potentiostat at simulated AM1.5 light (LOT LS0106 with AM1.5 filter). The light intensity was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 using a pyranometer (EKO-ML-020VM, Eko instruments). The measurements were performed without the use of a mask to ensure identical illumination conditions for different measurements (masking according to ref. 24 led to a decreased short-circuit current density by about 10%). EIS at AM1.5 illumination was performed by applying different potentials and using an amplitude of 10 mV. Additional photoelectrochemical analysis was performed under illumination with red light using a Zahner RTR LED (λmax = 632 nm) at different illumination intensities, using intensity modulated photocurrent and photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS and IMVS), photocurrent transients and open-circuit photovoltage decay (OCVD) and the measurement of the photovoltage vs. intensity. The cells were then stored in the dark, with occasional measurement of IV-curves under simulated AM1.5 illumination. After about 4 weeks, the complete photoelectrochemical analysis was repeated for each cell. The notation of the electrical polarity was chosen according to the electrochemical notation.
Concepts and data evaluation
Measured data were evaluated as described in ref. 21. The impedance spectra were evaluated by fitting to an equivalent circuit according to a well-established model25 (shown in the ESI,† Fig. S2) providing the chemical capacitance Cμ, the recombination resistance Rrec and the substrate series resistance Rs. To eliminate the influence of the overall series resistance of the cell, the voltage drop at the series resistance was subtracted from the applied voltage, giving the fermi-level voltage Vf.21,26 The behavior of the chemical capacitance Cμ of the film-electrolyte interface with the voltage is usually described by an exponential increase,21,27 (1)with α being the trap distribution parameter, Nt the total density of trap states, q the elemental charge, k Boltzmann's constant, T the absolute temperature, Vf the Fermi level voltage and Ec the conduction band edge energy. The recombination resistance Rrec is described by an exponential decrease with the voltage Vf,21,27 (2)with J0k the recombination rate, and β the recombination constant. The dependence of the open-circuit voltage VOC is given by the following equation,21,27 (3)with JSC being the short-circuit current density. The fill factor (FF) is related to the open-circuit voltage VOC and to β via the following relationship21,27 (4) This rather complete evaluation of primary data leads to quite busy plots which are documented for one complete set of cells in this article. Plots of other cells confirmed the interpretation and are shown in the ESI.†
Results and discussion
Performance of solar cells
ZnO films sensitized with the double-anchor dyes DN91, DN216 and DN28 at a dye-loading appropriate for well-functioning DSSCs as analyzed using optical spectroscopy (see also discussion following Fig. S1 in the ESI,†) led to cell characteristics which are very comparable to values achieved for electrodeposited ZnO sensitized with D149.12,19–21
Directly after preparation of the cells, IV-curves were measured at AM1.5 illumination and in the dark. The IV-curves for different cells are plotted in Fig. 2 (cell parameters listed in Table 1). The mean values of the short-circuit current densities JSC for dyes with two anchor groups increase with decreasing length of the carbon spacer, DN285 (7.81 mA cm−2) < DN216 (10.21 mA cm−2) < DN91 (10.84 mA cm−2), approximately reaching the value of D149 (10.38 mA cm−2). Similar observations have been made by Rohwer et al.,16 where ultrafast transient measurements revealed slower injection for dyes with a longer alkyl spacer of the second anchor group. Additional absorbance measurements on equivalently sensitized films (ESI,† Fig. S1) disclosed that the lower JSC value for DN285 is not simply due to a lower amount of dye molecules adsorbed to the ZnO surface, thus corroborating the conclusion that the lower JSC value is a direct consequence of the slower injection found for e.g. the dye DN285.16

For sensitization with D149, DN216 and DN285, the injection time seems not to be a limiting factor, as all three dyes achieve similar values of JSC. The fill factor (FF) of the studied cells is about 70% for most cells, comparable to literature values of the FF in DSSCs based on electrodeposited ZnO.16,20,21 Also, other cell values like the open-circuit voltage VOC, JSC and the power conversion efficiency η are comparable to values found in those references, and do not depend systematically on the dye structure.
After 4 weeks, the majority of the cells show a slightly higher power conversion efficiency. A slight decrease in VOC and in the FF for most of the cells is observed, and thus the observed improvement can be traced to a positive change in JSC during the storage (Table 1). JSC increases by about 9% for the studied cells during the four weeks storage in the dark, with the largest increase in the current occurring during the first few days (see Fig. 3). To enhance the legibility of this and most following plots the results of a typical cell per sensitizer are shown (other measurements shown in the ESI†).
 Fig. 3  Short-circuit current densities of DSSCs sensitized with different indoline dyes measured after different storage times following preparation of the solar cells. Day 0 denotes the day of preparation (followed by a longer electrochemical characterization). Different colors indicate different sensitizers as mentioned in the legend. 
For most cells the series resistance increases during storage in the dark, already indicated by a trend towards lower dI/dV at VOC in Fig. 2. By impedance measurements the different contributions to the overall series resistance Rseries were analyzed, in particular the sheet resistance of the substrate Rs, the electrolyte resistance Zd and the charge transfer resistance at the platinized counter electrode RPt (Table 2). Most contributions to Rseries remain constant, only the electrolyte resistance increases during the storage in the dark. This change could be explained by a change of the electrolyte during the storage time, e.g., by desorption of species from the semiconductor surface into the electrolyte during the storage time. Desorption of the dye into the electrolyte could lead to an increase in Zd as it was found in ref. 28; however, it was shown in the same reference that an addition of D149 to the electrolyte also increases the resistance of the platinized counter electrode RPt. An increase in RPt is observed for cell D149-1, where the single anchor group of the sensitizer molecule would still allow desorption. For cells containing sensitizers with two anchor groups, RPt remains roughly constant, thus giving an indication that desorption of the double-anchor dyes is suppressed not only in model experiments17 but also in working cells. The missing increase in RPt for the sensitization with DN91, DN216 and DN285 shows that desorption of dye molecules into the electrolyte cannot be the main cause for the observed increase in Zd. As a direct test, cell DN91-2 was built under conditions to avoid water contamination in the cell by additional means (e.g. extensive degassing of the ZnO film in the vacuum entry lock after drying, pre-filling of the cell with the electrolyte inside a glovebox), and showed by far the lowest increase in the electrolyte resistance Zd during the storage in the dark. Therefore, a possible reason for the increase in the electrolyte resistance could be water-contamination of the electrolyte inside the sealed cell by diffusion of water through imperfections of the sealant or by desorption of water from the surfaces, most likely from the porous ZnO itself. For the EIS results discussed below, the influence of the voltage drop at Rseries was removed by the applied voltage correction, so that the observed increase in electrolyte resistance does not affect other parameters.

Changes in the chemical capacitance
To untangle different possible origins of the observed systematic increase in JSC after storage in the dark, detailed photoelectrochemical measurements were performed. Impedance spectra (see ESI,† Fig. S2 for typical spectra) were fitted with an equivalent circuit (see also Fig. S2, ESI†), which provided the chemical capacitance Cμ of the cells, see Fig. 4 and Table S1 (ESI†). For intermediate voltages, a linear increase in Cμ with increasingly negative voltages (in the semi-logarithmic representation) is observed (eqn (1)). For more negative voltages a flattening of the curves indicates that the Helmholtz capacitance begins to dominate the overall capacitance,15,29 while a flattening at voltages positive of around −0.3 V indicates that the capacitance of the space-charge region between the substrate and the semiconductor (or the semiconductor and the electrolyte) begins to dominate the overall capacitance.27,30 For some cells an additional peak in the density of states arises in the values of Cμ at about −0.35 V. At a similar energetic position, deep monoenergetic trap states were observed in D149-sensitized cells (without coadsorbate) in ref. 21. Thus, it can be concluded that for some of the cells (e.g. cells D149-1 and DN216-1) deep monoenergetic trap states contribute to the values of Cμ.
 Fig. 4  Chemical capacitance Cμ of indoline-sensitized DSSCs, determined from EIS measurements at 100 mW cm−2 simulated sunlight. Different colors indicate different sensitizers. Curves with filled symbols were measured on the day of the preparation of the cells, while curves with open symbols were measured after about 4 weeks of storage in the dark. 
The trap distribution parameter, α, determined from the point of the highest slope of the capacitance curves, spans values from 0.36 to 0.52 for the different cells measured directly after preparation (see also Table 2). At least a part of the difference in α, especially for the cell sensitized with D149, is probably caused by a density of deep monoenergetic trap states, which decreases the slope of the capacitance curves at the respective voltage, and, thus, also the apparent values of α. In comparison to the literature, the values of α found here are in a very similar range as found for D149 with a coadsorbate on electrodeposited ZnO.16,20,21,26 Within this range of values, no additional significant change of α is observed after storage in the dark for 4 weeks.
A shift of the Cμ curves to less negative voltages is observed, however, for all cells, comparing measurements before and after ageing, which shows that the conduction band edge of ZnO is shifted to lower energies15 during the storage in the dark. To ensure that this difference is not caused by an increase in the total trap density Nt,21 charge densities determined from current transients of the different cells were compared (ESI,† Fig. S5). Very similar charge density values were found for the respective cells before and after storage in the dark, despite quite large variation among different cells, see also Table 2 for relative values of the total trap density Nt/Nt,ref,21 and Fig. S13 (ESI†) for a comparison of Cμ normalized by Nt/Nt,ref for the different cells. The similarity of charge densities before and after storage in the dark leads to the conclusion that the shift in Cμ during this storage can be ascribed solely to a shift of the conduction band edge. Therefore, a shift of the conduction band edge ΔEc/q was determined directly from a comparison of the chemical capacitance before and after storage in the dark. The shift ΔEc/q ranges from 10 to 43 mV for the different cells (see Table 3), without obvious dependence on the sensitizer. Such a shift of the conduction band edge is also a reasonable explanation for the observed increase in the current, since a lower conduction band edge provides a higher driving force for injection2 and, thus, a faster and more efficient injection. In a parallel experiment, unsensitized ZnO films with already desorbed structure-directing agent were stored in water for more than 100 days. Cells were prepared out of these films, otherwise following the same experimental procedures as for the standard films. These cells suffered from very low power-conversion efficiencies due to very low short-circuit current densities even though the dark current density at more negative voltages (= recombination current) was substantially reduced (see IV-curves in the ESI,† Fig. S6 and Table S2). Detailed photoelectrochemical measurements showed that the conduction band edge was shifted by around 300 mV to higher energies (see normalized chemical capacitance in the ESI,† Fig. S7), in contrast to the downward shift observed for the standard cells after storage in the dark. The upward shift of the conduction band edge of the former led to a decrease in JSC, while a downward shift of the latter led to a marked increase in JSC, quite in accordance with the expected behavior due to a corresponding change in injection.2
Table 3 Different contributions to the change in VOC. Calculated voltage differences were determined from Cμ, from the recombination current under illumination and from JSC, and the overall change in VOC was calculated from these contributions.21 The actual change in VOC from IV-curves is compared to this calculated change ΔVOC,calc. The differences are determined for each measurement after 4 weeks relative to the same cell measured directly after cell preparation. Negative values indicate a decrease in the absolute value of VOC. A mean value of β = 0.55 was used for the calculations

Congruous observations were made by Liu et al.31 for TiO2-based DSSCs, where water was added to the electrolyte. Increasing the water content led to an increase in VOC and a decrease in JSC. Even after the water-containing electrolyte was replaced by a dry electrolyte, the effect remained, indicating that widely irreversible adsorption of water molecules to the TiO2-surface occurred. The authors supposed either a shift in the conduction band edge or a decrease in the rate of the back reaction as a possible reason for the observed effects. ZnO-based cells in the present work showed similar changes with an increasing amount of adsorbed water to the TiO2-based cells reported in ref. 31, indicating that both oxidic semiconductors behave similarly. The EIS measurements of water-treated ZnO-based cells in the present work (ESI†) reveal that the main cause for the increase in VOC as a consequence of additional adsorbed water is a shift of the conduction band edge to higher energies. This change effects a decrease in JSC, even enhanced by an increase in the rate of the back reaction, when Rrec is compared at the same density of states (ESI,† Fig. S7b). Even the small amount of water, which probably is desorbed from the surface during the storage time in the dark, effects a small change in the opposite direction.
A downward shift of the conduction band edge as it is observed for all cells during a storage time of four weeks could be caused for example by an adsorption or desorption of ions or polar molecules. In the present case of a decreased energy of the conduction band edge, either positive ions (or dipoles with the positive side facing the ZnO surface) could be adsorbed, or negative ions or oppositely faced dipoles could be desorbed from the ZnO surface. A desorption of OH− from the semiconductor surface or a desorption of H2O originally facing with O to the oxide surface into the electrolyte could for example leads to a downward shift of the conduction band edge. A change in the redox level can most likely be excluded (see discussion in the ESI†), and the observed shift of the capacitance be attributed to the discussed shift of the conduction band edge. If no other changes in the cell occur, ΔEc/q should lead to an equivalent decrease in VOC after eqn (3) for the measurements after 4 weeks. For most cells a decrease in VOC is observed, but mostly this change is smaller than ΔEc/q (see Table 3), and for some cells even a small increase in VOC is seen. This indicates that apart from a change in the conduction band edge also other changes take place in the cells during storage in the dark (eqn (3)). One of the possible changes, the change in recombination behavior is discussed below.
Changes in the recombination resistance and electron lifetime
The recombination resistance Rrec before and after storage of the cells in the dark (determined from EIS measurements at simulated AM1.5 illumination) is compared in Fig. 5. To exclude influences of a shifted Ec on the changes in Rrec (or to compare the recombination of each cell at the same density of states), usually the Rrec curves are shifted by ΔEc/q relative to one reference measurement. In the present case, however, the values of the trap distribution parameter α vary too much for the different cells to allow this overall correction21 (see also Table 2). For a given cell, however, the values of α before and after the storage time were very similar. So each measurement after 4 weeks was corrected by the shift ΔEc/q relative to the measurement directly after preparation in Fig. 5. This allows a comparison of Rrec at the same density of states for each cell before and after ageing of the cells, but not a comparison between different cells. For all cells, an increase in Rrec (plotted against the shifted voltage) during the storage in the dark indicates that recombination is more efficiently blocked in the aged cells. This change is smallest for cell DN91-1 and largest for cell DN285-1. Possible reasons for an increase in Rrec after ageing of the cells are reorganization of dye and coadsorbate molecules on the semiconductor surface during the storage time, desorption of molecules (e.g. H2O) or ions into the electrolyte, a changed surface trap distribution or a combination of such events. For example, aggregated dye molecules, which serve as recombination centers via non-radiative deactivation of the excited state, could be partly desorbed from the surface, thus decreasing recombination.
 Fig. 5  Recombination resistance of dye-sensitized cells sensitized with different indoline dyes plotted against Vf (for measurements directly after preparation) or Vf corrected by the conduction band edge shift (for measurements after 4 week storage in the dark – see also Table 3 for the values of ΔEc/q). Filled symbols indicate measurements performed directly after the preparation of the cells, open symbols of the same color indicate a measurement of the same cell after storage in the dark for 4 weeks. 
For most of the cells, β also decreases after storage in the dark (see Table 2). This decrease is consistent with the observed decrease in the FF during storage in the dark according to the known relationship of the FF and β (see eqn (4)), especially since VOC showed rather small changes during the 4 weeks (compare also values in Table 1). The values of β in this study widely match those found before for electrodeposited ZnO sensitized with indoline dyes.19,20 Considerably higher values of β, however, were observed when the values were determined from measurements of VOCvs. the illumination intensity, see Table 2. These measurements were performed under illumination by a red LED, and the different values of β indicate a different recombination mechanism. An EIS measurement of cell DN91-2 at red LED illumination (see values in parentheses in Table 2) confirmed that the high β values from VOCvs. intensity measurements are not just an artifact due to a different measurement technique but were caused by a lower light intensity. In a separate set of experiments measuring the recombination parameter β in the dark (not shown) a higher value of β was confirmed, as it had also been observed in the literature20 and explained by possible changes in the concentration of triiodide or by changes in the surface or dye conformation under intense illumination.
An increasing ability of the surface to block recombination of the aged cells can also be determined from a comparison of recombination currents in the dark before and after the storage of 4 weeks in Fig. 6, which were plotted against Vf and against Vf − ΔEc/q, respectively. The recombination currents in the dark simply consist of the absolute values of IV-curves measured in the dark, while recombination currents under illumination were calculated by subtracting JSC from IV-curves measured at AM1.5 illumination, thus assuming zero recombination at short circuit.21 The dark recombination currents decreased during storage of the cells in the dark for 4 weeks, indicating that recombination is reduced, as it was also observed for Rrec. This change was smallest for cell DN91-1 and largest for cell DN285-1. As the IV-curves in this potential range are basically defined by Rrec,32 this similarity of the results is conceivable. The recombination current under illumination also decreases upon ageing of the most cells. For recombination currents under illumination at less negative voltages, a different slope is observed compared to recombination currents in the dark, and the recombination currents under illumination are considerably larger than the dark currents. Such enhanced recombination under illumination can be explained if regeneration of the dye is hindered under high-intensity illumination (probably by slow diffusion of I− ions to the oxidized dyes), so an increased concentration of the oxidized dye molecules remains under AM1.5 illumination. These oxidized dye molecules might then act as centers for recombination and thus enhance the recombination current.21 Such additional recombination could also be the cause of the decreased recombination parameter β under high-intensity illumination. Such limitation by inefficient regeneration at high illumination intensities would provide an explanation why JSC of the cells presented in this work lag behind the maximum attainable JSC of about 13 mA cm−233 (600 nm absorbance onset) even though the films absorb light with almost unity light harvesting efficiency.

(a) Dyes D149 and DN216 and (b) dyes DN91 and DN285. Thick lines indicate currents measured at AM1.5 illumination, thin lines indicate measurements in the dark. Full lines indicate measurements directly after cell preparation, while dashed lines indicate measurements after storage in the dark for 4 weeks. 
Recombination under high-intensity illumination was also probed by the determination of the effective electron lifetime τn by EIS measurements under AM1.5 illumination, by IMVS measurements at red LED illumination of varying illumination intensity, and by OCVD measurements at red LED illumination (Fig. 7). An increase in the electron lifetime is observed during the storage in the dark for all illumination conditions, similar to the increase in Rrec shown before. A considerably higher τn is observed when measurements are performed under lower intensity red LED illumination (OCVD, IMVS), compared to measurements under AM1.5 illumination (EIS). The slight deviation of OCVD and IMVS lifetimes for lower absolute voltages would consistently be caused by the difference in the measurement methods, as OCVD was performed at one intensity of the red LED illumination, while the IMVS measurement includes a variation of the red LED illumination. The large difference in τn for high- and low-intensity measurements, however, is not caused by a difference in the measurement method, as also EIS measurements under red LED illumination lead to values of τn comparable to OCVD and IMVS measurements (see additional measurements of cell DN91-2 in the ESI,† Fig. S10). The observation of a strongly decreased τn for high-intensity illumination indicates faster recombination under high-intensity illumination. Comparable to Rrec, τn is influenced by different recombination pathways, recombination via semiconductor surface states or via oxidized dye molecules,27 so that the large difference in τn indicates the presence of a given recombination pathway. The observation that recombination is increased under high-intensity illumination suggests that oxidized dye molecules are involved in this increase in recombination, consistent with the higher recombination currents under illumination than in the dark and with the different β-values found for different illumination conditions.
 Fig. 7  Effective electron lifetimes of DSSCs sensitize with different indoline dyes before and after storage of the cells in the dark for 4 weeks vs. Vf (for measurements directly after preparation) and vs. Vf − ΔEc/q (for measurements after 4 weeks). The lifetime τn was determined from EIS measurements at AM1.5 illumination (larger symbols), from OCVD measurements (smaller symbols) and from IMVS measurements at red LED illumination (lines). Filled symbols and solid lines indicate a measurement of a cell directly after preparation, while open symbols and dashed lines indicate cells measured after 4 weeks storage in the dark. The voltage for the measurements after 4 weeks storage was corrected by the observed shift of Ec (see also Table 3). 
Origins for the observed changes in the open circuit voltage
Based on eqn (3), changes in VOC effected by an increase in JSC (ΔVOC(ΔISC)) and a decrease in the recombination current (ΔVOC(Ilightrec)) can be determined.21 The expected total change in VOC, ΔVOC,calc can be calculated as the sum of these contributions plus the shift of the conduction band edge ΔEc/q.21 A comparison of the measured change in VOC, ΔVOC(IV), with ΔVOC,calc shows whether the measured change can be explained by a combination of the different contributions, see Table 3. It can be seen that contributions from ΔEc/q and from recombination are both comparatively large. However, the downward shift of the conduction band edge and the positive change in VOC due to a decrease in recombination contribute to the overall change of VOC in the opposite direction, thus the effect of these contributions is almost cancelled. The change in VOC due to the change in JSC is smaller and mostly positive, as the increase in JSC indicates more facile injection, and hence leads to more accumulated charge and thus an increase in VOC. The overall change in VOC is explained satisfactorily for almost all cells by this characterization of the different contributions. The expected change in VOC differs from the experiment by only 1–3 mV for most cells (DN91-1, DN91-2, DN216-1, DN216-3 and DN285-2). Such small changes can be attributed to slight differences in the voltage during the measurement of IV-curves, which can even occur for consecutively measured IV-curves. Slightly larger differences in the calculated ΔVOC values from the actual change in VOC are observed for cells D149-1, DN216-2 and DN285-1. For D149-1, this difference could correlate with the observed density of deep monoenergetic trap states (compare Fig. 4).21 The slight underestimation of ΔVOC by the calculation could also be affected by the assumptions of zero recombination at short circuit (assumed for the calculation of (ΔVOC(Ilightrec))), as the comparison of different illumination conditions above suggests a recombination via oxidized dye molecules, and, thus, also possible recombination at short circuit.34,35
Conclusions
Thin films consisting of porous electrodeposited ZnO were sensitized with different indoline dyes, and were further processed to DSSCs. Current–voltage measurements disclosed that the double-anchor indoline dyes DN91, DN216 and DN285 show a similar applicability in their function as sensitizers for ZnO-based DSSCs as the well-established dye D149. The double-anchor dyes provide in addition a higher binding stability when adsorbed to the semiconductor surface, thus offering a substantial advantage not only in technical applications but also in the reliability of fundamental studies.16,17
Upon storage of ZnO-based DSSCs sensitized with an indoline dye and a coadsorbate (storage in the dark for 4 weeks), an increase in the short-circuit current density JSC was observed. From dynamic measurements, this increase in JSC is found to be caused by a shift of the conduction band edge EC to lower energies by around 24 mV, which increases the injection efficiency and thus also JSC. The comparison of Rrec, Jrec and τn before and after storage in the dark showed that the ageing of the cells on the other hand led to a decrease in recombination, possibly due to a change in the surface configuration. A comparison with a cell with a higher water content indicated that this decrease in the position of the conduction band edge results from desorption of water or OH− ions from the ZnO surface during the storage time. An intentional adsorption of water on the surface shifted the conduction band edge of ZnO to higher energies, and increased the recombination rate, probably due to an increase in surface traps. Thus, adsorbed water presumably has still an effect on cell performance of cells based on electrodeposited ZnO, even if the cells are dried before cell preparation.
The downward shift in EC upon storage in the dark is partially compensated by an increase in VF through a faster injection and a decreased recombination. Thus, the downward shift of the conduction band edge does not lead to a decrease in VOC, and for some cells even a small increase in VOC is observed. Comparison of recombination under different illumination conditions, i.e. recombination current in the dark and under simulated AM1.5 illumination, electron lifetime at low-intensity red LED illumination and under high-intensity AM1.5 illumination, showed that the rate of recombination increases at high-intensity illumination. It is reasonably assumed that this increase is caused by additional recombination via oxidized dye molecules, which would be the direct consequence of inefficient regeneration at high-intensity illumination with AM1.5 light.20,21,34–36 Similar conclusions were also drawn by Magne et al. from the comparison of EIS measurements of ZnO-based cells in the dark and under AM1.5 illumination.20
In summary, it was demonstrated that a number of kinetic parameters changed upon storage of the present DSSCs based on indoline-sensitized electrodeposited ZnO, despite the use of quite irreversible binding of the double-anchored sensitizers. The cell properties did not always decay under the combined changes during the storage in the dark for 4 weeks but the power conversion efficiency even slightly increased for some of the cells. It was therefore shown that detailed studies of the long-term changes in electrode kinetics in DSSCs represent a valuable tool to further optimize such cells and possibly develop them towards technical applications.
