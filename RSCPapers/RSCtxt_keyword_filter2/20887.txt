PTB7-based OPV cells incorporating these new fullerene derivatives show increased Voc compared to the corresponding PC60BM-based cells. The best performing derivative in this fullerene family is IC60MA-4C that contains the longest alkyl chain and that yields a power conversion efficiency of 6.5% when combined with PTB7.
The development of high performance organic photovoltaics (OPVs) has attracted a tremendous amount of attention in recent years.1–6 The most popular structure among OPVs is the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) cell, which comprises a bulk-heterojunction active layer constructed by a blend of polymer donor and organic acceptor.7–10 In contrast to the large number of novel polymeric donor materials developed, only limited progress has been achieved in the development of new acceptors. Due to its high electron mobility, C60 was considered as an excellent electron acceptor material for the BHJ cell.7 However, the poor processibility of C60 makes it very difficult to use the unsubstituted C60 during device fabrication. To address such issue, C60 derivatives with improved processibility such as PC60BM have been developed, serving as an electron acceptor for OPV devices.11–13 With their outstanding solubility and electron mobility, PC60BM and PC70BM are still dominating acceptor materials for high performance OPV devices. With PC70BM as the acceptor, an over 9% PCE was achieved from a single junction solar cell and an over 10% PCE was achieved from tandem cells.14,15 On the other side, in order to improve the Voc of OPV devices, fullerene derivatives with high LUMO levels are highly desirable for quite a long time.
To upshift the LUMO level of fullerenes, a series of mono- and multisubstituted fullerene derivatives was developed. Cyclobutadienes were incorporated into C60 and the resulting derivatives showed higher LUMO than C60.16 Silylmethyl[60]fullerene (SIMEF) was synthesized and the OPV device based on SIMEF showed a 0.21 V higher Voc than the PC60BM based device.17 Bis-PCBM, biindene-C60 adducts (BCMA, BCBA), di(4-methylphenyl)-methano-C60 bisadduct (DMPCBA), indene-C60 monoadduct (ICMA) and indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) have been developed with modified electrochemical and physical properties.18 All of the derivatives exhibited good solubility with higher LUMO level than PCBM. In particular, much research progress has been made with ICBA on devices showing high open-circuit voltage (Voc). Compared with the monoadduct, fullerene multiadduct ICBA has better solubility and higher LUMO but poorer electron mobility and thus Jsc. To balance solubility, LUMO level and electron mobility, fullerene monoadduct-ICBM was synthesized.19 The ester group of ICBM enhanced its miscibility with donor materials and excellent performance was obtained for the ICBM based OPV device. However, derivatives such as ICBA and ICBM both have isomeric structures. These isomers with different LUMO levels would increase the electron recombination and affect Jsc negatively as a result.
Herein, we report a new design of the fullerene derivatives, which combine the LUMO up-shifting property from ICBA with the improved processibility via incorporation of the alkyl side chain with an ester group from PCBM. A series of fullerene derivatives (IC60MA-2C, IC60MA-3C and IC60MA-4C) were synthesized and characterized. These IC60MA derivatives are attractive alternative electron acceptors to PC60BM with up-shifted LUMO levels and decent material processibility for device fabrication. Photovoltaic devices were fabricated using PTB7 as a donor material, and PC60BM and IC60MA derivatives as acceptor materials, respectively (structures shown in Scheme 1). Devices with IC60MA-2C, IC60MA-3C and IC60MA-4C showed improved Voc compared with the one using the PC60BM acceptor. The highest Voc of 0.79 V was achieved when IC60MA-3C was employed as the acceptor.

The fullerene derivatives were synthesized via the Diels–Alder reaction between C60 and cyclic diene20 (Scheme 2). In contrast to the preparation of ICBA using a large excess amount of the indene reactant, this method only required up to ∼2 equivalents of bicycle and tetrazine to generate the corresponding products in a decent yield. The mild reaction condition (45 °C) is also considerably easy to handle compared with the temperature used for IC60BM preparation (∼180 °C).

The absorption spectra of active layers are shown in Fig. 1. The absorbance of all the acceptors is quite similar and slight differences came from wavelength before 500 nm.

Cyclic voltammetry was employed to characterize the electrochemical properties of IC60MA-2C, IC60MA-3C and IC60MA-4C. LUMO levels were then obtained from their onset reduction potentials indicated in the cyclic voltammograms (Fig. 2).21Table 1 shows the half-wave potentials (defined as E = 0.5(Ep,c + Ep,a), where Ep,c is the cathodic peak potential and Ep,a is the corresponding anodic peak potential) and the LUMO levels of the reduction processes of PC60BM and the three fullerene derivatives. 0.02 eV upshift LUMO levels were obtained for all the three new IC60MA derivatives compared with PC60BM.

Photovoltaic devices were fabricated based on the ITO/ZnO/PTB7:acceptor/MoO3/Al configuration. The morphology of donor/acceptor blend films was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the height and phase images are shown in Fig. S1.† All the surface topography of the BHJ films based on IC60MA derivatives was very similar to the one based on PC60BM. The surface topography was quite smooth without any excessively large features that could be detrimental to the operation of a polymer solar cell device.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves measured under AM1.5 G illumination are shown in Fig. 3, and the performance of devices using different acceptors is summarized in Table 2. The device based on PC60BM still showed the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.8%, while two IC60MA-based devices also exhibited comparable performance (6.0% and 6.5%).

For the devices based on the IC60MA derivatives, the open circuit voltages (Vocs) are all higher than PC60BM-based devices (Table 2). The results can be attributed to the difference in the LUMO levels of the acceptors (Table 1) and the increase in LUMO levels finally results in the higher Voc. Moreover, devices based on IC60MA-2C and IC60MA-4C also obtained similar Jsc to the PCBM based device.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of solar cell devices are shown in Fig. 4. All the curves showed the highest peak at around 620 nm and then followed by a lower peak at around 690 nm. The EQEs matched quite well with the UV absorptions as well as the current densities for all devices. IC60MA-2C and IC60MA-4C based devices also showed comparable EQEs to the PC60BM based device.

To achieve a high-performing bulk-heterojunction solar cell, good charge-carrier mobility and solubility are also required. The charge-carrier mobilities were calculated from the J–V characteristics using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. Since PTB7 and PC60BM are commercialized molecules, we carried out experiments on the three IC60MA derivatives. The results of charge-carrier mobilities and solubility in chloroform are summarized in Table 3.

Three derivatives exhibit different e-only mobilities. IC60MA-4C has quite a high mobility of 1.41 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and thus a convincing fill factor (61%), while the other two derivatives have lower e-only mobilities and fill factors. In general, there is a negative correlation between solubility and electron mobility. Interestingly, IC60MA-3C, which has the lowest electron mobility among the three derivatives, exhibits the highest solubility (Table 3). The relatively high solubility of IC60MA-3C indicates that the intermolecular interaction is relatively weak for IC60MA-3C molecules compared to other two derivatives, which then results in lower electron mobility for IC60MA-3C.
Conclusions
In summary, three novel C60 derivatives without isomeric structures were designed and synthesized via the Diels–Alder reaction. They all showed upshifted LUMO levels compared with PC60BM. All of the derivatives could be easily dissolved in common solvents and work well with PTB7 during photovoltaic device fabrications. IC60MA-2C and IC60MA-4C based devices showed comparable EQEs, Jscs and PCEs to the PC60BM based device. Moreover, all devices based on IC60MA derivatives possessed higher Voc than that based on PC60BM. This new series of IC60MA derivatives will surely be a new choice in organic photovoltaic devices.
