    , Accepted 14th September 2016First published on 15th September 2016AbstractTernary sulfides of Ni1−xMoxS films with various compositions (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2) were fabricated on a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate by a simple one-step electrochemical deposition method. The electrochemically deposited ternary sulfides were utilized as a low-cost and highly efficient platinum free counter electrode (CE) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The structure, surface morphology and elemental composition of the electrochemically deposited ternary sulfides were examined by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). A phthaloylchitosan (PhCh) based polymer electrolyte was used as an electrolyte for DSSCs. Cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Tafel polarization studies revealed that the Ni0.95Mo0.05S CE exhibited lower charge-transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface and higher electrocatalytic activity towards the regeneration of I− from I3− relative to other compositions. The Ni0.95Mo0.05S ternary sulfide offers a positive synergistic effect for the electrochemical catalytic activity towards the reduction of I3−, which may be due to an increase in active catalytic sites and low-charge transfer resistance and achieved a high power conversion efficiency of 7.15% with a Voc of 0.65 V, a Jsc of 17.21 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.64 with a PhCh-based polymer electrolyte, which is comparable to that of the conventional Pt CE (7.20%). The present investigation demonstrates that the electrochemically deposited Ni0.95Mo0.05S ternary sulfide is a promising candidate as a low-cost and highly efficient CE in DSSCs.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted significant attention for solar energy to electrical energy conversion because of their low-cost, simple fabrication process, good plasticity, transparency, ease of large scale production, environmental friendliness and high power conversion efficiency.1–3 Typical DSSCs consist of a dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode, an I−/I3− redox electrolyte and a counter electrode (CE). The CE is one of the indispensable components in DSSCs, which collects electrons from an external circuit and catalyses the reduction of triiodide (I3−) to iodide (I−) in the redox electrolyte. Generally, platinum (Pt) is the most widely employed CE in DSSCs due to its remarkable electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of I3− to I− ions. However, Pt is a noble metal and very expensive and it can easily undergo dissolution to PtI4 or H2PtI6 in the liquid I−/I3− redox electrolyte, which strongly hinders the commercialization of large scale production of DSSCs. This issue has prompted many researchers to develop new Pt-free CE materials with low-cost and high electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction.
Nowadays, many other functional materials have been employed to replace noble Pt CEs in DSSCs, such as carbon materials,4,5 metal selenides,6,7 metal sulfides,8–10 conducting polymers11,12 and metal carbides and nitrides.13,14 Among various transition metal compounds, metal sulfides have drawn immense attention due to their good electrocatalytic activity, high conductivity, good stability, non-toxicity and high abundance.15 Many researchers have studied NiS based Pt free CEs for DSSCs in recent years.16–18 A variety of nickel sulfide phases, such as NiS, NiS2, Ni3S2, Ni3N4 and Ni9S8, have been formed depending on the synthetic conditions.19 Hydrothermal and electrochemical deposition methods are most widely used to synthesize these nickel sulfide phases. Nevertheless, a relatively low conductivity of pure nickel sulfide still limits its practical applications due to the grain boundaries and defects between the nickel sulfide particles.20,21 To resolve this problem and improve its conductivity and electrocatalytic activity, several strategies have been adopted such as coupling with other electrocatalytic materials10,17 and introducing some other materials into nickel sulfide phases.18,20 Liu et al.10 synthesized NiCo2S4 by using a facile solvothermal route and used it as a CE for DSSCs. The fabricated DSSC with the NiCo2S4 CE achieved a high power conversion efficiency of 6.14%, which is comparable to that of the conventional Pt CE (6.29%). Zheng et al.22 developed CoMoS4 and NiMoS4 by a facile solution reaction method and they displayed good electrocatalytic activity towards the regeneration of I− from I3−. The power conversion efficiencies of DSSCs with CoMoS4 and NiMoS4 CEs were 4.95% and 5.27%, respectively. Further, the efficiencies were improved to 7.31% and 7.14%, respectively by introducing graphite into CoMoS4 and NiMoS4, which were comparable with the efficiency of the Pt CE (7.46%). Chuang et al.23 fabricated a coral-like film of Ni@NiS on a conducting glass substrate by an electrochemical method in a two step process. The DSSC with the coral-like Ni@NiS CE showed a higher power conversion efficiency of 7.84%, while the DSSC fabricated with the Pt CE achieved an efficiency of 8.11%. Banerjee et al.24 synthesized nickel cobalt sulfide directly on a FTO glass substrate by sulphurization of nickel cobalt oxide, and subsequently utilized it as a CE for DSSCs. The DSSC with nickel cobalt sulfide showed an excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the I−/I3− redox reaction, and achieved a power conversion efficiency of 6.9%, which is comparable with that of the Pt CE (7.07%).
In the present investigation, we have developed ternary sulfides of Ni1−xMoxS with various compositions (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2) on FTO glass substrates by a simple electrochemical deposition method using the cyclic voltammetry technique. The electrochemical deposition method was chosen in this work because of its simple procedure, easy scale up possibility and large deposition area. The effect on electrocatalytic activity and power conversion efficiency of DSSCs by the addition of Mo into NiS as ternary sulfides was also investigated. In this work, a phthaloylchitosan (PhCh) based polymer electrolyte was used as an electrolyte for DSSCs. Although a higher power conversion efficiency for the DSSCs has been achieved while employing liquid electrolytes (I−/I3− redox couple) in DSSCs, they have several disadvantages such as short term stability due to organic solvent evaporation and leakage, difficulty in sealing the device, electrode corrosion, etc., which limits the commercialization of DSSCs. The usage of a polymer electrolyte can overcome these problems.1 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the synthesis of newer stoichiometric compositions of ternary metal sulfides by a simple one-step electrochemical route and investigating the positive synergistic effect of various compositions of Ni1−xMoxS towards the electrochemical catalytic reduction of I3− in DSSCs fabricated with a polymer electrolyte.
Experimental section
Materials
Nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O), sodium molybdate dihydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O), thiourea (CH2CSHCH2), nitric acid (HNO3), iodine chips (I2), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), acetonitrile, 2-propanol and absolute ethanol were purchased from SDFCL, India. Chitosan and phthalic anhydride were purchased from Merck-Germany. Carbowax was purchased from Supelco, USA. Polyvinylidine difluoride (PVDF), ethylene carbonate (EC), lithium perchlorate (LiClO4), lithium iodide (LiI), tetrapropylammoniumiodide (TPAI), N3 dye [cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid) ruthenium(II)] and fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) (7 Ω per square, TCO22-7) conducting glass were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. TiO2 nanoparticles (P25 and P90) were provided by Degussa, Germany. Demineralised water was obtained from Nice chemicals, India. All reagents were used without further purification.
Electrochemical deposition of Ni1−xMoxS films
Prior to the electrochemical deposition, the FTO glass substrate was washed using a mild detergent solution followed by deionized water, acetone and finally with isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min. The cyclic voltammetry technique was used for the electrochemical deposition process. The Ni1−xMoxS (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2) ternary sulfide films were electrochemically deposited on the FTO glass substrate using an electrochemical workstation (CHI608E, CH Instrument, USA) with a three electrode configuration system. The electrode comprises a precleaned FTO glass substrate as a working electrode, Pt wire as a counter electrode and saturated aqueous Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode. The electrochemical deposition solution was prepared by dissolving 0.78 g of NiCl2·6H2O/Na2MoO4·2H2O and 3.80 g of H2HCSNH2 in 50 mL of deionized water and stirred well for 15 min. The potential range of electrochemical deposition of Ni1−xMoxS ternary sulfide films was from −0.9 to 0.7 V at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 for 25 sweep cycles. Finally, the electrochemically deposited NiS, Ni0.95Mo0.05S, Ni0.9Mo0.1S, and Ni0.8Mo0.2S sulfide films were washed with deionized water and dried at room temperature for 2 h. Also, we tried to obtain a pure MoS film under the same experimental conditions and precursors for comparison studies, but there was no coating of MoS on the FTO glass substrate.
The electrochemical deposition process of pure NiS has been described in an earlier report by Hou et al.15 During hydrolyzation, thiourea (TU) is easily oxidized to form formamidine disulfide, which subsequently reacts with the metal ions (Ni2+) to form the corresponding metal sulfides (NiS). This process is explained as follows: (reactions (1)–(3)). (1) (2) (3)
Electrodeposition of ternary sulfide, viz., Ni1−xMoxS, is similar to that of pure NiS. Instead of a specific metal ion, metal ion precursors, namely, Ni2+ and Mo6+, were taken in stoichiometric ratio in the electrolyte solution and deposition was performed. (4)
A similar mechanism has also been proposed by Tran et al.25 for the CoIIWIVSx ternary sulfide system.
Preparation of the polymer electrolyte
An optimized phthaloylchitosan (PhCh) based polymer electrolyte was used in this investigation. The composition of the polymer electrolyte contains 1.3 wt% PEO, 5 wt% phthaloylchitosan, 31.5 wt% DMF, 37.8 wt% ethylene carbonate, 22.7 wt% tetrapropylammonium iodide and 1.7 wt% iodine. In brief, a mixture of 1.3 wt% PEO, 5 wt% phthaloylchitosan, 31.5 wt% DMF, 37.8 wt% ethylene carbonate and 22.7 wt% of tetrapropylammonium iodide was taken in a closed glass container. The contents were stirred well at 353 K for about 2 h until a homogeneous viscous gel was formed. Then, the solution was allowed to cool down to room temperature. Iodine (1.7 wt%) was then added to the polymer electrolyte and stirred well until it becomes a homogeneous viscous solution.
Fabrication of DSSCs
A TiO2 photoanode was prepared as described in our previous reports.26,27 In brief, a pre-cleaned FTO conducting glass was used as a substrate for the photoelectrode and a two layer TiO2 coating onto the FTO glass substrate was performed. To obtain a first compact layer, 0.5 g of TiO2 (P90) powder was ground well with 2 mL of 0.1 M HNO3 for about 30 min in an agate mortar and pestle. The resulting TiO2 (P90) paste was spin coated at 2650 rpm for 60 s on the conducting side of the FTO glass substrate followed by sintering at 450 °C for 30 min. To obtain a second porous layer of TiO2, 0.5 g of TiO2 (P25) was ground well with 2 mL of 0.1 M HNO3, 0.1 g carbowax and 2 drops of Triton-X 100. Then, the obtained TiO2 (P25) paste was coated above the compact layer using a doctor blade technique followed by sintering at 450 °C for 30 min. The TiO2 photoelectrode was dye-sensitized by immersing in 3 mM ethanolic solution of N3 dye for 24 h. The sandwich configuration of DSSCs was assembled using the dye-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode and the as-prepared CEs. Prior to the assembly, the polymer electrolyte described earlier was evenly spread on the surface of the dye-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode. In addition, the Pt CE was prepared by drop casting plastisol solution on the FTO glass substrate and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. The Pt CE was used as a reference cell for comparison. The active area of the DSSC was 0.2 cm2.
Characterization techniques
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer (Mini Flex II, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) in the 2θ range of 20–80° at a scan rate of 5° min−1. The shape and morphology of the electrochemically deposited samples were examined by high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM) with an FEI Quanta FEG 200 system at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. The elemental composition analysis was performed by using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) equipped with HRSEM. The electrocatalytic performance of the samples was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. The CV was carried out using a CHI608E electrochemical workstation (CHI, USA) in a three-electrode system with a Pt-wire as the counter electrode, non-aqueous Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode and electrochemically deposited ternary Ni1−xMoxS films as a working electrode. The electrolyte used in CV measurements consisted of 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI and 1 mM I2 in acetonitrile. The electrolyte solution was N2-purged for 15 min before taking the CV measurements. The CV curves were recorded in the potential ranging from −0.6 to +1.2 V. The symmetrical cells (CE/polymer electrolyte/CE) were fabricated to perform the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel analysis. The EIS was carried out using an AC-impedance technique in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1.0 MHz at an AC amplitude of 5 mV. The Tafel curves were recorded in the potential range of −0.15 V to 0.15 V and the scan rate was 10 mV s−1.
The photovoltaic performances of DSSCs were evaluated by recording photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves under a white light irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5) using a solar simulator PEC-L01 (PECCELL Inc., Japan). The fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (η) of DSSCs were calculated according to the following eqn (5) and (6).28 (5) (6)Where Vmax (mV) and Jmax (mA cm−2) are the voltage and current density, respectively, at the point of maximum power output on the J–V curve, Pin is the incident light power, and Voc and Jsc are the open circuit voltage (mV) and the short circuit current density (mA cm−2), respectively.
Results and discussion
XRD studies
The XRD patterns of the pristine FTO glass substrate and the electrochemically deposited NiS, Ni0.95Mo0.05S, Ni0.9Mo0.1S and Ni0.8Mo0.2S films are displayed in Fig. 1. The diffraction peaks of pure NiS (Fig. 1b) can be observed at 2θ = 30.3°, 45.8°, and 53.7°, which can be indexed to (100), (102) and (110) diffraction planes of the hexagonal phase of NiS (JCPDS no. 75-0613). These diffraction peaks are in good agreement with an earlier report by Xiao et al.29 All other strong diffraction peaks correspond to the pristine FTO glass substrate. The XRD patterns of Ni0.95Mo0.05S, Ni0.9Mo0.1S and Ni0.8Mo0.2S (Fig. 1c–e) indicate that the XRD pattern of NiS is not changed due to the incorporation of Mo with no specific diffraction peaks of Mo in the Ni1−xMoxS samples, possibly due to the low amount of Mo present in the Ni1−xMoxS. However, small changes in the peak intensity of NiS were observed which may be due to Mo atoms incorporated at the interstitial positions or substitutional sites producing considerable contraction and expansion of the lattice constants.

Morphology and elemental studies
The surface morphology of the electrochemically deposited NiS, Ni0.95Mo0.05S, Ni0.9Mo0.1S and Ni0.8Mo0.2S films was examined by HR-SEM, and the corresponding images are presented in Fig. 2. The HR-SEM image of pure NiS (Fig. 2a) appeared spherical in shape with some aggregated particles containing a large number of irregular particles. The HR-SEM image of Ni0.95Mo0.05S, Ni0.9Mo0.1S and Ni0.8Mo0.2S films (Fig. 5b–d) clearly shows that the spherical shaped NiS does not change its morphology by the addition of Mo. It can be seen that the Ni0.95Mo0.05S (Fig. 5b) is tightly packed nanocrystals. The well connected surface morphology with tightly packed nanocrystals promotes the effective electron transport from their surface to the redox electrolyte in DSSCs.30 The Ni0.9Mo0.1S and Ni0.8Mo0.2S show more agglomeration of particles by increasing the content of Mo. Also, the HR-SEM studies confirmed that the electrochemically deposited NiS, Ni0.95Mo0.05S, Ni0.9Mo0.1S and Ni0.8Mo0.2S layers adhered well on the FTO glass substrate. The good adhesion of the electrochemically deposited CE materials on the FTO substrate is a crucial factor for determining the long-term stability and efficiency of the fabricated DSSCs.

The elemental composition of the electrochemically deposited pure NiS and optimized Ni0.95Mo0.05S CE films was ascertained by EDS analysis and the corresponding EDS spectra are shown in Fig. 3. The EDS spectra clearly indicate that pure NiS (Fig. 2a) consisted of Ni and S atoms, whereas Ni0.95Mo0.05S (Fig. 2b) is composed of Ni, Mo and S atoms only. In addition, the observed other peaks of Sn, O, Si and F are ascribed to the FTO glass substrate,31 and no other impurity peaks are found. The atomic ratio of elemental percentage of species detected by EDS is mentioned in the inset of Fig. 3. The formation of Ni0.95Mo0.05S composition on the surface of the FTO glass substrate was confirmed from the EDS analysis.

Electrocatalytic activity
The electrochemical activity of NiS, Ni0.95Mo0.05S, Ni0.9Mo0.1S, Ni0.8Mo0.2S and Pt CEs towards the reduction of I3− to I− ions was examined by cyclic voltammetry using a three electrode system at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The cyclic voltammograms of different electrode materials for the I−/I3− redox species are presented in Fig. 4. Two pairs of redox peaks (Ox-1/Red-1, Ox-2/Red-2) can be observed for all the electrodes. The pair of redox peaks observed at the left side (low potential) can be attributed to the redox reaction shown in reaction (7), and the pair of redox peaks observed at the right side (high potential) can be attributed to the redox reaction shown in reaction (8).32 I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−(7) 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−(8)

The CV curves of NiS, Ni0.95Mo0.05S, Ni0.9Mo0.1S, and Ni0.8Mo0.2S were similar in shapes to that of Pt, suggesting a similar electrocatalytic behaviour for the I−/I3− redox reaction. The characteristics of peaks Ox-1 and Red-1 are at the focus of our analysis because the CE is responsible for catalyzing the reduction of I3− to I− ions in DSSCs.33 The peak current density (IPC) and the peak-to-peak separation (EPP) are two important parameters for evaluating the electrocatalytic activity of various CEs.18 A higher IPC means a faster reaction rate whereas a smaller EPP means a smaller over-potential and high electrocatalytic activity for the I−/I3− redox reaction.21 Hence, a higher IPC and a smaller EPP are beneficial for a CE to achieve high electrocatalytic performance. The observed EPP values for different CEs are presented in Table 1. It can be noted that the Ni0.95Mo0.05S CE exhibited a higher IPC and a smaller EPP (0.48 V) relative to other CEs. Also, the obtained IPC and EPP values are closer to the values of Pt CEs. According to Gong et al.,34 the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst may also depend on the stoichiometric ratio and total active surface area, changing the stoichiometric ratio may improve the catalytic activity. We have also evaluated the electrocatalytic activity of different CE materials with the same total active surface area for the reduction of I3− into I− ions. The observed CV results demonstrate that the Ni0.95Mo0.05S CE possesses a stronger catalytic behaviour compared to other CEs towards I3− reduction in DSSCs. This may be due to a higher synergistic effect offered by the Ni0.95Mo0.05S, and the increase in active catalytic sites. However, it can be noted that the electrocatalytic activity decreases on increasing the Mo content to 10% and 20% and this may be due to coverage of excess Mo on the NiS surface which may shield efficient electron transport.

The cyclic voltammograms of the Ni0.95Mo0.05S CE at various scan rates for the I−/I3− redox reaction are presented in Fig. 5a. It can be seen that the IPC increases with an increase in scan rate. Also, the cathodic and anodic peaks are gradually and regularly shifted towards negative and positive directions, respectively which suggests that sulfides at the inner sites become reactive at a high scan rate.8Fig. 5b shows a linear relationship between the peak current density and the square root of the scan rates. According to the Langmuir isotherm principle, this linear relationship reveals that the transport of I− species on the surface of the CE is affected by the diffusion limitation of the redox reaction,35 and there is no specific interaction between the I−/I3− redox species and Ni0.95Mo0.05S CE. The observed CV results indicate that the Ni0.95Mo0.05S CE can be a promising CE in DSSCs.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out in symmetrical dummy cells fabricated with two identical CEs to further understand the charge-transfer process and evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the synthesized CEs. The corresponding Nyquist plots of the symmetrical dummy cells are shown in Fig. 6. The Nyquist plots were fitted with the Z-view software and the relevant equivalent circuit model is shown in the inset of Fig. 6. The intersection of the high frequency intercept on the real axis (Z′-axis) corresponds to the series resistance (Rs), including the sheet resistance of two identical CEs and the electrolyte resistance. The high frequency region of the first semicircle corresponds to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and constant phase element (CPE) at the CE/electrolyte interface,36 in which the Rct represents the electrocatalytic performance of CEs. The semicircle at low frequency corresponds to the Nernst diffusion impedance (Zw) of the I−/I3− redox couple in the electrolyte.37 The obtained Rs and Rct values are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that the Rs values of the sulfide electrodes are almost similar but slightly higher than that of the Pt CE, and therefore the effect of Rs on the photovoltaic performance can be omitted.38 The Rct is mainly related to the electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of I3− to I− ions, and a lower Rct value means the superior electrocatalytic activity of CEs, which is beneficial for an increase in the FF of the DSSCs. The Rct value of the Ni0.95Mo0.05S CE (57.49 Ω cm2) is lower than that of other sulfide CEs and very close to that of the conventional Pt CE (53.38 Ω cm2). This indicates that the Ni0.95Mo0.05S is as effective as a Pt CE for electrocatalytic reduction of I3−. The observed lower Rct of Ni0.95Mo0.05S may be due to the positive synergistic effect by the introduction of Mo into the NiS, which can increase the conductivity and accelerate the regeneration of I− from I3−. It can be seen that the EIS results are in good accordance with the results obtained from CV measurements.

Tafel polarization studies
Tafel polarization measurements were performed with the symmetrical dummy cell similar to the one used in EIS to further elucidate the electrocatalytic activity of the various CEs. The corresponding Tafel polarization curves are shown in Fig. 7. In Tafel analysis, the exchange current density (Jo) and limiting current density (Jlim) are closely related to the electrocatalytic activity of the CEs.18,35 The Jo can be determined from the intercept of the linear fitting lines from the cathodic and anodic polarization curves.39 The anodic and cathodic branches of the Tafel curve for the Ni0.95Mo0.05S CE showed a larger slope than other sulfide CEs and closer to the Pt CE, indicating the higher Jo value for the Ni0.95Mo0.05S CE, and thus suggesting its superior electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of I3− ions. The Jo is inversely proportional to the Rct as expressed in eqn (9). Jo = RT/nFRct(9)where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of electrons involved in the I3− reduction reaction and Rct is the charge transfer resistance obtained from the EIS spectrum. From the graph, it is noteworthy that the trends in Jo values for the various CEs in the Tafel measurements are in good agreement with the EIS measurements. In addition, the information about Jlim can also be obtained with Tafel curves. The Jlim is related to the diffusion characteristics of the redox couple. The highest Jlim demonstrates the faster diffusion rate of the I3− reduction in the electrolyte. The trends of Jlim would be consistent with the Jo for all CEs. It can be concluded from the CV, EIS and Tafel polarization measurements that the Ni0.95Mo0.05S CE possesses a similar electrocatalytic activity to Pt CE for regeneration of I− from I3−, and the above investigation demonstrates that the Ni0.95Mo0.05S CE can be expected to show a reasonable power conversion efficiency of the DSSCs.

Photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs
The photovoltaic performances of the fabricated DSSCs based on various CEs were analysed under white light illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5) by recording the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves. The J–V curves obtained for the fabricated DSSCs with NiS, Ni0.95Mo0.05S, Ni0.9Mo0.1S, Ni0.8Mo0.2S and Pt CEs are shown in Fig. 8. The resultant photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs such as open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and the overall power conversion efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 2. The photovoltaic parameters of the DSSC fabricated with the pure NiS CE were found to show a Voc of 0.68 V, Jsc of 12.71 mA cm−2, FF of 0.69 and η of 5.96%. It could be noticed that the addition of Mo into the NiS CE led to a significant enhancement in the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs. The DSSC based on the Ni0.95Mo0.05S CE exhibited a higher power conversion efficiency of 7.15% with Voc of 0.65 V, Jsc of 17.21 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.64, which is comparable to that of the Pt based reference cell (7.20%). The enhanced power conversion efficiency of the Ni0.95Mo0.05S CE is mainly attributed to the improved Jsc and FF, which could arise from the positive synergistic effect towards the efficient reduction of I3− to I− ions, highly active catalytic sites and lower Rct at the CE/electrolyte interface. The well touched surface morphology of the Ni0.95Mo0.05S CE may also increase the electrocatalytic regeneration of I− from I3−, which is beneficial for an efficient electron transport mechanism. The optimized Ni0.95Mo0.05S and conventional Pt CE based DSSCs with the PhCh-based polymer electrolyte were subjected to a stability test. It was found that the fabricated DSSC with the Ni0.95Mo0.05S CE and the PhCh-based polymer electrolyte exhibited about 84% of its initial performance over 5 days, whereas the conventional Pt CE based DSSC exhibited about 91% of its initial performance over 5 days. This clearly indicates that the Ni0.95Mo0.05S has a comparable stability to Pt. Hence, the Ni0.95Mo0.05S CE can be a promising low-cost material with high efficiency for DSSCs.

The schematic illustration of the electron transfer mechanism taking place in the fabricated DSSC using the Ni0.95Mo0.05S CE is shown in Fig. 9. When the cell is illuminated, the N3 dye is photoexcited and its electrons are transferred into the conduction band of the TO2 photoelectrode. Subsequently, the photoexcited N3 dye molecules regenerate its electrons from the redox mediator of the electrolyte and the I− ions of the redox mediator are oxidized into I3− ions (eqn (10)). Then, the oxidized I3− ions get reduced to I− ions at the Ni0.95Mo0.05S CE (eqn (11)). 3I− + 2D+ → I3− + 2D (regeneration of N3 dye)(10) I3− + 2e− → 3I− (regeneration of iodide ions)(11)

Thus, the cycle is completed by the continuous flow of electrons from the TO2 photoelectrode into the Ni0.95Mo0.05S CE through an external circuit.
Conclusions
In summary, ternary sulfides of Ni1−xMoxS films with various compositions (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2) were electrochemically deposited on a FTO conducting glass substrate by using the cyclic voltammetry technique. HR-SEM studies revealed the shape and surface morphology of the samples. The elemental composition of the electrochemically deposited ternary sulfides was ascertained by EDS studies. Subsequently, the electrochemically deposited ternary sulfide films were utilized as a Pt-free low-cost CE for DSSCs. The CV, EIS and Tafel measurements revealed that the Ni0.95Mo0.05S film exhibited low-charge transfer resistance and superior electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of I3− to I− ions compared to other CEs. The Ni0.95Mo0.05S offered a more synergistic effect for the reduction of I3−, which may be due to highly active catalytic sites and fast reaction kinetics for the I−/I3− redox reaction. The DSSC fabricated with the Ni0.95Mo0.05S CE achieved a high power conversion efficiency of 7.15%, which is comparable to that of the traditional Pt CE (7.20%). These results demonstrate that the Ni0.95Mo0.05S CE could be one of the promising highly efficient and low-cost CEs for DSSCs.
