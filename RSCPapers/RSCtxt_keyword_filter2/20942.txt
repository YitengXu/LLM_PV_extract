    , Accepted 8th July 2020First published on 8th July 2020AbstractIn polymer solar cells (PSCs), electrolytes as the cathode interlayer are responsible for generating an interface dipole, which reduces the charge collection barrier at the cathode interface. In this study, small-molecule electrolytes were designed and synthesized as the cathode interlayer in inverted PSCs to overcome high processing costs caused by complicated synthesis procedures. Moreover, the proposed design strategy allows changing the ion size and number of ionic functionalities to tune the magnitude of the interface dipole. The structure of ((benzene-1,2,4,5-tetrayltetrakis(methylene))tetrakis(triphenylphosphonium) bromide) (4PBr) comprises a phenyl core with four benzyl triphenylphosphonium salts and (N,N′-(1,2-phenylenebis(methylene))bis(N,N-diethylethanaminium) bromide) (2EBr) has two benzyl trialkyl ammonium salts. The device based on 4PBr exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 10.63% (Jsc = 20.2 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.79 V, and FF = 66.6%), which is superior to that based on 2EBr (PCE = 9.56%, Jsc = 19.7 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.80 V, and FF = 61.1%). Thus, we demonstrated the possibility of maximizing performances without complicated synthesis procedures.
Introduction
Over the last decade, there have been several approaches for developing highly efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs) due to their processability, flexibility, and low-cost fabrication for large-area applications.1–4 Outstanding improvements with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of up to 16%5 have been achieved by developing efficient photoactive materials6–16 and interface engineering the electrode.17–37 Among the existing issues, tuning the energy offset at the cathode interface is an important issue that should be addressed to enhance the electron collection ability.
ZnO has been commonly used as the electron transport layer in inverted PSCs. To maximize its electron collection ability, there have been several approaches to change its layer properties, such as inserting conjugated/non-conjugated polymer electrolytes17–30 as the interlayer and self-assembled monolayer31–34 treatments. Thus, better PCEs were achieved by reducing the energy offset at the cathode interface and enhancing the charge collection capability.
Conjugated polymer electrolytes (CPEs) have been widely used as the cathode interlayer. However, CPEs have complicated synthetic procedures and extremely low product yield, thereby limiting their commercial large-area application. In terms of processing cost, the development of small-molecule organic electrolytes38–45 with simple synthetic procedures can attract attention in large-area applications. Recently, we reported the effect of the size of the counter anion36 and cation46 of organic electrolytes on the photovoltaic properties. The results suggested that a larger counter ion leads to a larger interface dipole, indicating its influence on the energy offset at the cathode interface. Lee et al. and Jo et al. also reported that the number of ionic functionalities on electrolytes affect the performance of PSCs.47–49 This suggests that the magnitude of the interface dipole depends on the number of ionic functionalities. Moreover, the increase in the size of ions and number of ionic functionalities has been observed to efficiently reduce the charge collection barrier at the interface, thereby improving device performances.
With these in mind, we have designed and synthesized (N,N′-(1,2-phenylenebis(methylene))bis(N,N-diethylethanaminium)bromide) (2EBr) and ((benzene-1,2,4,5-tetrayltetrakis(methylene))tetrakis(triphenylphosphonium)bromide) (4PBr) (shown in Fig. 1a). Both 2EBr and 4PBr have the advantage of allowing mass production without a complex synthetic procedure and low product yield. The dipole moment of the ionic compound is proportional to the distance between two charges. Therefore, the dipole moment of triphenyl phosphonium salt would be larger than that of triethyl ammonium salt. In addition to this, 4PBr is expected to have a higher dipole moment than 2EBr due to the number of ionic functionalities. The device based on a bulk-heterojunction structure (Fig. 1b) composed of poly([2,6′-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b;3,3-b]dithiophene]{3-fluoro-2[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl}) (PTB7-Th) and [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) (Fig. 1c) as the active layer enhances the PCE based on ZnO from 8.75% (short circuit current Jsc = 17.5 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage Voc = 0.80 V, and fill factor FF = 62.5%) to 10.63% (Jsc = 20.2 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.79 V, and FF = 66.6%), by introducing 4PBr as the interlayer. Moreover, the device based on 4PBr has a more superior PCE than that based on 2EBr (PCE = 9.56%, Jsc = 19.7 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.80 V, and FF = 61.1%). This could be mainly attributed to the improved Jsc by the reduced Schottky barrier at the cathode interface.

Results and discussion

2EBr and 4PBr were synthesized by a simple substitution reaction between 1,2-bis(bromomethyl)benzene and triethylamine in toluene and acetonitrile, respectively. All compounds were well characterized by the 1H, 13C NMR, and elemental analysis, which are provided in the ESI.†
We fabricated inverted type PSCs (illustrated in Fig. 1b) based on ZnO with and without small-molecule electrolytes as the electron transporting layer and investigated the effect of ionic functionalities on the photovoltaic properties. Detailed procedures of the fabrication of PSCs are described in the ESI† and the photovoltaic parameters with different thickness of the cathode interlayer are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The optimum thickness of the interlayer was determined to be 5–6 nm. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), small-molecule electrolytes do not tend to aggregate on the surface of ZnO. The surface roughness of the ZnO surface with 2EBr and 4PBr was 0.58 and 0.60 nm, respectively, which are comparable to the surface roughness of the ZnO surface (0.55 nm). Fig. 2a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PSCs with and without the interlayer under illumination while the photovoltaic performances are summarized in Table 1. Significant enhancements are observed in devices based on ZnO with an interlayer. The PCEs of devices with 2EBr and 4PBr are 9.56% (Jsc = 19.7 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.80 V, and FF = 61.1%) and 10.63% (Jsc = 20.2 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.79 V, and FF = 66.6%), while for that based on ZnO without the interlayer was limited to 8.75% (Jsc = 17.5 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.80 V, and FF = 62.5%). Notably, the enhanced Jsc was the main contributor to the improved PCE.

Kelvin probe microscopy (KPM) is a common powerful tool for determining the effective work function of a metal or metal oxide. Thus, KPM measurements were conducted to investigate how the interlayer affects the changes of Jsc.21–23,26,27,36,37,42–46,48
A larger Schottky barrier at the interface interrupts the charge collection capability.
Thus, the transition from a Schottky to ohmic contact at the interface is a crucial factor to achieve high Jsc. As shown in Fig. 2b, the work function of ZnO with 2EBr and 4PBr is −4.29 and −4.18 eV, respectively, while that of ZnO was −4.4 eV. The change in magnitude of the interface dipole depended on changing the size of the cation and number of ionic functionalities. Reducing the Schottky barrier height results in a high Jsc, which is strongly related to the change of work function. Herein, the improved Jsc indicates the formation of a favorable interface dipole with its magnitude depending on the ion size and number of ionic functionalities. The calculated Jsc data from IPCE curves (Fig. 2c) showed an extremely good correlation with the Jsc data of devices under a simulated illumination of 1.0 sun. The series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) were calculated from the inverse slope near the high current regime and the slope near the lower current region in the dark J–V curves. The Rs data also showed its coherence with the Jsc of PSCs. The Rsh data of the device based on pure ZnO, and ZnO with 2EBr, and 4PBr were 893, 645, and 2553 kΩ cm2, respectively, which are well correlated with their FF. Interestingly, the Rsh of the device based on 2EBr was smaller than that without the interlayer.
To elucidate the effect of the interlayer on the electron transporting/collecting properties of ZnO, we fabricated and tested the electron devices with a structure of ITO/ZnO (25 nm)/with or without the interlayer (60 nm)/PC71BM/Al (100 nm) (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 shows the space-charge limited current (SCLC) characteristics of the current density and voltage. The electron mobilities of the devices were calculated by the SCLC method expressed by the Mott–Gurney law. The electron mobilities of the devices based on 2EBr and 4PBr were 9.2 × 10−4 and 1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are comparable to the device based on ZnO without the interlayer (7.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). However, the turn-on voltages of the devices with 2EBr and 4PBr, which was estimated according to Parker,49 were 1.26 and 0.94 V, respectively, while of that based on ZnO without the interlayer was limited to 1.65 V. Thus, the interlayer facilitates the electron collection capability from the PC71BM layer to the ZnO layer, owing to the introduced interlayer that reduced the Schottky barrier between them. Moreover, 4PBr has easier electron collection ability than 2EBr. These results are well coherent with the improvement of Jsc.

To understand the charge transport and collection properties of the devices, we analyzed the photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of the effective voltage (Veff) by:Jph = JL − JDVeff = V0 − Vawhere JL is the measured current density under illumination, JD is the measured current density without illumination, V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0, and Va is the applied voltage.
As shown in Fig. 4, the log(Jph) as a function of log(Veff) showed a linear relationship at low Veff and saturated at the high Veff regime. The Veff value of the devices reaching the saturated photocurrent (Vsat) increased in the following order: 4PBr (0.17 V) < 2EBr (0.31 V) ≅ ZnO (0.34 V). Hence, a smaller Vsat denotes faster transition from the space-charge-limited to the saturation regime. The results followed the trend of the Jsc and PCE of the devices.

We examined the Jsc and Voc of the devices as a function of illumination intensity50–52 to understand the charge recombination kinetics at the interfaces. The relationship between Jsc and illumination intensity I is generally defined by Jsc ∝ Iα. When the device exhibits a completely bimolecular recombination under short-circuit conditions, α is unity. As shown in Fig. 5a, the α of the devices based on ZnO with 2EBr and 4PBr is 0.97 for both, which is comparable to that based on ZnO (0.93). This indicates that the devices exhibited the suppression of undesirable bimolecular recombination. Voc is defined byVoc ∝ skT/q·ln(I)where k, T, q, and I are the Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, electron charge, and illumination intensity, respectively. When bimolecular recombination is dominant, s is approximately equal to 1 and reaches 2 in the case of dominant trap-assisted recombination. The s values of the device based on pure ZnO, 2EBr, and 4PBr were 1.78, 1.71, and 1.29, respectively. Therefore, the lowest trap-assisted recombination behavior of the device based on 4PBr can justify its highest Jsc and FF values. Overall, most device parameters related to the charge extraction and recombination characteristics of the devices are continuously improved by introducing the interlayer. In addition, the change in the s values of the devices agrees well with the PCE trend of PSCs.

To further observe the carrier recombination and transport mechanism, we examined the electrical impedance spectra (EIS) of the PSCs under dark conditions. EIS measurements were performed at 0 V with a frequency range of 1–1.0 MHz.

Fig. 6a shows the Nyquist plots of the devices at 0.8 V. The EIS spectra were linearly fitted to estimate the recombination resistance (Rrec). A single semi-circle without a transmission line was observed in the Nyquist plots of each devices. Its diameter is assigned to the charge transfer resistance.53,54 The size of the EIS semi-circle reflects the extent of Rrec; thus, depending on the extent of the charge recombination PSCs. The magnitude of the Rrec of the devices was 1.51, 0.836, and 1.97 kΩ for pristine ZnO, with 2EBr, and with 4PBr, respectively. Notably, the device based on ZnO with 4PBr exhibited the highest Rrec, indicating the lowest reduced interfacial recombination. The trend of Rrec followed those of the FF and Rsh of PSCs. As shown in Fig. 6b, the peak frequency of the devices followed the trend of the FF and Rsh. This indicates that the interlayer also modifies the electron lifetime. Moreover, the electron lifetime (τ) can be estimated using the equation τ = 1/2πfmid, where fmid is the midfrequency peak of the Bode plot in the impedance spectrum.53 The estimated τ of the devices based on pristine ZnO, ZnO/2EBr, and ZnO/4PBr was 25, 13, and 32 μs, respectively. This result supports the EIS analysis results.

Conclusions
Small-molecule electrolytes, 2EBr and 4PBr, have been successfully synthesized. The PSCs with 2EBr exhibited an enhanced PCE, reaching up to 9.56%. The PCE was further enhanced by using 4PBr as the interlayer due to the increased ion size and number of ionic functionalities. The enhanced PCE can be mainly attributed to the improvement of Jsc. In addition, the trend of the FF followed that of PCEs. The charge-generation, charge-transport, and charge-recombination characteristics also supported the PCE enhancement. As a result, we demonstrated the possibility of maximizing the performances without complicated synthesis procedures.
