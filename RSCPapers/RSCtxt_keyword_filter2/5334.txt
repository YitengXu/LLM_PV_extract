    , Accepted 17th February 2012First published on 12th March 2012AbstractIn this study, we used facile synthetic routes to construct two well-defined starburst donor/acceptor conjugated small molecules with broad absorption features; in TPAKP-2 and TPAKP-3, triphenylamine (TPA) moieties served as electron donor core units and dialkylated diketopyrrolopyrrole (DKP) moieties with symmetrical thiophene units served as electron acceptors, in 1:2 and 1:3 ratios, respectively. Our investigation of the photophysical properties indicated that the absorption bands of TPAKP-2, and TPAKP-3 extended up to 793 nm, with low optical band gaps of 1.56 and 1.65 eV respectively. Under illumination with AM 1.5 white light (100 mW cm−2), we investigated the performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic devices incorporating an active layer of an electron-donor small molecule (TPAKP-2 or TPAKP-3) blended with an electron acceptor: [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) at various weight ratios. The photovoltaic device containing the donor TPAKP-3 and the acceptor PC71BM at a 1:3 weight ratio exhibited the best power conversion efficiency (1.81%), with an open circuit voltage of 0.66 V, a short circuit current density of 7.93 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 34.7%.
Introduction
Solar cells comprising organic polymers and small molecules have attracted considerable attention recently because of their attractive features such as their low cost, light weight, and large-area fabrication on flexible substrates.1 In the last few years, studies of polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on low-bandgap polymers have dominated over small molecules because of their optimized film morphologies, higher optical densities, and higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).2 Nevertheless, because of their simpler purification, controlled molecular weight distribution, and superior batch-to-batch reproducibility, small molecules are attractive for organic solar cells (OSCs) to be used as active layers.3 With their broad absorption spectra, resulting from intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions, small organic molecules featuring π-bridged donor–acceptor (D–π–A) structures are finding extensive applications in organic photovoltaics.4 Therefore much research effort has been exerted into the development of small molecule OSCs, with a few of them exhibiting PCEs of greater than 5%.5 To date, however, the PCEs of photovoltaic devices containing small organic molecules in the active layer remain much lower than those based on polymers. Therefore, it remains a great challenge to the research community to prepare new high performance solution-processable small organic molecules for organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications.
Among the small molecule materials tested for OSCs, the star-shaped donor π-conjugated bridge-acceptor (D–π–A) molecules stand for a novel class because of their high solution processability, high purity and chemically well-defined structures.6–8 Furthermore, D–A–D structures in the branches of star-shaped molecules, which act as light harvesting antennae in OSC devices, could be easily tuned in their molecular structures to acquire enhanced photophysical properties.9 Because of their high hole transporting abilities and good electron donating properties, triphenylamine (TPA) units have been used widely as efficient photovoltaic materials in OPVs.10–12 In addition, many star-shaped molecular structures, so-called starburst molecules, have been tested for their applications in OPVs.13,14 Besides, dialkylated diketopyrrolopyrrole (DKP)-based small-molecules and polymeric donor materials are attractive because they impart high solution-processability to the preparation of effective bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphologies with broad absorptions in the solar spectrum.15–17 Therefore, it is quite interesting to develop star-shaped D–π–A molecules with TPA as a core for the donor materials, and conjugated DKP arms as acceptors.
Herein, we synthesized two new starburst D–π–A molecules (TPAKP-2 and TPAKP-3) featuring hole-transporting TPA donor units as the core moieties and dialkylated DKP units with symmetrical thiophene groups as the acceptor moieties in the arms. These two compounds are highly soluble in common organic solvents because of the alkyl chains present in their DKP units. Furthermore, the donor-to-acceptor ICT transitions of these star-shaped molecules (TPAKP-2 and TPAKP-3) extended their absorptions up to 793 nm in the solar spectrum. In this study, the best photovoltaic performance was that of an OSC device incorporating a blend of TPAKP-3 and PC71BM in a 1:3 weight ratio, with a highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.81%, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.66 V, a short circuit current density, (Jsc) of 7.93 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 34.7%—which are quite respectable performances for device based on a solution-processable star-shaped small molecule.
Experimental
Materials
All the chemicals were purchased from Aldrich, ACROS, Fluka, or TCI. Toluene, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and Et2O were distilled over Na/benzophenone. CHCl3 was purified by refluxing over CaH2 followed by distillation. If not specified otherwise, the other solvents were deoxygenated by bubbling with N2 for 1 h prior to use.
Measurements and characterization

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Varian Unity 300 MHz spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed using a HERAEUS CHN-OS RAPID elemental analyzer. UV–Vis absorption spectra were recorded using a HP G1103A apparatus and in dilute chlorobenzene (CB) solutions or solid films that have been spin-coated onto a glass substrate from CB solutions at a concentration of 10 mg mL−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed at room temperature using a BAS 100 electrochemical analyzer with a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell and a solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in MeCN, with a scanning rate of 100 mV s−1. During the CV measurements, the solutions were purged with N2 for 30 s. In each case, a carbon working electrode coated with a thin layer of the small molecule, a platinum wire as the counter electrode, and a silver wire as the quasi-reference electrode were used, and an Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) electrode served as a reference electrode for all potentials quoted herein. The redox couple of the ferrocene/ferrocenium ion (Fc/Fc+) was used as an external standard. The corresponding energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were calculated using the values of Eox/onset and Ered/onset determined from solid films of the small molecules, through drop-casting films at a similar thickness from CB solutions (ca. 5 mg mL−1). The onset potentials were determined from the intersections of two tangents drawn at the rising currents and background currents of the CV measurements. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the thin films (on glass substrates) were obtained using a Digital Instruments NS 3a controller and a D3100 stage.
Fabrication of organic solar cells (OSCs)
The OSCs in this study featured an active layer of blended small molecules (TPAKP-2 or TPAKP-3) blended with PCBM in solid films, which were sandwiched between a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) anode and a metal cathode. Prior to device fabrication, the ITO-coated glass substrates (1.5 × 1.5 cm2) were cleaned ultrasonically in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. After routine solvent cleaning, the substrates were treated with UV ozone for 15 min. The modified ITO surface was then obtained by spin-coating a layer of poly(ethylene dioxythiophene): polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) (thickness: ca. 30 nm) at 130 °C for 1 h, after which the substrates were transferred into a N2-filled glove-box. The active layer was deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer through spin coating (ca. 2500 rpm, 60 s) of a solution of the small molecule (TPAKP-2 or TPAKP-3) blended with PCBM (PC61BM or PC71BM) at a ratio of 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, or 1:4 (w/w); the thickness of the active layer was typically ca. 80 nm. Initially, the blended solutions were prepared by dissolving both small molecules and PCBM in chlorobenzene (20 mg mL−1), followed by continuous stirring for 12 h at 50 °C. In the slow-growth approach, the blends were kept in the liquid phase after spin-coating by using a solvent with a high boiling point. Finally, a Ca layer (30 nm) and an Al layer (100 nm) were thermally evaporated sequentially through a shadow mask at a pressure of less than 6 × 10−6 Torr. The active area of each device was 0.12 cm2. All OSC devices were prepared and characterized under ambient conditions. The properties of the solar cells were measured inside a glove box under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using a Xe lamp-based solar simulator (Thermal Oriel 1000 W). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were obtained under short-circuit conditions. The light source was a 450 W Xe lamp (Oriel Instruments, model 6266) equipped with a water-based IR filter (Oriel). The light source was a 450 W Xe lamp (Oriel Instruments, Model 6123NS). The light output from the monochromator (Oriel Instruments, Model 74100) was focused on the photovoltaic cell being tested.
Fabrication of hole- and electron-only devices
The hole- and electron-only devices tested in this study contained the blend films TPAKP-3:PC71BM (in various ratios) sandwiched between the transparent ITO anode and cathode. The devices were prepared following the same procedure as the fabrication of the BHJ devices except that in the hole-only devices, Ca was replaced (with MoO3 with work function (Φ) of 5.3 eV) and in the electron-only devices, the PEDOT:PSS layer was replaced with Cs2CO3 with Φ of 2.9 eV. In the hole-only devices, MoO3 was thermally evaporated to a thickness of 20 nm and then capped with 50 nm of Al on top of the active layer. In the electron-only devices, Cs2CO3 was thermally evaporated with a thickness of approximately 2 nm on top of the transparent ITO. For both devices, annealing of the active layer was performed at 130 °C for 20 min. The space-charge limited current (SCLC) method was used to evaluate the hole and electron mobilities of the small-molecule blend films of TPAKP-3:PC71BM at various weight ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4) by fabricating the hole- and electron-only devices. The electron and hole mobilities were determined precisely by fitting the plots of the dark current versus voltage (J–V) curves for single-carrier devices to the SCLC model. The dark current is given by:J = 9ε0εrμV2/8L3where ε0εr is the permittivity of the polymer, μ is the carrier mobility, and L is the device thickness.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and structural characterization

Scheme 1 outlines the synthetic approach towards TPAKP-2 and TPAKP-3; Fig. 1 depicts the structures of the final products. Compound 1 was obtained through a known procedure18 and then reacted with 3-(bromomethyl)heptane and K2CO3 in DMF to provide compound 2 in 75% yield. Compounds 3, 4a, and 4b were synthesized through simple brominations with NBS. The di- and tri-boronic esters of TPA (5a and 5b, respectively) were prepared from the corresponding bromides after successive treatments with n-BuLi and 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane. The final products TPAKP-2 and TPAKP-3 were produced through Pd(0)-catalyzed Suzuki couplings of compound 3 with 5a and 5b, respectively. Both TPAKP-2 and TPAKP-3 were soluble in common organic solvents, including CH2Cl2, CHCl3, THF, CB, and dichlorobenzene.

Optical properties
We used UV–Vis spectroscopy to investigate the optical properties of the D–π–A molecules TPAKP-2 and TPAKP-3 in CB solutions (Fig. 2a) as well as in the solid films (Fig. 2b); Table 1 lists the pertinent data. In solution, both compounds exhibited two absorption bands: one at 340 nm for TPAKP-2 and 349 nm for TPAKP-3 for the π–π* transitions of their conjugated backbones, and the other at 598 nm for TPAKP-2 and 601 nm for TPAKP-3 representing the ICT transitions between their TPA cores and the branched DKP acceptors.19 In the spectra of the solid films, the absorption maxima of both the low- and high-energy bands of TPAKP-2 and TPAKP-3 were bathochromically shifted relative to those in solution. These bathochromic shifts were attributed to the intermolecular interactions in the solid state. The UV–Vis absorption spectra of the solutions revealed that the net molar extinction coefficient of TPAKP-3 was greater than that of TPAKP-2 (Fig. 2a, Table 1). In addition, the absorption intensity of TPAKP-3 (Fig. 2b) in solid film (thickness: ca. 100 nm) was greater then that of TPAKP-2 (thickness: ca. 100 nm), confirming that TPAKP-3 had a higher optical density and could absorb a greater number of photons from the solar spectrum than could TPAKP-2; this behavior was also reflected as higher photocurrent densities of the photovoltaic devices incorporating TPAKP-3 as the active layer.20 In addition, the absorption onset of TPAKP-3 (λonset,film = 793 nm) was bathochromically shifted by 44 nm relative to that of TPAKP-2 (λonset,film = 749 nm), but there were no significant changes in their absorption maxima (λabs). Furthermore, the broadening of the value of λonset, due to the ICT from the donor core to the acceptor arms, decreased the optical band gap from 1.65 eV for TPAKP-2 to 1.56 eV for TPAKP-3 (Table 1).

Electrochemical properties
To study the electronic structures of the D–π–A star-shaped molecules TPAKP-2 and TPAKP-3, we determined the HOMO and LUMO energy levels through CV measurements of their solid films with Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode, calibrated by ferrocene (E1/2(ferrocene) = 0.45 V vs. Ag/AgCl).
We estimated the HOMO and LUMO energy levels from the oxidation and reduction potentials relative to the reference energy level of ferrocene (4.8 eV below the vacuum level) according to the equation:21EHOMO/LUMO = [−(Eonset − 0.45) − 4.8] eV
As summarized the results in Fig. 3 and Table 2. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of TPAKP-2 and TPAKP-3 were −5.20/−3.53 eV and −5.15/−3.60 eV, respectively. As expected, the introduction of electron withdrawing groups on the branches of the star-shaped molecules decreased the bandgaps by lowering the LUMO energy levels; the band gaps for TPAKP-2 and TPAKP-3 were 1.67 and 1.55 eV, respectively. The electrochemical bandgaps found were in good agreement with the obtained optical bandgaps and also in the desirable range for use in organic photovoltaic applications.22

Photovoltaic properties
We explored the potential applications of the D–π–A molecules TPAKP-2 and TPAKP-3 in OSCs by fabricating BHJ photovoltaic devices with the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/TPAKP-2 or TPAKP-3:PC61BM blend (ca. 80 nm)/Ca (30 nm)/Al (100 nm).
The solutions for the active layer were prepared by blending TPAKP-2 or TPAKP-3 with PC61BM at various weight ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4) initially and the active layer compositions were later modified using various weight ratios of the better-performing molecule (TPAKP-3) blended with PC71BM (owing to its broader absorption and higher absorption coefficient, relative to PC61BM). Table 3 lists the photovoltaic properties (Voc, Jsc, FF, PCE) of the PSC devices based on TPAKP-2 and TPAKP-3 with PC61BM at the various weight ratios. We found that blending of the D–π–A molecule, possessing three arms (TPAKP-3) with PC61BM (1:3, w/w) provided a greater PCE (1.22%)—with values of Voc, Jsc, and FF of 0.62 V, 5.39 mA cm−2, and 36.5%, respectively—than that of the device incorporating TPAKP-2 blended with PC61BM (1:2, w/w; PCE = 0.97%; Voc = 0.58 V; Jsc = 4.88 mA cm−2; FF = 34.3%). We attribute these enhanced properties to the star-shaped molecule TPAKP-3 featuring a greater number of arms, which acted as better light harvesting antennae and helped to adsorb a greater number of photons, thereby providing a higher value of Jsc (5.39 mA cm−2) than that (4.88 mA cm−2) of the device incorporating TPAKP-2. In addition, the donor/acceptor blending ratio also played a key role in determining the photovoltaic properties.23 As revealed in Table 3, TPAKP-2 (two acceptor branches) and TPAKP-3 (three acceptor branches) required 1:2 (w/w; 1:3 molar ratio) and 1:3 (w/w; 1:6 molar ratio) of small molecule-to-PC61BM blend ratios, respectively, to provide their optimal PCEs (0.97 and 1.22%, respectively). The higher molar ratio (1:6) for the three-dimensional spatial structure of the donor (TPAKP-3) and PC61BM provided intimate intermixing and resulted in very efficient exciton dissociation and, thereby, charge carrier generation throughout the whole volume of the blend. In theory, the value of Voc is dependent on the difference between the HOMO energy level of the donor and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor. We found, however, that the values of Voc for the devices incorporating TPAKP-2 and TPAKP-3 deviated from theory, presumably because of carrier recombination or resistance related to the thickness of the active layer.24

The performance of the PSC devices containing TPAKP-3 was optimized by fabricating BHJ OSC devices featuring TPAKP-3 (donor) and PC71BM (acceptor) in various weight ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4). The J–V curves and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices based on TPAKP-3:PC71BM in these four different blended ratios are shown in Fig. 4 and 5, respectively, and the data are illustrated in Table 4. The PSC device based on TPAKP-3:PC71BM at a 1:3 weight ratio provided the best PCE value (1.81%) with values of Voc, Jsc, and FF of 0.66 V, 7.92 mA cm−2, and 34.7%, respectively. The devices based on blends of TPAKP-3:PC71BM at 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4 weight ratios displayed relatively poor photocurrent responses and EQEs (see Fig. 5), presumably because of suppressed charge separation and transportation within the active layer. Furthermore, the poor and unbalanced (by two orders of magnitude) hole and electron mobilities in the device containing TPAKP-3/PC71BM at a 1:4 weight ratio built up the space charge and limited the net photocurrent, thereby contributing (see Table 4) to the net decrease in its PCE.25–27

The device based on TPAKP-3 blended with PC71BM at a 1:3 weight ratio exhibited the highest PCE (1.81%), which was attributed to its broader absorption spectrum (λonset = 793 nm), deeper HOMO level (EHOMO = −5.15 eV), broader and higher EQE (ca. 41% at ca. 598 nm) and relatively balanced hole (μh = 5.21 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s) and electron (μe = 5.28 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s) mobilities, even though these hole and electron mobilities were low. To investigate the mixing morphologies in the films, which affect the interpenetrated networks of the donor and acceptor units, we recorded AFM images of the TPAKP-3:PC71BM blends at different weight ratios (Fig. 6). The average root-mean-square roughnesses (Rrms) of the films of the TPAKP-3/PC71BM blends at weight ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4 were 0.77, 0.57, 0.32, and 0.28 nm, respectively. These values indicate that the films possessed finely mixed morphologies, regardless of the content of PC71BM. Furthermore, we tested the effects of various annealing temperatures (from 50 to 200 °C) on the molecular order in the active layer, but found no improvements in either the values of Jsc or the PCE, which is consistent with the poor crystallinity and phase separation in these blends.
 Fig. 6  AFM images of TPAKP-3: PC71BM blends at various weight ratios. 
Nonetheless, the smoother surface of the device containing the TPAKP-3/PC71BM blend at a 1:3 weight ratio provided a higher diffusion escape probability for mobile charge carriers and higher short circuit currents.24a,b In general, it is more difficult to obtain high-quality films in small-molecule BHJ solar cells, as evidenced by the low and non-symmetric hole and electron mobilities and the poor AFM morphologies obtained upon varying the donor/acceptor weight ratios (see Table 4 and Fig. 6). It might be possible to improve the morphology of the active layer further by using solvent mixtures or high-boiling-point-solvent additives, which may further assist the formation of the interpenetrating network by enhancing the crystalline phase of the small-molecule active layer without disrupting the fullerene acceptor during drying.28–30
Conclusion
We have designed and synthesized two novel star-burst D–π–A structured molecules containing TPA units as cores and DKP moieties with symmetrical thiophene units as arms for application in OSCs. The absorptions in the visible region of the tri-burst molecule TPAKP-3 were broader (covering a wavelength range from 450 to 793 nm) and stronger than those of the di-burst molecule TPAKP-2. Furthermore the number of accepting arms played a key role in determining their optical and photovoltaic properties. The photovoltaic device containing a blend of TPAKP-3 and PC71BM in a 1:3 weight ratio provided to the highest PCE (1.81%) with other optimal photovoltaic performances in terms of values of Voc, Jsc, and FF of 0.66 V, 7.93 mA cm−2, and 34.7%, respectively.
