    , Accepted 1st December 2017First published on 15th December 2017AbstractA series of conjugated T2 polymers (PBBF1-T2 and PBBCl1-T2), and T3 polymers (PBBF1-T3, PBBCl1-T3 and PBBCl2-T3) were synthesized using chlorinated/fluorinated benzothiadiazole (BT) and the two-dimensional benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) units as the building blocks. When compared to the fluorinated polymer, the performance of the polymer photovoltaic devices showed that these chlorinated polymers gave extended optical absorption spectrum, and lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels. The introduction of chlorine atoms increases the twist angle between the polymer backbones, and led to a lower HOMO energy level and resulted in the increase of open circuit voltage (Voc) up to 0.84 V in PBBCl2-T3 based devices with a two chlorine substitution. However, the device based on PBBCl1-T3 with only one chlorine atom exhibited the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) which was as high as 6.87% with a Voc of 0.73 V, and this was about 10% higher than that of its fluorinated analogs. This result indicated that the introduction of chlorine atoms into polymers is not only a simple route to synthesize a large amount of material and which avoids the tedious synthesis steps in widely used fluorinated polymers, but it is also a feasible and effective strategy to fine tune the energy level of polymer solar cell with optimized PCE. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the introduction of longer π-conjugation side chains could minimize the influence of chlorine substitution by reducing the twist angle between the polymer backbones, which would reduce the gap of Voc between the chlorinated polymers and their fluorinated analogs.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a bulk heterojunction structure have attracted considerable attention in both the academic and industrial communities because of significant properties such as low cost, light weight, flexibility and large-area manufacturing compatibility.1–4 Commonly, choosing the appropriate donor (D)–acceptor (A) building blocks in the conjugated polymers with D–A structure is currently the most popular and successful way to tune the energy levels and band gaps, and it has also become the most important strategy to construct the high-performance donor materials used in PSCs.5,6 So far, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs based on a D–A type conjugated polymer has exceeded 13%.7 Among the electron-rich donor units, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) is very attractive option because of its good planarity and excellent electron mobility. A series of BDT-based copolymers have been shown to have quite good photovoltaic properties, so it has been studied extensively in the last few years.8 However, among the various electron-deficient acceptor units, benzothiadiazole (BT) has been widely used because of its excellent electron-withdrawing property and good compaction, which is helpful for electron delocalization in the conjugated polymers while it is introduced into the polymers. Furthermore, the preparation of the BT units is very simple, which means it is promising for manufacture on a large scale.9 So in recent years, a significant amount of effort has been devoted to developing the effective and valuable conjugated polymers based on the BDT or BT units in PSCs.10–14
Among the many strategies developed to improve the performance of PSCs, atomic substitution is an obvious method that could be used to finely tune the energy levels of the conjugated polymer with larger open circuit voltage (Voc) in PSCs.15–20 The fluorine substitution on D–A type polymers has been intensively investigated in recent years together with the rapid enhancement of the PCEs.21,22 The strong electronegativity and small van der Waals radius of the fluorine atoms would lower the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the resulting polymers without disrupting the polymer backbone planarity and intermolecular packing.23 However, the reagents used for fluorination reactions are usually very hazardous and the reaction showed a low yield in some cases, so the fluorinated monomer is usually expensive and hard to synthesize.24–26 These problems had limited the application of fluorinated polymer as an active layer, especially in roll-to-roll printing which has large demands for raw materials.
Compared to the popularity of the fluorine substitution method, only a few researchers focused on chlorine substitution although the chlorine atom was also very electronegative. Several research groups reported chlorinated polymers which had been applied in organic field electronic transistor (OFET) devices27 and PSCs. Those devices showed good electron mobility in OFET and superior PCE in PSCs compared with that of their fluorine analogs, because of their moderated interchain interactions and favorable molecular packing orientations of the chlorinated polymers.28 These results indicated that the chlorination of conjugated polymers could be a promising choice for constructing potential materials for PSCs and OFETs. Meanwhile, the introduction of the π-conjugated side chains on the backbone to form a two dimensional (2-D) polymer was also a highly promising route for designing effective donor materials for use in PSCs,29,30 which would significantly enhance its absorption at about 400 nm and give stronger intermolecular packing because of the π–π interaction of the aromatic side chains. In this research, a family of halogenated polymers designated T2 (PBBF1-T2 and PBBCl1-T2), T3 (PBBF1-T3, PBBCl1-T3 and PBBCl2-T3) with electron-rich 2-D BDT units as donor moiety and the electron-deficient chlorinated/fluorinated BT units as acceptor moiety were designed and synthesized (Scheme 1). These polymers showed good solubility in chlorobenzene (CB) because of two 2-octyldecyl chain substitutions on each of the BDT units and dodecyl chain substitution on each thiophene bridge. Firstly, the effect of the chlorine substitution was investigated by comparing it with that of the fluorinated polymers. By changing the fluorine to the chlorine, the Voc in PBBCl2-T2-based devices was significantly improved because of the steric effect of the chlorine atoms, and the device based on PBBCl1-T2 with only one chlorine atom exhibited a PCE of 3.64%, which was higher than its fluorinated analog, PBBF1-T2. These results demonstrated that chlorine substitution on the backbones was a potential alternative method of fluorine substitution in PSCs. In order to further improve the photovoltaic properties of the fluorinated/chlorinated polymers, the length of their π-conjugation side chains was extended from T2 to T3. Fortunately, the T3 polymers (PBBF1-T3, PBBCl1-T3 and PBBCl2-T3) showed better photovoltaic properties than the T2 polymers (PBBF1-T2 and PBBCl1-T2). The device based on PBBCl1-T3 exhibited the highest PCE of 6.87%, which was nearly twice the PCE of its T2 analog, PBBCl1-T2, and the PBBF1-T3 was also nearly twice the PCE of PBBF1-T2.
 Scheme 1  Structure of the polymers. 
Furthermore, research also showed that the introduction of chlorine atoms increased the twist angle between the polymer backbones, which lead to a lower HOMO energy level and resulted in the increase of the Voc up to 0.84 V in PBBCl2-T3-based devices with a two chlorine substitution, and it also showed that the gap of the Voc between PBBF1-T3 and PBBCl1-T3 is much smaller than the gap of the Voc between PBBF1-T2 and PBBCl1-T2, which means that the extension of the length of the π-conjugation side chains can minimize the influence of the chlorine substitution on the Voc. So it is a useful way to adjust the Voc by utilizing the competition between the 2-D side chains and the chlorine substitution.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and thermal properties
The structures of the polymers are shown in Scheme 1, and the synthetic routes are shown in Scheme 2. The detailed synthetic routes31–33 of monomers (4,8-bis(5′-(2-octyldodecyl)-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis-(trimethylstannane) (D1), (4,8-bis(5′′-(2-octyldodecyl)-[2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophen]-5-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (D2), 4,7-bis(5-bromo-4-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)-5-fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (A1), 4,7-bis(5-bromo-4-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)-5-chlorobenzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole (A2) and 4,7-bis(5-bromo-4-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)-5,6-dichlorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (A3) are depicted in Scheme 2 and described in detail in the ESI.† The monomers D1–D2 were prepared using the reaction between compounds 3–4, n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) and trimethyltin chloride [(CH3)3SnCl]. Compounds 8–10 were synthesized using the Stille coupling reaction of the dibrominated compound 5–7 and tributyl(5-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)stannane with the catalyst system, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) [Pd(PPh3)4] in dimethyl formamide (DMF)/toluene (Tol) (1:4). Then the monomers A1–A3 were obtained by the bromination of compounds 8–10. The target polymers PBBF1-T2, PBBCl1-T2, PBBF1-T3, PBBCl1-T3 and PBBCl2-T3 were prepared using a Stille polymerization reaction between the bis(trimethyltin)-BDT (D1–D2) and dibrominated chlorinated/fluorinated BT (A1–A3) in CB with use of tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) [Pd2(dba)3] as catalyst and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine [P(o-tol)3] as ligand to give the five polymers with high yields and good solubility in CB.

The thermal stability of the five polymers was measured using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), which was performed at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under the protection of nitrogen (N2). The results are shown in Fig. 1. The TGA curves indicated that the polymers have a good stability and show no decomposition at 300 °C. The thermal decomposition temperatures (Td) at 5% weight loss of PBBF1-T2, PBBCl1-T2, PBBF1-T3, PBBCl1-T3 and PBBCl2-T3 were 426 °C, 450 °C, 426 °C, 395 °C and 409 °C, respectively.

Optical properties
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption properties of PBBF1-T2, PBBCl1-T2, PBBF1-T3, PBBCl1-T3 and PBBCl2-T3 in CB solutions and in thin film were investigated and the absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 2 and the detailed absorption data are shown in Table 1. In solution, the PBBF1-T3 shows a dual peak that originates from delocalized π–π* transition of the conjugated polymer backbone, and PBBCl1-T3 shows a broader absorption spectrum in the wavelength range between 700 nm and 800 nm, which would improve its ability to harvest light and thus lead to a higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) in the PSCs. In thin films, because of the strong intermolecular π–π* transition, both PBBF1-T3 and PBBCl1-T3 show a dual peak in the absorption spectrum with the absorption onset wavelengths (λonset) at 791 nm and 794 nm, respectively. This indicates that both the PBBCl1-T3 and PBBF1-T3 strongly tended towards an orderly organized structure and compactly packed morphology in the thin film.34 However, for the polymer PBBCl2-T3, there was no obvious dual peak in the absorption spectra that were measured in both CB solution and as a thin film, which means that the increase of the number of larger radius chlorine atoms would further disrupt the planarity and significantly induce torsion angles in the backbone. However, the obvious red shift and broader absorption spectra of the T3 polymers, but not the T2 polymers, demonstrated that the longer π-conjugation side chains would broaden the absorption range and improve the light-harvesting ability of the polymers.35

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry was used to investigate the electrochemical properties of the conjugated polymers. The onset oxidation potentials (Eox)/onset reduction potentials (Ered) of PBBF1-T2, PBBCl1-T2, PBBF1-T3, PBBCl1-T3 and PBBCl2-T3 were 1.16/−1.08, 1.21/−1.06, 1.17/−1.07, 1.16/−0.90 and 1.23/−1.07 versus Ag/Ag+, respectively, and the corresponding HOMO levels were −5.44, −5.49, −5.45, −5.44 and −5.50 eV (Fig. 2b), respectively. However, the presence of large sized chlorine atoms can deconstruct the backbone planarity and the intermolecular packing of the conjugated polymers, and as the content of chlorine is increased in the polymer, the twist angle of the backbone will increase and lower the HOMO level of the polymers, thereby leading to the increase of the Voc.19 The results provide a promising and simple strategy for adjusting the Voc without changing other factors in the PSCs. However, the T2 polymers show a broader energy band gap than the T3 polymers (Fig. 3) because the larger π-conjugated side chains would increase the electron density, and thus narrow the energy band gap of the polymers.

Photovoltaic properties
To evaluate the potential of these polymers as promising electron donor materials in PSCs and to understand the relationship of the structure-photovoltaic properties based on such unique materials, PSCs with a device structure of indium tin oxide/zinc oxide/polymer: PC71BM/molybdenum trioxide/silver (ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag) were fabricated in our laboratory. The optimal blend ratio between all donor materials:PC71BM was found to be 1:1.5 in CB solution containing 3% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as an additive. The devices were also fabricated without DIO, and the photovoltaic performances were moderate (see Table S2 and Fig. S3; ESI†). To reduce the aggregation of polymers and obtain high quality active films, the active layer was spin-coated from the blend solution at 70 °C. The photovoltaic performances based on PBBF1-T2, PBBCl1-T2, PBBF1-T3, PBBCl1-T3 and PBBCl2-T3 were systematically evaluated and their optimal photovoltaic parameters including Voc, Jsc, fill factor (FF), and PCE of the devices under 1 sun illumination, are listed in Table 2. The current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs under AM 1.5G at 100 mW cm−2 illumination are presented in Fig. 4a, and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the corresponding PSCs are presented in Fig. 4b. The device based on polymers PBBF1-T2 and PBBCl1-T2 both have lower Jsc and FF than that of devices fabricated with T3 polymers, and the results obtained indicated that the backbone of these T3 polymers generally favor generation of photocurrent and carrier transport. It is interesting to note that the chlorinated polymer PBBCl1-T3 exhibited a higher Jsc and FF than the fluorinated polymer PBBF1-T3. Among these polymers, PBBCl1-T3 has the highest PCE of 6.87% with the highest Jsc of 13.75 mA cm−2 and a high FF of 68.59%, whereas PBBF1-T3 shows a moderate PCE of 6.21% with a Jsc of 12.74 mA cm−2 and a high FF of 66.94%. The identical Voc of 0.73 V in PBBCl1-T3 and PBBF1-T3 is attributed to their almost equal HOMO levels, which maybe because of the longer side chains which reduced the twist angle of the backbone.36 Indeed, the larger radius of the chlorine atom in this family of polymers is conducive to the distribution of carriers, decreasing the accumulation of space charges, which could be very effective and successful in enhancing Jsc and FF without sacrificing the Voc. Since the chlorine atoms could disrupt the intermolecular arrangement of polymers, polymer PBBCl2-T3 exhibited a lower Jsc (9.90 mA cm−2) and FF (63.94%) than the fluorinated polymers PBBCl1-T3 and PBBF1-T3. The double chlorine atoms in polymer PBBCl2-T3 decomposes the π–π stacking of intermolecules, and even then the PBBCl2-T3 has the highest Voc among all the polymers, and this is thought to occur because of the suppression of the dissociation of the excitions.

As shown in Fig. 4b, the Jsc obtained from the J–V curves for these polymers was also observed in the EQE spectra. Both PBBF1-T2 and PBBCl1-T2, have a lower photoelectric response in the band of 500 nm to 800 nm than other T3 polymers. For PBBCl1-T3, the EQE profile shows much higher values from 300 nm to 900 nm than that of other polymers, except for somewhat lower values from 650 nm to 710 nm for PBBF1-T3, which is consistent with the absorption profile of polymers in Fig. 2 and the enhancement of Jsc. The maximum EQE of PBBCl1-T3 is 70% at 480 nm and a broad wavelength range from 400–700 nm with an EQE higher than 50% was achieved. Furthermore, the maximum EQE of PBBF1-T3 is a little lower than the EQE of PBBCl1-T3, and the EQE profile obtained was much narrower than that of PBBCl1-T3 because of the blue shift of absorption, which produces a decrease of Jsc for PBBF1-T3. The EQE intensities of polymer PBBCl2-T3 is obviously inferior in the entire photoactive region corresponding to the lower Jsc obtained from the J–V curves. All the calculated integrating current densities from the EQE curves match well with the Jsc values from J–V curves.
Morphology characterization
To determine the influences of phase-separated morphologies on the device performances, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were conducted to investigate the film surface of the polymer T3:PC71BM blends corresponding to the optimized performance shown in Fig. 5a and b for the polymers PBBF1-T3, PBBCl1-T3 and PBBCl2-T3. The PBBCl1-T3:PC71BM and PBBF1-T3:PC71BM blend films show an obvious dispersive fibrillar nanostructure with a favorable fiber width, which is good for generating efficient excitons. This indicates that the chloride polymer also forms the idea morphology with PC71BM, which is even better than that of the fluoride polymer. However, there are no obvious fibrillar nanostructure in the PBBCl2-T3:PC71BM blend film. This could be because the dichloride polymer hinders compatibility with PC71BM compared to PBBCl1-T3, thus the lower Jsc and FF of the corresponding PSCs devices result because of reduced exciton separation efficiency in the blend film. In addition, the smooth surface has a root-mean-square roughness (RMS) value of 1.22 nm for PBBCl2-T3, compared to 2.11 nm for PBBCl1-T3, and 2.17 nm for PBBF1-T3 (taken from the AFM images). As described next, the devices fabricated from PBBCl1-T3 and PBBF1-T3 with larger a RMS showed a preferable photovoltaic performance, which is desired for efficient exciton separation at the D/A interface.18 The result showed that the chlorination of the polymers was beneficial for forming the desired morphology in the solid state and giving optimized solar cell performance.

To further understand different PCEs of devices based on T3 polymers from the point of view of film morphology, the molecular orientation of T3 polymers with PC71BM was further characterized using 2-D grazing incident wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GIWAXD)37 (see Fig. 6). A face-on orientation was found for blend films of PBBCl1-T3 and PBBF1-T3. The film with PBBCl1-T3 exhibits a high crystalline order, shown by the sharp and intense (100) diffraction.38 The π–π stacking distance for PBBF1-T3 is 3.59 nm. PBBCl1-T3 also exhibits a high crystalline order with a π–π stacking distance of 3.61 nm; PBBCl2-T3 shows a π–π stacking distance of 3.51 nm, and thus, the chlorination of the polymers results in a slightly larger stacking distance of the polymer backbone than fluorination. This result means that the chlorination on the backbone would, to some extent, disrupt the packing order which would improve the solubility of the polymers and enhance the charge transport.

To obtain an insight into the effects on charge transport of incorporating the chlorine atom in to the polymer, the hole mobility of the blends with polymers T3 and PC71BM were measured using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method39 for the all polymers. The structure of the hole-only device were ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/polymers:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag.
The hole mobilities obtained from the SCLC method are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). For the PBBCl1-T3 blend films, a high hole mobility (up to 2.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) was achieved because of the chlorine atom, whereas the PBBF1-T3 film only showed a moderate mobility of 8.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. These results were consistent with the performance of each device and the film morphology previously mentioned. The favorable mobility is mainly responsible for the remarkable improvement in FF, Jsc, and overall performance and was a result of much better charge transport and less charge recombination loss. Similar results were observed for PBBCl2-T3 and PBBCl1-T2 film with mobilities of 3.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 2.7 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. This result also clearly indicated that improvement of mobility can be achieved by using chlorinated polymers and is an effective method to realize high performance of PSC devices.
Conclusions
In summary, a series of novel photovoltaic polymers incorporating 2-D BDT and chlorinated/fluorinated BT moieties were developed. The results obtained have demonstrated that polymers incorporating a chlorine atom showed better photovoltaic properties than with fluorine substitution. The introduction of the large size chlorine atom on copolymers is an effective approach to adjusting the Voc of PSCs. The ideal properties such as energy levels and molecular packing can be adjusted by adjusting the number of chlorine atom in the copolymers. However, the modified polymers with different oligothienyl side chains were also synthesized and investigated. It was found that the T3 polymers showed a higher PCE than the corresponding T2 polymers, because they exhibited a broader UV/vis light absorption band, higher charge mobility and short-circuit current. Fortunately, it was found that the side chain extension would help to minimize the influence of the chloride substitution on the Voc, which is an alternative and useful route to adjust the Voc in the PSCs. These findings will be useful in the design and development of highly efficient PSC materials for production of effective and printed PSCs.
