    , Accepted 30th March 2017First published on 30th March 2017AbstractHalide perovskite derivatives present unprecedented physical phenomena among those materials which are suitable for photovoltaics, such as a fast ion diffusion coefficient. In this paper it is reported how the benefits of this property can be used during the growth of halide perovskites in order to control the morphological and optoelectronic properties of the final thin film. Using a large enough halide reservoir, the nature of the halides present in the final perovskite layer can be exchanged and this depends on the initial salt used in the two-step deposition method. In particular, the preparation of a methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) thin film is reported, using a two-step method based on the transformation of lead(II) iodide (PbI2), lead(II) bromide (PbBr2) and lead(II) chloride (PbCl2) salts into MAPbBr3 perovskite after dipping in a methylammonium bromide (MABr) solution. The films prepared from different salts present different properties in terms of morphology and optoelectronic properties, thus providing significantly different performance when they are used for the preparation of photovoltaic devices. Interestingly, the use of PbI2 and PbCl2 salts reduce the charge recombination and increase the open circuit potential obtained, especially in the former case. However, the highest photocurrent is obtained when PbBr2 is used. For PbI2 and PbCl2 salts no traces of the former salt are observed in the MAPbBr3 layer obtained after 10 minutes of dipping time, however, the presence of PbBr2 has still been detected (using X-ray diffraction) when this salt has been employed.
Introduction
Halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted a great amount of attention in the last few years because of their excellent properties for the development of highly efficient opto-electronic devices using relatively simple methodologies.1–3 Halide perovskites present an ABX3 structure, where A is a small organic cation (e.g., CH3NH3+ = MA+) or inorganic [cesium ions (Cs+) or rubidium ions (Rb+)], B is a divalent metal cation [e.g., lead ions (Pb2+) which is the one used most extensively] and X is a halide ion [iodide (I−), chloride (Cl−), bromide (Br−)].4–6 The versatility, in terms of chemical composition, makes the halide perovskites an extremely interesting family of materials. Their properties, such as bandgap, which can be tuned with appropriate composition control, increase the range of applications to beyond conventional photovoltaics. For example, large bandgap halide perovskites,7,8 using Br− instead of I−, can be used as the top cell in tandem devices.9,10 Furthermore, the capability of tuning the bandgap along all the visible range, with the appropriate ratio of halides, also makes the same materials extremely interesting for light emitting systems.11,12
Since the first reports on all solid PSCs,13,14 different fabrication methods have shown that is possible to obtain high quality halide perovskite thin films, but probably, the most extensively used methods are based on the spin coating deposition of the precursor solutions. The first reported methods where the perovskite film was fabricated through a single spin coating step from a solution containing all the perovskite precursors. Very early on it was observed that the precursors have a strong influence on the final thin film properties and consequently, on the device performance later on. For example the substitution of lead(II) iodide (PbI2), totally or partially, by lead(II) chloride (PbCl2) has an important effect on the methylammonium lead halide (MAPbI3) film morphology but also on the optoelectronic properties.15–21 The incorporation of Cl− in the film was under the detection limit or, in those cases in which it was able to be measured, is lower than 2%.17,19 Similar behavior has been observed when PbCl2 was used instead of lead(II) bromide (PbBr2) for the formation of methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3).7,20 Consequently, it was realised that the halogen precursor plays a dramatic role on the properties of the film.
Furthermore, results from experiments on halide perovskites points to a high mobility of the halide ions. This property has been used to control the halogen content of nanoparticles CsPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl or a combination of these halides), thus transforming a nanoparticle originally containing a specific halogen into a nanoparticle with a different halogen composition.22–24 This halide exchange is especially useful to preserve the perovskite structure for compounds that can present several crystalline phases [i.e., cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3)].23 Halide exchange has also been used to transform MAPbX3 films using both gas treatment under halide atmosphere,25,26 or by dipping into a MAX solution.27 In both these cases, the starting MAPbX3 film acts as a template and therefore, the perovskite obtained after the halide exchange presents the same crystalline phase as its initial one even though the halide composition has been altered. The studies focused on halide exchange found in the literature mainly tackle the effect of the halide on the structural modifications, with limited analysis of the implications of the performance of the devices. Pellet et al. observed that MAPbX3 films produced by halide exchange presented a higher photoluminescence (PL) than those films originally prepared with a MAPbX3 composition, but no devices were characterized.27 Li et al. observed an increase in the photovoltaic conversion efficiency for those samples prepared with perovskite after halide exchange, but no further characterization of devices was performed.25
The research presented here reports on the preparation of MAPbBr3 perovskite layers from PbI2, PbBr2 or PbCl2 films. After a lengthy dip in a methylammonium bromide (MABr) solution, the lead halide films were transformed into perovskite and it is worth mentioning that MA+ was quickly incorporated into the layer, whereas halide exchange required a longer diffusion time. Finally, all three salt layers were transformed into MAPbBr3 layers as has been demonstrated through PL measurements and X-ray diffraction (XRD). This transformation presents a significant difference to transformations reported in previous papers. In previous research the halide exchange was produced when a perovskite layer was already formed,25–27 and consequently the process just needed the migration of halide anions, whereas the two-step process reported here needed in addition the migration of the MA cation. Interestingly the structural, optical and electrical properties of the final films were strongly influenced by the initial salt used for the perovskite synthesis and this has important implications for the ultimate performance of PSCs, as has been systematically determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, light absorption measurements, PL, XRD, current–potential (J–V) curves and impedance spectroscopy (IS). The previous characterization of perovskite layers produced by halide exchange has focused on the structural properties of the films with very few examples of solar cell preparation,25 and even in this case there was not an indepth analysis of the origin of the differences observed among samples prepared by halide exchange. Conversely, the general characterization carried out in this research has allowed the understanding of the different solar cell behavior of photovoltaic devices prepared with MAPbBr3, correlating the solar cell performance with the structural properties of the different layers.
Experimental
Deposition of c-TiO2 and mp-TiO2
Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates (25 × 25 mm, Pilkington TEC 15, ∼15 Ω sq−1 resistance) were partially etched using a chemical treatment with zinc powder and hydrochloric acid (2 M), cleaned with soap (Hellmanex) and rinsed with Milli-Q water. Then, the substrates were cleaned ultrasonically in a mixture of acetone/ethanol (1:1 v/v) for 15 min and then dried with compressed air. To remove all the water vapor, they were heated up to 80 °C for 30 min and finally treated in an ultraviolet (UV)-ozone chamber for 10 min before use. The compact titanium dioxide (c-TiO2) layer was deposited on the top of the substrates using a manual spray pyrolysis at 450 °C with 5 mL of a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (75% in 2-propanol, Sigma-Aldrich) that was diluted in absolute ethanol (0.5:4.5 v/v). Compressed oxygen was used as the carrier gas. The spraying of the titanium precursor solution was performed in three steps of 6 s each with an interval of 30 s between each step. After spraying all the precursor solution, the films were kept at 450 °C for 30 min.
The mesoporous spherical TiO2 (ms-TiO2) layer was spin coated (2000 rpm, 10 s) using 100 μL of a solution of a TiO2 paste (30 NR-D, Dyesol, 30 nm average particle size) diluted in absolute ethanol (1:5 v/v). Then the films were dried on a hotplate at 100 °C for 10 min, heated up to 500 °C for 30 min and finally, cooled down at room temperature. All the samples analyzed in this work have the same substrate configuration: glass/FTO/c-TiO2/ms-TiO2.
PSC fabrication
The perovskite layers were prepared using a two-step method. It is worth noting that PbI2, PbBr2, and PbCl2, were employed for the fabrication of the perovskite (PS) films. PbBr2 (1 M) (99.99%, TCI Chemicals) and PbI2 (1 M) (99.99%, TCI Chemicals) were independently dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). However, PbCl2 (1 M) (99.99%, Aldrich) was dissolved in a mixture of solvents DMF/dimethylsulfoxide (7:3 v/v). All the lead precursor solutions were kept at 70 °C for 30 min under stirring. After complete dissolution, 30 μL of each one was spin coated over all the substrate (500 rpm for 5 s and 6000 rpm for 20 s). Then, the films were heated for 3 min at 40 °C and 10 min at 100 °C. Subsequently, the films were dipped into a 10 mg mL−1 solution of MABr in 2-propanol (98%, Aldrich) for different reaction times (40 s, 1 min, 5 min or 10 min), then rinsed with 2-propanol and dried at 100 °C for 10 min.
The Spiro-OMeTAD layer was dynamically spin coated onto the FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2/MAPbBr3 substrate (4000 rpm for 30 s). The Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene), 28.8 μL of 4-t-butylpyridine and 17.5 μL of a stock solution of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (520 mg mL−1 of the lithium salt in acetonitrile) in 1 mL of chlorobenzene. Finally, 100 nm of gold (Au) was thermally evaporated on the top of the devices to form the metal contact.
Characterization of the perovskite films
The structural properties of the PS films were examined using XRD with a Bruker AXS, D4 Endeavor advanced X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. The surface morphologies were determined using SEM with a Jeol, JEM-3100F field emission gun scanning electron microscope (FEG-SEM) including EDX analysis. The optical properties of these perovskite films were studied using ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy using a Varian Cary 300 Bio spectrophotometer and the PL spectra were obtained using a Horiba FL-1000 fluorimeter. IS was performed using a Metrohm Autolab PGSTAT30 potentiostat under chopped light. J–V curves of the PSCs were measured under 1 Sun conditions (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G) using a solar simulator from Abet technologies.
Results and discussion
The transformation of the PbI2, PbBr2 or PbCl2 layer into MAPbBr3 by dipping the samples in a solution of MABr is produced by the incorporation of MA+ cations at the same time that Cl− and I− anions are exchanged by Br− anions. PbX2 films were dipped into a solution of MABr with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1. The effect of the reaction time on the properties of the PbX2 salt films was determined by characterizing the films after different dipping times: 40 s, 1 min, 5 min and 10 min. Fig. 1 shows the results of a qualitative analysis of the transformation by just comparing the color evolution of the different salt layers with the dipping time. PbCl2 and PbBr2 films are colorless, whereas the PbI2 films show a strong yellow coloration. After dipping PbX2 films, very different color evolution was observed depending on the original PbX2 layer, however, a very similar deep yellow coloration was obtained after 10 minutes of dipping time for all the samples. Whereas the PbBr2 films acquire the final coloration after just 40 s of reaction, the colorless PbCl2 acquires it more slowly. On the contrary, the PbI2 film initially turned orange, but upon longer exposure to the MABr solution, the film gradually became a deep yellow color.

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the original PbX2 films and of the same films exposed to MABr solution with different dipping times. After 10 min of dipping time the XRD spectra is dominated in all the cases by the diffraction peak of the planes (100) of the crystalline structure corresponding to MAPbBr3 with a small angle deviation on the main peak (2θ ≈ 14.96°) that arises from the different lead halide precursors used. The presence of this peak and those corresponding to other diffractions of MAPbBr3 indicate the formation of the bromide perovskite in all three cases after 10 min of dipping time, see Fig. 2. The characteristic diffraction peaks of the MAPbBr3 were ascribed to the crystal planes (100), (200) and (300) at 14.96°, 30.14° and 45.9°, respectively.28
 Fig. 2  XRD patterns of MAPbBr3 and PbX2 films starting from three different lead salts, (a) PbI2, (b) PbBr2 and (c) PbCl2. Diffraction peaks from the FTO substrate are indicated with asterisks. Green labels indicate the diffraction planes corresponding to MAPbBr3 whereas black labels indicate the diffraction planes corresponding to PbX2. The insets show a magnified plot of the 2θ region of the diffracting (100) peak from MAPbBr3. 
When PbBr2 was used as the lead precursor the intensity of the diffraction peak (100) from MAPbBr3 increases progressively with the dipping time, see the inset in Fig. 2b. However, after 10 min of reaction, in addition to the diffraction peaks from MAPbBr3, those diffraction peaks corresponding to PbBr2, (022), (111), (021), or (112) were still visible, thus indicating that the transformation from PbBr2 into MAPbBr3 is not totally completed after 10 min and a mixed phase is obtained, in which PbBr2 is still present. This fact indicated a diffusion limitation of MA though the PbBr2 salt. Interestingly, MAPbBr3 is quickly formed when PbI2 is used, as can be recognized by the clear diffraction peak from the MAPbBr3 (100) planes after just 40 s of dipping time, see the inset in Fig. 2a. Note that no trace of MAPbI3, characterized by the (110) diffraction peak at 2θ = 14.12°, can be found, see inset in Fig. 2a. This fact indicates that the MAPbBr3 phase is significantly dominant compared to other possible phases not detected using XRD. At the same time, those peaks from PbI2 have practically disappeared after this short dipping time, as can be found from the strong decrease of diffraction from the PbI2(005) planes. After 10 minutes of dipping time no trace of PbI2 is present in the XRD spectra and a total transformation into MAPbBr3 was produced. In contrast to the PbBr2 salt the diffusion of MA though the PbI2 salt does not present a severe limitation.
For the PbCl2 layer, as in the case of PbI2 and in contrast with PbBr2, no peaks from the original salt are observed after 10 min of dipping time, see Fig. 2c. After 10 minutes of dipping time the diffraction peak from the perovskite (100) plane was detected at 14.92° for those samples prepared from PbI2 and PbBr2, and at 14.96° for the sample starting from PbCl2, see the insets in Fig. 2 and these values can be considered to be equal when the experimental error was taken into account, see Fig. S1 (ESI†). However, the evolution of the position of this peak depends strongly on the initial PbX2 salt, whereas for PbI2 and PbBr2 the position of the (100) signal does not significantly shift over the dipping time. However, for the PbCl2 sample a clear evolution from larger to smaller 2θ values is observed over the reaction time, see inset Fig. 2c and Fig. S1 (ESI†). This behavior indicates that for PbI2 and PbBr2 salts, the MAPbBr3 is quickly formed whereas for PbCl2 first the MAPbCl3 is formed, and this is characterized by the (100) diffraction peak at 2θ = 15.22°, see inset in Fig. 2c. As the dipping time increases a mixed MAPb(ClxBr1−x)3 perovskite is formed, as can be observed by the shift to lower 2θ diffraction angles of the (100) diffraction peak. The x values decrease with the dipping time until the MAPbBr3 perovskite is finally formed after 10 minutes of dipping time.
From the XRD measurements it can be concluded that independently of the PbX2 halide salt used as original layer, MAPbBr3 was obtained after a 10 minute dipping process, as has already been commented on. However, unexpectedly just for the samples starting from a PbBr2 layer, the salt phase is not totally removed. In order to explain this unexpected result EDX spectroscopy was carried out on the original PbX2 salt layers and on the finally transformed MAPbBr3, obtained after 10 minutes dipping, see Fig. S2 (ESI†). The EDX results obtained were in good agreement with those obtained using XRD and there was no trace of I or Cl in the MAPbBr3 films detected above the detection threshold of the equipment, see Fig. S2 (ESI†). The X/Pb atomic ratio obtained from the EDX measurements is plotted in Fig. 3. Note that PbBr2 is a halide rich film whereas PbCl2 and PbI2 are lead rich films, and consequently have a high density of halide vacancies. The halide vacancies allow the fast incorporation of Cl and I into the film structure during the dipping process and as has been shown previously halogen migration is mainly ruled by the vacancies.29,30 However, in Pb rich perovskite the punctual defect with the lowest formation energy is the presence of MA in an interstitial position,31 which allows the fast incorporation of MA ions into the structure of Pb rich PbCl2 and PbI2. However, for the halide rich layer the formation energy of these defects is higher making this incorporation more difficult. Consequently, the PbBr2 phase is not totally removed in the MAPbBr3 layers formed from PbBr2 films.
 Fig. 3  X/Pb atomic ratio obtained using the EDX measurements [see Fig. S2 (ESI†) for more details] using different halides, where X = Cl, Br or I. On the left hand side is the ratio obtained for the original PbX2 salts, whereas on the right hand side is the measured ratio of the final MAPbBr3 layer. The black dashed and dotted lines are eye guides indicating the stoichiometric ratio for the salts and for the perovskite, 2 and 3, respectively. 
The surface morphologies of the different perovskite samples on mp-TiO2 were characterized by registering the SEM images. Fig. 4 shows the top view of images of the three lead halide precursors (PbCl2, PbBr2 and PbI2) and the corresponding MAPbBr3 films formed upon reaction with a solution of MABr for 10 min. Clear differences in the crystal morphology were observed and whereas PbCl2 and PbBr2 salts were deposited just inside the TiO2 pores, a non-continuous capping layer on top of TiO2 was formed with PbI2. The samples were prepared in exactly the same way independently of the salt (with a small variation for PbCl2 deposition), and consequently, as the salts were different, differences were observed between the deposited layers that influence the final MAPbBr3 layer obtained. In this sense, whereas MAPbBr3 prepared from PbCl2 crystallizes inside the porous TiO2, for PbI2 and PbBr2 precursors a non-continuous capping layer of MAPbBr3 can be seen on the top, and this indicated a greater filling of the pores with PbBr2 in comparison with PbCl2. The slight differences observed in the palette of yellow color for MAPbBr3 after a dipping process of 10 minutes, see Fig. 1, can be attributed to the thickness difference because of the presence of the perovskite overlayer (Fig. 4), to the presence of a PbBr2 phase for the perovskite obtained from this lead precursor (Fig. 2) and to the different stoichiometry of the perovskite layers (Fig. 3). A variation of the growth conditions can cause the production of a layer with just perovskite embedded in the TiO2 scaffold or the preparation of a layer with a capping of perovskite on top of the TiO2 scaffold.32 Using the appropriate growth conditions for PbCl2 and PbBr2 would provide samples with a capping layer, but here it was preferred to just compare the samples in terms of different materials and not in terms of different material and different growth conditions.

The UV-vis absorption spectra in Fig. 5 showed the light absorption properties of the perovskite films although this depended on the lead precursors and the time of dipping. Fig. 5a shows the absorption spectra of the PS films with the shortest reaction time (40 s) and clear variations of the wavelength corresponding to the absorption onset were observed depending on the precursor employed: 498 nm for PbCl2, 557 nm for PbBr2 and 588 nm for PbI2. The onset wavelength was calculated from the extrapolation of the absorption spectrum and the corresponding interception with the abscissa axis. It was quite clear that after 10 min of reaction (Fig. 5b) the sample prepared from PbCl2 suffered a red-shift of 68 nm (from 449 nm to 517 nm at dipping times of 40 s and 10 min, respectively), which indicated its transformation into all-bromide perovskite. However, the absorption onset for samples prepared from PbI2 suffers a blue-shift of 30 nm (from 556 nm to 526 nm) and no significant shift is observed for those prepared from PbBr2 over the different reaction times (from 519 nm to 522 nm). The similar absorption onset of the three types of samples after 10 min of reaction time indicated that MAPbBr3 crystals were being formed, after a sufficient reaction time, regardless of the nature of the lead halide precursor, and these results were in good agreement with those of the XRD experiments.

It is well known that the ability of the halide anion to tune the bandgap of the corresponding perovskite crystals depends on their composition,20,33,34 where chloride perovskites show the largest bandgap, Eg, and this decreases progressively for bromide and iodide perovskites (MAPbCl3 > MAPbBr3 > MAPbI3). Fig. 5c shows the evolution of the absorption onset with the dipping time. The light absorption measurements of the initial PbX2 salt layers and the evolution of each one at different dipping times are plotted in Fig. S3 (ESI†). It is also important to highlight that the excitonic absorption peak is clearly visible for MAPbBr3 samples formed from PbCl2 and especially from PbI2 (Fig. 5b).
Very interesting conclusions about the structural evolution of the samples analyzed can be also extracted from an accurate analysis of the PL. The normalized PL spectra of the samples studied are shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6a–c show the evolution of the emission spectra of the films resulting from the corresponding PbI2, PbBr2 and PbCl2 precursors, respectively, with varying dipping times. For samples using the PbI2 salt two clearly separated emission peaks are observed after just 40 s of dipping, see Fig. 6a. The strongest PL peak is observed at longer wavelengths, such as 728 nm, whereas a smaller peak is observed at 538 nm. The peak in the green spectral region (538 nm) can be associated to the MAPbBr3 perovskite, thus indicating the formation of this perovskite at a very early stage, and this result is in good agreement with that obtained using XRD. The peak at longer wavelengths is associated with MAPb(Br1−xIx)3 perovskite with a high iodide content close to MAPbI3. However, the weight of this phase has to be very low as it was not detected using XRD (Fig. 2b). The higher emission peak arising for the radiative recombination of this phase can be explained by the band alignment that produces a change transfer to the phase with the lower bandgap.35 Emission from MAPb(Br1−xIx)3 was reduced with the dipping time and after 10 minutes of reaction, just the emission from MAPbBr3 could be observed. The presence of this phase is also responsible for the orange color observed for samples prepared with PbI2 precursors and with low dipping times (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 6  Normalized PL spectra of the films shown in Fig. 1, at different dipping times for the different lead halide precursors (a) PbI2, (b) PbBr2 and (c) PbCl2. 
For the PbBr2 precursor no significant changes were observed in the PL spectra over the reaction time (Fig. 6b), because the only possible composition of the resulting PS is MAPbBr3 whose emission maxima is centered at 535 nm after 10 min of reaction. For PbCl2 at the shortest reaction time, a broad emission signal with two maxima centered at 412 and 468 nm, respectively, was observed (Fig. 6c). The multiple emission signal is ascribed to the presence of different perovskite domains with different compositions, i.e., MAPbCl3−xBrx with a variable Br−/Cl− ratio, and these results are in good agreement with those obtained using XRD and light absorption measurements. As long as the dipping time increases, a systematic red-shift of the PL spectra was observed and the multiple emission signal was red-shifted and converted into a single signal centered at 517 nm. It is worth noting that those samples prepared from the different lead precursors (PbCl2, PbBr2 and PbI2) with 10 min of reaction, showed slight variations of emission maxima position, i.e., 517 nm for PbCl2, and 536 nm for PbBr2 and PbI2. This was probably because of the significant differences in the crystal size and a blue shift of PL emission was reported with the decrease of grain size.15,36 MAPbBr3 grown from PbCl2 presents a lower average grain size, because it crystallizes inside the TiO2 pores, and the size of perovskite grains cannot be larger than the size of the TiO2 nanoparticles, which is ∼30 nm. However, the grain size of the perovskite over layer on top of the mp-TiO2 grown from PbBr2 and PbI2 was several hundreds of nanometers (Fig. 4).
Finally, photovoltaic devices were fabricated with the MAPbBr3 layers obtained. The J–V curves of the three devices developed from the three different lead precursors PbCl2, PbBr2 and PbI2 with 10 min reaction with MABr, are given in Fig. 7a and the average cell performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. Note that all three salts have been prepared following the same procedure without any particular optimization for each material and therefore, the solar cell performance is far away from being optimized. However, an important conclusion can be extracted about the effect of the different halide salts for the preparation of MAPbBr3 perovskite. The most remarkable feature, as shown in Table 1, is the strong dependence of the solar cell parameters, short circuit current (Jsc), FF, and open circuit potential (Voc) on the PbX2 salt employed for the synthesis of MAPbBr3. From Fig. 3 it can be observed that the perovskite sample prepared from PbBr2 salt presents a Br/Pb ratio close to 3, the value expected for perovskites, whereas samples obtained from the other halide salts were halide rich films with higher ratios. This fact could explain the increase in photocurrent detected for samples prepared from PbBr2. However, this hypothesis needs further confirmation. A systematic optimization of the growth conditions in each case is required to determine whether the higher photocurrent is just a consequence of the non-optimized deposition method or if it arises from a structural reason as commented previously.

Furthermore, the variation of Voc is easier to determine at this preliminary optimization stage. For this purpose IS analysis of the solar cells prepared from the three different lead salts was carried out. The Voc of these cells depended on the lead precursor employed, being on average 0.72 V for PbBr2, 0.79 V for PbCl2 and 0.94 V for PbI2. IS spectra have been fitted using the previously reported equivalent circuit.37 IS has been broadly used for the characterization of PSC.20,37–40Fig. 7b plots the resistance of the low frequency arc that has been related to the recombination resistance20,38–40 and consequently, is inversely proportional to the recombination rate. It can be seen that the resistance (Fig. 7b), especially for applied potentials close to Voc, depended on the lead precursor as PbI2 > PbCl2 > PbBr2, was the trend obtained for Voc (see Fig. 7a and Table 1). In fact, the champion cell with 2.7% photoconversion efficiency was obtained using the PbI2 salt (Table 1). These results point to a lower recombination rate for samples grown using PbCl2 and especially PbI2.
A good photovoltaic material is also a good light emitter as radiative recombination cannot be removed.41 As the photon absorption is allowed (in fact it is the basis of the photovoltaic process) the reciprocal process (the photoexcited carrier recombination emitting a photon) is also possible because of the reciprocity principle.42 In a real device, in addition to ideal radiative recombination there are alternative non-radiative recombination pathways that can be removed by optimization of the system. Consequently, the disappearance of the fast and avoidable non-radiative recombination produces an increase of the unavoidable radiative recombination pathway with a subsequent increase of PL. The intensity of the PL emitted for the different samples [Fig. S4 (ESI†)], also scales as PbI2 > PbCl2 > PbBr2, thus pointing to the same direction of reduced non-radiative recombination of MAPbBr3 prepared from PbCl2 and especially PbI2 compared to the one prepared from PbBr2. Probably the presence of unreacted PbBr2, as was detected using XRD (see Fig. 2b), was producing alternative non-radiative recombination pathways. In addition, as has been previously commented, MAPbBr3 obtained from PbI2 and PbCl2 are halide rich samples and consequently the presence of metallic Pb, associated with recombination centers, is lower.3,43 The higher Voc has the additional beneficial effect of increasing the FF.44
Conclusion
The perovskite MAPbBr3 material was successfully developed starting from different lead precursor layers: PbCl2, PbBr2 and PbI2. The absorption and the emission of the perovskite films could be easily controlled by managing the dipping time and exploiting the classical two-step method, which is based on the spin-coating deposition of the lead halide precursor and subsequent dipping in a MABr solution. However, the MAPbBr3 material is produced after a long enough dipping time regardless of the starting precursor, and the properties of these layers are strongly dependent on the precursor employed. This fact was highlighted by the preparation of solar cells. Solar cells prepared from PbI2 or PbCl2 were halide rich and show higher PL and Voc, thus pointing to a reduction of the non-radiative charge recombination, especially for PbI2. These results highlight the importance of the choice of the corresponding precursors for the development of high efficiency solar cells. The higher recombination detected in MAPbBr3 prepared from PbBr2 can be attributed to the presence of a mixed phase containing both MAPbBr3 and PbBr2, whereas surprisingly for PbCl2 and PbI2, the layers were fully transformed into MAPbBr3, as has been detected by the XRD analysis. Furthermore, the reduction of metallic recombination centers in the halide-rich perovskites (the ones produced from PbI2 or PbCl2 salts) could contribute to the recombination reduction. In addition to the potential for the preparation of photovoltaic devices, the materials and procedures analyzed in this research could constitute an excellent platform for the study of ion migration and defect formation, and their effects on the properties of halide perovskite materials.
