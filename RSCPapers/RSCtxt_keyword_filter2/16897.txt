    , Accepted 23rd August 2018First published on 24th August 2018AbstractSolar cells with organic–inorganic perovskites as light absorbers are now delivering more than 22% power conversion efficiencies and are comparable to their inorganic counterparts on a laboratory scale. However, their intrinsic instability hinders the commercialization of this promising photovoltaic technique. Herein we introduced the bivalent alkyldiammonium cation ethylenediamine (EDA2+) into methylammonium (MA)/formamidinium (FA) lead iodide (MA0.7FA0.3PbI3) to improve its stability, forming a triple cation perovskite (MA0.7FA0.3)1−2xEDAxPbI3 as a light absorber layer for planar perovskite solar cells. After delicately tuning the stoichiometric ratio of EDA2+ in the cation, PSCs based on the (MA0.7FA0.3)0.97EDA0.015PbI3 (x = 1.5%) perovskite yielded a highest power conversion efficiency of 20.01% with negligible hysteresis. More importantly, the devices showed greatly enhanced stability compared to the EDA-free ones. The unencapsulated perovskite solar cells with EDA incorporation retained 96% of their initial efficiencies after 25 days of storage in an ambient atmosphere.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites have attracted tremendous attention since they were first reported as sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells in 2009.1 Owing to their superb semiconductor opto-electronic properties such as high absorption coefficient,2 ambipolar charge transport property,3 and long carrier diffusion length,4,5 hybrid organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites have been widely deployed for solar cells,6–11 light-emitting diodes,12,13 and detectors.14–16 In the last few years, the certified lab-scale power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have skyrocketed to 23.3%,17–20 which challenge commercialized silicon-based solar cells. However, PSCs suffer from severe instability issues under photo-,21,22 thermal-23 and humidity-24 stress, which should be addressed before the commercialization of this emerging photovoltaic technology. It has been proven that the high volatility of organic cations mainly accounts for the instability of halide perovskites due to the low lattice formation energy of organic cations with the surrounding halides. Fully substituting the organic cations with an inorganic cation Cs has been realized,25–28 and PSCs with these so-called all-inorganic perovskites have yielded a considerable PCE of 15.7%.28 On the other hand, partially substituting the organic cations with similar-radius ions to form multi-cation perovskites has been an alternative way to stabilize perovskites.29 Hybrid organic–inorganic double-, triple- and even quadruple-cation perovskites have been demonstrated for highly efficient and stable PSCs.30–32 Herein we introduce the alkyldiammonium cation ethylenediamine (EDA2+) into the MA0.7FA0.3PbI3 perovskite, forming a novel triple-cation perovskite material (MA0.7FA0.3)1−2xEDAxPbI3 for PSCs. We demonstrate that the incorporation of 1.5 mol% EDA2+ in organic cations significantly improves the performance of PSCs. PSCs with (MA0.7FA0.3)0.97EDA0.015PbI3 as the light absorber exhibit a PCE of 20.01% with negligible hysteresis, which is significantly superior to that of EDA-free PSCs. More importantly, incorporating a small amount of EDA2+ into cations significantly enhances the stability of perovskite films. Therefore, the (MA0.7FA0.3)0.97EDA0.015PbI3-based devices retain 96% of their initial PCE after 25 days of storage, while the control EDA-free devices lose 90% of their PCEs after only 5 days under the same conditions. These results demonstrate that the incorporation of EDA2+ in perovskites is an effective strategy to improve the performance of PSCs as well as their stability.
2. Experimental section
Materials
Unless otherwise stated, all the regents and solvents were purchased from either Sigma-Aldrich or Alfa Aesar and used as received without any purification. Tin oxide (SnO2) quantum dots (QDs) were prepared according to a reported procedure.33 EDAI2 was synthesized by reacting EDA and hydroiodic acid with a molar ratio of 1:2 in an ice bath for hours. The precipitate was collected, washed with diethyl ether, and then vacuum-dried. The perovskite (MA0.7FA0.3)1−2xEDAxPbI3 precursor was prepared by dissolving MAI, FAI, EDAI2, PbI2, DMSO, and Pb(SCN)2 in DMF with a concentration of 1.21 M, where the molar ratio of DMSO and PbI2 was 1:1. The obtained mixture was then stirred at 60 °C for hours before use. The Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 μL of TBP and 17.5 μL of 520 mg mL−1 lithium salt (Li-TFSI) in acetonitrile, in 1 mL of anhydrous chlorobenzene.
Solar cell fabrication
FTO substrates (OPV technology, ca. 13 ohm per square) were sequentially sonicated in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and ethanol for 15 min each, followed by drying with a N2 gun. The SnO2 QDs were spin-coated on the cleaned substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 200 °C for 60 min. The perovskite deposition process was carried out in an Ar-filled glove box, using a solvent-engineering technique reported in the literature.34,35 The hole transport layer was deposited by spin-coating the Spiro-OMeTAD solution on top of the perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 20 s. The devices were completed with a layer of 60 nm gold as the back electrode upon thermal evaporation.
Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected with a Bruker AXS D8 Advance. Time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were performed with a DeltaFlex fluorescence spectrometer (HORIBA). All the samples were deposited on FTO substrates using Al2O3 powder as the background under ambient conditions. The absorption spectra were obtained using a SHIMADZU mini 1280 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The morphologies of the film surface and cross-section were obtained with a JSM 6700F field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed using an XPS/UPS system (Thermo Scientific, ESCALAB 250Xi, USA). Steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a 488 nm laser as an excitation source. Steady-state current and power output measurements, and current density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instruments, China) with a Newport 94023A solar simulator equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp and an AM 1.5G filter. Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a QE/IPCE system (Enli Technology Co. Ltd).
3. Results and discussion
XRD measurements were carried out to examine the structure of (MA0.7FA0.3)1−2xEDAxPbI3. Fig. 2a depicts the XRD patterns of (MA0.7FA0.3)1−2xEDAxPbI3 (with x = 0, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 4%, 6%, and 8%) perovskite films deposited on glass. It can be observed that all the samples exhibit a batch of strong diffraction peaks at around 14.1°, 28.3°, and 31.7° and weak ones at around 19.9°, 24.4°, 34.8°, 40.4°, 43.0°, and 50.1°, which correspond to the (110), (220), (310), (112), (211), (312), (224), (314) and (404) planes, respectively, indicating the formation of a typical tetragonal phase.36 The ion size of ethylenediamine is 3.743Å. We calculated the tolerance factor using the following equation:  where α is the tolerance factor and ri (i = A, B, and X) is the radii of ions in ABX3. The tolerance factors for (MA0.7FA0.3)1−2xEDAxPbI3 are 0.934, 0.933, 0.932, 0.931, 0.930, 0.927 and 0.920 for x = 0%, x = 0.5%, x = 1%, x = 1.5%, x = 2%, x = 4% and x = 8%, respectively. All these values are within the ideal range (0.8–1) to form a perovskite structure.37 Upon increasing the molar concentration of EDA2+ in the A cation site from 0% to 8%, a slight shift of diffraction peaks towards lower angles was detected (Fig. 2b). According to Bragg's law, this shift strongly evidences the embedment of EDA2+ into the perovskite crystal structure. The incorporation of EDA2+ with such a larger ionic radius distributed across the organic cation site leads to crystal lattice expansion. The crystal size of the perovskite films was roughly estimated with the Debye–Scherrer formula. Based on the full width at half-maximum of the (110) plane diffraction, the average size of the crystals was determined to be 200 nm for EDA-free samples. Upon increasing the molar concentration of EDA2+, the crystal size shrank, which was consistent with the trend shown in the SEM images (Fig. 4).

The charge dynamics of (MA0.7FA0.3)1−2xEDAxPbI3 perovskite films were investigated with time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements. Fig. 2c shows the TRPL decay curves of the perovskite films (deposited on FTO substrates). Obviously, the decay curves exhibit biexponential decay dependence. We fitted the curves with a bi-exponential function  where A is a constant, B1 and B2 are the relative amplitude fractions for each decay component, and τ1 and τ2 are the fast and slow decay times, respectively. The fitted parameters are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.† Due to the high energy applied in this measurement, the short lifetime τ1 was dominated by bimolecular recombination while the long lifetime τ2 was dominated by trap-assisted recombination.38 It can be seen that (MA0.7FA0.3)1−2xEDAxPbI3 perovskite films with 1.5 mol% EDA2+ exhibit a longer τ2 compared to the ones with low amounts of EDA2+. The τ2 of (MA0.7FA0.3)0.97EDA0.015PbI3 was measured to be 105.30 ns, while (MA0.7FA0.3)1−2xEDAxPbI3 exhibited τ2 of 85.22 ns and 89.06 ns for x = 0.5% and 1%, respectively. However, when more EDA2+ (2%, 4%, 6%, and 8%) was incorporated, the lifetime showed a downtrend. The τ2 values of these films are even shorter than those of the EDA-free samples. Since the PL decay is believed to originate from the nonradiative recombination at the trap states in perovskite films,38 (MA0.7FA0.3)0.97EDA0.015PbI3 with the longest lifetime should have the lowest trap density, which is favorable for obtaining high performance in PSCs.
It has been shown that the band gap of organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites (ABX3) is mainly dependent on the halogens in the X site.39 However, upon increasing the EDA2+ content in the A site, the absorption edges show a noticeable blueshift (Fig. 2d), indicating an increase of Eg. As shown in Fig. 3a, the band gap is 1.55 eV for the EDA-free sample and gradually increases to 1.61 eV for the (MA0.7FA0.3)0.84EDA0.08PbI3 (x = 8%) perovskite, which are calculated using the corresponding Tauc plots of the absorption spectra. Subsequently, UPS measurements were performed to determine the valence and conduction bands of these perovskite materials. Fig. 3b shows the UPS spectra of (MA0.7FA0.3)1−2xEDAxPbI3, from which the work function and the energy difference between the top of the valence band (Ev) and the Fermi level of these films can be obtained. Combined with the Eg values, the band alignment between these perovskite materials and the electron/hole transporting materials can be determined. As depicted in Fig. 3c, the valence bands of these perovskite materials show a slight upshift upon increasing the content of EDA2+, and the energy bands of all the perovskite materials align well with those of the electron and hole transporting layers (SnO2 and Spiro-OMeTAD here, respectively), which would be favorable for charge transport in the photovoltaic devices.

A set of planar structure PSCs using (MA0.7FA0.3)1−2xEDAxPbI3 as the light absorber layer were fabricated to verify the feasibility of this perovskite material in solar cells. The device structure is schematically displayed in Fig. 1, which comprises a thin layer (ca. 30 nm) of SnO2 QDs deposited on FTO as the ETL, an approximately 300 nm thick perovskite layer, a layer of Li-TFSI doped Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL, and ca. 30 nm Au as the back contact. All the thickness data were evaluated according to the cross-sectional SEM images of the PSCs. The J–V curves of the champion devices are shown in Fig. 5 and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The reference EDA-free device delivers a PCE of 17.12% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.045 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.94 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.71. With the incorporation of 1.5 mol% EDA2+ cation, the (MA0.7FA0.3)0.97EDA0.015PbI3 based device exhibits the highest PCE of 19.7%, with a Voc of 1.08 V, a Jsc of 23.7 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.77. This result demonstrates the effect of the doped EDA2+ on the performance of PSCs. It is noteworthy that the enhancement mainly originates from Voc and FF, which can be rationalized by the decreased trap density after EDA doping. This hypothesis can be supported by the afore-mentioned TRPL measurement results. While the concentration of EDA2+ further increases to 2 mol%, the photovoltaic parameters show an identifiable decrease (Voc from 1.075 to 1.065, Jsc from 23.74 to 23.22, and FF from 0.77 to 0.75). This deterioration was more noticeable upon increasing the proportion of EDA up to 4 mol%: the (MA0.7FA0.3)0.92EDA0.04PbI3 perovskite based PSCs yield a PCE of only 16.30% with a much lower Jsc of 20.56 mA cm−2 compared to other samples. These results were probably due to the formation of 2D perovskites in the films when excessive large size EDA2+ was added. Similar results were also described in other studies.40

Fig. 6a presents the evolution of the surfaces of the unencapsulated perovskite films stored under ambient conditions with an average humidity of 57% (highest humidity of 70%). For the EDA-free sample, the film began to decompose from its down left corner after 1 day and the color gradually turned light brown. This phenomenon probably indicates the decomposition of the perovskite to PbI2 in the film due to the high humidity in the ambient atmosphere. This assumption was further confirmed by the XRD patterns (Fig. 6b), in which the diffraction peak at 12.6° corresponding to PbI2 appeared after 1 day. Under the same conditions, the EDA-containing perovskite film, (MA0.7FA0.3)0.97EDA0.015PbI3, is more stable. The film remained dark brown after being exposed to the high humidity environment for 28 days. Although a weak PbI2 diffraction peak appears after long time storage, the degradation of the (MA0.7FA0.3)0.97EDA0.015PbI3 sample is much slower than that of the EDA-free sample. This stark contrast in the stability reflected by the color change of these two films drew our attention. We speculate that the greatly enhanced stability of the perovskite film after the EDA doping stems from the double NH3+ at the two ends of the bivalent EDA2+, which may strain the PbI64− octahedra around EDA2+ cations by van der Waals force and further stabilize the perovskite crystal structure. The long-term stability of the (MA0.7FA0.3)0.97EDA0.015PbI3 based PSCs was also examined along with that of the EDA-free perovskite (MA0.7FA0.3PbI3) based ones for comparison. The unencapsulated PSCs were examined and stored in an ambient atmosphere with 30% RH periodically. The temporal evolution of PCEs was studied and is presented in Fig. 6c. It can be observed that the (MA0.7FA0.3)0.97EDA0.015PbI3 based PSCs retained 96% of their initial performance after 25 days of storage, while the control devices quickly lost 90% of their PCEs after only 5 days under the same conditions.

The climatic conditions were ∼27 °C and ∼57% humidity. 
Compared to the state-of-the-art PSCs (PCE over 20%),41,42 our champion device shows an inferior performance, which may result from the decreased perovskite grain size after EDA doping (Fig. 4). The smaller grain size means more grain boundaries in the film, which would increase the possibility of charge recombination and hence lower the performance.43 It has been reported that a small amount of Pb(SCN)2 in the perovskite precursor could lead to a larger grain size in perovskite films and an improved performance (mainly Voc) of the PSCs.44,45 In addition, interfacial modification with a fullerene-self-assembled monolayer (C60-SAM) between SnO2 and perovskite has been shown to suppress J–V hysteresis.46 To explore the best performance of the (MA0.7FA0.3)0.97EDA0.015PbI3 based PSCs, 2 mol% Pb(SCN)2 was added to the perovskite precursor and the SnO2 QD ETL was covered with an ultra-thin layer of C60-SAM. After applying these strategies and carefully optimizing the fabrication process, we successfully boosted the PCEs of the (MA0.7FA0.3)0.97EDA0.015PbI3 based devices to over 20%, achieving a nearly hysteresis-free PCE of 20.01% with a Voc of 1.09 V, a Jsc of 23.7 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.778 in the reverse scan and a PCE of 19.69% with a Voc of 1.075 V, a Jsc of 23.69 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.773 in the forward scan (Fig. 7a). The steady-state measurement results (Fig. 7b) show that a stabilized PCE of 19.94% and a constant photocurrent of 22.40 mA cm−2 were obtained at a bias voltage of 0.89 V (determined by the maximum power output point from the J–V curve), which are consistent with the values obtained from the J–V curve. Fig. 7c shows the IPCE spectrumof the best performing device, which exhibits a broad spectral response between 400 nm and 830 nm. The integrated Jsc (22.78 mA cm−2) from the IPCE spectrum is consistent with the value extracted from the J–V measurement. The statistical PCEs of 40 devices are presented as a histogram in Fig. 7d. The average efficiency is 18.58%, and 25% of the PSCs exhibit PCEs over 19%.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have introduced the alkyldiammonium cation EDA2+ into the organic cation of MA0.7FA0.3PbI3 to develop a novel triple cation perovskite (MA0.7FA0.3)1−2xEDAxPbI3 for PSCs. The dication EDA2+ was successfully embedded into the perovskite lattice which strained the crystal structure, thereby stabilizing the crystal structure and improving the stability of the perovskite film. With the incorporation of 1.5 mol% of EDA2+ into the cation, the (MA0.7FA0.3)0.97EDA0.015PbI3 perovskite film shows a prolonged lifetime and improved stability compared to the EDA-free one. PSCs based on the (MA0.7FA0.3)0.97EDA0.015PbI3 perovskite exhibit a high PCE of 20.01% (19.69%) with a Voc of 1.085 V (1.075 V), a Jsc of 23.70 mA cm−2 (23.69 mA cm−2), and a FF of 0.778 (0.773) in the reverse (forward) scan. Importantly, the (MA0.7FA0.3)0.97EDA0.015PbI3 PSCs show greatly enhanced stability in an ambient atmosphere. The unencapsulated devices retained 96% of their initial photovoltaic performance after 25 days whilst the EDA-free devices lost 90% of their efficiency after only 5 days under the same conditions. These results demonstrate the positive effect of EDA on the performance as well as the stability of the PSCs, which offers an effective way of developing high performance PSCs with excellent stability.
