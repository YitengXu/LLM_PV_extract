The device based on the cis-2 isomer and poly(3-hexylthiophene) exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 2.8%, which is higher than those of the reference devices.
Fullerene derivatives, organic materials with unique large π-conjugation spheres, have been widely used as electron-acceptors in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) due to their high electron deficiency and electron mobility.1 As the open circuit voltage (VOC) of a BHJ PSC device is dependent on the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor, a higher LUMO level of a fullerene acceptor leads to a higher VOC.2 The π-conjugation size is the major determinant of the LUMO level of fullerene derivatives. Taking [6,6]-phenyl–C61–butyric acid methyl ester ([60]PCBM) as the representative example, the 58-π-conjugation is dwindled to 56-π-conjugation as covalently tethering the same substituent to [60]PCBM. Concomitantly, the LUMO level of the bis-adduct is elevated by 0.1 eV, and therefore leads to a 20% increase in VOC (from 0.61 V to 0.73 V) of the corresponding PSCs with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a donor.3 The second functionalization on the fullerene sphere reduces the π-conjugation size and the electron delocalization region, rendering the electron acceptors of the fullerene bis-adduct weaker than their mono-adduct analogues. The most successful example for fullerene bis-adduct acceptors is the Diels–Alder bis-adduct of indene, IC60BA.4 The optimized PSC device based on P3HT and IC60BA achieved a high VOC of 0.89 V as well as a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.5%.4b
The high-lying LUMO level and the facile synthesis are great advantages of fullerene bis-adducts, whereas the coexistence of multiple regioisomers in the bis-adduct is a great threat to short circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) values, considering that molecular packing and arrangement of fullerene acceptors in the BHJ structure have a large influence on charge separation and electron-transporting processes.5 Inherently, a C60 bis-adduct with the same two symmetrical substituents has eight regioisomers: trans-1, trans-2, trans-3, trans-4, e, cis-1, cis-2, and cis-3 (Fig. 1a). It was very recently that the regioisomer effects on the PSC device performances were investigated in detail.6–8 In particular, we successfully separated trans-1, trans-2, trans-3, trans-4, e, and a mixture of cis-2 and cis-3 isomers of alkoxycarbonyl-substituted dihydronaphthyl-based [60]fullerene bis-adducts (NCBA) by a preparative HPLC method.6 PSCs based on the regioisomerically separated NCBA generally showed superior device performances to those based on the NCBA regioisomer mixtures. It should be noted, however, that the mixture of cis-2 and cis-3 isomers could not be separated by the special HPLC method and even cis-1 was not generated due to the steric hindrance.6 As such, cis-isomers of fullerene bis-adducts are yet to be isolated for PSC applications, although the less steric hindrance of the cis-isomers would be favorable for their more close packing in the BHJ film and superior photovoltaic properties.8

Herein, we report the synthesis, isolation, and application of a pure cis-isomer of a fullerene bis-adduct as an electron-acceptor in PSC for the first time. Because controlled bis-functionalization of C60 is crucial to produce the sterically-hindered cis-isomers and avoid the tedious HPLC separations, we conducted tether-directed remote functionalization.9 Ethylene-tethered indene dimer (1,2-bis(3-indenyl)ethane, BIE) was chosen as a reactant to synthesize the cis-2 isomer efficiently without forming relatively remote substituent patterns, i.e., e and trans isomers (Fig. 1a). The single regioisomer of cis-2 BIE–C60 adduct (cis-2-BIEC, Fig. 1b) could be isolated and used in PSC devices with P3HT.
The detailed synthetic procedure is described in the experimental section of the ESI.† Briefly, the Diels–Alder reaction between BIE and C60 was conducted by refluxing 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene.4a This reaction yielded four fractions, i.e., unreacted C60, a BIE–C60 adduct with one unreacted indene unit (mono-BIEC, Fig. 1d), a regioisomer mixture of BIE–C60 adducts with no unreacted indene units (bis-BIEC, Fig. 1c) and multiple-BIE–C60 adducts (multi-BIEC), which were eluted in this order by silica gel column chromatography with hexane/CS2 (2/1). Further purification of the bis-BIEC regioisomer mixture by HPLC (Fig. S1, ESI†) afforded cis-2-BIEC in an overall moderate yield (48%). Meanwhile, solvent-free Diels–Alder reaction of C60 with BIE in the melted state under vacuum at 240 °C was also performed.10 In contrast, this reaction yielded only three fractions in silica gel column chromatography, i.e., unreacted C60, cis-2-BIEC and multi-BIEC, without forming mono-BIEC and other regioisomers of bis-BIEC. Although the total yield is relatively low (10%), the regioisomerically pure target molecule cis-2-BIEC was obtained without the HPLC separation.
The structures of cis-2-BIEC and mono-BIEC were fully characterized by 1H and 13C-NMR, high-resolution mass spectroscopy (the experimental section in the ESI†), and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy (Fig. S2, ESI†).11 In the 1H NMR spectrum of cis-2-BIEC, characteristic peaks of intact indene units, i.e., protons at 1 and 2 positions of the five-membered ring, are absent as both indene moieties attached to C60, whereas the spectrum of mono-BIEC exhibits the corresponding peaks at 6.39 and 4.91 ppm. Furthermore, the structure of cis-2-BIEC was unequivocally identified by X-ray crystallography (Fig. 2a) with the two methylene bridges of the indene addends protruding on the same side.12 The packing diagrams of crystalline (Fig. 2b and Fig. S3, ESI†) show arranged rows of contacted cis-2-BIEC molecule pairs with the solvent tetrachloroethane in the gaps between the rows.‡

Electrochemical properties of the BIE–C60 adducts and [60]PCBM as a reference were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry (Fig. S4, ESI†). Table 1 lists the first (E1), second (E2), and third (E3) reduction potentials together with the experimental and theoretical LUMO energy levels. As expected, the experimental LUMO levels of cis-2-BIEC and regioisomer mixture bis-BIEC are 0.16–0.20 eV higher than those of mono-BIEC and [60]PCBM, which would be favorable for the application as an acceptor in PSCs to improve VOC. The difference in the LUMO levels of cis-2-BIEC, mono-BIEC and [60]PCBM is consistent with that of the corresponding theoretical values (Table 1). Thermal properties of cis-2-BIEC and mono-BIEC were evaluated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). They display high thermal stability with onset points of steep weight losses at ca. 350 °C and 310 °C, respectively (Fig. S5, ESI†). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements revealed melting points of 154 °C for cis-2-BIEC and 167 °C for mono-BIEC (Fig. S6, ESI†).

PSC devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:fullerene/Ca/Al were fabricated to evaluate the photovoltaic performances of the BIE–C60 adducts. The detailed device fabrication procedure is described in the experimental section of the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 3a and Table 2, the PSC based on P3HT:cis-2-BIEC reveals a significantly higher PCE of 2.8% than P3HT:bis-BIEC (1.8%) and P3HT:mono-BIEC (1.6%). The photovoltaic performance of the P3HT:cis-2-BIEC-based device is comparable with that of the P3HT:[60]PCBM-based one (2.6%) that was fabricated under the same conditions.13 As expected, the VOC values (0.80 V) of the PSCs with cis-2-BIEC and bis-BIEC are higher than those (0.61 V) with mono-BIEC and [60]PCBM owing to the elevated LUMO levels by bis-functionalization. In contrast, the BIE–C60 adduct-based devices have lower JSC values than the [60]PCBM-based one, which should be ascribed to the rather sterically-bulky BIE addend.8c,14 Note here that the JSC value of the cis-2-BIEC-based device (6.60 mA cm−2) is still increased significantly compared to the bis-BIEC -device (4.70 mA cm−2) and P3HT:mono-BIEC-based device (5.15 mA cm−2). Consistently, the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) value of the cis-2-BIEC-based device was higher than those of bis-BIEC- and mono-BIEC-based ones (Fig. 3b), despite the analogous light-harvesting properties of the blend films (Fig. S7, ESI†). Electron mobilities of the composite films P3HT:cis-2-BIEC, P3HT:bis-BIEC and P3HT:mono-BIEC, which were estimated by the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method,6b are 3.5 × 10−5, 2.5 × 10−5 and 2.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively. They are in accord with the JSC values, suggesting that the regioisomerically pure, relatively compact structure of cis-2-BIEC formed a well-packed structure in the composite film as illustrated in Fig. 2b, thereby leading to more efficient charge transportation and the higher JSC value than bis-BIEC and mono-BIEC.6

The isomer effect of the BIE–C60 adducts on the molecular ordering of P3HT in the composite films was assessed by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) (Fig. S8, ESI†). The GIWAXS profiles from the P3HT:cis-2-BIEC, P3HT:bis-BIEC, and P3HT:mono-BIEC films exhibit out-of-plane (l00) and in-plane (010) reflection patterns. These results imply that P3HT forms a lamellar structure oriented edge-on with the substrate irrespective of the fullerene isomers. Meanwhile, to shed light on the relationship between film structures and device performances, surface morphology of the P3HT:fullerene films was evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Fig. 4). The surface roughness increases in the order of P3HT:cis-2-BIEC (rms = 2.1 nm) < P3HT:mono-BIEC (3.0 nm) < P3HT:bis-BIEC (5.4 nm), showing that the fullerene isomer affects the domain size in the composite films. This trend correlates well with the quenching efficiency of P3HT fluorescence in the composite films, P3HT:cis-2-BIEC (90%) > P3HT:mono-BIEC (87%) > P3HT:bis-BIEC (84%) (Fig. S9, ESI†), i.e., the generated excitons reach the P3HT–fullerene interface most efficiently in P3HT:cis-2-BIEC with the smallest domain size. The P3HT:cis-2-BIEC film would be suitable for forming more effective bicontinuous donor–acceptor networks, giving rise to the highest JSC and PCE in the corresponding three devices.

The rms surface roughnesses are (a) 2.1, (b) 5.4, and (c) 3.0, respectively. 
In conclusion, the synthesis and isolation of a regioisomerically pure cis-2 1,2-bis(3-indenyl)ethane–C60 adduct, cis-2-BIEC, have been achieved by the tether-directed functionalization method. In the BHJ PSC devices with P3HT, cis-2-BIEC showed the PCE of 2.8% with the high VOC of 0.80 V, outperforming the devices with the corresponding regioisomer mixture (bis-BIEC) and the BIE–C60 adduct with one unreacted indene unit (mono-BIEC). These results demonstrate that cis-2 isomers of fullerene bis-adducts are highly promising as excellent electron-acceptors in BHJ PSC devices. Because the rather bulky ethylene-tethered indene addend may lessen the fullerene–fullerene contact and decrease JSC in PSCs, molecular design targeted at the smallest possible addend with cis-configurations is currently under investigation.

The P3HT:[60]PCBM-based device fabricated using a higher concentration solution of P3HT and [60]PCBM (25 mg mL−1, 1:1, w/w) in o-dichlorobenzene showed a higher PCE value of 3.5% (Fig. S10, ESI†). However, the solubilities of cis-2-BIEC, bis-BIEC, and mono-BIEC are rather limited compared to that of [60]PCBM. Accordingly, we used the mixed solutions with the lower concentration ([P3HT] = 15 mg mL−1 and [fullerene] = 12 mg mL−1) for the fabrication of all devices to make an accurate comparison under the same conditions.
