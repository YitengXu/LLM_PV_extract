1 Introduction
In the past two decades Dye-sensitized Solar Cells (DSCs) have attracted widespread attention in the photovoltaic field as cost-effective technology complementary to conventional silicon-based solar cells.1,2
The solar light harvesting mechanism of these photo-electrochemical devices is relatively simple: a mesoporous film of a wide band gap semiconductor, deposited on a transparent conductive substrate, is dye-sensitized in order to absorb photons in the visible range and convert them to electrons. An electrolytic solution acts as a redox mediator closing the circuit with a Pt coated counter electrode.3 During the last twenty years the involved materials and the manufacturing technologies became cheaper and smarter to satisfy the demands of different sectors, and the power conversion efficiency has recently exceeded 12%.4
1D semiconducting materials have been largely studied as a promising alternative to randomly interconnected nanoparticles (NPs)-based photoanodes in DSCs.5–7 The advantage comes from the more direct pathway for the collection of the photo-generated electrons.8 Unfortunately these nanostructures, like nanowires or nanorods, are not able to provide a surface area for the anchoring of the dye molecules as high as for a NP network.9
Since the pioneering work of Zwilling and co-worker10 in 1999 on titanium anodic oxidation and the report of Grimes et al.11 in 2001, self-organized anodic grown TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) became an increasingly attractive material thanks to their outstanding properties. TiO2 NTs can be grown into high-density uniform arrays with relatively high surface area and the 1D nature of the material, together with the vertical orientation, allow the enhancement of electron transport properties if compared to the TiO2 nanoparticles network.12 Moreover they can be synthesized by a simple and low-cost process such as conventional electrochemical anodization.
A NTs-based DSC photoanode can be fabricated directly using the NT film on opaque Ti foil, with a cell backside illumination. In this configuration, the number of photons that reach the sensitized semiconductor is partially diminished by absorption/reflectance at the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/platinum interface and even further reduced in the UV-region by the absorption of the iodine based electrolyte, sensibly reducing the overall performances of the device. NTs derived from thin films deposited on FTO-covered glass can overcome this drawback12 but in that case it is difficult to obtain long NT array starting from a thin Ti layer.
An advantageous approach is to fabricate self-standing TiO2 NT membranes13 that can be transferred to transparent FTO/glass sheets employing a bonding interlayer and used as front illuminated photoanodes. During the detachment from the growth substrate, the characteristic blocking layer usually present between the bottom of the NTs and the bulky Ti foil is removed,14 resulting in a further improvement of charge transport. The adhesion layer can be obtained by tape-casting a NP paste or employing a TiO2 sol, with appropriate thermal treatments and applied pressure.15,16
Herein the photovoltaic performances and the electron transport properties of transparent TiO2 NTs-based DSC (schematically represented in Fig. 1) are investigated. NT arrays with different lengths were fabricated by anodic oxidation of Ti foil and free-standing NT membranes were detached by the bulk metal and bonded on the FTO surface implementing a simple technological approach. The morphology, composition, crystal orientation and surface area of the TiO2 NTs were investigated by different techniques.

DSCs were assembled employing a microfluidic housing system.17 The DSC performance dependence on tube length and the effect of a TiCl4 treatment were characterized by current density vs. voltage (I–V) measurements under AM 1.5 illumination, incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and open circuit voltage decay (OCVD). Since charge separation and transport are not governed by electrical potential difference in DSC it is very important to study the electron diffusion properties into nanostructured photoanodes. For this reason, EIS data were fitted by an equivalent circuit to obtain information on the electron diffusion properties into the NTs. Results of NTs-based DSC were compared to NPs-based photoanode in order to investigate the effect of the 1D pathway for charge collection in this kind of electrochemical devices.
2 Experimental
2.1 Materials and reagents
Titanium foils (250 μm thick, 99.6% purity, Goodfellow) were used as a working electrode for the anodic growth of TiO2 NT arrays. Platinum foil (250 μm thick, 99.99% purity, Goodfellow) was used as a counter electrode. Ethylene glycol (99.5%, Sigma Aldrich), ammonium fluoride (98%, Sigma Aldrich) and DI-water were used for the electrolytic solution.
Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (97%), glacial acetic acid (99.7%) and Tween 20, all from Sigma Aldrich, and DI-water were used for the preparation of the sol of TiO2 nanoparticles used to bind the TiO2 NT array onto the FTO/glass substrate. TiCl4 (98%, Carlo Erba reagents) solution was used to improve the electrochemical performance of the photoanode.
FTO covered glasses (7 Ω per sq., Solaronix), TiO2 NP paste (Ti-Nanoxide D, Solaronix), iodide/tri-iodide redox couple in acetonitrile with a concentration of 50 mM (Iodolyte AN 50, Solaronix) and cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)bis(tetrabutyl ammonium) dye (N719, Solaronix) were used to fabricate the DSCs.
2.2 Anodic oxidation
Titania nanotube arrays were grown by a two-step anodic oxidation18 of Ti foil in an electrolytic solution consisting of 0.5 wt% NH4F and 2.5 vol% deionized water in ethylene glycol.
Prior to the anodic oxidation, Ti foils were pre-treated by polishing with aluminum oxide abrasive film discs (5, 3 and 1 μm). Samples were then cleaned by ultrasonication in acetone, rinsed in ethanol and dried under nitrogen stream. A Pt sheet was employed as a cathode in a two-electrode configuration Teflon cell, in which a 0.8 cm2 area of the Ti surface was exposed to the electrolyte. A first electrochemical process was conducted for 30 minutes applying an anodization potential of 60 V using a DC power supply (GW Instek SPD-3606). The obtained NT array was removed by an ultrasonication treatment in acetone. Subsequently, a second anodization step was performed applying 60 V potential for 2, 3 and 4 hours. After the anodization, the oxidized Ti foils were repeatedly rinsed in DI-water and ethanol to remove the residual fluoride contaminants and other impurities adsorbed from the electrolytic solution during the growth process. During this step a self-detachment of the NT array from the metal substrate was obtained avoiding cracks occurrence.
2.3 Sol preparation
The sol of TiO2 NPs used to obtain a good interface between the FTO and the TiO2 NT bottom was prepared by the sol–gel technique. In a typical synthesis, titanium(IV) isopropoxide was hydrolyzed using glacial acetic acid and excess of DI-water, according to a procedure similar to that previously described in the literature.19 The reaction media were modified introducing the non-ionic surfactant Tween 20, which helps in obtaining a better connectivity and homogeneity when the sol is casted to form a thin film. The sol was aged for 48 h at ambient temperature and subsequently concentrated in a rotary evaporator at 40 °C for 2 h under vacuum. The final sol containing amorphous TiO2 nanoparticles was homogeneous and stable for weeks.
2.4 Material characterization
The morphological characterizations of the TiO2 NT membranes and TiO2 sol-derived NPs were performed by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM, Zeiss Supra 40) equipped with an Energy Dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX, Oxford INCA Energy 450) for compositional analyses. Their crystalline structure was examined using a Panalytical PW1140–PW3020 X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα source.
BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) specific surface area was measured from N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms (Quantachrome Autosorb1) by a multipoint method within the relative pressure range of 0.1–0.3 P/P0.
2.5 Devices fabrication
FTO/glasses were cleaned in acetone in an ultrasonic bath and then rinsed with ethanol. A cleaning in “piranha” solution (3:1 concentration of sulfuric acid:hydrogen peroxide) was employed to remove organic residues on the surface. The TiO2 NT membranes were then transferred and bonded on the transparent conductive substrates employing a drop of the TiO2 sol, previously casted on the FTO surface. Afterwards, samples were left at room temperature overnight and then heat treated at 450 °C for 1 h for crystallization. NPs-based photoanodes were fabricated squeezing the Ti-Nanoxide D paste on FTO substrates in order to obtain a 8 μm thick porous layer and annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. Substrates were treated with TiCl4 in a 50 mM aqueous solution for 20 min at 70 °C and heat treated again at 450 °C. The as-prepared photoanodes were incubated for 18 h into a 0.3 mM N719 ethanolic dye solution at room temperature. The Pt deposition on counter electrodes, the PDMS spacer fabrication, the microfluidic DSC assembling and the electrolyte filling procedure are reported elsewhere.20
2.6 Photovoltaic performance evaluation
The fabricated devices were characterized through I–V measurements under AM1.5G illumination using a class A solar simulator (91195A, Newport) and a Keithley 2440 source measure unit. Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed using a 150 W Xenon halogen lamp equipped with a dual grating Czerny Turner monochromator and measuring the DC current through a Keithley 2440 source measure unit. Open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements were performed using a 760D electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were acquired using the same electrochemical workstation under dark conditions at different applied bias voltages; the amplitude of the AC signal was 10 mV and the frequency range was 10−1–105 Hz. The collected spectra were fitted using an equivalent circuit (detailed description is reported in the ESI‡) in order to obtain information about transport and recombination of charges.21
3 Results and discussions
3.1 Characterization of TiO2 NT membranes
A one-step anodic oxidation process can lead to the synthesis of disordered TiO2 nanowires (NWs) on the top of the TiO2 nanotubes. The formation of NWs is due to the chemical dissolution of the tube top by means of the fluoride species, and it is detrimental to the DSC operation, since NWs can hamper the infiltration of dye molecules during the sensitization step.22 In order to achieve a debris-free open-top nanotube morphology, a two-step electrochemical process was employed. The first 30 min anodization at 60 V forms a disordered sacrificial NT layer, which is subsequently removed. Thus, the resulting Ti surface is patterned by almost periodic hollows that previously contained the removed NT bottom. This surface texture allows the electric field to be focused into each hole during anodic oxidation18 and these hollows act as growing centres for the second electrochemical step leading to a more homogeneous debris-free NT distribution.
After the second step of anodization of the Ti foil, a hexagonal close-packed TiO2 nanotube array was successfully obtained. Fig. 2 shows low and high magnification of the scanning electron microscopy view of the top (a, c) and bottom (b, d) of TiO2 NTs. The average external diameter of the tubes was 120 nm, with a wall thickness of about 20 nm.

For the anodization times chosen in this work (2, 3, 4 hours), TiO2 NT membranes of different thicknesses were obtained (12, 22, 30 μm, respectively, as reported in Fig. 3).

Fig. 4a shows the XRD pattern of the TiO2 NT array annealed at 450 °C. The diffractogram shows good agreement with the anatase phase reference pattern (JCPDS 89-4921), both in peak positions and relative intensities. A similar diffraction pattern (not shown) was obtained for a thin film of TiO2 NPs derived from the TiO2 sol, subjected to the same thermal treatment. The semi-quantitative standardless analysis result, extrapolated from the EDX spectrum, is summarized in the table reported as the inset of Fig. 4a and it shows an optimal control in oxide stoichiometry.

The surface area of the annealed NTs measured by BET (see Fig. 4b) is around 40 m2 g−1. This value is considerably high if compared to other low-dimensional nanostructures investigated as potentially interesting photoanode materials in DSCs.7,9,23
The pore size analysis, reported in the inset of Fig. 4b, shows a broad bell-shaped distribution. This result takes into account the contributions of the free volume among adjacent tubes and the roughness induced in the tube walls by the thermal treatment. After the annealing procedure, the typically smooth walls of the nanotubes grown in a nonaqueous organic electrolyte became highly rough. The cross-sectional FESEM micrographs reported in Fig. 5 show the morphological variation, even if the nanotubular shape was preserved. Albu et al.24 have investigated with HRTEM the effect of temperature on the morphology of the nanotubes revealing that the crystallite formation leads to nanocracks occurrence along the walls. Although on one hand this phenomenon can affect the electron transport properties, on the other hand it brings to an increase of the surface area, consequently improving the dye loading in DSC application.

The steps involved in the fabrication process of the NTs-based transparent photoanode are described in Fig. 6. When the anodized Ti foil was removed from the electrochemical cell (Fig. 6a), NT membranes could be detached by the metal substrate without any crack following a self-detaching mechanism based on repeated rinsing in DI-water and ethanol (Fig. 6b). This is a very simple procedure since it does not involve any chemical etching or mechanical splitting, unlike what has been proposed up to now.13 Subsequently the free-standing membranes were removed (Fig. 6c) and attached (Fig. 6d) on the transparent substrate. A drop of titania nanoparticle solution, previously casted on the FTO surface, was used as binding medium. Finally (Fig. 6e), a thermal treatment is performed to crystallize both the nanotube array and the binding film of TiO2 nanoparticles as measured by FESEM analysis. In Fig. 6f a picture of the dyed photoanode is presented, while Fig. 6g shows a FESEM micrograph of the final multilayer structure consisting of glass/FTO/TiO2-NP/TiO2-NT layers.

3.2 Photovoltaic characterization of the DSCs
In Fig. 7 the results of I–V measurements, performed on the cells fabricated using the NT array membranes employing the microfluidic architecture, are reported. We compared the results obtained for the three different nanotube lengths (12, 22 and 30 μm), with and without the TiCl4 treatment. Starting from the I–V curves the Photovoltaic Conversion Efficiency (PCE) is evaluated as:  where VOC is the open circuit voltage, JSC is the short circuit current density, W is the optical power density (equal to 100 mW cm−2) and FF is the Fill Factor, defined as Wmax/(VOC × JSC), where Wmax is the maximum output power density. The photovoltaic parameters are reported in Table 1. Looking at these values, it can be noticed an increase of the photocurrent density while increasing the nanotube thickness: from 10.07 to 14.77 mA cm−2 passing from 12 to 30 μm. This improvement has to be attributed to the increase of the total surface available for the dye anchoring. Moreover the TiCl4 treatment led to a further improvement of the photovoltaic performances for all the samples under study. In fact, a downward shift of the TiO2 conduction band occurs due to the effect of this treatment,25 resulting in an enhancement of the electron injection efficiency. Moreover a higher number of charge separation interfaces is originated, leading to an intensified light absorption.26 The overall effect is an increase of the JSC values, and consequently of the photoconversion efficiency. A maximum PCE value of 7.56% has been obtained for the cell fabricated with 30 μm thick nanotube membrane treated with TiCl4.

The observed increase of short-circuit current density increasing the nanotube length was also confirmed by IPCE measurements, reported in Fig. 8 for the TiCl4-treated cells. The spectra show an upward shift in the wavelength range from 400 to 750 nm, with a maximum IPCE value of 0.89 measured at 530 nm for 30 μm length nanotubes.

The effect of the NT length on the recombination kinetics in the fabricated devices was studied through open circuit voltage decay measurements. In order to perform these measurements, the cells are initially kept in a steady state under constant illumination and open circuit conditions. The illumination is then stopped and the photovoltage is recorded as a function of time while maintaining the open circuit condition. The free electron density n is subjected to a decrease to the dark equilibrium state value n0 due to charge recombination, with an approximately constant rate. The results of the OCVD measurements performed on the cells are reported in Fig. 9. No difference in the exponential decay was observed for the different NT membrane thickness, meaning that the electron lifetime is not dependent on nanotube length. A slower decay of the photovoltage (meaning an increase of the charge lifetime) was instead observed for the TiCl4-treated cells (as shown in the inset of Fig. 9): this is evidence of a reduced recombination rate due to the nanoparticle coverage on the nanotube walls that acts as a barrier for the interfacial recombination.25,27 In fact, as suggested by O'Regan and co-workers,28 the NPs could occupy nanotube surface impurities, defects and grain boundaries (that are the sites on which the recombination processes mainly occur).

In order to study in detail the recombination and transport properties of the NT membranes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis was performed. EIS is a well-established technique widely used for the study of electrochemical devices and systems based on the analysis of the electric response of a cell to an applied periodic small-signal voltage of variable frequency. For a DSC, in particular, this technique permits us to distinguish the different transport and recombination processes occurring in the cell, since all of them are characterized by quite different time constants: the transport and recombination mechanisms through the photoanode, the charge transfer at the counter electrode and the Nernstian diffusion in the electrolyte. From the equivalent circuit fitting of the experimental curves, the effective electron lifetime τn and the diffusion length Ln values in the oxide were extracted and the results are reported in Fig. 10 (EIS data and the detailed procedure for obtaining τn and Ln are reported in the ESI‡ section). The same parameters have been evaluated for a cell fabricated with a 8 μm thick TiCl4-treated layer of TiO2 NPs (also shown in Fig. 10). As already observed from the OCVD measurements, it is evident an increase of the carrier lifetime in the NTs-based DSCs due to the TiCl4 treatment, while comparable values were obtained for the diffusion length, meaning that the charge transport properties of the NTs are adequate for electron collection even without the treatment.25 A significant increase of both electron lifetime and diffusion length values was observed for the NTs-based cells with respect to the NPs-based one. In fact the number of surface states is proportional to specific area and the NT surface is a order of magnitude lower with respect to the NPs one. For this reason the NT array presents a reduced number of defects and trap sites (such as grain boundaries) with respect to the NP layer, and the charge recombination rate is subsequently greatly reduced.23 Moreover, thanks to the 1D structure, the charge transport is improved in the NTs-based DSCs, while in the NPs-based ones the transport mechanisms result more complicated due to a longer pathway for the electrons in the nanoparticle network. A slight dependence of the diffusion length on the bias voltage can be observed in Fig. 10b. Indeed, at applied voltage higher than the Voc the Ln decreases, approaching the thickness of the film. As suggested by Snaith and co-workers29 this behavior can be ascribed to the reduced collection efficiency that occurs under these conditions due to the increased recombination rate. The improved transport properties of the NTs-based cell are also confirmed by the effective diffusivity values Dn, calculated through the formula Dn = Ln2/τn. We found, at cells open circuit voltage, the values of 4 × 10−4 cm2 s−1, 3 × 10−4 cm2 s−1 and 0.8 × 10−4 cm2 s−1 for the NTs treated cell, NTs untreated cell and NPs cell, respectively.

For comparison, the same parameters extracted for a cell fabricated with 8 μm of TiCl4-treated TiO2 nanoparticles are reported. 
4 Conclusions
TiO2 nanotube arrays with different lengths were fabricated by two-step anodic oxidation of Ti foil and free-standing NT membranes were employed to obtain transparent DSC photoanodes. The cell performances and the electron transport properties dependence on TiCl4 treatment and tube length were characterized and a maximum value for the PCE equal to 7.56% was obtained for the cell fabricated with a 30 μm thick nanotube membrane treated with TiCl4. Information on the electron diffusion properties into the NTs was obtained by equivalent circuit fitting of the EIS spectra. A significant increase of both electron lifetime and diffusion length values was observed for the NTs-based cells with respect to an NPs-based one.

 	Fig. 1  Illustration of front-side illuminated DSC based on a transparent NT photoanode.	 

 	Fig. 2  FESEM micrographs showing the top (a, c) and bottom (b, d) of TiO2 NT array at different magnification. Scale bars are 300 nm in a, b and 100 nm in c, d.	 

 	Fig. 3  FESEM micrographs showing the cross-sectional view of self-standing TiO2 NT membranes fabricated with different anodization times: 2 h (a), 3 h (b) and 4 h (c). Scale bars are 10 μm for all the pictures.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) X-ray diffraction pattern of crystallized TiO2 NT array (semi-quantitative standardless analysis result, extrapolated from the EDX spectrum is reported in the inset), (b) N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms for the surface area evaluation (pore size distribution is shown in the inset).	 

 	Fig. 5  FESEM micrographs acquired at different magnification showing the cross view of NT membrane before (a, c) and after (b, d) thermal treatment. Scale bars are 500 nm in a, b and 250 nm in c, d.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a–f) Schematic of the fabrication process flow of a transparent photoanode employing TiO2 NT array. (g) Cross-sectional view of the multilayer structure consisting of glass/FTO/TiO2-NP/TiO2-NT layers (scale bar 10 μm).	 

 		 

 	Fig. 7  Current density–voltage curves of TiO2 NTs-based DSCs with and without TiCl4 treatment for different nanotube lengths.	 

12 μm	10.07	0.628	0.66	3.64
12 μm TiCl4	11.41	0.657	0.62	4.65
22 μm	11.84	0.651	0.64	4.97
22 μm TiCl4	13.17	0.677	0.65	5.82
30 μm	14.77	0.646	0.66	6.26
30 μm TiCl4	17.47	0.677	0.64	7.56

 	Fig. 8  Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency spectra of TiCl4-treated NTs-based DSCs for different nanotube lengths.	 

 	Fig. 9  Open circuit voltage decay curves of not-treated NTs-based DSCs for different nanotube lengths. In the inset the comparison between the cells fabricated with 22 μm thick NT membranes with and without TiCl4 treatment is reported.	 

 	Fig. 10  (a) Effective electron lifetime and (b) diffusion length dependence on the bias voltage for the cells fabricated with 22 μm thick NT membranes with and without TiCl4 treatment. For comparison, the same parameters extracted for a cell fabricated with 8 μm of TiCl4-treated TiO2 nanoparticles are reported.
