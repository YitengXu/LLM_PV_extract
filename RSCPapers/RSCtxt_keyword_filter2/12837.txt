    , Accepted 28th April 2014First published on 30th April 2014AbstractWe have investigated the photovoltaic properties of inverted solar cells comprising a bulk heterojunction film of thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), sandwiched between indium tin oxide (ITO)/Sn-doped TiO2 front and MoO3/aluminum back electrodes. The inverted organic solar cell (IOSC) fabricated with a Sn-doped TiO2 film showed a significantly greater power conversion efficiency of 7.59%, compared to that of the TiO2 film (6.70%). Further studies confirm that the improved morphology and electrical properties of the Sn-doped TiO2 film result in reduced shunt loss and interfacial charge recombination and hence enhanced photovoltaic performance.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted increasing attention because of their low-cost, low-temperature, lightweight, and flexible nature.1–9 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of bulk heterojunction solar cells has been increasing dramatically over the past few years, currently exceeding 9%.10 In conventional OSCs, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is extensively used as a hole transporting layer (HTL) to improve hole collection at the anode. Yet, the major drawback of PEDOT:PSS is its stability issue. It is known that the hygroscopicity and acidity of PEDOT:PSS can cause degradation of the active layer and the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode, resulting in reduction of lifetime of the solar cell.11,12 In addition, the relatively high cost and poor mechanical properties of PEDOT:PSS-based anode buffer layers could limit the commercialization of organic electronics.13,14 As an alternative to PEDOT:PSS, transition metal oxides have been used for efficient hole extraction on the top of inverted organic solar cells (IOSCs), e.g. molybdenum oxide (MoO3), vanadium oxide (V2O5), tungsten oxide (WO3), and nickel oxide (NiO).15–18 Another problem with the conventional device with a top cathode is oxidation of the low work-function electrodes.
In order to overcome these problems associated with conventional organic devices, inverted structures of solar cells have been developed in recent years because of the superior device stability and manufacturing compatibility.19,10 One key challenge in making efficient IOSCs lies in the electron selective buffer layer: it should work as a high conductive path for efficient electron extraction and also exhibit good hole blocking capability. Several inorganic materials have been chosen as the cathode interlayer for the inverted solar cells to enhance the electron collection at the ITO cathode, among which TiO2 is the most widely utilized cathode interlayer for high efficiency and air-stable solar cells.20 In order to increase the device performance of inverted solar cells, several groups have studied the use of metal doped n-type buffer layers. Metal doping is an effective procedure used to modify the grain size, orientation, and conductivity and could greatly influence the optical and electrical properties of the n-type buffer layer.21–23 Doping materials with Sn is an attractive approach, especially for TiO2, as the small lattice mismatch between SnO2 and TiO2 leads to good structural compatibility and stability.24,25 To enhance the electron transport properties in the TiO2 films, tin (Sn) was used in this work as a doping impurity. The efficiency of solar cells has been improved using the Sn-doped TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL). In this paper, we discuss about the photovoltaic properties of the bulk heterojunction layer of thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) in inverted structures employing a glass/ITO/Sn-doped TiO2 cathode and a MoO3/aluminum anode. The PTB7:PC71BM based device shows efficiencies of 6.70% and 7.59% for TiO2 and Sn-doped TiO2 as ETLs respectively. The properties of the Sn-doped TiO2 layer has been investigated and a discussion about the source of improvement in device performance is presented.
Results and discussion
The inverted cell device structure, molecular structures of PTB7 and PC71BM, and the energy levels of the component materials are shown in Fig. 1. The energy levels of PTB7,10,26 PC71BM,10 and MoO3 (ref. 27) were taken from the literature. The work function of TiO2 and Sn-doped TiO2 films were measured using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and are as shown in Fig. S1.† When light irradiates the photoactive layer of the solar cell through the ITO electrode, the active layer will absorb photons to produce excitons and the excitons will diffuse towards the PTB7:PC71BM interface and dissociate at the interface into electrons in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor PC71BM and holes in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor PTB7. Since the LUMO level of a TiO2 (−4.46 eV) is the same as that of PC71BM, electrons can easily move to the ITO electrode through TiO2. As the HOMO level (−7.66 eV) of TiO2 is much lower than that (−5.15 eV) of PTB7, it blocks the hole transport from PTB7 to the ITO electrode. The HOMO level (−5.3 eV) of MoO3 is very close to the HOMO level (−5.15 eV) of PTB7, and this facilitates the hole transfer to the Al electrode through MoO3. While the relatively high-lying LUMO level (−2.3 eV) of MoO3 prevents the electron transfer from PC71BM to the Al electrode.

The surface composition and chemical states of TiO2 and Sn-doped TiO2 films were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS spectra of TiO2 and Sn-doped TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 2. The XPS peaks at 456.50, 462.30 and 527.85 eV are attributed to Ti2p3/2, Ti2p1/2 and O1s and the two peaks at 484.26 and 492.61 eV correspond to Sn3d5/2 and Sn3d3/2, respectively. Compared with the TiO2 (456.61 and 462.42 eV for Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2), the binding energy of Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 decreased to 456.50 and 462.30 eV after Sn-doping. This can be attributed to the variation in electron negativities of the Ti and Sn elements (Ti = 1.54, Sn = 1.96).28 This result suggested that Sn is incorporated into the TiO2 lattice. The radii of Sn4+ and Ti4+ ions are 0.071 and 0.068 nm, respectively. They are so close that it is easy for Sn4+ to replace Ti4+ in the lattice of TiO2. The chemical constituents present in the sample according to the XPS results are Ti = 24.32 at.% and O = 75.68 at.% for the TiO2 film and Ti = 24.68 at.%, O = 74.41 at.%, and Sn = 0.91% for the Sn-doped TiO2 film.

The sizes of the particles in TiO2 and Sn-doped TiO2 films have been studied using a high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). The HRTEM image clearly shows (Fig. 3a) that TiO2 particles have agglomerated. Fig. 3b shows the particle size distribution histogram and the corresponding Gaussian curve fitting of TiO2. The particle size of TiO2 has been obtained as 12.7 nm. Fig. 3e shows the HRTEM image of Sn-doped TiO2. It is observed that all the particles have agglomerated. Fig. 3f shows the particle size distribution histogram and the corresponding Gaussian curve fitting of Sn-doped TiO2. The average particle size of Sn-doped TiO2 is found to be 11 nm. The HRTEM images shown in Fig. 3c and g exhibit lattice fringes and the lattice spacing has been calculated using these fringes. The lattice spacing is found to be 3.51 Å and 3.49 Å for TiO2 and Sn-doped TiO2 and this corresponds to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern exhibits concentric circles revealing that the TiO2 (Fig. 3d) and Sn-doped TiO2 (Fig. 3h) are of nanocrystalline nature made up of small grains. The rings correspond to the (101), (004), (200), and (105) planes of the anatase TiO2. The d spacing values calculated from these images are in close agreement with the standard data of JCPDS card no. 841286.

Fig. 4a and b show the surface morphology of TiO2 and Sn-doped TiO2 thin films. It is observed that grains are small and are uniformly distributed throughout the surface. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of TiO2 and Sn-doped TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 4c and d. They reveal that the films are uniform without any cracks and are continuous with very well connected grains. The root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness is found to be 2.7 and 2.0 nm for TiO2 and Sn-doped TiO2 respectively. The smoother surface should enable a more uniform interfacial contact between the ETL and active layer, which could increase the electron collection efficiency. The higher surface roughness may indicate non-uniform coverage, which may in turn affect the contact resistance. It is observed that the morphology improvement of the electron transporting interface after doping is responsible for the better performance of the device.

The optical absorption spectra of TiO2 and Sn-doped TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 5a. Absorption spectra of the Sn-doped TiO2 film shows that the absorption edge is slightly shifted towards the shorter wavelength (blue shift) when compared to TiO2. The movement of the absorption edge to the shorter wavelength region is the Burstein–Moss shift.29 The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PTB7:PC71BM based IOSCs fabricated using ETLs of TiO2 and Sn-doped TiO2 are shown in Fig. 5b and they have been measured under 100 mW cm−2 air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) illumination. The TiO2 based device exhibits a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 14.92 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.74 V, a fill factor (FF) of 60.53% and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.70%. It can be seen that the Sn-doped TiO2 based IOSC exhibits a significantly enhanced photovoltaic response with a PCE of 7.59%, a Jsc of 15.85 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.76 V and a FF of 62.78%. The results indicate that PCE of the TiO2 based devices can be easily improved through Sn-doping. The enhanced Jsc and FF in the IOSCs with the Sn-doped TiO2 layer are due to the fact that the series resistance (Rs) in the IOSCs with the Sn-doped TiO2 layer is smaller than that of the TiO2 layer, and shunt resistance (Rshunt) of the IOSCs with the Sn-doped TiO2 interfacial layer is larger than that of the TiO2 layer. In order to confirm this, we have calculated Rs and Rshunt using the J–V curves shown in Fig. 5b. The Rs decreases from 8.63 (TiO2) to 7.39 Ω cm2 (Sn-doped TiO2) and Rshunt increases from 603.10 (TiO2) to 1019.32 Ω cm2 (Sn-doped TiO2). In order to further analyze the cause of the large Jsc in the IOSCs, the resistivities of TiO2 and Sn-doped TiO2 thin layers were investigated by the four-point probe method. The resistivity values have been calculated and are found to be 0.401 × 10−3 Ω cm and 0.362 × 10−3 Ω cm for TiO2 and Sn-doped TiO2 (0.01 M) films. From the resistivity measurement it was observed that resistivity of the Sn-doped TiO2 thin layer is smaller than that of the TiO2 thin layer. This low electronic resistivity will facilitate electron transport from the bulk heterojunction composite to the corresponding electrode. Therefore, higher Jsc was observed for the IOSCs with the Sn-doped TiO2 interfacial layer when compared to that of the TiO2 layer. However, it is also noted that further increase of the Sn doping concentration to more than 0.02 M leads to the decrease of the device performance with lower Jsc and FF (Fig. S2 and Table S1†). The reduction in device performance is because higher doping concentration introduces saturated electron barrier height and more electron trapping sites, which is disadvantageous for photocurrent transport. The dark J–V characteristics in Fig. 5c show that the Sn-doped TiO2 device exhibited excellent diode characteristics and lower leakage current under reverse bias condition when compared to the device based on TiO2. The incident photon to charge carrier efficiency (IPCE) spectra of PTB7:PC71BM based IOSCs are shown in Fig. 5d. It is observed that the Sn-doped TiO2 based device exhibits a maximum IPCE of 75%, which is higher than 68% of the TiO2 device. This indicates that the Sn-doped TiO2 device has better carrier transport properties and carrier collection efficiency. The Jsc values have been calculated using the IPCE data with an AM1.5G reference spectrum. The Jsc is found to be 13.77 and 14.50 mA cm−2 for TiO2 and Sn-doped TiO2 respectively. These values match well with those obtained from J–V measurements.

Conclusion
An inverted organic solar cell (IOSC) containing Sn-doped TiO2 as an electron transport layer with an ITO/Sn-doped TiO2/thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7):[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)/MoO3/Al structure was fabricated. The power conversion efficiency of IOSC with the Sn-doped TiO2 device is 7.59%, which is higher than that of the TiO2 based device (6.70%). The Sn-doped TiO2 layer exhibits less shunt loss and interfacial charge recombination and hence has better photovoltaic performance. The results clearly demonstrate that significant improvement in power conversion efficiency can be obtained by incorporating Sn into the TiO2 films.
Experimental section
Synthesis of Sn-doped TiO2 nanocrystalline thin films
In the present study, Sn-doped TiO2 nanocrystalline thin films have been prepared using the sol–gel spin coating method. Titanium(IV) butoxide (Ti(OCH2CH2CH2CH3)4) (0.45 M) and tin(II) chloride dihydrate (SnCl2·2H2O) (0.01 M and 0.02 M) were dissolved in a mixture of 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH) and acetylacetone (CH3COCH2COCH3) (0.45 M) at room temperature. The resultant solution was stirred for 2 h to yield a homogeneous, clear and transparent (light yellowish color) solution using a magnetic stirrer. The spin coating method was used to prepare thin films of Sn-doped TiO2 onto ITO substrates using the prepared solution. Sn-doped TiO2 thin films of thickness 30 nm were formed after post annealing at 500 °C for 2 h and these films form the Sn-doped TiO2 nanocrystalline thin films.
Device fabrication and characterization
Inverted organic solar cells (IOSCs) were constructed with a device structure of ITO/Sn-doped TiO2/active layer/MoO3/Al. Patterned ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by a sequence of sonication steps in acetone, isopropyl alcohol and deionized water respectively for 15 minutes and UV–ozone cleaning for 10 minutes. A thin layer of Sn-doped TiO2 (30 nm) was spin coated onto the ITO substrates and annealed at 500 °C for 2 hours in air. The Sn-doped TiO2 substrates were transferred into a glove box. The PTB7:PC71BM blend solution was prepared with a weight ratio of 1:1.5 in a mixed solvent of chlorobenzene/1,8-diiodooctane (97:3 vol%). The active layer (PTB7:PC71BM) was then spin-coated on the Sn-doped TiO2 layer and the thickness was about 80 nm. After that the organic layer was slowly dried in vacuum and a layer of MoO3 (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) as an electrode was thermally evaporated on top of the active layer through a shadow mask under a pressure of ∼10−6 Torr. The effective area of the device was measured to be 0.0196 cm2.
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurement was performed using an AXIS Ultra DLD (KRATOS Inc.) with He I (21.2 eV) as the monochromatic light source. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS-HSi) was used to identify the surface elements and their chemical state. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the prepared TiO2 and Sn-doped TiO2 were obtained using a JEM-3010 electron microscope. The surface morphology of the samples was studied using a Zeiss Supra 55VP field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The surface topography was studied using conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM, BRUKER). The optical properties were studied using the absorbance spectra recorded with a Beckman DU-70 spectrophotometer. The electrical resistivity was measured by a four-point probe method. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were recorded using a Keithley 237 source measurement unit using a 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G solar simulator (Newport, 91160A). Light intensity was calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell as a reference. The incident photon to charge carrier efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices were recorded using a lock-in amplifier (Model 7265, Signal Recovery) with monochromatic light from a xenon lamp through the monochromator (SpectroPro-150, Acton Research Corporation).
