    , Accepted 24th January 2017First published on 26th January 2017AbstractThe development of hybrid organo-lead trihalide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) comprising an electron transporting layer (ETL), a perovskite light absorber and a hole transporting layer (HTL) has received significant attention for their potential in efficient PSCs. However, the preparation of a compact and uniform ETL and the formation of a uniform light absorber layer suffer from a high temperature processing treatment and the formation of unwanted perovskite islands, respectively. A low temperature/room temperature processed ETL is one of the best options for the fabrication of flexible PSCs. In the present work, we report the implementation of a room temperature processed compact TiO2 ETL and the synthesis of extremely uniform flexible planar PSCs based on methylammonium lead mixed halides MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0.1) via RF-magnetron sputtering and a toluene dripping treatment, respectively. The compact TiO2 ETLs with different thicknesses (30 to 100 nm) were directly deposited on a flexible PET coated ITO substrate by varying the RF-sputtering time and used for the fabrication of flexible PSCs. The photovoltaic properties revealed that flexible PSC performance is strongly dependent on the TiO2 ETL thickness. The open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) are directly proportional to the TiO2 ETL thickness while the 50 nm thick TiO2 ETL shows the highest current density (JSC) of 20.77 mA cm−2. Our controlled results reveal that the room temperature RF-magnetron sputtered 50 nm-thick TiO2 ETL photoelectrode exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) in excess of 15%. The use of room temperature synthesis of the compact TiO2 ETL by RF magnetron sputtering results in an enhancement of the device performance for cells prepared on flexible substrates. The champion flexible planar PSC based on this architecture exhibited a promising power conversion efficiency as high as 15.88%, featuring a high FF of 0.69 and VOC of 1.108 V with a negligible hysteresis under AM 1.5 G illumination. Furthermore, the mechanical bending stability revealed that the fabricated devices show stable PCE up to 200 bending cycles. The interface properties revealed that the 50 nm thick TiO2 ETL provides superior charge injection characteristics and low internal resistance. The present work provides a simplistic and reliable approach for the fabrication of highly efficient stable flexible perovskite solar cells.
1. Introduction
The manufacture of flexible efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is one of the most promising tasks in commercial photovoltaic technology. PSCs are mainly divided into two categories: the planar type (without an mp-TiO2/Al2O3 scaffold) and the mesoscopic type (with an mp-TiO2/Al2O3 scaffold).1–5 Recently, solar cells based on methylammonium mixed halide (MAPbX) and formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbX) have achieved 16.2%3 and 21.1%2 power conversion efficiencies (PCE), respectively. Negligible hysteresis via the optimization of each layer, an extremely uniform and dense structure via toluene dripping, tuning of the band gap via composition variation, a long diffusion length (>100 nm) and a high absorption coefficient3–7 are key features of perovskite materials. The synthesis of an electron transporting scaffold (i.e., mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2), Al2O3, ZnO or Zn2SnO4) sensitized with an organometallic halide perovskite absorber and its optimization are typically the necessary steps in the creation of perovskite sensitized solar cells.5,8,9 The metal oxide photoelectrode or electron transporting layer (ETL), a perovskite absorbing layer, a hole transporting layer (HTL) and a counter electrode (Au) are the key components of perovskite solar cells.
We have previously attempted the low temperature growth of 1D TiO2 (<180 °C) nanorods and passivation by an ALD technique.5 However, due to the strong acidic medium of the precursor solution (HCl:H2O, 1:1 v/v) it is impossible to grow 1D TiO2 on glass/ITO or PET/ITO substrates. To date, low temperature solution processed metal oxides ZnO,10,11 TiO2,12 graphene/TiO2 nanocomposites,13 and atomic layer deposited (ALD) compact ZnO14 or TiOx/TiO215,16 layers have been used as electron transporting layers (ETLs), and spiro-OMeTAD,17 poly(triarylamine) (PTAA),18 copper thiocyanate (CuSCN),19,20 and CuI21 have been used as hole transporting layers (HTLs) for PSCs. Yu et al.22 synthesized different morphologies of Bl-TiO2 by magnetron sputtering (MS), spray pyrolysis (SP) and spin coating (SC) techniques and demonstrated 15.93, 13.01 and 10.87% efficiency for MAPbI3 based non-flexible perovskite solar cells. However, only a few low temperature processed ETLs have been used for flexible PSCs and demonstrated >10% efficiency.23,24 In the case of inverted p-i-n type PSCs, conducting polymers (CoPs) such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) have been widely used as the HTL25 and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) has been used as the ETL for flexible PSCs.26 In the first case (n-i-p type PSCs), with ETLs such as TiO2, Al2O3, or ZrO2 scaffolds, the optimization of the ETL thickness, crystallinity and uniformity is a major issue, whereas in the second case (p-i-n type PSCs), the optimization of the PCBM ETL layer27 is a difficult task. Therefore, there is a need to find the perfect solution for the compact and uniform deposition of ETL photoelectrodes for flexible PSCs. In the present investigation, we have used RF magnetron sputtering for the synthesis of a compact and amorphous TiO2 ETL layer and used it in flexible PSCs. Furthermore, the thickness of the ETL layer has been varied from 30 nm to 100 nm, and the recombination rate and transport collection efficiency have been controlled. This technique facilitates the pinhole free deposition of crystalline TiO2 at room temperature. This technique also provides control of thickness at room temperature, which blocks the unwanted back reaction for perovskite solar cells. Therefore, the fabrication of flexible PSCs using RF-magnetron-sputtered ETLs enables a new approach towards efficient flexible PSCs.
Recently, Jung et al. synthesized a TiOx layer by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique and used it in a flexible PSC with a 12.2% power conversion efficiency (PCE). The authors showed that the 20 nm-thick amorphous, compact TiOx layer deposited by atomic layer deposition attributed to fast electron transport.16 Snaith et al. demonstrated 15.4% PCE by the vapor-phase deposition of a perovskite material.7 However, devices made by using this process suffer from high interfacial resistances and low fill factors. Recently, Liu et al. demonstrated a high conversion efficiency (15.7%) for a flexible PSC using solution processed ZnO nanoparticles at 65 °C.10 Seok et al. demonstrated 16.2% PCE using an extremely uniform and dense CH3NH3Pb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskite absorbing layer in a γ-butyrolactone (GBL) and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) mixed solvent followed by a toluene drop-casting process.3 Here, we have combined the benefits of an RF-sputtered TiO2 ETL and the CH3NH3I–PbI2–DMSO intermediate phase via solvent engineering technology.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no single report available on an RF-magnetron sputtered compact TiO2 ETL for flexible PSCs. Motivated by the desire to further simplify the processing techniques of the flexible PSCs, we have studied the room temperature deposited TiO2 ETL. The compact TiO2 layer can be deposited at room temperature by RF magnetron sputtering; therefore, this technique is very useful for thermally sensitive substrates. The approach is to overcome the experimental hurdles and to form the desired TiO2 in an easy and cost effective manner for use in PV technology.28 This TiO2 ETL enables fast electron transport due to its compact nature, perfect isolation between the perovskite layer and the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) and a high fill factor. The compact amorphous TiO2 layer was deposited by RF sputtering with an approximately 5–8 nm grain size, as determined by FESEM analysis (SEM, Fig. S1†). The thickness of the blocking TiO2 (Bl-TiO2) has been varied systematically by controlling the deposition time. However, the uniformity of the TiO2 layer is the same for all samples.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Surface topography and XRD analyses of Bl-TiO2
The effect of different blocking layers on planar heterojunction PSCs has been systematically studied. In the present configuration, TiO2 ETLs were synthesized at high, low and room temperature and used in MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 based PSCs. The detailed experimental procedure for the deposition of Bl-TiO2 is given in the Experimental section. Detailed top-cross sectional FESEM and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) analyses of Bl-TiO2 are given in Fig. S1 and S2,† respectively. All samples show a compact deposition of Bl-TiO2 on different substrates (Fig. S1a–f†). From FESEM micrographs of RF-magnetron sputtered Bl-TiO2 it is clear that a uniform, highly dense and smooth TiO2 grain was obtained for all thicknesses. It is also noticed that the grain size of TiO2 slightly increases with the increase in sputtering time. It is believed that the layer has a higher degree of compactness along with smaller particles, therefore the 50 nm thick sample shows more compactness which is beneficial for a higher PCE. The thicknesses of the RF-magnetron sputtered Bl-TiO2 samples were confirmed by recording cross sectional FESEM images (Fig. S1g–i†). For comparison we have also deposited Bl-TiO2 by the traditional spin coating technique and recorded GIXRD patterns. The Bl-TiO2 processed by the traditional high temperature method exhibits a crystalline nature (Fig. S2a†), whereas the sol–gel samples have an amorphous nature (Fig. S2b†). The GIXRD analysis of the RF-magnetron sputtered Bl-TiO2 sample revealed an amorphous nature with excellent transmittance (Fig. S2c and d†). Further surface chemistry of the TiO2 ETL layers was characterized by XPS analysis. Fig. S3† presents the core level spectra of Ti 2p and O 1s spectra of the TiO2 compact layer deposited by different deposition techniques. At a glance it is clear that all samples show defect free Ti 2p and O 1s levels. The solution processed a large amount of hydroxyl groups (OH–) at 531.28 eV compared to traditional Bl-TiO2 and the RF-sputtered TiO2 compact layer. These OH− species arise due to an organic compound which hinders the electron injection and fast transportation. Therefore, in the present case our sol–gel processed sample shows a lower PCE.
2.2 Synthesis of a uniform MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 layer by the solvent engineering process
Initially, we prepared compact ETLs with different thicknesses by RF-magnetron sputtering onto patterned PET/ITO and glass/ITO substrates. These photoelectrodes were used for the deposition of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0, 0.1, 1). The MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0, 0.1, 1) solution was prepared in a GBL/DMSO (7:3 v/v) solvent and spin cast in two steps at 1000 rpm and 4500 rpm. During the second spin coating step, one drop of toluene was dripped onto the substrate. For the γ-GBL/DMSO solvent evaporation and crystallization of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3, the spin-coated samples were dried on a hot plate; later, these samples were used in further processes. The phase confirmation of the prepared perovskite was carried out by GIXRD analysis. The different compositions of the perovskites such as MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, and MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 deposited on the glass substrates were used for the XRD analysis. Fig. 1 shows the GIXRD patterns of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0, 0.3, 1) mixed halide perovskites. The MAPbI3 samples correspond to the (110), (112), (211), (202), (220), (310), (312), (224), (411) and (330) orientations at 14.04°, 19.93°, 23.52°, 24.55°, 28.42°, 30.99°, 31.93°, 40.34°, 42.49° and 43.25°, respectively, of the tetragonal crystal structure.5
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of MAPbI3, MAPbBr3 and MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 thin films. For comparison, we have used MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3. The 27–31° region is magnified in the inset. 
The XRD pattern of the MAPbBr3 sample showed that it had a highly crystalline cubic phase. The lattice parameter of the corresponding cubic phase of the MAPbBr3 perovskite was found to be a = 5.9334(5) Å (a = 5.94173 Å, space group = Pmm).29 To analyze the MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 phase, we have evaluated the peak position of the (220) peak. The characteristic perovskite peak at 2θ = 28.42° (for MAPbI3) is shifted to a larger angle due to the addition of the Br.30 This peak originates mainly from the iodide. Therefore, this peak is absent in the MAPbBr3 sample. Moreover, MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 shows a significant broadening of the (220) reflection (inset, Fig. 1). This is due to the distortion of the tetragonal phase of pure MAPbI3. However, the other peaks show similar reflections; therefore, the deposited MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 sample has a pseudo-tetragonal unit cell with a I4cm symmetry. Moreover, as the Br content increases, the intensity of the (220) peak increases.31

Fig. 2 illustrates the process for the synthesis of flexible PSCs from RF-sputtered TiO2 on gold contacts. The process involves six stages, and each stage is simple with a process temperature below 100 °C (for more details, please see experimental details). Fig. 3(a) shows the FESEM image of the MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 thin film after drying at 100 °C deposited on the 50 nm Bl-TiO2 electrode deposited on the PET substrate. Fig. 3(a) shows that the dense grains of the MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 thin film with sizes of 100–400 nm have been formed. The entire film is composed of a homogeneous, well crystallized perovskite layer. As seen in the two-dimensional and three-dimensional AFM images, the root mean square roughness value for the crystalline perovskite layer is 7.124 nm (Fig. 3(b and c)), which is much less than those of the sample without dripped toluene (22.234 nm) (Fig. S4†) and the Bl-TiO2 processed at high temperature (15.653 nm) (Fig. S5†). Without the toluene drip treatment, the sample exhibited an inhomogeneous fiber-like morphology that does not fully cover the substrate, whereas the toluene-dripped spin-coated sample exhibits a highly uniform morphology, low surface roughness (7.124 nm) and full coverage by a transparent layer of the perovskite. Due to the crystalline nature of the perovskite and its large grains, the perovskite interfaces between the perovskite and spiro-MeOTAD also improved. The large gains facilitate the low grain boundaries and low recombination rate which is offered by highly uniform RF-sputtered Bl-TiO2 and solvent engineering processed mixed halide. Further elemental analysis of the MAPb(I3−xBrx)3 perovskite has been proved that the products after annealing show the atomic percentage of Pb, I and Br close to 1:2.7:0.3 respectively (details of energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurement can be found in Fig. S6†).

(b) AFM topography top view and (c) three-dimensional views of the surface of the MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0.1) thin film deposited on the PET/ITO/TiO2 substrate. The size of the AFM images is 5 × 5 μm2. The measured root mean square (RMS) roughness is 7.124 nm. 
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the different perovskite solar cells, including the flexible devices, are plotted in Fig. 4(a). The Bl-TiO2 device on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate (high temperature) has a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 21.22 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.120 V, and fill factor (FF) of 0.70, leading to a PCE of η = 16.64%. For comparison, we have prepared a sample of TiO2 on a PET/ITO substrate by a low-temperature sol–gel spin-coating process followed by soft annealing. The TiO2 sol–gel processed sample has 3.04% conversion efficiency with JSC = 12.13 mA cm−2, FF = 0.29 and VOC = 0.867 V. The TiO2 deposited by the sol–gel process on a glass/ITO substrate has 5.47% conversion efficiency with JSC = 16.64 mA cm−2, FF = 0.31 and VOC = 1.060 V. However, the same sample deposited on an FTO substrate has JSC = 17.53 mA cm−2, FF = 0.32 and VOC = 1.091 V, leading to a PCE of η = 6.12%. The RF-sputtered 30 nm-thick Bl-TiO2 photoelectrode on a PET/ITO substrate has VOC = 1.047 V, JSC = 20.58 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.52, resulting in a PCE of η = 11.20%. The VOC and FF of this sample is relatively low and may be due to partial isolation between the PTAA and the ITO layer. However, the samples with a 50 nm-thick layer show a drastic increase in VOC to 1.113 V. Similarly the FF of the 30 nm thick sample exhibited a low FF of 0.52 compared to the 50 nm thick TiO2 (0.70). This increase may be attributed to the increased electrical isolation between the PTAA and the ITO substrate. When the HTL is directly in contact with the ITO substrate, the cell exhibits ohmic behavior. Moreover, the values of JSC = 20.02 mA cm−2, FF = 0.70 and η = 15.53% are also increased. Similarly, we have deposited 50 nm-thick TiO2 on a glass/ITO substrate. This sample shows VOC = 1.113 V, JSC = 20.77 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.69, leading to a PCE of η = 15.59%. These results reveal that the flexible and non-flexible devices show almost the same PCE. With a further increment in thickness, the 100 nm-thick Bl-TiO2 sample exhibited VOC = 1.144 V, JSC = 17.69 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.71, leading to 13.99% conversion efficiency.

The J–V characteristics were measured under the 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G illumination. (b) Energy band diagrams of ITO, Bl-TiO2 and MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskite absorbing layers. The band gap of the mixed halide perovskite MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 has been calculated using the equation Eg(x) = 1.57 + 0.39x + 0.33x2, where Eg is the band gap of the perovskite in eV and x is the amount of Br relative to the amount of I.31 All layer thicknesses are not up to scale. (c) Nyquist plots of selected perovskite solar cells in the open circuit state recorded in the dark. 
Here, the FF of the device increased from 0.69 to 0.71, but the current density decreased drastically for the 100 nm thick Bl-TiO2 sample. This is due to the thick amorphous nature of the TiO2 layer, which hinders the electron flow. As per the above discussion, Fig. 4(b) shows schematic energy diagrams of flexible PSCs based on RF-magnetron sputtered (30, 50 and 100 nm) Bl-TiO2 ETLs. The band gap of the mixed halide perovskite MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 has been calculated using the equation Eg(x) = 1.57 + 0.39x + 0.33x2, where Eg is the band gap of the perovskite in eV and x is the amount of Br relative to the amount of I.31 Increasing the thickness of the amorphous TiO2 layer caused a too high series resistance between the perovskite absorbing layer and ITO. This indicates that the thickness of Bl-TiO2 plays a key role in the performance of PSCs. From the above observation, it is clear that the sample with the 50 nm-thick TiO2 layer exhibits the highest average PCE of 15.56% and an FF of 0.69. Furthermore, it was also observed that the FF of the 50 and 100 nm TiO2 ETL based devices was 70%, which is much higher than that for the 30 nm sample. This represents the compactness of Bl-TiO2 having 50 nm or 100 nm thickness. This enhancement is mainly due to the decreased back-reaction and lower recombination rate. The 100 nm thick amorphous nature of TiO2 limited the electron transport, therefore the current density of 100 nm TiO2 has been decreased up to 16.79 mA cm−2.
The hysteresis analysis of samples of the optimized device structure formed with and without toluene dripping is presented in Fig. S7(c and d).†
The flexible perovskite solar cell formed without dripped toluene exhibits PCE values of 8.38% and 10.63% for the forward and reverse scans, respectively. The parameters of the forward scan are VOC = 0.984 V, JSC = 17.40 mA cm−2, FF = 0.49%, and η = 8.38%. The reverse scan exhibits a small increment in the PCE to 10.63% (VOC = 1.005 V, JSC = 18.25 mA cm−2, FF = 0.58) (Table S1†). The toluene-dripped sample exhibits PCE values of 14.96% and 15.59% for the forward and reverse scans, respectively. The forward scan exhibits VOC = 1.069 V, JSC = 20.59 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.68%, with η = 14.96% (Table S2†). The reverse scan exhibits a small increment in the PCE to 15.59%, with VOC = 1.113 V, JSC = 20.77 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.69 (Table S2†). From the hysteresis study, it is clear that the toluene-dripped flexible perovskite solar cells show negligible hysteresis with an average PCE of 15.45%.
The solid state impedance spectroscopy (ssIS) analyses were performed in the dark on these devices to further understand the effect of Bl-TiO2. Fig. 4(c) presents the Nyquist plot measured at a voltage bias of 0.9 V. In this Nyquist plot, the semicircle at high frequencies vanishes for all perovskite devices due to the very thin TiO2 films employed. It is also well known that the Rrec is inversely proportional to the electron recombination rate. Therefore, the simplified circuit model, shown in the inset of Fig. 4(c), represents the case in which no transmission line (TL) is observed. In solar cells with perovskite absorbers, the dominant electron loss pathway is the recombination of electrons from the titanium dioxide film with the holes from the conductor.32 This recombination lowers the steady state electron density in the TiO2 film, thus affecting the open-circuit potential of the device. The impedance semi-circle corresponds to the internal resistance of the interface between the TiO2 and the perovskite absorbing layer. The diameter of the semi-circle of the Bl-TiO2 sample is smaller than those of the sol–gel processed devices, indicating the slower recombination rate and smaller internal resistance. However, the diameter is smaller for the 50 nm RF-sputtered TiO2 sample than for both the Bl-TiO2 (30 nm) and TiO2 sol–gel samples. This indicates that the 50 nm Bl-TiO2 possesses superior charge injection characteristics and low internal resistance. Furthermore it is also observed that the sol–gel processed TiO2 ETL based flexible devices show lower FF compared to the rest of the devices. This may arise due to the high recombination rate and the OH− organic compound which hinder the electron injection and fast transportation.

Fig. 5(a) shows the device architecture of a champion planar heterojunction flexible perovskite solar cell comprising a perovskite absorbing layer MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 sandwiched between the ETL and HTL. Here, the TiO2 ETL was prepared by the RF-sputtering technique onto a PET/ITO electrode. The HTL poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) and gold (Au) metal were next deposited on the active layer by spin coating and thermal evaporation as a hole-transporting material and photocathode, respectively. The active absorbing layer of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 was deposited on Bl-TiO2 by the spin coating technique from a precursor solution containing MAI, PbI2, MABr and PbBr2 in the desired amounts.

(d) IPCE spectrum for the champion 50 nm RF-sputtered Bl-TiO2 ETL having an MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskite absorbing layer. The inset photograph shows bended flexible PSCs. The integrated JSC value was calculated to be 19.97 mA cm−2. The IPCE data were collected in constant-energy direct current mode with a delay time of 10 ms under a light intensity of 50 μW cm−2. 
In this device architecture, the compactness of the Bl-TiO2 and the crystallinity and uniformity of the active MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 absorbing layer are extremely important. Fig. 5(b) shows the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a champion perovskite cell device with a planar heterojunction structure. In Fig. 5(b), we can observe the compact and uniform Bl-TiO2 with a thickness of 50 nm deposited on an ITO substrate. The dense-grained uniform morphology of the MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 absorbing layer has been observed. An MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 absorbing layer with a thickness of nearly 300 nm and the uniform deposition of a 180 nm PTAA HTM layer have been observed in the present device architecture. The J–V characteristics of the optimized flexible device are plotted in Fig. 5(c). The optimized flexible device achieved 15.88% PCE at JSC = 20.77 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.108 V and FF = 0.69 (Table 1). It is noteworthy that this flexible perovskite solar cell exhibits a photovoltaic performance similar to that of typical glass substrate-based perovskite solar cells. The best device showed a very broad IPCE plateau of up to 80% between 400 and 700 nm, as shown in Fig. 5(d). The inset of Fig. 5(d) shows a photographic image of an actual bent flexible perovskite device based on the MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskite material.

a Measurements of the thickness of the Bl-TiO2 layer deposited by sputtering directly on the glass/ITO and PET/ITO substrates with the help of cross section are difficult. However we have measured these values by monitoring a quartz thickness monitor placed close to the substrates in the sputtering chamber. Several samples were deposited under each set of RF-sputtering conditions, and the reported values correspond to the average values for 20 samples. Please consider the error to be ±5 nm for all RF-magnetron sputtered TiO2 blocking layers.

This device was further used for studying the hysteresis behavior. The study of the hysteresis behavior of the fabricated devices was carried out with a 40 ms scanning delay. The reverse (from the VOC to the short-circuit current (ISC)) and forward (from ISC to VOC) modes have been used. Fig. 6(a) shows the J–V curves recorded under forward and reverse bias conditions. The inset table summarizes the extracted JSC, VOC and FF parameters. The champion flexible perovskite solar cell exhibits PCE values of 14.96% and 15.59% for the forward and reverse scans, respectively. The forward scan exhibits VOC = 1.069 V, JSC = 20.59 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.68%, with η = 14.96%. The reverse scan exhibits a small increment in PCE to 15.59% (VOC = 1.113 V, JSC = 20.77 mA cm−2, FF = 0.69). From the hysteresis study, it is clear that the flexible perovskite solar cells with the 50 nm Bl-TiO2 show negligible hysteresis with an average PCE of 15.45%, indicating the reliability of the I–V measurement. Fig. 6(b) shows a histogram of the average PCEs for 50 nm-thick flexible PSCs fabricated independently. Nearly 80% of the cells fabricated based on the 50 nm ETL exhibited >15% PCE. These results demonstrate the key role of the optimized 50 nm-thick TiO2 ETL. To demonstrate the mechanical bending stability of the flexible PSC device, a bending test was performed taking into account the number of bending cycles and radius of curvature. Here we have fixed the radius of curvature at 10 mm. After each bending cycle, we have measured the JV performance which is presented in Fig. 6(c). The PCE exhibited no significant decrease in efficiency even after 200 bending cycles. Furthermore, we have studied the current stability of champion devices. Fig. 7 shows the photocurrent stability of glass/ITO/perovskite/PTAA/Au and PET/ITO/perovskite/PTAA/Au devices under stable light illumination.

 Fig. 7  Photocurrent stability of champion devices fabricated on glass as well as a flexible PET substrate. 
From Fig. 7 it clear that both devices show dramatic increment in the initial few seconds and reached up to 22.1 mA cm−2 and 19.56 mA cm−2 respectively for rigid and flexible devices. However, slow increment and stable behaviour has been observed in the latter case. It is also observed that these values are close to the PCE obtained from the J–V measurement which is in good agreement with the stability of our fabricated flexible devices. The photocurrent stability results show negligible variation in their performance.
3. Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a room temperature processed uniform and compact TiO2 ETL for a low temperature (<100 °C) processed MAPb(I1−xBrx)3-based flexible perovskite solar cell with a 15.88% PCE under standard conditions (AM 1.5 G radiation, 100 mW cm−2). The present methodology is very compatible with low temperature substrates because it does not suffer from the use of an mp-TiO2 scaffold processed at high temperature or any other high temperature processing steps. An extremely uniform (RMS: 7.114 nm) and crystalline MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskite absorbing layer with approximately 300–400 nm grain size has been prepared from a GBL/DMSO (7:3 v/v) solvent via the toluene dripping technique. This architecture provides a uniform MAPb(I1−xBrx)3/PTAA interface and low boundaries with the best mechanical bending flexibility. The hysteresis issue has been addressed by investigating film thickness and the optimized 50 nm-thick Bl-TiO2 layer deposited uniformly via the RF magnetron sputtering technique shows negligible hysteresis. By studying the ETL layer deposition techniques, it was found that the RF magnetron sputtering technique facilitates enhanced charge transport, mechanical flexibility and large scale application in flexible solar cell technology. The best optimized conditions of RF magnetron sputtering for the PET/ITO/Bl-TiO2/MAPb(I1−xBrx)3/PTAA/Au device result in a device with a 15.88% PCE and excellent bending durability.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Synthesis of TiO2 layers by RF-magnetron sputtering
Initially, laser-patterned, ITO- and FTO-coated glass substrates (TEC15, Pilkington) were cleaned by ultrasonication in an alkaline, aqueous washing solution, and then rinsed with deionized water and ethanol. The PET/ITO substrates were cleaned only with detergent and ethanol. TiO2 thin films of different thicknesses were fabricated using radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering on a flexible indium-doped tin oxide (ITO)-coated conducting glass and/or PET substrates with a sheet resistance of 20 Ω cm−2. A pure titanium metal target (Ti) with an area of 2 cm2 and 99.99% purity was used for sputtering. The sputtering chamber was initially evacuated to 2.2 × 10−6 Torr and then maintained at 10 mTorr by flowing Ar and O2 gases during sputtering. During deposition, the Ar to O2 gas flow rate ratio was set to 8:2 (20% oxygen). The samples were deposited at room temperature with an applied power of 130 W. TiO2 films with three thicknesses of 30, 50 and 100 nm were grown by adjusting the sputtering time and using a quartz thickness monitor placed close to the substrates in the sputtering chamber. The growth rate of the TiO2 film was 0.5 Å per cycle.
The highly uniformly deposited Bl-TiO2 layers on glass/ITO and PET/ITO substrates with different thicknesses (30, 50 and 100 nm) using RF magnetron sputtering at room temperature have been used as an alternative ETL to the conventional methods. The deposited PET/ITO/Bl-TiO2 and/or glass/ITO/Bl-TiO2 substrates were transferred into a nitrogen filled glove-box for MAPb(I3−xBrx)3 perovskite deposition. Second, a desired mixture of MAI, MABr, PbI2, or PbBr2 in GBL and DMSO solvent was dripped onto the PET/ITO/Bl-TiO2 (1.5 × 1.5 cm2) surface. This substrate was then spun in a spin-coater at speeds of 1000 rpm (10 s) and 4000 rpm (40 s). Third, a solvent that is immiscible with the perovskite materials, such as toluene, was dripped onto the substrate during spin coating. Fourth, the uniformly deposited MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 thin film was dried on a hot plate to obtain crystalline MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskite materials. Fifth, the HTM material (PTAA) from the toluene solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm at room temperature. Finally, the device was completed by the deposition of an 80 nm thin Au contact using thermal evaporation.
4.2 Synthesis of Bl-TiO2 by a chemical method
All chemicals for the preparation of the flexible perovskite solar cells were of reagent grade and were used without further purification. In the present case, we have also used three different types of ETL electrodes. The first is Bl-TiO2 processed at high temperature (non-flexible PSC) and the second is TiOx formed by the sol–gel process (flexible PSC) for comparison. Compact TiO2 layers of approximately 50 nm thick were deposited on the FTO substrates by spin coating of 0.15 M and 0.3 M commercial titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetyl acetonate) solution (75% in 2-propanol, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in ethanol (1:39, volume ratio) as the precursor and subsequently annealed in air at 450 °C for 30 min. The sol–gel synthesis of TiOx was performed as per the previous literature with few modifications.33 Briefly, titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4, Aldrich, 99.999%, 10 ml) was prepared as a precursor and mixed with 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, Aldrich, 99.9+%, 50 ml) and ethanolamine (H2NCH2CH2OH, Aldrich, 99+%, 5 ml) in a three-necked flask equipped with a condenser, a thermometer, and a nitrogen-gas inlet/outlet. Then, the mixed solution was heated to 80 °C for 2 h with magnetic stirring followed by heating to 120 °C for 1 h. The two-step heating (80 and 120 °C) was then repeated. The typical TiOx precursor solution was prepared in isopropyl alcohol and spin cast onto PET/ITO substrates.
4.3 Preparation of methylammonium lead trihalides (MAPbX3)
Methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) and methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) were synthesized as per our previous reports.5,9,29 The CH3NH3I (MAI) and CH3NH3Br (MABr) were first synthesized by reacting 27.86 ml methylamine (CH3NH2) (40% in methanol, Junsei Chemical) and 30 ml hydroiodic acid (HI) (57 wt% in water, Aldrich) or 44 ml hydrobromic acid (HBr) (48 wt% in water, Aldrich), respectively, in a 250 ml round-bottom flask in an ice cold solution for 2 h with stirring, followed by solvent evaporation using a rotary evaporator (95 mbar vacuum, 400 rpm rotation) at 60 °C. The resulting white solid product MAI/MABr was dissolved in ethanol and recrystallized using diethyl ether. The fresh fine white crystals were washed three times using diethyl ether and then dried in a vacuum for 24 h. The MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving the desired amounts of MAI, MABr, lead iodide (PbI2) and lead bromide (PbBr2) (Aldrich, 99.999%) in anhydrous γ-butyrolactone (GBL) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich) (7:3 v/v) at 60 °C overnight. The clear filtered yellow solution was spin coated on the top of the Bl-TiO2 samples by a consecutive two-step spin-coating process at 1000 and 5000 rpm for 10 and 40 s, respectively. One drop of toluene was drop-cast during the second spin-coating step followed by a heat treatment on a hot plate for 10 min to form dark-brown colored crystalline MAPb(I1−xBrx)3. The hole transport material (HTM) was prepared by the standard procedure reported elsewhere.3 15 mg poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA, EM Index, Mw = 17500 g mol−1) in toluene (1.5 ml) was mixed with 15 μl of a solution of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI, 99.95%, Aldrich) (170 mg cm−1) in acetonitrile (1 ml) and 7.5 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%, Aldrich) and spin-coated on the glass/ITO/Bl-TiO2/MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Then, the substrates were transferred to a vacuum chamber and subsequently evacuated to a pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar. For the Au counter electrode, an 80 nm-thick Au layer was deposited on the top of the HTM over layer by thermal evaporation (growth rate approximately 0.5 Å s−1) at a pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar. The active areas of all devices were 0.03 cm2.
4.4 Characterization
High resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) measurements were carried out using a D/MAX Ultima III XRD spectrometer (Rigaku, Japan) with the Cu K line at 1.5410 Å. The cross-sectional images were recorded by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; S-4700, Hitachi). The cells were illuminated using a solar simulator at AM 1.5 G for 10 s, for which the light intensity was adjusted to 1 sun intensity (100 mW cm−2) through the use of an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-5 filter. The IPCE spectra were measured as a function of wavelength from 300 to 900 nm using a Spectral Products DK240 monochromator. All IPCE spectra were normalized to the measured J–V current for accurate comparison. The IPCE data were collected in the constant energy DC mode with a delay time of 10 ms and a light intensity of 50 μW cm−2. Solid state impedance spectroscopy (ssIS) was conducted using an IviumStat (Ivium Technologies B.V., Eindhoven, the Netherlands) under open-circuit conditions at frequencies ranging from 10−1 to 105 Hz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV. Z-view 2.8d (Scribner Associates) was used to fit the IS spectra to the equivalent circuit based on the transmission line model. The DC bias potential was applied in 0.05 V step intervals.
