    , Accepted 28th October 2015First published on 2nd November 2015AbstractIn a mesoporous hybrid perovskite solar cell (PSC), the mesoporous scaffold plays key roles in controlling the crystallization of the perovskite material and in the charge carrier transport, and hence is critical for developing highly efficient PSCs. Here we report a study on blending micrometer-long TiO2 nanorods (NRs) into the commonly used nanoparticles (NPs) to optimize the mesoporous structure, with the aim of enhancing the perovskite material loading and connectivity as well as light harvesting. It was found that with 5–10% of NR incorporation, a uniform scaffold can be spin-coated and the PSC performance was improved. In comparison to the pure NP-based device, the power conversion efficiency was increased by about 27% when 10% of the NRs were incorporated, due to enhanced light harvesting and charge collection. However, with more NR blending, a homogeneous scaffold cannot be formed, resulting in PSC performance degradation. These findings contribute to a better design of mesoporous scaffolds for high-performance PSCs.
Introduction
Organometal halide based PSCs are attracting intensive interest towards the development of a new generation of photovoltaic (PV) technologies.1–4 In the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite material, the organic component renders the material solution-processing capability and facilitates self-assembly for crystallization, while the inorganic component forms an extended framework through covalent/ionic bonds, which enables the preservation of a precise crystal structure in the film, ensuring good optoelectronic properties.5,6 Such hybrid photoactive materials are promising for developing PV technology that combines the merits of the cost-effective production of organic PV and high efficiency of inorganic PV.
The efficiency of PSCs has been dramatically improved in the past few years with a demonstrated power conversion efficiency of ∼20%. This potentially puts PSC technology in direct competition with the traditional semiconductor thin-film and even crystalline Si PV technologies. Nevertheless there is still enough room for further study and improvement. One aspect is related to the commonly used mesoporous scaffold structure. Of the two basic types of PSC device structures,7,8 although planar PSCs have a simpler structure, the best certified power conversion efficiency has been limited to the mesoporous device structure.9,10 In contrast to the planar film formation, the scaffold (e.g., TiO2 nanostructures) used in the mesoporous device can greatly facilitate the nucleation and growth of perovskites and avoid the formation of pinholes to suppress internal device shunting. In addition, the mesoporous TiO2 scaffold seems to have an effect in suppressing the hysteresis behavior that is generally more severe in the planar structure.11–13 Therefore, as alternatives to the commonly used TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) based scaffold, other nanostructured electron transport materials, such as vertically aligned TiO2 nanorods,14–17 3D TiO2 nanowires18,19 or dendrites,20 TiO2 nanotubes,21 and ZnO nanowires22–24 have been investigated. Most of these efforts emphasized the enhanced electron transport in an aligned wire or tube based scaffold structure, similar to those for dye-sensitized solar cells.25–28 However, the scaffold of PSCs plays roles other than just for electron transport. Therefore, engineering the scaffold and comparing its performance will benefit the further development of high-performance PSCs.
A typical mesoporous PSC structure is illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The mesoporous scaffold controls the photoactive perovskite layer formation by allowing the infiltration of precursor solution and confining the perovskite crystallites in the tiny volume of nanopores. It is important that the infiltrated perovskite forms a continuous network in the scaffold by avoiding voids or dead volumes so that photon-generated electrons and holes can both be collected. This is not only critical for holes, since they must be transported through perovskite to the hole transport material (HTM), but is also useful for electrons. It is because electron injection into the TiO2 scaffold might be slow,29 and a continuous perovskite network in the scaffold may facilitate direct electron collection in addition to electron transport in the TiO2 scaffold. Furthermore, the crystal properties of perovskite formed within a mesoporous structure might be different from the crystal formed without a porous scaffold.30 Pore-filling with perovskite to reduce charge recombination from TiO2 and HTM was also reported.31 However, poor pore-filling by perovskite often occurs due to the convoluted nanoscale porous channels within the scaffold.21 Therefore, further optimizing the scaffold structure may contribute to further improvement of the PSC performance. The commonly used TiO2 NP scaffold is formed by the spin-coating of NP colloids with a typical size of around 20 nm. As schematically illustrated in Fig. 1(b), such a NP-based scaffold could have a very tortuous pore connectivity and limited pore volume, prohibiting a large perovskite material from loading and a well-connected perovskite network. In addition, to maintain a thin perovskite layer for efficient charge collection, photon management and light harvesting is a second issue, since the tiny NPs cannot provide effective light scattering. It is envisioned that if larger size components are introduced into the NP based scaffold, these two issues, the pore volume and connectivity and photon management might be relieved. As illustrated in Fig. 1(c), when micrometer long nanorods (NRs) are blended with NPs, we expect that the resulting scaffold should be better than the pure NP based one.
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic of a typical mesoporous PSC structure fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass. It consists of an FTO cathode, TiO2 compact layer (C-TiO2), TiO2 mesoporous scaffold, infiltrated perovskite with a capping layer, HTM, and Au (or Ag) anode. Schematics, in a larger magnification, are also shown for the cases of the perovskite-infiltrated pure NP-based mesoporous scaffold in (b) and NP–NR-based scaffold in (c). The large pore volume and light scattering are emphasized in (c). The arrows in (b) and (c) represent light rays, emphasizing no significant light scattering in (b), while NRs can enhance light scattering in (c). 
Herein, a study is presented on structural modifications of the NP-based scaffold by blending TiO2 NRs with NPs in different ratios. Solar cells were made on these porous scaffolds by infiltrating the perovskite material. The structure property and PSC performance was characterized to investigate the effect of incorporating NRs into NPs on the PSC performance.
Experimental methods
TiO2 NRs were synthesized hydrothermally from a 10 M aqueous solution of NaOH and TiO2 powders. In a typical process, 1 g of Degussa P25 powder was added to 75 ml NaOH solution in DI water and mixed thoroughly by stirring. The solution was transferred to a Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave of 100 ml capacity and was kept at 200 °C for 72 hours in an electric oven. After cooling, the product was washed in dilute HCl and then in DI water several times, followed by drying in a vacuum overnight. The produced long TiO2 nanobelts or nanowire powder was further cut into short NRs by applying tip sonication in a solution. The shortened NRs were then dried and ground into fine powder. A solution of acetylacetone in water (1:10 v/v) was added to make a thick paste, which was further diluted by water. A few drops of Triton-X100 were added as surfactant. The NR paste, with a ratio of 5%, 10%, 25%, and 50%, was blended with TiO2 NP paste to form the mesoporous scaffold. TiO2 NP paste was diluted from a screen printing paste32 by adding ethanol to ∼3.5 wt% TiO2.
The PSC fabrication starts with the coating of a TiO2 compact layer of about 20 nm onto a patterned FTO glass substrate as detailed elsewhere.33 The mesoporous scaffold was formed by spin-coating of the blended NP and NR paste. As a reference, a PSC based on a pure NP (0% NR) scaffold was also fabricated following the same procedures. The perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 precursor was made of a 1.4 M equimolar mixture of MAI and PbI2 in γ-butyrolactone (GBL, Aldrich)/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich) (7/3 v/v). The substrate was spun at 4500 rpm for 50 s, and toluene was dispersed as an anti-solvent during the spinning. The perovskite film was further annealed at 85 °C for 10 min. Hole transport material (HTM) was deposited on top of the perovskite film by 4000 rpm for 30 s using 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-dip-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD, Merck) solution, which consists of 80 mg Spiro-OMeTAD, 30 μl bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) stock solution (500 mg Li-TFSI in 1 ml acetonitrile), 30 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), and 1 ml chlorobenzene. Finally, silver metal film was thermally evaporated as a counter electrode.
The microstructures and crystal quality were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The transmission and reflection of TiO2 scaffolds without and with perovskite infiltration were measured to confirm the scattering effect of the large feature size NRs. The PSC performance was characterized using a standard solar simulator. To qualitatively observe the impact of NR incorporation on the charge recombination rate in the subsequently infiltrated perovskite material, open-circuit photovoltage decay (OCVD) was measured for the representative cells. The cell was illuminated by light emitting diodes (LEDs) to establish a steady state open-circuit voltage. After the illumination was stopped, the voltage decay was measured as a function of time.
Results and discussion

Fig. 2(a) shows the morphology of the as synthesized TiO2 nanostructure with a nanobelt or nanowire geometry. The tiny nanowires have a diameter down to the nanometer scale, but the nanobelts can have a width up to hundreds of nanometers and may be considered as nanowire bundles. They have a length of tens of micrometers. In this alkaline solution based hydrothermal synthesis process, it is believed that the 3-D lattice structure of the TiO2 crystalline precursor was first disassembled by breaking down the Ti–O–Ti bonds.34 The resulting TiO6 octahedra share edges and vertices and rearrange into an open 2-D framework, while sodium and hydrogen ions can fill into the interlayer voids, giving a generic structure of NaxH2−xTi3O7·nH2O. Sodium-free hydrogenated titanate was further obtained by an ion-exchange reaction with acid in the HCl washing process.35,36 When the hydrothermal reaction temperature is low, the very thin 2-D framework may wrap into a tubular geometry to saturate dangling bonds and minimize the surface energy. At a higher temperature, such as 200 °C used in this study, the rapid reaction kinetics leads to thicker sheets, giving a nanobelt-like morphology that can be further split into a nanowire shape.37

(c) XRD pattern of TiO2 NRs dispersed on a FTO glass substrate, indicating the dominant anatase phase with a tiny rutile inclusion (*: peaks from the FTO substrate. A: anatase. R: rutile). 
With a high aspect ratio, these long TiO2 nanobelts cannot be dispersed in a spin-coating process to form a uniform mesoporous layer with a thickness of a few hundred nanometers necessary for efficient PSCs. Therefore these as-synthesized TiO2 nanobelts were cut into short NRs using tip sonication. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the resulting NRs have a very reduced length of below one micrometer or so. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to characterize their crystalline phases after annealing at 500 °C on FTO glass. As indicated in Fig. 2(c), these TiO2 nanomaterials have a dominant anatase phase, although a small fraction of rutile phase inclusion does exist after annealing. The crystal phases and the respective planes of TiO2 were identified according to the JCPDS card numbers 21-1272 (anatase) and 21-1276 (rutile).
By mixing these shortened TiO2 NRs with ∼20 nm NPs in different ratios, mesoporous scaffolds were coated onto FTO glass substrates that had a pre-coated TiO2 compact layer. The inclusion of NRs will change the pore geometry and especially widen the nanopores. It is expected that wider pores will yield a larger space to accommodate more perovskite crystals and also enhance their connectivity in the TiO2 matrix.38 SEM images in Fig. 2 compare the surface morphology of these TiO2 mesoporous layers. For a low ratio of NRs (5% and 10%), the included NRs are uniformly mixed and buried in the layer and therefore the film surface still looks uniform and comparable to that of the pure NP based mesoporous layer. However, as the NR concentration increases to 25% and especially to 50%, the surface of these scaffold layers has an unpredictable morphology that varies from clustered NRs to only NPs at different sites. At these high ratios, the layer may even lose continuity at some locations. The resulting morphology variations lead to a wide deviation in the layer thickness. Considering the micrometer length of these NRs and the less than ∼200 nm thickness of the scaffold, it is not unexpected that at a high ratio of NRs, the scaffold quality will be dramatically deteriorated. Similar observations were made from the cross-sectional SEM images of these structures (not shown here). Again, uniform scaffolds are observed for the first three structures (0%, 5%, and 10% NRs), while clusters and non-uniformity are the striking features for the last two structures (25% and 50% NRs) from cross-sectional images. The benefits of blending a small ratio of NRs into the scaffold can be observed by comparing the higher magnification images in Fig. 3(a) and (c). Without deteriorating the scaffold integrity, a small amount of the NRs can dramatically modify the porous structure by enlarging the pore volume and their connectivity.

All images have a scale bar of 100 nm. The insets in (a) and (c) show the detailed surface morphology of 0% and 10% NR based scaffolds, respectively. 
As the NRs possess a much larger feature size than the NPs, at visible and near infrared light wavelength, we expect that the composite of NPs and NRs will scatter the incident light more strongly than pure NPs.39 The diffusive transmission and reflection spectra, and the resulting absorption spectra of three representative mesoporous structures with infiltrated perovskite and 0% NRs, 10% NRs, and 50% NRs were measured and they are presented in Fig. 4. The related spectra of pure mesoporous layers are presented as Fig. S1 in the ESI.† It can be noticed that, in terms of the diffusive transmission (Fig. 4(a)), NR incorporation reduces the transmission in the longer wavelength range (∼500–750 nm), and as more NRs are incorporated, the transmission reduction is more significant. For diffusive reflection (Fig. 4(b)), although there is a slight increase in reflection with NR incorporation at short wavelengths, e.g. the two small peaks at ∼330 nm and ∼380 nm, there is a much more significant reflection suppression by the NRs at a longer wavelength (>∼650 nm). Considering both the transmission and reflection, the absorption, as in Fig. 4(c), is enhanced by NR incorporation, particularly in the longer wavelength range (>∼500 nm). It is noted that a higher NR incorporation will have more of an enhancement effect in terms of light absorption. However, due to the integrity loss of the mesoporous layer for 25% NRs and 50% NRs, the subsequently infiltrated perovskite has a very rough surface and low crystalline quality, as will be confirmed later.
 Fig. 4  The transmission (a), reflectance (b), and absorption (c) of three representative samples with 0% NRs, 10% NRs, and 50% NRs infiltrated with perovskite were measured by an integrating sphere with the light incidence from the FTO glass side. 
The mesoporous scaffolds were impregnated with the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite photoactive material in a one-step spin-coating process, and the perovskite also formed a ∼100 nm thick capping layer on the scaffold. The capping layer greatly enhances light harvesting, and at the same time fully isolates the electron transporting scaffold from the subsequently coated HTM. A thin silver film was then deposited to finish the PSC fabrication. The cross-sectional SEM images of several representative cells are presented in Fig. 5(a–d). With the inclusion of NRs, the infiltrated porous layer looks more compact, with fewer voids, indicating greater pore-filling with perovskites. This will enhance the perovskite network connectivity, facilitating both hole and electron transport. For 5% NR and 10% NR based cells, the perovskite also forms a fairly uniform and continuous overlayer. However, for greater NR ratios (25% and 50%), the continuity and uniformity of the perovskite capping layer and also the HTM layer are abolished by the unfavorable morphology of the TiO2 scaffold. The XRD pattern of the infiltrated perovskite material for 10% NR based scaffolds is presented in Fig. 5(e), in conjunction with that of the compact layer (C-TiO2) and the scaffold layer. Similar TiO2 peaks are found from both the compact and porous films. In addition to those from the substrate, all other peaks can be well indexed to perovskite CH3NH3PbI3.40 The strong perovskite (110) peak at 14.2°, the smaller but significant (220) and (310) peaks at 28.2° and 31.9°, respectively, as well as the absence of a PbI2 peak at 12.5°, prove the complete conversion of the PbI2 and CH3NH3I precursors into CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, and its high crystalline quality. In Fig. 5(f), we compare the XRD pattern of perovskite on all five different scaffolds. The zoomed in plot of the dominant (110) diffraction peak is shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† These samples were measured under the same condition. The diffraction patterns are the same, however, the perovskite diffraction intensity increases from the 0% NR sample to the 5% NR and 10% NR samples, then decreases for the 25% NR and 50% NR samples. For the dominant (110) peak, the relative peak values are 1, 1.12, 1.38, 0.57 and 0.52, respectively. Considering that perovskite coating onto the two scaffolds was implemented using the same recipe, the stronger diffraction intensity from the 5% NR and 10% NR samples suggests that after blending a small portion of the NRs into the scaffold, the morphology change and pore widening resulted in higher perovskite loading with better crystal quality and perovskite connectivity, which will enhance both the light harvesting and charge carrier collection. However, a large amount of NRs in the 25% NR and 50% NR samples destroys the scaffold integrity, somehow resulting in deterioration of the perovskite crystalline quality, as noted from the low diffraction peak intensity and the peak widening.

The prepared PSCs with different NR compositions in the mesoporous scaffold were characterized under a standard solar illumination simulator and the measured J–V curves are shown in Fig. 6(a). The photovoltaic performance of these cells is summarized in Table 1. The PSC of the 0% NR based scaffold exhibits a short circuit current density (JSC) of 19.56 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.03 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.592, giving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.93%. This efficiency was improved to 13.88% when 5% NRs were blended into NPs to form the scaffold, and it was further boosted to 15.15% when 10% NRs were incorporated. The cell with the 10% NRs exhibited the best performance with the highest JSC of 21.18 mA cm−2, the highest VOC of 1.06 V, and the largest FF of 0.675, resulting in 15.15% efficiency. However, when further increasing the NR composition to 25% and 50%, the cell performance dramatically degraded in terms of JSC, VOC, and FF. The much worse performance of the latter two devices is not a surprise considering the loss of uniformity in the scaffold layer as well as the large backward reflection resulting from NR clustering. On the other hand, a small portion (5% and 10%) of NRs, when blended into NPs for the scaffold without destroying its integrity, produces a considerable improvement in the photovoltaic performance, especially in JSC and FF. As expected, the enhanced photocurrent could be attributed to the greater perovskite loading and enhanced connectivity in the mesoporous scaffold that resulted in increased photocarrier generation and facilitated electron and hole carrier transport when 5% and 10% NRs were incorporated, as well as the light scattering introduced by the NRs. For a comparable device configuration, the capturing of more perovskite material translates to a ∼4% and 8% increase in JSC when 5% and 10% NRs are blended. More significantly, the facilitated charge carrier transport by the enhanced pore-filling results in a ∼11% and 14% increase in the PSC fill factor for these two devices. Overall, with 10% NR incorporation, the best photovoltaic performance was demonstrated, with the efficiency increased by 27%. The result suggests that optimizing the mesoporous scaffold structure is a promising option to further improve the PSC efficiency.

Enhancements of JSC and FF of a solar cell can be caused by several factors related to the device fabrication. To confirm that such an enhancement observed in the 5% NR and 10% NR cells is due to the better scaffold structure, which gave better perovskite with reduced charge carrier recombination, the open-circuit photovoltage decay41,42 for two representative cells, 0% NRs and 10% NRs, was measured. Here the monochromatic LED illumination was set so that the obtained VOC is close to that under the standard one solar light. After switching off the illumination, the VOC decay was measured as a function of time, as presented in Fig. 6(b). Initially, both cells have similar VOC (∼0.94 V). After 0.25 s, their VOC decays to 0.70 V and 0.58 V, respectively. After 2.5 s, they are 0.56 V and 0.47 V. Both cells exhibit a slower decay when compared to the literature.41,42 However, here we emphasize that the VOC decay in the 10% NR cell is considerably slower than that of the 0% NR cell. This result confirms that after introducing a small amount of NRs into the mesoporous scaffold to modify the porous structure, the subsequently infiltrated perovskite can have a better crystal quality and better connection, facilitating both hole and electron transport and therefore suppressing the charge recombination.
Conclusion
This work presented a study on the effects of blending different ratios of TiO2 nanorods into nanoparticles to form the mesoporous scaffold for hybrid perovskite solar cells. It was found that up to a certain extent (∼10%), the inclusion of nanorods contribute to large pore formation, allowing greater perovskite loading, improved perovskite crystalline quality, and enhanced perovskite connectivity in the scaffold while maintaining a fairly uniform morphology. The nanorods, with their large feature size, also enhance the perovskite light absorption through the light scattering effect. Such improvement results in the greater power conversion efficiency of the fabricated devices that have a reduced charge recombination rate. However, when the NR ratio is too large, a favorable scaffold layer cannot be formed in the spin-coating process, leading to PSC performance degradation. The results of this study suggest that developing a novel porous architecture with large pores for perovskite accommodation as well as enhancing perovskite connectivity for efficient carrier transport, is one effective option for developing better perovskite solar cells.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic of a typical mesoporous PSC structure fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass. It consists of an FTO cathode, TiO2 compact layer (C-TiO2), TiO2 mesoporous scaffold, infiltrated perovskite with a capping layer, HTM, and Au (or Ag) anode. Schematics, in a larger magnification, are also shown for the cases of the perovskite-infiltrated pure NP-based mesoporous scaffold in (b) and NP–NR-based scaffold in (c). The large pore volume and light scattering are emphasized in (c). The arrows in (b) and (c) represent light rays, emphasizing no significant light scattering in (b), while NRs can enhance light scattering in (c).	 

 	Fig. 2  SEM images of the long nanobelts/nanowires in (a) and short nanorods in (b) (black scale bar: 300 nm). (c) XRD pattern of TiO2 NRs dispersed on a FTO glass substrate, indicating the dominant anatase phase with a tiny rutile inclusion (*: peaks from the FTO substrate. A: anatase. R: rutile).	 

 	Fig. 3  SEM images to compare the surface morphology of the five porous TiO2 scaffolds: (a) pure NPs (0% NRs), (b) 5% NRs, (c) 10% NRs, (d) 25% NRs, and (e) 50% NRs. All images have a scale bar of 100 nm. The insets in (a) and (c) show the detailed surface morphology of 0% and 10% NR based scaffolds, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  The transmission (a), reflectance (b), and absorption (c) of three representative samples with 0% NRs, 10% NRs, and 50% NRs infiltrated with perovskite were measured by an integrating sphere with the light incidence from the FTO glass side.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a–d) Cross-section SEM of the fabricated PSCs based on scaffolds made of 0%, 5%, 10%, and 50% NRs (black scale bar: 100 nm). (e) XRD pattern of the infiltrated perovskite material as well as those of the compact TiO2 layer and a scaffold layer made up of 10% NRs. (f) Comparison of the XRD patterns and diffraction intensities of perovskite formed on all five different scaffolds (* represents FTO peaks).	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) J–V characteristics of the fabricated PSCs based on five different scaffold structures under standard one solar light illumination. (b) VOC decay measurement for two representative cells. The monochromatic light illumination was turned off at t = 0.
