    , Accepted 7th January 2019First published on 8th January 2019AbstractThe morphology and crystalline quality of perovskite layers are crucial to fabricate high efficiency and high stability perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, we investigated how the substrate temperature influences the crystallization process of the mixed-ion perovskite material (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15. The intermediate phase formation, the following perovskite phase transformation, and the film morphology were studied by spin-coating the perovskite material onto hot substrates using microscopy and X-ray diffraction methods. The results show that elevating the substrate temperature alters the morphology of perovskite films from pure dendritic to dendritic/island co-existing structures. The appearance of islands increases the defect density in the perovskite layer and deteriorates the device performance. The substrate temperature has to be controlled in a certain range to form a high crystallinity perovskite layer. The morphology evolution mechanism was also discussed. This work provided a better understanding of the roles of DMSO and temperature in the crystallization process, which will provide more opportunities and guidance for the upscaling of mixed-ion perovskite solar cell manufacturing.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received significant attention due to their simple preparation process and high power conversion efficiency (PCE). The PCE of PSCs has been increased from 3.8% to 23.3% in the past decade.1–6 The typical PSC configuration is that the perovskite optical absorption layer is sandwiched between the electron transport layer (ETL) and hole transport layer (HTL). The crystalline quality of the perovskite film is crucial to the preparation of high efficiency and stable solar cells.7–10
The key to obtaining a pinhole free, highly crystallized perovskite film using conventional spin-coating methods is to form a uniform intermediate phase film and then transform it into the perovskite phase in a very short period of time.11,12 Based on this concept, many methods have been proposed to improve the crystallinity of the perovskite film. A second solvent is introduced into the perovskite precursor solution to form a stable intermediate phase via synergistic effects between the solvent and the PbI2.13–16 Adding anti-solvents during the perovskite layer spin coating can improve the morphology by reducing the solute solubility and thus increasing the nucleation and growth rate of the perovskite materials.17–20 Vacuum treatment was suggested to replace the conventional annealing process to accelerate the solvent evaporation and the phase transformation, thus improving the crystallinity of the perovskite film.21,22 Recently, it has been shown that resting precursor films in a nitrogen glove box for several tens of minutes before annealing can improve the crystalline quality of thin films by controlling the volatilization rate of solvents.23
Recently high efficiency PSCs have been fabricated using the blade-coating technique, showing their great commercial potential for mass production. The PSCs were fabricated at elevated temperatures, and the high quality perovskite layers were obtained by precisely controlling the substrate temperature and correspondingly the volatilization rate of the solvent during the blading process.24,25 Meanwhile, the trick of spin-coating the perovskite layer on heated substrates has been adapted as the standard fabrication process in the lab. However, there are few systematic studies on how the substrate temperature affects the formation of the intermediate phase and the crystallization process of the perovskite film. Pei et al. studied the effects of substrate temperature on the lead iodide (PbI2) coverage in a two-step process to obtain the optimal crystal quality of the perovskite thin film.26 Tidhar et al. studied the effect of PbCl2 on the surface induced nucleation and surface coverage, and found that the morphology was strongly related to substrate temperatures.27 Sveinbjörnsson et al. reported that increasing the substrate temperature provided a new route to fabricate high efficiency PSCs in the ambient atmosphere.28
In this work, the effect of substrate temperature on the crystallization of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite films during one-step preparation and the performance of solar cells was investigated. The TiO2 substrate was heated prior to spin-coating the perovskite film and the temperature was accurately monitored using an infrared thermometer in the range of 30–70 °C. We focused on how the substrate temperature affects the formation of the intermediate phase and δ phase, as well as the morphology and phase compositions of the perovskite films, and thus the resulting cell performances. In addition, we also elaborate the island crystallization process of perovskite films by controlling the substrate temperature, which is more conducive to the application of large-area solar cell fabrication, the blade-coating manufacturing technology, and film quality control of flexible solar cells.
Results and discussion
The typical planar device structure of PSCs used in this work is shown in Fig. 1a. The devices were fabricated using the conventional one-step solution process. First, a layer of dense blocking bl-TiO2 was deposited onto conducting fluorine-doped tin(IV) oxide (FTO) glass and sintered at 450 °C for 1 hour, and then cooled down to room temperature for the perovskite film deposition. The perovskite layer was quickly spin-coated on the preheated substrates when the substrates cooled down to the desired temperature (30 °C, 35 °C, 40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C and 70 °C, respectively) measured by using an infrared thermometer. Finally, a spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer of 100 nm thickness was spin-coated, followed by a 100 nm gold layer deposited by using a vacuum vapour deposition system.

(b) Photographs of fresh perovskite thin films (above) and annealed perovskite films (below) spin-coated onto substrates with different temperatures. (c) Optical microscope photographs of fresh perovskite thin films (above) and annealed perovskite films (below) spin-coated onto substrates with different temperatures. 
The photographs of a series of perovskite films fabricated at different substrate temperatures are shown in Fig. 1b. The upper row shows the photos of fresh perovskite films right after the spin-coating process, and the lower row shows the photos of the annealed ones. When increasing the substrate temperature, the colour of the fresh perovskite film changes from reddish brown to charcoal, and the light transmittance drops from translucent to opaque. The red color exhibited is considered as the color of the intermediate phase,28 so it can be concluded that the portion of the intermediate phase drops with the increase of substrate temperature. The surface roughness increases with the substrate temperature, and is really large above 60 °C. For the annealed samples, there is no obvious difference in the colour and transmittance between the films fabricated under different conditions, while the surface roughness follows the same trend as that of the fresh perovskite film. The optical microscopy photos of the same samples (Fig. 1c) provide more details of the film morphology variation. The morphology of fresh perovskite films gradually changes from dendritic to dendritic/island-coexisting, and to a pure island structure when increasing the substrate temperature. After annealing, the dendritic structure turns into regular grains, but the island-like structure remains.
To study the effect of substrate temperature on the crystallization process of the perovskite film, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) characterization was done for both fresh and annealed samples prepared under different conditions, as shown in Fig. 2a and b. The fresh perovskite films show a strong diffraction peak at 6.62° and a weak one at 13.04°, and samples prepared above 50 °C show two more diffraction peaks at 9.22° and 11.6°. The peak intensity at 6.62° decreases and those at 9.22°, 11.6° and 13.04° increase with the increase of substrate temperature. According to other groups' work, peaks at 6.62°, 9.22° and 13.04° can be assigned to the (002), (022) and (040) lattice planes of the MA2Pb3I8(DMSO)2 intermediate phase, respectively,29,30 and the peak at 11.6° to the δ perovskite phase.31–34 The films spin-coated below 40 °C are composed of a pure intermediate perovskite phase, while the films spin-coated above 50 °C are mixtures of the intermediate phase and δ perovskite phase (δ-phase). The ratio of the δ perovskite phase increases with the increase of substrate temperature, as shown in Fig. 2c. The phenomenon that the peak intensity changes with the increase of substrate temperature suggests that the crystal alignment can also be tuned by the substrate temperature. Note that the substrate temperature affects not only the phase components and ratios, but also the crystal orientation of the fresh perovskite film.

The XRD diagrams of the annealed perovskite films spin-coated at different substrate temperatures are displayed in Fig. 2b. The diffraction peaks of both the intermediate phase and the δ phase disappear, and those of the cubic perovskite phase show up. This means that both the intermediate perovskite phase and δ phase are transformed into the cubic perovskite phase after annealing at 150 °C for 20 minutes. Three new diffraction peaks at 14.02°, 28.28° and 31.72° correspond to the (110), (220) and (310) crystal planes, respectively.12,35 If we calculated the intensity ratios of diffraction peaks of (110)/(310) of all the samples (Fig. 3c), it is found that the peak intensity ratio is from 3.8 for 30 °C to 4.6 for 35 °C with the maximum at 35 °C. The peak ratio drops slightly to 4.3 at 40 °C, but then decreases rapidly when further increasing the substrate temperature. Therefore, the substrate temperature can affect the crystal orientation of the perovskite film. Besides, the same trend can be seen from the intensity ratio of diffraction peaks of fresh perovskite films (002)/(040). The δ phase starts to appear at 50 °C and increases with increasing substrate temperature. Note that the substrate temperature affects the crystal orientation of the intermediate phase and δ phase, and thus the corresponding crystal orientation of the annealed perovskite film. In short, a pure intermediate phase can provide optimum crystal orientation (110) during annealing.36,37

The diffraction peak from PbI2 appears in all the XRD diagrams of annealed perovskite samples, and the peak intensity of PbI2 decreases with the increase of substrate temperature. The PbI2 phase results from the partial decomposition during the perovskite crystallization process at a higher annealing temperature.38,39 Considering that the volume of the intermediate phase decreases with the increase of substrate temperature, we can conclude that PbI2 is mainly from the decomposition of the intermediate phase, and generated during the phase transition of the intermediate phase to the perovskite phase.
The SEM images of fresh and annealed perovskite films prepared at different substrate temperatures are shown in Fig. 3a and b, to further investigate the effect of substrate temperature on the morphology evolution. SEM images of the same samples at a higher magnification (40000×) are displayed in Fig. S1† to show the details of the film morphology. Fresh perovskite films prepared below 40 °C had a uniform dendritic morphology with a feature size of 1 μm, while those prepared above 50 °C had a rough morphology of a mixed flat dendritic structure and islands with a feature size of 10 μm. The size and the density of islands increased with the increase of substrate temperature. The islands in general were tens of nanometres larger than the dendritic structures, resulting in a larger surface roughness. Correlating the SEM images and XRD diagrams of the fresh perovskite films, the fact that perovskite films prepared at a temperature of 30 °C–40 °C had a pure intermediate phase and dendritic structures suggests that the perovskite intermediate phase has a typical morphology of dendritic patterns. This is consistent with Y. Bai group's work.33,36 The formation of islands will be elaborated later.
Comparing the SEM images of the fresh (Fig. 3a) and the annealed (Fig. 3b) perovskite films, we can see that after annealing all the dendritic structures (the intermediate phase) disappeared, and the islands remain. Crystal grains of PbI2 are also observed.40 Perovskite films prepared at low temperature are smooth, closely packed, and pinhole-free. For those prepared at higher temperature, the crystalline quality of the perovskite film is deteriorated by the presence of the islands, due to the increase of surface roughness and the presence of pinholes.
The elemental composition of perovskite films prepared at 50 °C was analysed using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to investigate whether a morphology difference (the island and the dendritic region) leads to a compositional difference (Fig. 3c). The ratios of lead atom numbers to that of the halogen (iodine and bromine) in four regions were calculated and are listed in the inset. The composition variation of different domains is in the range of measurement error, so it is difficult to draw any conclusion on the correlation between the elemental composition and the film morphology. Correlating this result with the XRD diagrams in Fig. 2, it can be concluded that there is no obvious composition change during the phase transformation from the intermediate phase and the δ phase into the cubic perovskite phase.
Based on the above results, the crystallization process of perovskite films prepared at different substrate temperatures is proposed in Fig. 4. During the spin-coating process, PbI2 (and also PbBr2) prefers to form adducts with DMSO, FAI and MABr through coordination effects.36,41 The reaction between PbI2 and DMSO is stronger than that of FAI (MABr) and PbI2, so PbI2 will react with DMSO first and form the intermediate perovskite phase. If there is not enough DMSO, PbI2 will react with FAI (MABr) instead and form the δ perovskite phase. An elevated temperature might also assist the formation of the δ perovskite phase. During the annealing process, the crystal structure of the intermediate phase is destroyed due to the evaporation of DMSO, and then the intermediate phase transforms into the perovskite phase. The δ perovskite phase transforms into the cubic phase, which is energetically more favourable.

At a low substrate temperature, the DMSO solvent evaporates slowly due to the low saturated vapour pressure, and the rest of DMSO molecules in solvate coordinates with PbI2, forming a stable intermediate phase. The intermediate phase uniformly covers the substrate, resulting in a flat dendritic morphology. When increasing the substrate temperature, the surface tension of the solvate increases, and microscale fluid flows are generated due to the strong volatilization of the solvent (here DMSO and DMF). These flows carry around the nuclei of the intermediate phase and δ phase, which aggregate together in the solvate and eventually form islands.24,25 The density and the size of islands increase with the increase of substrate temperature, resulting in a large surface roughness.
With the above understanding, we sketched the phase transition and the morphology evolution process during the preparation of the perovskite layer in Fig. 4. The fresh perovskite film obtained at a low substrate temperature is composed of a pure intermediate phase with a uniform dendritic structure and transforms into a smooth cubic phase in the annealing process. With the increase of substrate temperature, the δ phase starts to appear in the fresh perovskite film, and the morphology changes to the co-existing dendritic and island-like structure. After annealing, the original island morphology still remains. The morphology of the perovskite film is mainly determined by the spin-coating process.
To investigate whether the film morphology affects the crystalline quality of the perovskite layer, steady state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of perovskite films prepared at different substrate temperatures were measured. An excitation light with a wavelength of 467 nm was used. As shown in Fig. 5a, the PL peak wavelength is about 763 ± 1 nm for perovskite films fabricated at 30–50 °C, while the peak wavelength red-shifts by around 20 nm for those fabricated at 60–70 °C. The red shift of the PL peak wavelength is related to the trap states at the surface and grain boundaries,42 which is consistent with the previous results that the perovskite films prepared at 60 °C and 70 °C have poor crystallinity. The PL peak intensity of the perovskite film prepared at 35 °C is the strongest among those of all the samples, which means the least non-radiative recombination and correspondingly the best crystalline quality.12 Compared with films fabricated at 50 °C, films fabricated at 60 °C and 70 °C had a slightly higher PL peak intensity which might result from thicker films.
 Fig. 5  (a) Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra and (b) normalized time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay profiles fabricated at different substrate temperatures. 
The TRPL decay curves in Fig. 5b were fitted with a bi-exponential decay function. The fast component τ1 and the slow component τ2 stand for the surface and the bulk recombination rate of the perovskite film respectively.43–45 It can be seen that the film prepared at 35 °C has the longest mean lifetime among all samples, which means the best carrier transport capability. In conclusion, the film fabricated at 35 °C has fewer trap states and a lower defect recombination rate.
A large number of solar cells under different fabrication conditions were measured to investigate how the substrate temperature affects the device performance. The average and optimum device performance parameters of these PSCs are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 6. The cells prepared at 35 °C have the highest PCE. Fig. S3† shows the typical JV curves of the forward and reverse scans of the PSC device, which exhibits a Jsc of 22.75 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.13 V, and a FF of 0.73, resulting in a PCE of 19.03% at 35 °C. Table S2† shows the forward and reverse scan parameters of the best PSCs prepared at different substrate temperatures. The PSCs prepared at all temperatures have hysteresis effects, but there is no obvious trend in how the substrate temperature affects the hysteresis effects.

The thickness and roughness of films fabricated at different substrate temperatures were measured with a white light interferometer and a step profiler, and the results are listed in Table S1.† The large surface roughness leads to poor contact between the perovskite layer and the HTM layer, or the incomplete coverage of the HTM layer on the perovskite layer, and even direct contact between the gold electrode and the perovskite layer, and thus reduces the open circuit voltage.46 Therefore, open-circuit voltage (Voc) first increases and then decreases, with the increase of substrate temperature. Short-circuit current (Jsc) is determined by the light absorption capacity and the charge collection efficiency.47 UV-Vis absorption and transmission spectra of the perovskite films in Fig. S2† show that the light absorption capacity of the thin films reaches the maximum at 50 °C. The perovskite thin film prepared at 50 °C has a thickness of 918 nm, larger than the typical carrier diffusion length of 600 nm, and thus has a smaller Jsc. The thickness of the perovskite film prepared at 40 °C is smaller than the carrier diffusion length, so the Jsc is the highest among those of all the devices. This is consistent with the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency measurement shown in Fig. S4.† From SEM and XRD results, it can be seen that the crystallinity of the film prepared at 35 °C is better than that of the film at 40 °C, and the average grain size is larger. The larger grain size can reduce carrier scattering at the grain boundaries and the carrier recombination rates, thus improving the FF of the device. The fill factor (FF) of the films prepared at different substrate temperatures is maximum at 35 °C. The typical device reverse scan JV curves of samples prepared at different substrate temperatures are shown in Fig. S5.†
To gain further insight into the stability of PSCs prepared at different substrate temperatures, the steady power efficient of PSCs was measured under max power point conditions, i.e. biased at the corresponding voltage for 300 s (Fig. S6†). The PCE of the PSCs fabricated at higher substrate temperatures (50 °C, 60 °C and 70 °C) exhibit serious fluctuations, which confirms the poor stability of those devices. The PSCs prepared at low substrate temperatures from 30 °C to 40 °C show pretty good stability, justifying the accuracy of the device performance measurement. Fig. S7† shows the normalized PCE of PSCs as a function of storage time, which were stored inside a glove box without any encapsulation.
Conclusions
We have systematically investigated how the substrate temperature affects the morphology evolution, the intermediate phase and δ phase formation, the crystallinity and the photoelectric characteristics of perovskite films, and the performance of resulting solar cells. A moderate substrate temperature (below 40 °C in this work) improves the crystalline quality of the mixed ion (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite layer, as evidenced by a longer carrier lifetime and a lower defect density shown in TRPL and PL measurements. While at higher substrate temperatures (above 50 °C in this work), the shortage of DMSO in the solvate leads to the direct formation of the perovskite phase. Meanwhile, the strong volatilization of solvents (DMSO and DMF) at high substrate temperature generates microscale fluid flows in the solvate, and these flows transport the nuclei of the intermediate phase and the δ perovskite phase, resulting in the aggregation of nuclei and thus the formation of islands. The presence of islands increases the surface roughness and deteriorates the crystalline quality of the perovskite layer. Therefore, an appropriate substrate temperature of ∼35 °C is helpful to achieve a smooth and high crystallinity perovskite film. The highest PCE in our work of 19.03% was achieved for TiO2-based planar PSCs prepared at 35 °C. The knowledge gained in this study is valid for high-temperature blade-coating techniques and other upscaling solar cell manufacturing.
Experimental
Device fabrication
(1) Fabrication of the dense bl-TiO2: FTO conductive glass (the surface resistance is about 14 Ω and the transmittance is about 90%) was carried out by sequentially and ultrasonically cleaning with detergent, deionized water, acetone and ethanol for 15 minutes, and then drying in an oven. 250 μL tetrabutyl titanate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 25 μL hydrochloric acid were dissolved in 3 mL absolute ethyl alcohol (Aladdin) and stirred for 10 minutes to prepare precursor bl-TiO2 solution. The dried FTO was treated with UV-ozone for 15 min before the spin-coating process, and then the bl-TiO2 layer was formed by dropping the solution onto the FTO substrates at a rotation rate of 5000 rpm for 30 s at room-temperature in air. The samples were preheated at 120 °C for 20 min on a hot plate, and then transferred to a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 1 h. (2) Fabrication of the perovskite layers: 28 mg MABr (Lumtec), 91.8 mg PbBr2 (Sigma-Aldrich), 215 mg FAI (luminescence) and 633 mg PbI2 (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in 800 μL DMF(Sigma-Aldrich) and 200 μL DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich), and then stirred at room temperature overnight. FTO/TiO2 substrates were transferred to a glove box. The substrate was heated firstly at a high temperature, and the substrate temperature was measured by using an infrared thermometer. When it reached the desired temperature, a perovskite layer was deposited rapidly by a one-step spin coating process at 500 rpm for 5 s and 5000 rpm for 50 s on the FTO/TiO2 substrate. 50 μL of chlorobenzene (Alfa Aesar) was deposited on the spinning substrate before the end of the program. The films were then annealed at 150 °C for 20 min. (3) Fabrication of the HTM and gold electrode: spiro-OMeTAD solution (72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD (Lumtec), 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine(Sigma-Aldrich), 17.5 μL Li-TFSI solution (520 mg Li-TFSI (Sigma-Aldrich) in 1 mL acetonitrile (Alfa Aesar)) and 60 μL Co(III) TFSI salt solution (100 mg FK209 Co(III) TFSI salt in 1 mL chlorobenzene) both dissolved in 1 mL chlorobenzene) were then deposited on the perovskite layer by spin coating at 5000 rpm for 50 s. Finally, a 100 nm-thick Au layer was deposited by vacuum thermal evaporation.
Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on an FEI Inspect. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDS) Detector diagrams were obtained using an INCA-Penta-FET-X3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of all the samples were measured on a Haoyuan DX-2700XRD with a scan rate of 4° per min under conditions of 40 kV and 30 mA. 200-fold magnified photos were obtained from a Shangguang XP-PC optical microscope in reflection mode. Steady-state PL spectra were measured using a FSL 980 device equipped with a 467 nm excitation wave. Fluoromax-4 was used for the TRPL experiments. The resulting solar cells were tested for energy conversion efficiency using a Newport 94123A solar simulator and a Keithley 2400 digital source meter under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2). UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1800 from 300 to 850 nm. External quantum efficiency was measured using an Enlitech QE-R3011, film thickness was measured with a Veeco 2650E, and surface roughness was analysed using a Veeco Dektak 150 step instrument.
