    , Accepted 8th December 2017First published on 8th December 2017AbstractWe develop an external-electric-field (EEF)-assisted annealing treatment to improve the photoelectric performance of planar organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The new strategy can control the ion polarization orientation of perovskite films to obtain a good crystallization film and enhance the built-in electric field (BIF), which facilitates the effective promotion of charge separation and transport. Under an optimized treatment of up-EEF-assisted (2.5 V μm−1) annealing, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the inverted PSC is improved from 15.33% to 17.26%, and from 16.77% to 19.18% for regular PSCs, compared with the thermal-annealing-only process. The ion polarization and ferroelectricity in the perovskite layer induced by the EEF are intensively discussed. The finding in this work provides a new route to improve perovskite film quality and cell performance.
Introduction
Solar cells based on perovskite organic–inorganic hybrid materials have drawn tremendous research interest and have currently achieved over 20% power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–3 Researchers have made several studies to further improve the photoelectric property. For solution-processed perovskite films, control over morphology, charge transfer and collection is vital. Especially, enhancing nucleation and crystal growth is key to optimize the photovoltaic performance in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Various methods have been attempted, such as employing additives to slow down perovskite crystal growth,4 adding seed-mediated nano-particles to control growing sites,5 and utilizing solution engineering to form intermediate adducts to improve the nucleation process.6,7 Also, the underlayer for the perovskite layer can be modified to facilitate a dense perovskite film.8 Simultaneously, some chemical-physical techniques are also ideal ways to regulate crystallization quality. Shen et al. established a kind of electrochemical fabrication to control the crystallization process of perovskite films.9 Applying a magnetic field during the spin-coating process can also help assist the growth kinetics of perovskite films.10 It is well known that the methylammonium cation (MA+) and inorganic octahedral cage in a perovskite layer are removable under an external field.11–13 These mobile ions and the polarization electric field induced by the external field can offer the opportunity to tune the intrinsic built-in field (BIF). The intrinsic BIF dominates in determining the charge separation in PSCs.14 Chen et al. have demonstrated that an electric field applied after completing the device fabrication can significantly influence the polarization and hysteresis in PSCs.15,16 Chen et al. confirmed that a poling bias before the J–V scan can mitigate hysteresis. In addition, setting an external electric field, which was firstly reported by Padinger et al.,17 is also an efficient optimization method in organic solar cells.18,19
Herein, we report a method to improve the photoelectric performance of PSCs by employing an external-electric-field (EEF) during the annealing process. Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of EEF-assisted annealing treatment on the perovskite films. When different vertical EEFs were applied on perovskite films during annealing, the MA+ and inorganic octahedral cages can be changed along the applied EEF. Two directions of EEF, designated “up-EFF” and “down-EFF,” are exerted. In the case of up-EEF, the positive ions layer stacks towards the [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester electron transport layer (PCBM or TiO2), which is in the same direction as the intrinsic BIF. The BIF enhanced by polarization and ion migration can promote the driving force of charge separation. However, in the down-EEF treatment, the driving forces for extracting electrons (holes) to the electron transport layer (ETL) from the hole transport layer (HTM) become weaker. Although the down-EEF treatment has a negative effect on charge separation, there is still no decrease of the PCE, since it can reduce the trap states at the interface, and the film and morphology can be improved by both directions of applied EEFs. In addition, ferroelectric polarization also plays a role in these EEF treatments. For these phenomena, several measurements and detailed explanations of the influence of different applied EEFs during the annealing process on PSCs are provided in this work.

To date, this is the first fabricated PSC with controllable crystallization and carrier separation by applying an EEF during the annealing process. We provide some explanations about the behavior of ion migration and polarization under different directions of EEF. Meanwhile, we utilize ion migration and polarization to optimize the device performance, achieving an optimal PCE of 19.18% (in a regular device).
Experimental
Materials
20 mL of hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in H2O) was added dropwise to 48 mL methanol (40 wt%) under ice bath stirring for 2 h. The reactant solution was distilled in a rotary evaporator at 55 °C to remove the solvents, and then the precipitate was washed by diethyl ether 3 times. Finally, a white-colored powder was collected and dried at 60 °C for 24 h under vacuum. The mixture of PbCl2:CH3NH3I with a 1:3 molar ratio was dissolved in DMF and then stirred at 60 °C overnight, giving the perovskite precursor solution.
Sample preparation
The used device structure is shown in Fig. 1(a). ITO-coated glass substrates (15 Ω sq−1) were ultrasonically-coated in acetone and ethanol at room temperature for 15 min, then UV-Ozone cleaner for 15 min. A film (45 nm thick) of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the ITO substrate at 4500 rpm and annealed at 140 °C for 10 min. Then, the prepared perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated at 4000 rpm. For the thermal annealing process, the perovskite films were conducted by a typical gradient increased temperature method (the films were slowly heated from 60 to 100 °C at a rate of 10 °C/10 min on a hot plate). For the EEF assisted annealing process, EEFs were exerted on the perovskite films using a conductive glass cover, where a spacing of about 60–80 μm was set [Fig. S1(a)†]. To acquire the spacing, we put a plastic strip between two of the same conductive substrates to build a similar flat capacitor with air as the dielectric. Using C = εA/d, the spacing can be deduced by measuring the capacitance. The electric field intensity (E) can be obtained based on E = V/d, where V is the applied DC voltage (60 V or 150 V). During the cooling process from 100 °C to room temperature, the EEF was kept constant, and the photo taken during the EEF assisted annealing treatment is shown in Fig. S1(b).† A PCBM layer was deposited from a 20 mg mL−1 chlorobenzene solution at 2000 rpm. Then 0.5 mg mL−1 Bphen in absolute ethanol was coated onto a PCBM layer at 4000 rpm. Finally, 100 nm thick Ag (mask area of 0.0725 cm2) was deposited on top of the Bphen layer by thermal evaporation under 10−7 Torr.
Characterization

J–V characteristics of the PSCs were recorded under 1 sun illumination using a programmable Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G simulated solar light. Incident photon current efficiency (IPCE) was measured by a 1000 W halogen lamp and grating monochromator (Acton Spectra Pro 2300i). Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott–Schottky capacitance analysis were surveyed by Ivium (Netherlands). The absorption spectra were measured with a UV/vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 750). The surface morphology and element distribution in energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Quanta 200 FEG, FEI Co.). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using PANalytica 80 equipment (Empyrean, Cu Kα radiation with a wavelength of 0.154 nm). 2D-GIXRD patterns were obtained by a MarCCD 225 detector mounted vertically at a distance of around 256.401 mm from the sample with an exposure time of 100 s at a grazing incidence angle of 0.2°. The coordinates of the GIXRD patterns were represented by diffraction vectors with q = 4πsin(θ)/λ, where θ is half of the diffraction angle and λ is the wavelength of the incident X-ray. P–E loops were tested by PMF0312-295 (Radiant Technologies, USA). The dielectric spectra were tested by a Precision Impedance Analyzer (Agilent 4294A).
Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) is tested by PMF0312-295 (Radiant Technologies, USA), which is based on Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S7(g) in the ESI†). Firstly, the surface topography is mapped in the tapping mode. Secondly, the contact potential difference (CPD) between the AFM tip and the sample is detected by retracing at a left height from the sample surface. During the second test procedure, a compensated DC voltage is applied to offset the potential difference between the tip and sample. Therefore, local potential distribution on the sample surface is observed, and the work function of the sample is obtained if the tip’s work function is known. All measurements are taken in air conditions.
Results and discussion
Perovskite films based on EEF assisted thermal annealing
The crystallization of the solution-processed perovskite layer, a critical parameter, plays a crucial role in the optical properties of PSCs.20–25 The representative top surface SEM topography of perovskite films that have undergone different annealing treatments is displayed in Fig. 2(a–e). Obviously, the number of pinholes in the films that underwent EEF-assisted annealing is less than in those that underwent thermal annealing treatment. The larger the EEF applied, the larger the grain size and the fewer pinholes, independent of the direction of the EEFs. In the annealing process, MA+ and inorganic octahedral cages are easily changeable. When different vertical EEFs were exerted on the perovskite layer, a dynamic process of changing the ion and cage directions along with the applied EEF occurred with a certain film polarization.

After cooling the sample down to room temperature, a uniform film with orderly crystallization is formed. A more ordered film means less defects and pinholes, which is beneficial for the generation of exciton and carrier transport, and, hence, higher device performance.26,27Fig. 2(f) shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of these films. Similarly, the perovskite films that underwent an electric field intensity of 2.5 V μm−1 (both up- and down-EEF) have a stronger absorption intensity compared with films without any EEF treatment. We attribute the enhanced absorption to the improved film crystalline quality achieved by the applied EEF. The annealing times for the perovskite films are long (∼2 h), and the color changes of the perovskite films are recorded in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† As observed, EEF treatment can slow the annealing process, since the applied EEF can prevent the evaporation of DMF, and a slower solvent evaporation process benefits the crystallization kinetics in the perovskite film forming process.4
Further evidence of more ordered crystal orientations in EEF-assisted perovskite films has been obtained from detailed XRD analysis, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The intensities of the (110) and (220) diffraction peaks in CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films, whether 2.5 V μm−1 up-EEF or 2.5 V μm−1 down-EEF treatments, are the strongest among all samples. This suggests that EEF-treated perovskite films grow more preferentially along the (110) orientation.26 Noticeably, enlarged XRD patterns presented some shifts for these peaks (as shown in Fig. 3(b)), which describes a smaller parallel atomic plane spacing in the EEF assisted annealing process samples. For instance, the positions of the (110) peak of the EEF-assisted samples are 14.68° [2.5 V μm−1 (up)], 14.48° [1 V μm−1 (up)], 14.44° [1 V μm−1 (down)], and 14.59° [2.5 V μm−1 (down)], while the position is 14.35° for the thermal-annealing-only sample. Based on Braggs law (2dsin(θ) = nλ), the corresponding parallel atomic plane spacings (d) are calculated to be 6.02 Å [2.5 V μm−1 (up)], 6.11 Å [1 V μm−1 (up)], 6.11 Å [1 V μm−1 (down)], and 6.06 Å [2.5 V μm−1 (down)] (and 6.16 Å for the reference sample), respectively. It can be seen that, the d-spacing is narrower during EEF treatment, indicating that closer and more compact perovskite crystals have been obtained, which can be intuitively proven by the larger grain size from SEM morphologies. Detailed reasons for the closer arrangement need to be determined by the GIXRD technique. Real-time diffraction based on a fast two-dimensional (2D) area detector combined with a high-brightness synchrotron X-ray source was carried out to study the crystallographic structures. Fig. 3(c–e) shows the two dimensional (2D) results of representative perovskite films with and without EEF-assisted annealing treatment. The diffraction arcs of (110) and (220) in films with EEF treatments (both up and down cases) are sharper than that in the controlled film. Normalized radially integrating intensity plots along the ring at q = 10 nm−1 [the (110) plane of perovskite structures] of the corresponding perovskite films are plotted in Fig. 3(f). The full widths at half-maximum in the sharp peaks at 90° are 7.51°, 8.60°, and 10.05°, respectively, for perovskite films with up-, down- and no-EEF-assisted treatment. To clearly compare the stacking mode between the films with and without EEF treatment, we integrated the crystalline intensities along the out-plane and in-plane directions. The schematic of the GIXRD experimental setup is in Fig. S3,† along with the integrated intensities along different directions. This suggests that after EEF treatment, whether up or down, the out-plane intensity is stronger and the in-plane intensity is weaker. This also means that MA+ and inorganic octahedral cages strongly prefer to stack along the in-plane direction.28–30 In-plane growth can contribute to the larger grain size to form dense films, meaning less grain boundaries. Charge recombination at the grain boundaries is detrimental to charge transport and collection.31,32 Therefore, stacking in a more preferential orientation would close the distance between perovskite crystals, resulting in denser films and more efficient charge transport along the crystal orientation. The schematic is shown in Fig. 1(b).

Photovoltaic performance
The impacts of EEF-assisted annealing treatment on photovoltaic performance are summarized in Fig. 4 and Table 1. Fig. 4(a) shows the representative J–V curves of PSCs with and without EEF treatment. It is found that after the up-EEF-assisted annealing treatment, the device parameters open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF) and PCE are largely improved compared to those of the reference devices. The optimal device (up-EEF of 2.5 V μm−1) presents a maximum PCE of 17.26% with a VOC of 0.98 V, JSC of 22.64 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.78 (Fig. 4(b)). Compared to 15.33% in the reference device, there is a significant improvement of 12.59% in PCE. Furthermore, the devices undergoing down-EEF treatment show a satisfactory PCE compared to those of the reference devices. Moreover, the EEF plays the same role in the regular device of a structure of ITO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-MeOTAD/Ag as shown in Fig. S4 and Table S1 (ESI†), in which the maximal PCE approaches 19.18% after up-EEF treatment. Taking inverted devices as the object of study, we further evaluate the correlation between cell parameters and applied EEFs. Statistical average values and standard deviations of VOC, JSC, FF and PCE are plotted as a function of EEF in Fig. S5 (ESI†), based on over 20 devices (Fig. S6, ESI†). One can find that VOC, JSC, FF and PCE reveal a positive relationship with up-EEF treatment, while down-EEF treatment has a positive effect on FF, a negative effect on VOC, and nearly no obvious effect on JSC. Meanwhile, there were no large changes of FF and JSC under larger down-EEF treatments.

The J–V hysteresis plots are displayed in Fig. 4(d), and the detailed parameters are presented in Table S2.† Interestingly, devices with different annealing treatments present various features for different scanning directions. The hysteresis is obvious in the thermal-annealing-only-based device scanned from forward and reverse directions, and it almost disappears in the up-EEF-treated device. However, the hysteresis can be aggravated after down-EEF treatment, and it must also be mentioned that VOC in a forward scan is obviously lower than that in a reverse scan. We attribute this to the enhanced opposite polarization arrangement with the applied test bias.13J–V hysteresis behavior can be generated by complex causes, with induced polarization and ion migration after EEF treatment the likely major ones.33–39 The steady maximum power point (0.84 V) of the optimal device, as shown in Fig. 4(f), confirms the inexistence of obvious photocurrent hysteresis in the up-EEF-assisted device.40
The light response is surveyed by IPCE spectra (Fig. 4(e)), and the statistics on the maximum value in IPCE are presented in Fig. S7 (ESI†). It is found that the down-EEF-assisted annealing treatment has nearly no effect on the light response. Nevertheless, the up-EEF-assisted annealing treatment has a stronger light response compared to the reference device. The larger the up-EEFs, the stronger the light response (ESI Fig. S8†), suggesting more effective carrier transfer and collection processes in the devices. In addition, the integrated currents agree with the J–V (Fig. 4(a)) result.
The series resistance consisting of the sheet and charge transfer resistances in PSCs with and without EEF treatment was estimated by the EIS technique. As shown in Fig. 5(a), an equivalent circuit normally used for fitting purposes is shown in the inset, where RSH and RCT represent the sheet- and charge-transfer resistance inside the perovskite films, respectively. The almost negligible difference in RSH among these devices demonstrates that the manufacturing process used in our experiment was relatively stable for different devices. A regular change of RCT, more negative (down) EEF applied, and the appearance of larger RCT are observed. The minimum RCT, 40.66 kΩ cm2, and maximum, 159.30 kΩ cm2, lie in the up-EEF-based (2.5 V μm−1) and down-EEF-based (2.5 V μm−1) device, respectively. We ascribe this to the polarization arrangement under different EEF treatments, which will be discussed in a later section.

To explore the EEF influence after completing device fabrication, repeating J–V tests were performed to compare the test external electric field (TEEF) during J–V scans and the EEF in the annealing process. The PCE of a device without any EEF treatment during the annealing process initially increases with increasing scan time, which is due to induced ion polarization and migration by the TEEF. This phenomenon is consistent with the argument of other researchers that an EEF applied after completing device fabrication can still cause polarization and migration.39 For the device that underwent down-EEF treatment, the increased phenomenon of PCE is clearer, since the TEEF is the opposite of that with polarization induced by applying down-EEF during the annealing process. However, after up-EEF treatment, the PCE of the device is relatively stable, which benefits from the advanced polarization during the annealing process. Therefore, PCEs obtained after up-EEF treatment during the annealing process are more realistic and more stable.
Since there is ion migration in perovskite films, an additive capacitance exists in the perovskite layer due to the Schottky barrier between the interfaces. The extrapolated built-in potential (Vbi) and the carrier density (ND) can be extracted from Mott–Schottky characteristics. Fig. 5(c) shows the measured capacitance as a function of the forward bias (C–V) where the positive potential is set on the positive ITO electrode (the same direction of up-EEF), and swept with a DC bias from 0 V to 1.1 V accompanied with an AC signal (20 mV, 10 kHz). The capacitance (C) can be written according to the Mott–Schottky relation as41  where q is the elementary charge, V the applied forward bias, and A is the Schottky contact area (0.0725 cm2). From the equation, the inverse capacitance squared 1/C2 should be a linear function of V (the plot of 1/C2versus V is shown in Fig. 5(d), whose intersection with the voltage axis yields the extrapolated Vbi (ref. 42) and whose slope of the linear region yields ND (ref. 43)). The detailed data obtained by fitting the linear parts are displayed in Table 2. In the linear region, we can find that positive EEFs would cause elevated Vbi and increased ND. It is known that a higher Vbi is necessary to prevent carrier recombination from competing with charge extraction.44 According to the equation C = εrε0A/W, the depletion capacitance (W) can be obtained when there is no bias applied (V = 0),45 and the relative dielectric constant (εr) of the perovskite is 3.46 The calculated result is also shown in Table 2. When the perovskite layer is undergoing up-EEF treatment, the BIF is enhanced and the width of the depletion regions in the perovskite layer is increased and the band bending at both HTL and ETL interfaces is enlarged, leading to higher VOC and JSC due to the better charge separation.12 Higher PCE will be expected by introducing up-EEF-assisted annealing treatment. In contrast, the perovskite layer based on a down-EEF treatment can cause the opposite effect of the BIF, resulting in a reduction of the driving force of charge separation and transport. Nevertheless, the high-quality perovskite crystallization and ion migration (see later discussion) can compensate the weakened charge separation and transport efficiency, which can explain the nearly unchanged JSC in down-EEF-treated devices.

To characterize the polarization in perovskite films, we explored dielectric relaxation. Fig. 5(e and f) presents εr and the dissipation factor (tanδ) as a function of frequency from 1 kHz to 1 MHz in the different devices under darkness at room temperature. The value of εr is deduced from the capacitance measurement by the equation C = εrε0A/d, where d is the thickness of the perovskite film (∼300 nm). At low frequencies, the perovskite film shows a relatively larger εr. With increasing frequency, the value of εr slightly decreases (<10 kHz), rapidly decreases above 10 kHz, and finally becomes a constant at high frequency. The dielectric relaxation can be caused by dipoles oscillating in an alternating electric field.47 It is found that εr expresses a positive correlation with the EEF from negative towards positive in the low-frequency region in which displacement polarization is dominant. In the present case, an up-EEF-treated (2.5 V μm−1) device has an εr value of 28.23 and a tanδ of 3.91 at 103 Hz. The higher εr and lower tanδ are associated with the stronger polarization after EEF treatment. Dielectric analysis provides crucial evidence of the obvious influence of applied EEFs on ion polarization.
Further discussion
It is well known that ion migration is a non-negligible factor in J–V hysteresis.48,49 In the present case, it is obvious that ion polarization caused by ion migration will be induced by EEF treatment. To evaluate the EEF effect on ion migration, we tested the cross-section EDX (Fig. 6) to display the distribution of elemental chlorine (Cl), iodine (I) and lead (Pb), and the surface KPFM to characterize the contact potential difference (CPD) (Fig. S9 in ESI†). It can been seen from Fig. 6 that I and Pb are distributed homogeneously, whether the EEF is applied or not, but a regular change for Cl is also observed. After up-EEF treatment, Cl accumulated in the perovskite layer (bottom) on the PEDOT:PSS side, but accumulated at the top perovskite surface after down-EEF treatment. This is because strongly polar Cl−1 has a relatively small atomic radius, which is easy to migrate. As determined by first-principle calculations, the activation energy (EA) of the ions in CH3NH3PbI3 shows an order of Pb2+ > MA+ > I−, i.e. I− is the easiest ion to migrate in CH3NH3PbI3.50–52 However, I− migration was not discerned from our EDX measurements, in good agreement with a previous study by Jinsong Huang et al.11,13 In order to confirm I− ion migration, we compared the surface CPD of films based on CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (Fig. S9(a–c)†) and CH3NH3PbI3 (Fig. S9(d and e)†) through KPFM analysis with a scan range of 20 μm.

Ion migration can cause the surface CPD to change, which is sensitive to the surface work functions of the perovskite materials.53 Assuming that the work function of the tip remains constant during scanning, the increase in CPD indicates a decrease in the film work function. The statistical distribution of CPD of the different films shown in Fig. S7† shows regular changes. In the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film, the CPD in up-EEF treatment is lower than that in no- and down-EEF treatments; that is, the work function of the up-EEF film is the highest, where the migration ions are Cl−, I− and MA+. Under the influence of up-EEF treatment, some cations (MA+) accumulating at the surface can cause the generation of valance-band holes, leading to a higher film surface work function. For the CH3NH3PbI3 film, the surface CPD is also changed, in which the migration ions are MA+ and I−. Therefore, I− ion migration occurred in the perovskite film after EEF treatment, probably accompanied with some MA+ migration, which is also consistent with previous studies.13 Ion migration is the main cause for the change of the intrinsic BIF. In addition, some ion migration can also influence the trap state at the interface. For example, although the down-EEF treatment can weaken the BIF, the migration ions can suppress the trap states at the interface. In this situation, down-EEF treatment can push MA+, the positive trap that can prevent electrons from going toward the ETL layer, to migrate away from the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/ETL. Considering the lessened trap state and the increased BIF, the satisfactory performance of the device after down-EEF treatment is reasonable (in Fig. 4(a)).
The ferroelectricity of the perovskite layer is also an important characteristic that influences the performance in PSCs after EEF treatment,54,55 and it has attracted much interest since it will affect the charge-transfer process in solar cells.56,57 The complex ferroelectric behaviors of the organometal halide perovskite materials are described in the literature.58–60Fig. 7 displays polarization–electric field (P–E) loops obtained for different test times, where (a) is the measured result once the devices were finished, and (b) and (c) are the graphs after J–V scans while keeping the device in the dark for 1 week. According to the principle of the P–E loops and discussion by Scott,61 conductivity loss is a key factor in the measurement. For the up-EEF treatment, the ion polarization field is opposite that of the P–E test field, therefore, the conductivity loss induces the unsaturated P–E loops. The down-EEF treatment has just the opposite effect, and hence relatively saturated P–E loops are observed. Therefore, the ‘banana’-shaped P–E loops (Fig. 7(a)) obtained once the devices are fabricated indicate that the ion polarization caused by EEF treatment plays as important a role as the conductivity loss does. Because the ‘banana’ shape cannot be recognized as ferroelectricity, we measured the P–E loops of the PSCs after J–V scans and storage in the dark, and the result are shown in Fig. 7(b) and (c). Standard P–E loops indicate that the ferroelectric behavior in CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film is confirmed.62–64 The altered P–E shape indicates that the J–V scans and storage under darkness can weaken the interface ion polarization to some extent. The results also show that ferroelectric polarization exists and exhibits regular change with different EEF treatments. Pr and Ec increase gradually with the applied EEFs from negative toward positive. When the up-EEF treatment is applied to the perovskite films, the BIF will be enhanced, and the increased proportion of the dipole along the bias results in increases of Pr and Ec. However, a down-EEF can make the direction of the dipole tend to be against the bias, which causes decreases of Pr and Ec. Therefore, applied EEFs can make the polarization of perovskite films more aligned regardless of direction during the annealing process. That is the main reason for the high quality of perovskite films after EEF treatments.

P–E loops measured (a) once the devices were finished, and (b and c) after J–V scans and storage for one week. (c) P–E loops tested under different scan voltages for the 2.5 V μm−1 (up)-EEF based PSC. 
As a consequence, ion migration and ferroelectricity complement each other in the EEF treatment. Other researchers obtained identical conclusions,65 in which ion migration exists among the grain boundaries and ferroelectricity is in the grain. This interesting phenomenon will be a focus of our future work.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated an efficient method, EEF-assisted annealing treatment, to improve the device performance of planar PSCs. Compared to the conventional thermal-annealing-only process, it shows better controllability in terms of carrier separation and crystal quality. The intrinsic BIF existing in the perovskite can be enhanced or weakened by ion migration and polarization induced by the EEF treatment to harmonize the hole and electron to initiate charge separation and transport. Although down-EEF assisted annealing treatment is harmful to charge separation and transport, the shortcoming can be compensated by the improved film quality of perovskites and reducing interface trap states. Interestingly, the up-EEF-assisted treatment is an excellent technique for fabricating high-performance PSCs. The EE-assisted-annealing method provides a new route to improve the perovskite film quality and, thus, device performance.
