    , Accepted 6th October 2020First published on 7th October 2020AbstractExpanding the family of ABX3-type perovskites is very important for developing excellent photoelectric materials. The perovskite-based H5O2+ superalkali cation had been explored, but perovskites with stable dynamics performance using superalkali and superhalogen ions are not yet found. In this work, H5O2+ and BH4− are introduced into a cubic CsPbI3 perovskite, and Pb is replaced with Ge and Sn, respectively. Then, cubic H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x (M = Ge and Sn; x = 0, 1, 2, and 3) perovskites are systematically studied by employing density functional theory-based first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The calculated results indicated that the perovskites show a wide range of material properties, i.e., stable dynamics performance at normal temperature and pressure, suitable tolerance factors (0.86–1.00), tunable direct band gaps (0.96–3.28 eV), and small effective hole and electron masses (0.17–0.70 me). Moreover, a power conversion efficiency over 31% is obtained for single-junction perovskite solar cells based on the cubic H5O2GeI3, H5O2SnI3 and H5O2SnI2BH4 perovskites. These results indicate that the cubic H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites may be used for fabricating high-performance photoelectric devices, and an intriguing platform can be provided for developing other new stable lead-free superatom perovskites by using superalkali and superhalogen ions.
Introduction
ABX3-type lead halide perovskites, as excellent photoelectric materials, have attracted enormous attention due to easy solution-based synthesis, low cost, benign defects, small effective carrier masses, tunable optical band gaps, high conversion efficiency, and so on.1–6 Reports of Lee et al. claimed that perovskite solar cells can show an ohmic contact by optimizing their interface, and open circuit voltage losses may be overcome by universal energy-level tailoring.7,8 These superior performances suggest that the lead halide perovskites such as CH3NH3PbX3 and CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br and I) can be viewed as more excellent photoelectric materials than the conventional Si, GaAs and Cu(In,Ga)Se2 materials.9–11 Fortunately, the single-junction lead halide perovskite solar cells have shown a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.2%.12 Unfortunately, the perovskites have toxic lead content and instability, which hamper the commercial application of perovskite solar cells.13,14
In recent years, inorganic double perovskites such as Cs2AgBiBr6, Cs2InYCl6, and Cs2TlBiCl6 have been explored for developing lead-free and stable perovskites.15–17 However, the double perovskites show a large band gap of about 3.2 eV for Cs2InYCl6, weak dipole matrix amplitudes for Cs2KBiCl6, most toxic issues for Cs2TlBiCl6 and so on.18–20 Furthermore, toxic Pb can also be replaced with nontoxic atoms such as Mn, Fe, Ge, and Sn, and Ge and Sn atoms with the valence state of ns2np2 are the best candidates for replacing Pb atoms, suggesting that Ge- and Sn-based perovskites may show excellent photovoltaic properties.21,22
To develop new ABX3-type perovskite photoelectric materials, another strategy is replacing A/X site atoms with superatoms. The reason is that the physicochemical properties of superatoms and atoms are similar. For instance, superhalogens gain electrons more easily than halogens. More than 30 perovskites with BH4 superhalogens have recently been successfully synthesized by Schouwink et al.23 Our previous study24 has revealed that the single-layer (C4H9NH3)2Sn(BH4)4 perovskite has a band gap of 3.01 eV. The works of Chen et al.25,26 show that the stability and PCE of perovskite solar cells can be improved by doping BF4 or PF6 superhalogens. Paduani et al.27 and Fang et al.28 introduced Li3S+ and Li3O+ ions into cubic ABX3-type lead halide perovskites. Unfortunately, their works showed that narrow band-gaps and nonperovskite phases were obtained for the perovskites with these superalkali ions, such as the band gap of 0.36 and 0.41 eV for (Li3S)PbI3 and (Li3O)PbI3 perovskites respectively, and quick phase transition from perovskite to nonperovskite phases for Li3O(Ge/SnI3) and Li3O[Ge/Sn(BH4)3] perovskites due to the strong interaction between Li3O+ ions. Moreover, introducing massive superalkalis (Li3O, Li2F, H5O2, and so on) into cubic CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites was systematically studied in our previous work,29 and the ab initio molecular dynamics simulation results indicated that the cubic super-alkali perovskite-based H5O2 superalkalis such as H5O2PbI3, H5O2SnBr3, and H5O2PbBr3 perovskites show stable dynamics performance. Most notably, H5O2+ClO4− crystals had been synthesized in the experiment.30 However, the ABX3-type lead-free perovskites with stable dynamics performance using superalkalis and superhalogens have not been forecasted until now. Herein, we believe that simultaneously introducing H5O2 superalkalis and superhalogens into perovskites may be a feasible strategy to obtain ABX3-type lead-free superatom perovskites containing superalkalis and superhalogens, and the lead-free superatom perovskites may show stable dynamics performances and tunable optoelectronic properties.
To obtain lead-free superatom perovskites with a tolerance factor of 0.80–1.00, H5O2+ superalkali cations and BH4− superhalogen anions were introduced into the A and X sites of cubic (α phase) CsPbI3 perovskites, due to which their radii were very close, i.e., 1.87 Å, 1.88 Å, 2.03 Å and 2.20 Å for H5O2+, Cs+, BH4− and I− ions29,31–33 respectively, and Pb were replaced with Ge and Sn with the valence state of ns2np2, respectively. We noted that the hydrogen bond is ubiquitous for organic–inorganic perovskites,34 which also suggests that introducing H5O2+ and BH4− ions into cubic CsPbI3 perovskites is a feasible strategy for finding lead-free superatom perovskites with stable dynamics performance. To clarify this point, we systematically studied cubic H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x (M = Ge and Sn; x = 0, 1, 2, and 3) perovskites using density functional theory (DFT)-based first-principles calculations and AIMD simulation. The calculation results indicated that all cubic H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites show stable dynamics performance, suitable tolerance factors, negative formation energies, tunable electronic structures and direct band gaps, and small effective carrier masses. The results also indicated that the single-junction solar cells based on cubic H5O2GeI3 and H5O2SnI2BH4 perovskites can show PCEs of 31.83% and 31.66%, respectively, when only the detailed balance limit is considered.
Results and discussions
The similar outermost orbitals of I− and BH4− are shown in Fig. 1A, which suggests that they have similar physicochemical properties. The structures of I−, BH4−, M2+ and H5O2+ ions are also shown in Fig. 1A. The models of cubic H5O2MI3, H5O2MI2BH4, H5O2MI(BH4)2 and H5O2M(BH4)3 perovskites are shown in Fig. 1B–E, respectively. The tolerance factor of cubic H5O2GeIx(BH4)3−x perovskites is more close to 1.00 than that of cubic H5O2SnIx(BH4)3−x perovskites, such as 0.98 and 0.86 for H5O2GeI3 and H5O2SnI3 perovskites respectively, which is due to the fact that the cation radius of Ge2+ is less than that of Sn2+. All cubic H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites show negative formation energies, and the negative formation energy is decreased with the increase of BH4, suggesting that replacing I atoms of cubic H5O2MI3 perovskites with BH4 superhalogens may be practicable in the experiment. The formation energy is normalized by regarding the single superalkali/superhalogen as an atom. The tolerance factors of 0.86–1.00 and negative formation energies also suggest that H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites may be stable and form perovskites, due to that the range of the tolerance factor is suitable for the formed perovskites.35–37 The results of the M–X bond average energy given in Tables 1 and S1† show that for the H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites, the bond energy is increased with the increase in BH4 contents, which may be attributed to superhalogens more easily gaining electrons than halogens, further resulting in a strong interaction between M and X site atoms. Moreover, the results of the M–X bond average energy also indicated that the MX3 frames of the H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites are stable at normal temperature and pressure. As a cubic H5O2SnBr3 perovskite with hydrogen bonding and stable dynamics performance in our previous work,29 the cubic H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x inorganic perovskite may show stable dynamics performance at room temperature, which is different from the cubic CsPbI3 all-inorganic perovskite and shows phase transition at normal temperature and pressure.

To verify this point, we compared the dynamics performance of cubic CsPbI3 perovskites with that of cubic H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites, and their AIMD simulation results are shown in Fig. 2, S1 and S2.† The cubic CsPbI3 perovskite with a 3 × 3 × 3 supercell showed obvious structural changes and the structural collapse of the PbI3 frame after AIMD simulation of 5 ps at 300 K and 105 Pa (see Fig. S1†). Moreover, obvious jump phenomena of the energy curve of cubic CsPbI3 perovskite were found (see Fig. S1†). These results are consistent with previous reports that the α-CsPbI3 perovskite with a cubic structure is only stable at >320 °C, and below this high temperature corresponding to the γ-CsPbI3 perovskite with a nonperovskite structure.38,39 By contrast, cubic H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites have no phase transition and gathering of ions (see Fig. 1, S1 and S2†), which may suggest that formed α-H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites are more stable than α-CsPbI3 perovskite at normal temperature and pressure. The changes in α, β, γ, a, b and c lattice parameters of cubic CsPbI3 and H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites are shown in Fig. S2† during AIMD simulations of 5 ps. Their lattice parameters, except for that of the cubic CsPbI3 perovskite, show a slight oscillation around the initial values, suggesting further that these cubic H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites are stable and form perovskites at room temperature and normal pressure. On the contrary, the initial values of the lattice parameters of the cubic CsPbI3 perovskite show obvious changes after AIMD simulations of 5 ps (see Fig. S2†), which also suggest that the cubic CsPbI3 perovskite has a nonperovskite structure at room temperature and normal pressure.

Next, we turn to explore the electronic structures of the H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites with different BH4 contents. We calculated their band structures and density of states (DOS) (see Fig. 3) using the standard HSE06 functional with 43% exact Hartree–Fock exchange including the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect and non-local vdW correction that this calculation method had been used for the H5O2-based super-alkali perovskites in our previous work.29 We noted that the H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites have the dispersed conduction band minimum (CBM) and valance band maximum (VBM), and a direct band gap at the R point of the Brillouin zone (see Fig. 3 and S3†), and they show direct band gaps of 0.96–3.28 eV, suggesting that they have the wide absorption region of 378.00–1291.60 nm, as shown in Fig. S4.† These H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites such as H5O2SnI3 and H5O2GeI3 perovskites show very slight Rashba-type splitting near band edges (see Fig. 3 and S4†), which may owe to the valence electrons of Ge and Sn atoms with weak SOC interactions. The direct band gaps of the H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites are broadened with the increase in BH4 parts (see Fig. 3 and S3†), which may be attributed to the factor that 1p orbitals of the BH4 superhalogen are below 5p orbitals of the I atom, further resulting in a wide gap between two antibonding (σ*) orbitals, as shown in the schematic in Fig. S5.† For the H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites, their total and projected DOSs are similar, i.e., the CBM states comprising mainly M np orbitals, the VBM states mainly deriving by I 5p orbitals with a negligible contribution of B 2s, 2p and H 1s orbitals (except for the H5O2M(BH4)3 perovskites mainly contributed by the outermost s and p orbitals of B and H atoms), and the DOSs of H5O2 parts locating mainly below −4.2 eV (see Fig. 3 and S3†). These DOS results show that the s–p and p–p optical transitions are possible for obtaining the high optical absorption of the H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites, because the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite with excellent light absorption also has the two optical transitions, as reported in the previous work.11 To explore the orientations of superatoms for the effect of optoelectronic properties, the models of the cubic H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskite with another orientation of superatoms are shown in Fig. S6,† and their DOSs and band gaps are shown in Fig. S7 and Table S2,† respectively. The band edge components of the perovskites with different orientation of superatoms have no change (see Fig. 3, S3 and S7†), such as the CBM and VBM states comprising mainly from Sn 5p orbitals and I 6p orbitals respectively for the cubic H5O2SnI3 perovskite with different orientations of superatoms (see Fig. 3 and S7E†). Moreover, the minimum and maximum differences of 0.01 and 0.30 eV were obtained for the band gaps of the cubic H5O2GeI2(BH4) and H5O2Ge(BH4)3 perovskites with the different orientations of superatoms (see Table S2 and Fig. S3†), respectively. To further estimate the orientations of superatoms and distortions for the effect of optoelectronic properties, after AIMD simulation of 5 ps, the DOSs were obtained for the cubic perovskites with a supercell and various orientations of superatoms (see Fig. S8†). As shown in Fig. 3, S3, S7 and S8,† the band edge components of these perovskites have no change after the AIMD simulation, i.e., the CBM and VBM states comprising mainly M np orbitals and I/BH4 outermost s/p orbitals respectively, suggesting that the excellent s–p and p–p optical transitions are retained for these perovskites.

The bands near VBM and CBM are a parabolic band for the H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites (see Fig. 3 and S3†). To quantitatively estimate the dispersion of conduction and valence bands of these perovskites, their effective carrier masses are shown in Tables 1 and S1.† These perovskites show small  and . For instance, the H5O2SnI3 perovskite has an effective hole mass of 0.17 me and the effective electron mass of 0.19 me (see Table 1), respectively. In all, these small effective carrier masses indicate that the carriers are easily generated and transferred after the light absorbed by the H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites. Moreover, the exciton binding energies below 81 meV were obtained for the H5O2SnI3, H5O2SnI2BH4 and H5O2GeI3 perovskites, suggesting that they can be used for the light-absorbing material of solar cells. Other H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites show the exciton binding energy above 138 meV, indicating that they may not be an excellent candidate for solar cells. In a word, the behavior of the charge carriers from bound like to free like can be observed with the increase in I content for the H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites, implying that their efficiencies can be improved by increasing the I content. However, the light absorbing materials with optimal band gaps of 1.1–1.4 eV are suitable for single-junction solar cells.40 With this criterion, we noted that only the H5O2SnI2BH4 perovskite with a direct band gap of 1.40 eV can be selected as the light absorbing material of a single-junction solar cell (see Fig. 3). To comprehensively evaluate the PCEs (η) of the single-junction solar cells based on the H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites, their average band gaps were used (see Tables 1 and S1†) and the detailed balance limit was considered. The Voc, Jsc, FF and η are shown in Tables 1 and S1.† The maximum open circuit voltage, short circuit current density, fill factor and PCE are 3.02 V, 48.22 mA cm−2, 95.10% and 31.83% for the single-junction solar cells based on the H5O2Ge(BH4)3, H5O2SnI3, H5O2Sn(BH4)3 and H5O2GeI3 perovskites, respectively.
As we know, the generation and separation of electron–hole pairs are also related to the charge densities of CBM and VBM states. The charge densities of the VBM and CBM states of the H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites are shown in Fig. 4A and S9,† respectively. These charge densities are similar, i.e., the VBM and CBM charge densities mainly contributing from I and M atoms respectively (except for form the BH4 superhalogen for VBM charge densities of the H5O2M(BH4)3 perovskites), which is consistent with the DOS results of these perovskites, as shown in Fig. 3 and S3.† The different compositions of the CBM and VBM charge densities suggest that electron–hole pairs can be easily generated and separated, further indicating that carriers are easily transported, which suggest that there is a potential advantage for achieving high PCE for solar cells based on these perovskites. The PCEs of the single-junction solar cells based on these perovskites are further estimated by placing these PCE values on the PCE curve (see Fig. 4B). The PCEs of 31.83%, 31.64% and 33.66% are obtained for the single-junction solar cells based on the cubic H5O2GeI3, H5O2SnI3 and H5O2SnI2BH4 perovskites, respectively. The three PCE values lay on the endpoints of the optimal PCE curve respectively, which suggests that obtaining the highest PCEs is feasible by controlling the proportion of BH4 superhalogens and I atoms laying in the scale of 0–0.5, because that the average direct band gaps of 1.00–1.54 eV can be obtained by controlling this proportion (see Tables 1 and S1†). However, the cubic H5O2Sn(BH4)3 and H5O2Ge(BH4)3 perovskites only show below the PCE of 2.21%, because of the average direct band gap >3.30 eV. These PCE results suggest that, for a single-junction solar cell, the cubic H5O2MI3 and H5O2MI2BH4 perovskites with a PCE above 19.00% can also be used as the light absorbing material. Therefore, the model of a single-junction solar cell based on the H5O2MI3 and H5O2MI2BH4 perovskites is shown in Fig. 4C.

Experimental section
Calculation parameters
To obtain the ground-state structures of the cubic H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x (M = Ge and Sn; x = 0, 1, 2, and 3) perovskites with different orientations of superatoms and an unit cell, the Pullay stress of 0 GPa and the external pressure below 0.005 GPa were ensured by changing their lattice parameters, and the VASP code containing the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBE-GGA) and the projected augmented wave (PAW) method were employed during geometrical optimizations.41–43 In order to accurately evaluate the interaction between the H5O2 ion and the MIx(BH4)3−x framework, we also considered the non-local van der Waals interactions (vdW) with Grimmer's DFT+D2 correction.44 For the SCF cycle, an atomic force below 0.02 eV Å−1, a tolerance of 10−5 eV, and a cutoff energy of 520 eV were set during the geometrical optimization. The valence states of H (1s1), B (2s22p1), O (2s22p4), Ge (4s24p2), Sn (5s25p2) and I (5s25p5) were adopted for constructing PAW potentials. Moreover, we used the Monkhorst–Pack45 sampling with a 4 × 4 × 4 k-point mesh during the geometrical optimization. For the electronic structure calculations, the 8 × 8 × 8 k-point, an atomic force below 0.01 eV Å−1, the standard HSE06 functional with 43% exact Hartree–Fock exchange including the SOC effect and vdW correction were employed, because we noted that a direct band gap of 1.50 eV of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite was obtained using the same calculation method in the previous report,46 and the value is very close to the band gap of 1.51–1.52 eV in the experiment.47 The occupied orbitals of BH4− and I− anions were calculated by the DFT method using the Gaussian 09 software, and the B3LYP/6-311++g(3df,3pd) and B3LYP/LANL2DZ levels48,49 were employed for the two anions, respectively.

Ab initio molecular dynamics simulation
The AIMD simulations of the cubic CsPbI3, H5O2SnI3, H5O2SnI(BH4)2, H5O2Sn(BH4)3 perovskites with a 3 × 3 × 3 supercell were performed using the PBE-GGA and the PAW method implemented in VASP codes. In order to save computing costs, a 3 × 3 × 2 supercell was used for the AIMD simulations of other H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites. The change in lattice parameters of all perovskites were allowed by set ISIF = 3 during the AIMD simulation, and Langevin thermostat50 was used for the Parrinello–Rahman dynamics of constant pressure and temperature. A time step of 1 fs, a temperature of 300 K, and an external pressure of 105 Pa were set. After AIMD simulation of 5 ps, the atomic trajectory data were collected every 10 fs. Another parameter setting is consistent with the geometrical optimizations of the perovskites. To further explore the orientations of superatoms for the effect of optoelectronic properties, after AIMD simulation of 5 ps, the DOSs of some cubic perovskites with a supercell and various orientations of superatoms were calculated using the PBE-GGA including the vdW correction (see Fig. S8†).
Material property calculation
To obtain a simple and effective estimation for the stability and distortion of the cubic H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites, the Goldschmidt tolerance factor,51, were employed, where rA, rB and rX are the average radius of H5O2+, the radii of Ge2+ and Sn2+, and the radii of I− and BH4−, respectively. The Shannon ionic-radii33 were employed for Ge2+, Sn2+, and I− ions. The formation energy (Ef) of the H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites was defined as Ef = [Et − EH5O2 − μM − xEI − (3 − x)EBH4]/5, where Et, EH5O2, EI, EBH4, and μM are the total energies of the perovskites, single H5O2 superalkali, single I atom, single BH4 superhalogen, and the chemical potentials of Ge/Sn in its bulk phase, respectively. Herein, 5 is the total number of superalkalis, superhalogens, M and I atoms in a unit cell. Effective carrier masses (m*) of all perovskites were calculated using the equation, , where ℏ, k and ε(k) are the reduced Planck constant, the wave vector and the energy eigenvalue, respectively. The k values from 0 to 0.01 bohr were used for the finite difference method52 in the calculation of effective carrier masses. To estimate the characteristics of electron–hole pair separation for H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites, the exciton binding energy within the weak Mott–Wannier model was calculated using the equation,53–55, where ε0, ,  and εs are the dielectric constant of vacuum, hole effective masses, electron effective masses, and static dielectric constants including local field effects, respectively.

The parameters, namely, the open circuit voltage (Voc), the maximum short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCE (η), of the single-junction solar cells based on the cubic H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites were calculated using their average direct band gaps. A solar cell usually has the thermodynamic loss, the radiative and non-radiative recombination loss, but the loss based on the detailed balance limit without the non-radiative recombination was only considered to obtain the assessment for the maximum PCE of these single-junction solar cells. We assumed that all photons with an energy higher than Eg were absorbed totally, and a photon can promote the generation of an electron–hole pair. The Jsc was calculated by the equation,56,57, where e, E and S(E) are the electronic charge, the incident photon energy and the radiant energy on earth per unit area, respectively. The detailed balance limit proposed by the previous work58 was employed to estimate the PCEs of the cubic H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites. The fill factor and the power conversion efficiency were calculated by the two equations of  and , respectively, where Ps can be calculated using the solar spectrum data, which is offered by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.59
Conclusions
In summary, for the first time, we have systematically explored the dynamics performances and electronic structures of cubic H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x (M = Ge and Sn; x = 0, 1, 2, and 3) perovskites by combining DFT with AIMD calculations. The calculated results indicated that the H5O2MIx(BH4)3−x perovskites can show stable dynamics performance during the AIMD simulation of 5 ps at 105 Pa and 300 K, tunable average direct band gaps of 1.00–3.43 eV with the change of BH4 superhalogens, negative formation energies and small effective electron and hole masses of 0.18–0.70 me and 0.17–0.59 me, respectively. The exciton binding energies of 32.00–139.00 meV were obtained for the cubic H5O2MI3 and H5O2MI2BH4 perovskites, and the single-junction solar cells based on the two cubic perovskites can show a PCE above 19.00%, when only the detailed balance limit is considered. As far as we know, the ABX3-type lead-free superatom perovskites with high efficiency and stable dynamics performance are first obtained by introducing superalkalis and superhalogens, which may pave the way for developing other lead-free superatom perovskites by the same strategy.
