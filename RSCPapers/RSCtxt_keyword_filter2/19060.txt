    , Accepted 28th August 2018First published on 28th August 2018AbstractHerein, the synthesis of three covalently linked donor–acceptor zinc porphyrin–fullerene (ZnP–C60) dyads (C60trZnPCOOH, C60trZnPtrCOOH and C60ZnPCOOH) is described, and their application as sensitizers in NiO-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) is discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example where covalently linked ZnP–C60 dyads have been used as chromophores in NiO-based DSCs. In an effort to examine whether the distance of the chromophore from the electron acceptor entity and/or the NiO surface affects the performance of the cells, a triazole ring was introduced as a spacer between ZnP and the two peripheral units C60 and –COOH. The triazole ring was inserted between ZnP and C60 in dyad C60trZnPCOOH, whereas both the anchoring group and C60 were connected to ZnP through triazole spacers in C60trZnPtrCOOH, and dyad C60ZnPCOOH did not contain any triazole linker. Photophysical investigation performed by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy in solution and on the NiO surface demonstrated that all the porphyrin–fullerene dyads exhibited long-lived charge-separated states due to electron shifts from the reduced porphyrin core to C60. The transient experiments performed in solution showed that the presence of triazole ring influenced the photophysical properties of the dyads C60trZnPCOOH and C60trZnPtrCOOH and in particular, increased the lifetime of the charge-separated states compared to that of the C60ZnPCOOH dyad. On the other hand, the corresponding studies on the NiO surface proved that the triazole spacer has a rather moderate impact on the charge separation (NiO–ZnP˙+–C60˙−) and charge recombination (NiO–3*ZnP–C60) rate constants. All three dyads exhibited enhanced performance in terms of photovoltaic measurements with more than threefold increase compared to the reference compound PhtrZnPCOOH in which the C60 acceptor is absent. Two different electrolytes were examined (I3−/I− and CoIII/II) and in most cases, the presence of the triazole ring enhanced their photovoltaic performance. The best performing dyad in I3−/I− was C60trZnPCOOH (PCE = 0.076%); in CoIII/II, the best performing dyad was C60trZnPtrCOOH (PCE = 0.074%).
Introduction
Over the last decade, a worldwide necessity for inexhaustible and sustainable energy sources has dominated scientific interest. In the preceding years, excessive combustion of fossil fuels has triggered serious global environmental issues.1,2 To minimize the consumption of fossil fuels, it is imperative to increase the usage of exploitable and abundant energy sources, namely, renewable energy sources.3,4 To this end, huge efforts have been devoted for developing environmentally friendly technologies such as photovoltaic systems, which are capable of sufficiently converting solar energy into electricity.5–7
The development of photoelectrochemical devices based on the sensitization of a p-type semiconductor (p-SC) remains an important challenge since these systems can find applications in photovoltaic devices and artificial photosynthesis.8–11 In this context, nickel oxide (NiO) is one of the most commonly used p-SCs for both p-type dye-sensitized solar cells (p-DSCs)12–15 and dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthetic cells (DSPECs).16–20 Various families of sensitizers have already been synthesized and investigated in p-DSCs.21 The best performing NiO-based p-DSC was recently reported by Perera et al., which exhibited an overall power conversion efficiency of 2.51%.22 Porphyrinic compounds are a class of chromophores that have been employed extensively in DSCs23–32 due to their unique features and decisive role in photosynthesis.33–37 Despite the outstanding performance of porphyrins in n-type DSCs (Grätzel cells based on TiO2),31,36,38,39 these dyes are disappointingly inefficient in p-DSCs.23–29 The major reason is the ultra-fast charge recombination (CR), which heavily limits the photocurrent density and voltage delivered by the solar cell.23–25 It was previously demonstrated that the presence of a secondary electron acceptor appended to the sensitizer could diminish CR, thereby enhancing the performance of a poorly performing sensitizer.13,40–42 Fullerene is a well-known electron acceptor, which is used abundantly with various chromophores (including porphyrins) to prepare multi-component systems for photoinduced charge separation.43–51 This concept was recently demonstrated by Tian et al. who reported a supramolecular assembly of an electron donor zinc-porphyrin with an electron acceptor fullerene C60.29
In the present study, we report for the first time the synthesis of three differently modified novel porphyrin–fullerene dyads (C60trZnPCOOH, C60trZnPtrCOOH and C60ZnPCOOH). The new dyads (Chart 1) are composed of zinc porphyrin (ZnP) linked to fullerene (C60) and contain a benzoic acid anchoring group to immobilize these systems on the NiO surface. In general, the distance of the chromophore from either the electron acceptor entity or the surface of the semiconductor determines the performance of such devices to a large extent.21 Thus, to examine the effect of the distance and also to determine optimal combination, a triazole ring was introduced as a spacer between zinc-porphyrin and the two peripheral units, namely, fullerene and anchoring group. The presence of a triazole spacer between porphyrin and the linked donor and acceptor components has already been reported to be beneficial during charge transfer processes.43,49,52 Finally, to compare the photovoltaic properties and the photo-physical characteristics of our dyads, a new reference porphyrin PhtrZnPCOOH (Chart 1) was synthesized.

Photovoltaic measurements revealed that the power conversion efficiencies of the dyads were enhanced more than three times compared to that of the reference PhtrZnPCOOH@NiO, which can be due to the presence of the C60 electron acceptor. These findings were also supported by the results of photophysical studies using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy in solution and on NiO electrodes. The dyads exhibited longer charge-separated states on the NiO surface compared to the reference PhtrZnPCOOH due to electron shifts from the reduced ZnP to the fullerene unit.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis of the porphyrin–fullerene dyad C60trZnPCOOH containing a triazole spacer between ZnP and C60 is illustrated in Scheme 1. The formation of aldehyde-porphyrin (3) was achieved via a click reaction between azide-porphyrin (1)53 and ethynyl-benzaldehyde (2) catalyzed by copper iodide. The next step involved the hydrolysis of porphyrin (3) using an aqueous solution of KOH in a THF/MeOH reaction mixture. Finally, the desired product (C60trZnPCOOH) was obtained by a Prato reaction using fullerene (4) and sarcosine.

To prepare C60trZnPtrCOOH (Scheme 2), we used di-azido-porphyrin (5) as the initial compound, which was synthesized following the procedure described by Beletskaya and co-workers with slight modifications in the purification method.54 Then, two sequential click reactions were performed between porphyrin 5 and alkyne compounds 2 and 6. The desired porphyrin 7 was separated from the other two porphyrin derivatives with a yield of 42%. Finally, hydrolysis of the ester group and consequently a Prato reaction were carried out on porphyrin 7, leading to the desired C60trZnPtrCOOH dyad.

The synthetic process of the porphyrin–fullerene dyad C60ZnPCOOH, in which the two peripheral units, namely, C60 and anchoring group are directly linked to the porphyrin macrocycle, is illustrated in Scheme 3. First, dipyrromethane 8 was reacted with mesityl-aldehyde 9 in an acid-catalyzed condensation reaction, as reported by Balaban, Gryko and coworkers,55 resulting in the formation of porphyrin 10. This intermediate derivative was characterized in solid state using single-crystal X-ray crystallography (Fig. 1 and Tables S1, S2, ESI†). The compound exhibited a planar molecular structure with two-fold symmetry, and the two mesityl-groups were oriented almost perpendicularly to the porphyrin ring (making dihedral angles of 81.01°). All bond distances and angles were found to be within the usual ranges for analogous meso-substituted porphyrins. Porphyrin 10 was then transformed to the corresponding di-bromo-porphyrin 11 using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS). Porphyrin 14 was prepared by two Suzuki cross-coupling reactions with compound 11 and the relevant boronic acid derivatives 12 and 13. The formed porphyrin 14 was first metallated with zinc and then, the hydrolysis of the ester group was carried out. The corresponding carboxylic acid derivative was used finally for the formation of C60ZnPCOOHvia a Prato reaction with fullerene (4) and sarcosine.

In Scheme 4, the synthesis of the reference porphyrin PhtrZnPCOOH is presented. Notably, porphyrin 15, which was used as the precursor molecule, was synthesized according to a previously published procedure.56 The desired product (PhtrZnPCOOH) was obtained by a click reaction between porphyrin 15 and alkyne-derivative 16 using the same experimental conditions stated above.

The successful formation of the three porphyrin–fullerene dyads as well as the reference compound was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy (1H and 13C) and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. In addition, all the intermediate porphyrin derivatives were fully characterized (Fig. S1–S34, ESI†). In the 1H NMR spectra of the final dyads, the characteristic proton signals of the triazole ring appeared at 9.15 ppm for C60trZnPCOOH and at 9.16 and 9.28 ppm for C60trZnPtrCOOH. Moreover, in the 13C NMR spectra, the peaks corresponding to the unsubstituted carbon of the formed triazole ring were detected at 119.27 ppm for C60trZnPCOOH and at 119.41 and 119.73 for C60trZnPtrCOOH. In addition, in the 1H NMR spectra of the final dyads, we observed the proton signal of the carboxylic acid unit at around 11.5 ppm, whereas the proton peaks of the formed pyrolidine ring were located in the range of 5.4–4.3 ppm.
Photophysical investigations in solution
Photophysical studies were performed on the corresponding methyl ester derivatives C60trZnPCOOCH3, C60trZnPtrCOOCH3, C60ZnPCOOCH3 and PhtrZnPCOOCH3 (Scheme S1, ESI†) since these derivatives presented higher solubility in various solvents. UV-Vis spectra of all the compounds exhibited a Soret band and a set of Q-bands, which are typical features of meso-substituted zinc porphyrin derivatives.57–59 In particular, in all cases, an intense Soret band developed around 432 nm, followed by two less intense Q-bands located in the 560–607 nm range (Table S3, ESI†). Additionally, for all the porphyrin–fullerene dyads (ZnP–C60), an additional broad band was observed at 330 nm, which was assigned to the fullerene moiety.60 Although the absorption spectra of all the dyads red-shifted slightly compared to that of the reference compounds, these can be described as the superimposition of the absorption spectra of ZnP and C60. Interestingly, the extinction coefficients observed for C60trZnPCOOCH3, C60trZnPtrCOOCH3 and C60ZnPCOOCH3 were substantially lower than that of PhtrZnPCOOCH3 (Fig. 2), but such observations were already reported previously by others for ZnP–C60-based systems.61,62
 Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of C60trZnPCOOCH3 (red), C60trZnPtrCOOCH3 (green), C60ZnPCOOCH3 (blue) and PhtrZnPCOOCH3 (black) in benzonitrile. 
First insights into the potential electron donor–acceptor interactions in the ZnP–C60 dyads were obtained from fluorescence studies. Both reference compounds (PhtrZnPCOOCH3 and PhtrZnPCOOH) exhibited strong emissions in the range between 520 and 750 nm in benzonitrile, with two maxima at 611 and 660 nm (Fig. 3). The fluorescence quantum yield and the lifetime of PhtrZnPCOOCH3 in benzonitrile were found to be 0.026 and 2.28 ns, respectively. Although the shapes of the emission spectra of all dyads were practically identical to those observed for their reference derivatives (Fig. 3), the fluorescence quantum yields that were calculated were significantly quenched. For example, in the case of C60trZnPtrCOOCH3, fluorescence quantum yields of 0.0033 (toluene), 0.0027 (anisole) and 0.0023 (benzonitrile) were found (for detailed listing, please see Table S4, ESI†). Quenching of fluorescence suggests another decay channel, i.e., electron transfer or energy transfer, which starts from the first excited singlet state of porphyrin in ZnP–C60 dyads.

To investigate the nature of the observed fluorescence quenching, femtosecond transient absorption measurements were recorded by photoexcitation of all the samples at 430 nm. Initially, PhtrZnPCOOCH3 was studied, providing insights into S1–SN transitions. Upon photoexcitation at 430 nm, the excited singlet state was formed immediately, revealing transient maxima at 460, 585, 635, 785 and 1300 nm and minima at 565, 610 and 655 nm (Fig. 4). These transient absorptions decayed with a lifetime of 2.0 ns and gave rise to new transient absorption bands with maxima at 455, 585, 640 and 850 nm and minima at 560 and 610 nm. These new transient absorptions correlated to the triplet excited state signature of PhtrZnPCOOCH3.

(b) Corresponding time–absorption profiles at 850 nm (black) and 1300 nm (red). 
Upon photoexcitation at 430 nm of the methyl-ester dyads C60trZnPCOOCH3, C60trZnPtrCOOCH3, and C60ZnPCOOCH3 (Fig. 5 and Fig. S35, S36, ESI†), the same ZnP singlet excited characteristics were observed despite the presence of the electron accepting C60. This confirmed the successful excitation of ZnP moiety in the dyad systems. In contrast to the intersystem crossing noted for PhtrZnPCOOCH3 (Fig. 4), the ZnP singlet excited state signatures decayed rather quickly. For example, in benzonitrile, the ZnP singlet excited state features decay with lifetimes of 96 ps (C60trZnPCOOCH3), 80 ps (C60trZnPtrCOOCH3) and 12 ps (C60ZnPCOOCH3) (Table S5 summarizes the singlet first excited state lifetimes in other solvents, ESI†). The lifetimes of the singlet excited states depend on the linkage between ZnP and C60 moieties as well as the solvent polarity (i.e., toluene > anisole > THF > benzonitrile), and the results agreed with the observations from the fluorescence experiments. Simultaneously, with the decay of the ZnP singlet excited state, new transient peaks appeared with distinct maxima at 465, 590, 635, 785, 890 and 1020 nm. While the maxima at 465, 590, 635, 785 and 890 nm were due to the one-electron-oxidized ZnP radical cation,63 the maximum at 1020 nm matched the absorption of the one-electron-reduced fullerene radical anion,43 corroborating the formation of an intramolecular radical ion pair. In benzonitrile, the features of the radical ion pair state decayed back to the ground state with lifetimes of 1030 ps (C60trZnPCOOCH3), 1250 ps (C60trZnPtrCOOCH3) and 217 ps (C60ZnPCOOCH3) (Table S6 lists the charge-separated state lifetimes in other solvents, ESI†). On the other hand, in non-polar solvents, such as toluene, decay of the charge-separated state into the ZnP-centered triplet first excited state was noted.

(b) Corresponding time–absorption profiles at 1017 nm (black) and 1300 nm (red). 
For the carboxylic acid-containing compounds C60trZnPCOOH, C60trZnPtrCOOH, C60ZnPCOOH and PhtrZnPCOOH, transient absorption spectroscopy provided strong evidence supporting the charge transfer mechanism between photoexcited ZnP and C60. Fig. S37 (ESI†) shows the transient absorption changes that correlate with the ZnP singlet excited state in PhtrZnPCOOH. An instantaneous broad transient absorption spectrum with maxima at 465, 590, 635, 700 and 1300 nm was formed. Transient minima, on the other hand, were seen around 560 nm and 665 nm at a spectral range dominated by the ground state absorption of PhtrZnPCOOH. These transient absorptions decayed rather slowly (within 2.2 ns) via intersystem crossing to the corresponding triplet manifold. In the electron donor–acceptor systems of C60trZnPCOOH, C60trZnPtrCOOH, and C60ZnPCOOH, upon photoexcitation with femtosecond laser pulses at 430 nm, the same transient absorptions were seen as the ones noted in the case of the reference, indicating the formation of the ZnP-centered singlet first excited state. Furthermore, the singlet excited state in all three dyads decayed rapidly with lifetimes of 81 ps (C60trZnPCOOH), 85 ps (C60trZnPtrCOOH) and <5 ps (C60ZnPCOOH) in benzonitrile (for a detailed listing of the lifetimes, please see Table S5, ESI†), giving rise to a new set of transient absorptions matching the ZnP˙+–C60˙− charge-separated state, which has already been profoundly reported in literature.43 For example, the transient absorption spectra obtained for C60trZnPtrCOOH in benzonitrile are depicted in Fig. 6 (for C60trZnPCOOH and C60ZnPCOOH, please see Fig. S38 and S39, respectively, ESI†). The ZnP˙+–C60˙− charge-separated state decayed back to the ground state. In benzonitrile, lifetimes of 1260 ps (C60trZnPCOOH), 1350 ps (C60trZnPtrCOOH) and 180 ps (C60ZnPCOOH) for the charge-separated state were calculated (for a detailed listing of the lifetimes in other solvents, please see Table S6, ESI†).

(b) Corresponding time–absorption profiles at 1017 nm (black) and 1300 nm (red). 
Electrochemical study
Redox potentials of the four new systems were recorded by cyclic voltammetry in THF (Table S7, ESI†). The first reduction potential was located on the fullerene moiety at around −0.4 V, which was lower than the reduction potential of the ZnP moiety. This indicated that the electron shift reaction (+NiO/−ZnP–C60 → +NiO/−ZnP–C60−) is a very exergonic process.
Based on the calculations of the driving forces of the injection and regeneration reactions, it is clear that these processes are thermodynamically favorable for all the four dyes with both electrolytes (Table 1). Thus, these chromophores possess all the required characteristics and can be incorporated as sensitizers in p-DSCs.

DFT results
In an attempt to investigate the molecular and electronic structures of all the synthesized porphyrin–fullerene dyads, computational studies were performed. Particularly, Density Functional Theory (DFT)64 calculations were carried out at the B3LYP65 level of theory using LANL2DZ and 6-31G(d) for Zn and lighter atoms, respectively. The gas phase optimized structures of the three porphyrin–fullerene dyads C60trZnPCOOH, C60trZnPtrCOOH and C60ZnPCOOH are depicted in Fig. S40 (ESI†), whereas their corresponding coordinates are listed in Tables S8–S10 (ESI†). As presented in Fig. S40 (ESI†), in both dyads containing triazole spacers (C60trZnPCOOH and C60trZnPtrCOOH), the porphyrin framework adopted a perpendicular orientation with respect to the triazole ring. In a similar way, the porphyrin core in C60ZnPCOOH was also nearly perpendicular to the phenyl rings that were connected at its meso-positions. Additionally, in all dyads, the bridging phenyl rings as well as the 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl groups were almost vertical to the porphyrin macrocycle. Finally, in each porphyrin–fullerene dyad, the Zn atom was co-planar with the four pyrrole rings.
The electron density distributions regarding the HOMO and LUMO orbitals of C60trZnPCOOH, C60trZnPtrCOOH and C60ZnPCOOH are illustrated in Fig. 7. In each dyad, the HOMO orbital is predominantly located on the porphyrin ring with some additional distribution over the meso-substituents (phenyl and 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl groups). As expected, the LUMO orbital is positioned entirely on the fullerene moiety. These distributions suggest that the donor–acceptor description of these dyads is consistent since ZnP acts as the electron donor (D) and the fullerene entity acts as the electron acceptor (A). Thus, upon photoexcitation, the intramolecular electron transfer from ZnP to C60 is favorable. Moreover, we calculate the dipole moments (μ) of C60trZnPCOOH, C60trZnPtrCOOH and C60ZnPCOOH. A larger dipole moment value indicates improved electron transfer ability. Indeed, the μ values are found to be 7.81 D for C60trZnPCOOH, 9.05 D for C60trZnPtrCOOH and 3.21 D for C60ZnPCOOH, which are in accordance with the enhanced photovoltaic performance and the longer charge-separated state lifetime of C60trZnPtrCOOH.

Photovoltaic study
The three dyads along with the reference ZnP were used as sensitizers for the fabrication of NiO-based p-DSCs (see experimental part for details). Two different electrolytes, namely, the classical iodide/triiodide and the tris(4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2-bipyridine) cobalt complex were investigated as redox couples. The metrics of the solar cells are summarized in Table 2, and the current/voltage characteristics are presented in Fig. S41 and S42 (ESI†).

The photovoltaic performances of these porphyrins are quite similar to those recorded for NiO with other reported zinc porphyrin dyads,25,27–29 but they are relatively lower compared to that of efficient non-porphyrin-based sensitizers.21 This low performance can be due to the very fast charge recombination, a reason which was previously highlighted by other groups with porphyrin dyes on NiO.23–25 It is important to recall that the cobalt electrolyte requires dyes that display long-lived charge-separated states (NiO+/dye−), because Co(III) is a slow electron acceptor owing to the large reorganization energy that accompanies the spin change from Co(III) to Co(II).66 However, cobalt polypyridine complexes are indeed larger molecules than iodide and triiodide and consequently, they display lower diffusion coefficients.67 As a result, mass diffusion necessarily limits photocurrent density, especially under high light irradiation. This factor can also explain the lower photocurrent density measured with cobalt electrolyte compared to that with the iodide one. Surface coverage by the dyes can also impact interfacial charge recombination since a close dye packing can introduce charge transfer resistance with the electrolyte.68 The larger Voc values recorded for the dyads C60trZnPtrCOOH and C60trZnPCOOH may originate from different dye organization on the surface, which prevents the approach of the redox mediator from the NiO surface. The dyads C60trZnPCOOH, C60trZnPtrCOOH and C60ZnPCOOH exhibit higher photovoltaic performances than reference PhtrZnPCOOH. The presence of the C60 electron acceptor leads to enhanced overall lifetime of the reduced dye that is immediately formed after hole injection (see photophysical study below). This is clearly noticeable by the large increase in the Jsc and Voc values of the dyads compared to those recorded with PhtrZnPCOOH. This trend is even more evident when the cobalt electrolyte is incorporated. These dyads can be compared to a similar porphyrin dyad ZnP-NDI employing naphthalene diimide (NDI) as the electron acceptor in the place of the fullerene moiety or to the supramolecular assembly ZnP-PyC60 reported by Sun, Rensmo and co-workers (please see Fig. S40 (ESI†) for structures and Table 2 for data). Interestingly, the dyads with fullerene as the electron acceptor display higher performances than ZnP-NDI, which is most certainly due to the lower reorganization energy of C60 compared to that of NDI, thus favoring a longer lived charge-separated state.69 The fact that the fullerene unit is harder to reduce makes it a valuable alternative to NDI in the reduction of redox mediators with more negative reduction potential or for the activation of catalysts in DSPECs. Furthermore, appending fullerene with covalent bond as in the case of these dyads does not lead to higher efficiency, thus supporting the advantage of metallo-supramolecular interactions to connect with the electron acceptor component. The number and the position of the triazole rings slightly influence the photovoltaic properties of the dyads since C60ZnPCOOH that does not contain any triazole moieties exhibited the lowest overall efficiency. However, the photovoltaic performances of the dyads are quite similar, because the quantum yield of the charge-separated state formation (about 42%) and the lifetime (about 2 ns) are comparable in the three systems.
Photophysical investigations on NiO surfaces
In an effort to support the results from the photovoltaic measurements, we recorded the transient absorption spectra of the carboxylic acid-bearing compounds C60trZnPCOOH, C60trZnPtrCOOH, C60ZnPCOOH and PhtrZnPCOOH deposited on NiO films. The spectra obtained from femtosecond and nanosecond laser photolysis upon photoexcitation at 430 nm showed a more complex picture. The transient absorption signatures of the ZnP singlet first excited state and the ZnP˙+–C60˙− charge-separated state were discernible, but the singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis of the femtosecond transient absorption spectra using Glotaran70 (Fig. 8 for C60trZnPtrCOOH@NiO and Fig. S43, S44 and S45 for C60trZnPCOOH@NiO, C60ZnPCOOH@NiO and PhtrZnPCOOH@NiO, respectively, ESI†) showed the presence of five individual spectral components. Based on previous reports on electron donor–acceptor molecules on NiO films,24,42,71–73 these spectral components were assigned to NiO–1*ZnP–C60, NiO+–ZnP˙−–C60, NiO–ZnP˙+–C60˙−, (NiO–ZnP)(h+,VB)+–C60˙−, (NiO–ZnP)(h+,TR)+–C60˙− and NiO–3*ZnP–C60.§ Since all the spectral components did not decay within the time range of our femtosecond transient absorption system (8 ns), nanosecond transient absorption measurements were also conducted. SVD analysis of the nanosecond transient absorption spectra revealed three spectral components (Fig. S46–S48, ESI†). The first spectral component decaying within 8 ns was due to the sum of the first four components from the SVD analysis of the femtosecond transient absorption spectra. These were obtained in the SVD analysis of the nanosecond transient absorption spectra as one “joint” spectral component. In agreement with the literature results,24,42,71–73 the most feasible rationals for the other two components were (NiO–ZnP)(h+,TR)+–C60˙− and NiO–3*ZnP–C60. The first one was a charge-separated state between an NiO hole residing in a trapped state (TR) and an electron in C60. This assumption was supported by the fact that a fullerene radical anion transient is observed with lifetime up to 70 ns and an additional rising transient signal around 460 nm.72 This signal showed different features at 460 nm with respect to the previously formed (NiO–ZnP)(h+,VB)+–C60˙−, where the hole resides in the valence band (VB). According to Hammarström and co-workers,72 this spectral component corresponds to (NiO–ZnP)(h+,TR)+–C60˙−. This Ni4+ signal with unique features at 380, 400 and 430 nm and lifetimes in the range of several tens of nanoseconds matched the transients and lifetimes obtained by the SVD analysis perfectly.72,73 From the analysis of the time evolution of the transient absorption spectra, a complex kinetic model (Fig. 9) related to the formation and decay of the individual spectral components was derived. The rate constants for the individual decay channels are listed in Table 3. In the case of PhtrZnPCOOH@NiO (Fig. S45, ESI†), a hole injection lifetime of 3.6 ps and a hole recombination lifetime of 50 ps were calculated. These values were used in the kinetic model as k1 and k8 for C60trZnPCOOH@NiO and C60ZnPCOOH@NiO since these two dyads exhibited similar structural characteristics to those of the reference compound. More specifically, all of them lacked triazole ring between the porphyrin and the NiO surface. Notably, these measurements closely resembled lifetime values previously published by Hammarström, Odobel and co-workers for porphyrin-based donor–acceptor systems.24 For C60trZnPtrCOOH@NiO, where k1 and k8 could not be taken directly from the reference derivative, rate constants of the same order of magnitude were obtained, indicating the reliability of our kinetic model.

The time profiles of the transient absorption spectra of C60trZnPCOOH, C60trZnPtrCOOH and C60ZnPCOOH deposited on NiO and the rate constants derived from them provided important information. Remarkably, similar rate constants were found for all three dyads except the rate constant for the recombination of NiO+–ZnP˙−–C60 back to the ground state (k8). More specifically, the rate constant k8 calculated for C60trZnPtrCOOH indicated that the triazole linker between ZnP and NiO led to an increased lifetime of the NiO+–ZnP˙−–C60 charge-separated state. This is most likely due to a prolonged special separation between ZnP˙− and NiO+. In contrary to the results obtained from the studies in solution (vide supra), the triazole linker positioned between ZnP and C60 exhibited a rather moderate impact on the charge separation (NiO–ZnP˙+–C60˙−) and the charge recombination (NiO–3*ZnP–C60) rate constants. Also, the impact of triazole linkers on the NiO+–ZnP–C60˙− recombination was marginal. A feasible explanation for the latter is that C60 bent towards the NiO surface so that the recombination of the hole in NiO+ and the electron in C60˙− occurred via a through-space electron transfer mechanism.
Photophysical studies performed on the NiO surface revealed that up to 2/3 of the excitation energy leads to the formation of NiO+–ZnP˙−–C60 and only 1/3 leads to NiO–ZnP˙+–C60˙− as the initial charge-separated state (compare k1 and k2 in Fig. 8 and Table 3). Moreover, this study highlights the importance of the molecular design and the linkage between NiO and ZnP in the processes that regulate the lifetime and the efficiency of the charge transfer. For the development of efficient systems, we should suppress the formation of the NiO+–ZnP˙−–C60 state while simultaneously allowing hole transfer to form the NiO+–ZnP–C60˙− charge-separated state. More specifically, this can be achieved through the decrease in the k1 and k8 rate constants while also favoring the reaction pathways k2 and k3. However, the occurrence of the hole shift (k4) with an acceptably high rate constant has to be ensured. Detailed knowledge about the complex photophysical processes taking place in NiO–ZnP–C60 (and most likely in any similar system) will also enable optimization of molecular design in such type of systems.
Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized three novel covalently linked zinc porphyrin–fullerene dyads and investigated their performance as sensitizers in NiO-based p-DSCs. The optical and electrochemical properties of all the chromophores were determined to gain insights concerning their ability to act as sensitizers in p-DSCs. Transient absorption spectroscopy by means of femtosecond laser photolysis in solution was applied for all dyes, providing strong evidence for a charge transfer mechanism between the photoexcited ZnP and C60; this led to the formation of a charge-separated state (ZnP˙+–C60˙−). Dyads in which the triazole spacer was introduced between ZnP and C60 (C60trZnPCOOH and C60trZnPtrCOOH) presented higher lifetimes compared to dyad C60ZnPCOOH, where the C60 unit is directly linked to ZnP. Moreover, we conducted for the first time the photophysical investigation of such ZnP–C60 dyads by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy after deposition on NiO. These studies revealed longer lifetimes for the charge-separated states than that measured for reference PhtrZnPCOOH. Another important finding from this study is that the injected hole in NiO was significantly delocalized on the porphyrin π-system, thus explaining the rather large rate constant for the charge recombination reaction.
All ZnP–C60 dyads exhibited higher photovoltaic performances (increased Jsc and Voc values) than the reference dye due to the electron shift from the porphyrin core to the fullerene unit. This finding was in perfect agreement with the results of photophysical studies, in which the presence of electron acceptor (C60) led to an enhanced overall lifetime of the reduced dye formed after hole injection. This study highlights the importance of using donor–acceptor systems in NiO-based DSCs since they lead to enhanced overall photovoltaic performance. Furthermore, dyads C60trZnPCOOH and C60trZnPtrCOOH presented higher efficiencies compared to C60ZnPCOOH, suggesting that the presence of the triazole spacer improves their photovoltaic parameters. Finally, the reported ZnP–C60 dyads displayed higher performances than the benchmark ZnP-NDI dye28 since the C60 entity favors a longer life of the charge-separated state due to its lower reorganization energy.
This is the first attempt to develop covalently linked porphyrin–fullerene dyads as sensitizers in p-type DSCs. The findings from this study highlight the importance of developing novel porphyrin-based donor–acceptor sensitizers for NiO-based p-type DSCs. More specifically, several modifications such as elongating the distance between the porphyrin macrocycle and the electron acceptor by introducing a spacer as well as testing different anchoring groups with varied lengths to decrease the charge recombination should be explored. Indeed, this approach paves the way towards better performing dyes in p-DSCs with an ultimate aim of developing efficient functional materials.
Experimental section
Materials and techniques
All reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial vendors and used without further purification unless otherwise stated. Porphyrin derivatives 1,53554 and 1556 were synthesized according to previously published procedures. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AMX-500 MHz and Bruker DPX-300 MHz spectrometers using solutions in deuterated solvents with the solvent peak as the internal standard. High-resolution mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker ultrafleXtreme MALDI-TOF/TOF spectrometer using trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene] malononitrile as the matrix. Cyclic and square wave voltammetry experiments were carried out in freshly distilled and deoxygenated tetrahydrofuran (THF) at room temperature using an AutoLab PGSTAT20 potentiostat in the presence of tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte. A three-electrode cell setup was used with platinum as the working electrode, saturated calomel (SCE) as the reference electrode and a platinum wire as the counter electrode.
X-ray crystallography
A suitable single-crystal of compound 10 (free base) was protected with paratone-N and mounted for data collection on an STOE IPDS II diffractometer equipped with an Mo-Kα sealed-tube X-ray source (λ = 0.71073 Å, graphite monochromated) and an image plate detector. Data collection, data reduction, integration, and determination of cell parameters were carried out using the STOE X-AREA package software,74 whereas numerical absorption correction was applied using STOE X-RED and X-SHAPE software packages.75,76 The structure was solved using direct methods implemented in SHELXS-201477,78 and refined using SHELXL-2014.79 All non-hydrogen atoms were successfully refined using anisotropic displacement parameters. Plots of the molecular structure of compound 10 were obtained using the Mercury program.80
Photochemistry
Steady-state UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 2 two beam spectrophotometer. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded using a FluoroMaxP spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon). The experiments were performed at room temperature. Fluorescence quantum yields were determined by the comparative method using meso-tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) (ΦF = 0.11 in toluene)81 and zinc-meso-tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP) (ΦF = 0.03 in toluene)81 as the standards. Fluorescence lifetimes were determined by the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique using Fluorolog 3 (Horiba Jobin Yvon). The sample was excited with a SuperK Extreme (NKT) laser coupled with a SuperK Extend-UV unit. The signal was detected by a Hamamatsu MCP photomultiplier (type R3809U-50). Transient absorption measurements based on femtosecond laser photolysis were performed with the output from an amplified Ti:Sapphire laser system (CPA-2101 and CPA-2110 from Clark-MXR Inc.): 1 kHz, 150 fs FWHM pulses, and laser energy of 130 nJ. The excitation wavelength of 430 nm was generated using a non-collinear optical parametric amplifier (NOPA Pulse, Clark MXR). Nanosecond transient absorption experiments were performed using an EOS spectrometer (Ultrafast Systems LLC). The pump pulses at 430 nm were from the amplified Ti:Sapphire laser systems described above. The probe pulse (2 kHz, 0.5 ns pulse width) generated in a photonic fiber was synchronized with the femtosecond amplifier.
Thin and highly transparent NiO films for transient absorption spectroscopy were prepared by the doctor-blade technique (thickness around 88 nm) according to the already described procedures.82

Fabrication of solar cells and photovoltaic measurements on NiO substrates for photophysical studies
Conductive glass substrates (F-doped SnO2) purchased from Solaronix (TEC15, sheet resistance 15 Ω square−1) were cleaned by sonication in soapy water and acidified ethanol successively for 10 min before being fired at 450 °C for 30 min.
First, a NiO compact layer was prepared by spin-coating onto the clean FTO substrates with a 0.5 M nickel acetate solution containing 0.5 M ethanolamine in methoxyethanol at 2000 rpm for 30s followed by thermal treatment at 500 °C for 0.5 h. The thickness of the NiO dense layer was measured by SEM of sliced substrates (30 ± 5 nm). Then, a NiO mesoporous layer was deposited on the dense layer by screen-printing of the above paste using a semi-automatic screen printer. The NiO paste used for screen-printing composed of 3 g of NiO nanopowder (Inframat) suspended in 10 mL of distilled ethanol was ball-milled (500 rpm) for 24 h. The resulting slurry was mixed in a round-bottom flask with 10 mL of 10 wt% ethanoic ethyl cellulose (Sigma Aldrich) solution and 20 mL terpineol, followed by slow ethanol removal by rotary evaporation. Two layers of mesoporous NiO were subsequently screen printed with intermediate drying of the films. The dried films were first calcined in air at 400 °C for 0.5 h. Finally, the prepared NiO electrodes (3 μm thick) were soaked in a solution of nickel acetate in ethanol (20 mM) with 1% tetraethanolamine for 30 min at 60 °C, followed by ethanol rinsing and air drying. The cells were then fired at 200 °C for 30 min. The thickness of the resulting NiO films was measured using a DEKTAK Profilometer (∼3 μm). The dried films were calcined in air at 400 °C for 0.5 h. The prepared NiO electrodes were soaked while still hot (80 °C) in a 0.2 mM solution of each dye at room temperature overnight. For C60trZnPCOOH and C60ZnPCOOH, the solvent in the dyeing bath was a mixture of Toluene/EtOH (vol/vol: 1/1); for solubility reasons, we used DMF for C60trZnPtrCOOH.
Electrolytes used were composed of 1 M lithium iodide and 0.1 M diiodine in acetonitrile for I3−/I− electrolyte and 0.1 M CoII(dtb-bpy)3, 0.1 M CoIII(dtb-bpy)3 and 0.1 M LiClO4 in propylene carbonate for cobalt complex as the redox shuttle. Platinum counter electrodes were prepared by depositing a few drops of hexachloroplatinic acid in distilled isopropanol (2 mg per mL) on FTO plates (TEC7, Solaronix). The substrates were then fired at 375 °C for 30 min. The photocathode and the counter electrode were placed on top of each other and sealed using a thin transparent film of Surlyn polymer (DuPont, 25 μm) as the spacer. A drop of electrolyte was introduced through a predrilled hole in the counter electrode by vacuum backfilling and the hole was sealed by a glass stopper with Surlyn. The cell had an active area of 0.25 cm2.
Current–voltage characteristics were determined by applying an external potential bias to the cell and measuring the photocurrent using a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. The solar simulator was an Oriel Lamp calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 with a certified silicon cell.
