    , Accepted 29th May 2015First published on 1st June 2015AbstractGraphene/silicon heterojunction solar cells have attracted intensive research interest owing to their simple device structure as well as their low-cost process capability at room temperature. However, the use of thick silicon substrates hampers their application in flexible solar cells, despite the high flexibility of graphene. Here, we report the construction of flexible graphene/silicon solar cells by taking advantage of the high flexibility of ultrathin Si substrates. By systemically optimizing the device structures, including performing surface passivation on Si, inserting a layer of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as an electron blocking layer, and controlling the layer number and doping of graphene, a power conversion efficiency of 8.42% was successfully achieved. The photovoltaic characteristics of the graphene/ultrathin silicon heterojunctions were further evaluated under bending conditions, revealing their excellent flexibility and durability. Our work paves the way for low-cost, high-performance, flexible graphene/silicon heterojunction solar cells.
Introduction
Currently, crystalline silicon (c-Si) based solar cells are dominating large portions of the commercial solar cell market on account of their material abundance, non-toxicity, superior reliability and mature technology. However, the high cost of c-Si solar cells, mainly originating from raw material consumption and complicated fabrication processes, still hinders their ubiquitous applications. In addition, conventional c-Si based solar cells are heavy and fragile due to their large thickness (∼150 μm), and are not suitable for integrating with infrastructures of various shapes and sizes where lightweight and flexibility are important.1 Therefore, new conceptual solar cells based on flexible thin c-Si substrates are rising and appealing, which have drawn considerable attention in recent years.2–4 On the other hand, the use of thin Si substrates can be an advantage for minority carriers that have a short diffusion length, which can contribute to the reduction of electron–hole recombination.5 Nevertheless, large-scale fabrication of thin c-Si substrates is a precondition for assembling photovoltaic devices and remains a challenge. So far, there have been three main methods to fabricate thin c-Si solar cells, including epitaxial growth and layer transfer,6,7 the etch-release method,8,9 and exfoliation from bulk silicon wafers,10,11 but their process sequences are complicated and the sizes of thin c-Si substrates are also restricted. Recent advances demonstrated the fabrication of large-area ultrathin c-Si (thickness <10 μm) at the wafer scale with good processability via an alkaline etching approach, which leads to a further step toward thin c-Si based solar cells.12 However, it is worth noting that most of the flexible thin c-Si based solar cells were fabricated by preparing conventional p–n junctions which are realized through a number of steps, such as high temperature diffusion and annealing. The complicated processes will inevitably increase the energy consumption, the cost of the devices, as well as the probable damage to thin c-Si substrates. In order to simplify the fabrication procedures and reduce the cost of thin c-Si solar cells, heterojunctions that combine abundant photovoltaic materials with thin c-Si substrates at room temperature have been developed,13–15 but a favorable efficiency has not been achieved yet.
Graphene transparent electrodes have attracted a great deal of research interest because of their extraordinary properties, including superior electrical conductivity, outstanding mechanical flexibility, high transparency and good chemical stability.16–21 The chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method can achieve large-area growth of high-quality graphene,22 greatly facilitating its applications in various areas such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), touch screens, and solar cells.23–28 Recently, graphene/c-Si heterojunction solar cells have simulated many research activities because of their easy fabrication, low-cost, and remarkable photovoltaic performance.29 Graphene/c-Si solar cells showed a low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.5% at an early stage,30 and much progress has been achieved to make their efficiency more promising.31–37 For instance, Miao et al. improved the efficiency significantly from 1.9% to 8.6% by appropriate chemical doping.32 Through surface passivation and band engineering, we demonstrated a PCE of 10.56%.34 Shi et al. adopted a layer of TiO2 as an antireflection coating to enhance the efficiency to 14.5%.36 However, the above research studies were conducted on the basis of thick c-Si wafers; flexible graphene/c-Si solar cells are yet to be demonstrated.
Herein, we report the construction of flexible graphene/silicon heterojunction solar cells by combining graphene with flexible ultrathin c-Si that was fabricated by an etching method in concentrated alkaline solution. A thin layer of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was inserted between graphene and ultrathin c-Si as an electron blocking layer to suppress the carrier recombination at the interface. The c-Si thickness and graphene layer number dependent device performance were further investigated. With an optimum graphene layer number as well as effective surface passivation on an ultrathin c-Si surface, a PCE of 8.42% has been achieved with a c-Si thickness of 40 μm. The devices also exhibited excellent stability under bending conditions. Given the low-cost solution processed capability, our results open up a new possibility for c-Si based flexible solar cells.
Experimental details
Fabrication of ultrathin c-Si
N-type double-side polished single-crystalline Si wafers (orientation (100), resistivity 1–3 Ω cm, thickness 390 μm) were used in our experiments. First, the wafers were cut into several pieces and then cleaned with deionized (DI) water, acetone, and ethanol each for 10 min by ultrasonication. After cleaning, the c-Si substrates were etched by concentrated potassium hydroxide (KOH) solutions (50 wt%) at 90 °C. By tuning the etching time from 100 min to 90 min, the thin c-Si substrates with thicknesses varying from 4 μm to 40 μm could be obtained. Finally, the as-fabricated ultrathin c-Si substrates were further cleaned with diluted hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution and DI water to remove any etchant residues.
Synthesis and transfer of graphene
Graphene was synthesized using Cu foil as a catalytic substrate by the CVD method. After annealing the Cu foil in a tube furnace at 1040 °C for 60 min, a reaction gas mixed with CH4 (10 SCCM) and H2 (100 SCCM) was introduced into the furnace for 30 min. Then the growth of graphene was carried out. After that, the furnace was cooled down quickly. The as-prepared monolayer graphene film on Cu foil was transferred onto the ultrathin Si substrates by a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-supported etching method, in which 8% PMMA solution was first spin-coated onto the graphene film and then the underlying Cu substrate was etched off by concentrated FeCl3 solution. Multi-layer graphene films were prepared by using a layer-by-layer transfer method (LBL).38 Eventually, the graphene films were rinsed with DI water several times to eliminate the surface contaminants.
Fabrication of photovoltaic devices
The obtained n-type flexible ultrathin c-Si substrates were first washed by using acetone, ethanol, DI water each for 15 min, followed by bathing with a heated piranha solution (H2SO4:H2O2 = 3:1, v/v) to further remove the residuals. Then, CH3-terminated surface modification was performed to saturate the dangling bonds of the ultrathin c-Si by a two-step chlorination/alkylation method in a glovebox.39,40 It was demonstrated that surface CH3 modification can offer excellent surface passivation on Si.33,41 After that, 10 nm P3HT used as an electron blocking layer was spin-coated on the ultrathin c-Si substrate. In order to define the functional area accurately as well as avoid the short circuit of the device, a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer (10 μm thick) with a 4 mm hole in the center was attached onto the ultrathin c-Si substrate. The PDMS layer could sever as an insulator layer between the substrate and the top electrode. Afterwards, the graphene film was transferred onto the ultrathin c-Si substrate; the contact of graphene with ultrathin c-Si within the hole region of the PDMS layer forms the graphene/silicon heterojunction. Finally, mm-thick Ag paste was adhered on the top surface of graphene around the centre hole on the PDMS layer, working as a front contact electrode for the following photovoltaic measurements, and an indium–gallium (In–Ga) eutectic alloy was pasted on the backside of the device as the rear electrode to the n-type Si substrate due to its low work function.
Characterization and measurements
The thickness of the as-fabricated ultrathin c-Si substrates was checked using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Quanta 200FEG). The absorption spectra of the ultrathin c-Si with different thicknesses were recorded using a UV-Vis spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer Lambda 750), using which the optical transmittance of graphene films was also measured. The quality of graphene was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy (Horbia Jobin-Yvon Labram HR800). The photovoltaic characteristics of the flexible graphene/c-Si heterojunction solar cells were tested using a Keithley 2612 source meter and a solar Newport 91160 simulator under AM 1.5G at an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2, calibrated by a Newport standard Si solar cell (91150). A Newport monochromator 74125 and a power meter 1918 with a Si detector 918D were used to measure the external quantum efficiency (EQE).
Results and discussion
The as-cut original silicon substrate was immersed into 50 wt% KOH solutions heated at 90 °C. The etching of KOH on Si led to the release of a large amount of gas via the reaction: Si + 2KOH + H2O = K2SiO3 + 2H2↑. By controlling the etching duration time, ultrathin Si substrates with different thicknesses were obtained. Fig. 1a presents the cross-sectional SEM image of a 6 μm-thick ultrathin Si substrate, which can be bent to almost 180° (Fig. 1b), demonstrating the good flexural flexibility. The bending capacities of ultrathin c-Si substrates with various thicknesses are shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI,† verifying that the mechanical flexibilities of the ultrathin c-Si substrates depend on their thickness with a thinner Si substrate showing better flexibility. As we know, light absorption of the c-Si substrate is insufficient when its thickness is below 180 μm. In particular, when the thickness is decreased below 10 μm, the ultrathin c-Si substrate becomes optically transparent in a long wavelength range, as revealed in Fig. 1c, showing a 4 μm-thick ultrathin c-Si substrate with underneath white light illumination.

Moreover, the 4 μm-thick ultrathin c-Si substrate also exhibits excellent robustness against bending so that it can be wrapped around a glass rod with a diameter of 6 mm (Fig. 1d), further demonstrating the remarkable flexibility of ultrathin c-Si substrates. In addition, in order to gain insight into the light absorption of the as-fabricated ultrathin c-Si substrates, light absorption of ultrathin c-Si substrates with different thicknesses was investigated (Fig. 1e). Compared with the original bulk c-Si, the absorption of ultrathin c-Si substrates is almost the same in the short wavelength region, but with the decrease of thickness, the thinner c-Si shows lower light absorption in visible and infrared regions.

Fig. 1f displays the optical microscopy image of monolayer graphene transferred onto a SiO2 (300 nm)/Si substrate. The colour contrast between the graphene film and the substrate indicates that the monolayer graphene is intact and uniform. Furthermore, the Raman spectrum was utilized to evaluate the quality of the graphene film, as shown in Fig. 1g. One can note that there are two characteristic bands: the G band centered at 1580 cm−1, associated with the crystallinity of graphene, and the 2D band centered at 2700 cm−1, originated from photon resonance. In contrast to the obvious G band and 2D band, the intensity of the D band at 1350 cm−1 is extremely low, indicating that there are scarcely any disorders and defects. The intensity ratio of I2D/IG is equal to 3 with full width at half maximum (FHWM) being about 30 cm−1, which suggests that the CVD grown graphene on copper foil is a monolayer. The optical characteristics were also investigated by transferring graphene onto quartz substrates (Fig. 1h), revealing that the transmittance decreases with an increase in the layer number of the graphene film. This trend is confirmed by the optical transmittance measurements, as shown in Fig. 1i. However, the conductivity of the graphene film is improved remarkably with the layer number from 648 Ω □−1 for 1-layer graphene to 180 Ω □−1 for 5-layer graphene.34 Evidently, the opposite trend indicates that there must be a trade-off between the transparency and conductivity of the graphene film for transparent electrode applications.
Schematic illustration in Fig. 2a shows the device structure of a flexible graphene/c-Si heterojunction solar cell. The detailed fabrication process is described in the Experimental section. In order to define the functional area of the device and avoid the short circuit as well, a PDMS membrane with a 4 mm diameter hole at the centre was adhered onto the ultrathin c-Si substrate as an insulator layer. Moreover, a thin layer of P3HT was inserted between graphene and c-Si by spin-coating as an electron blocking layer, as investigated in our previous studies.33 The underlying physical mechanism of the graphene/P3HT/c-Si sandwich structured heterojunction can be understood from the energy band diagram, as depicted in Fig. 2b. It is known that the conduction band (EC) and valence band (EV) of c-Si are 4.05 eV and 5.17 eV, respectively, while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of P3HT are 3.2 eV and 5.1 eV, respectively. Therefore the offset of EC–LUMO (∼0.8 eV) exhibits a large potential barrier for electron transportation from c-Si to graphene, which facilitates the separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs and thus minimizes the surface carrier recombination at the graphene and Si interface. In addition, the junction barrier height (Φb) between graphene and n-Si will be increased upon the use of the P3HT layer, contributing to the enhanced device performance, as discussed later. On the other hand, p-type doping on graphene is accomplished by using concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) vapour, giving rise to the remarkable reduction of sheet resistance.42 The downshift of the Fermi level of graphene also increases the junction height and accelerates the collection of photo-induced carriers.

(e) EQE spectra of the device with and without HNO3 doping. 
The assembled photovoltaic devices were evaluated under the illumination of a simulated AM 1.5G solar spectrum at 100 mW cm−2. Considering the balance between conductivity and transparency, 3-layer graphene films were used as front electrodes. Ultrathin c-Si substrates of 40 μm were adopted due to the compromise of flexibility and light absorption. Fig. 2c depicts current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of a typical device with and without HNO3 doping in the dark, indicating the superior diode rectification behavior of the device by the good formation of heterojunction. Furthermore, the diode ideality factor (n) can be deduced to be 2.79 before doping and 2.31 after doping from the inset in Fig. 2c, from which it is inferred that charge recombination is suppressed due to the decrease of series resistance (Rs) of the device via HNO3 doping. Fig. 2d shows the photovoltaic characteristics of a typical graphene (3-layer)/P3HT (10 nm)/c-Si (40 μm) heterojunction solar cell in a flat configuration. The pristine device displays a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.50 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.55 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.52, yielding a PCE of 5.93%. After HNO3 doping, the Voc remains unchanged, while Jsc and FF are dramatically increased to 24.28 mA cm−2 and 0.63, respectively, giving rise to an enhanced PCE of 8.42%. We ascribe the enhancement to the improved conductivity of graphene and consequently higher junction quality after doping. From the EQE spectra in Fig. 2e, it is observed that the EQE value is enhanced over a wide wavelength region after HNO3 doping, which is consistent with the photovoltaic measurements in Fig. 2d. The EQE spectrum of the doped device shows a valley structure around 600 nm. This can be attributed to the light absorption of P3HT in this wavelength range; the inferior conductivity of P3HT will prevent the efficient hole transport from n-type c-Si to graphene, resulting in a performance degradation. Therefore, an optimum P3HT layer thickness of about 10 nm was selected in this study. In control experiments, the device without a P3HT layer was also measured (Fig. S2, ESI†), showing an inferior device performance. This result coincides with the above mentioned energy band analysis and expectations.
To elucidate the effect of ultrathin c-Si thickness on the device performance of graphene/c-Si heterojunction solar cells, we fabricated devices with varied thicknesses of 10, 20, and 40 μm (Table 1), respectively. For better comparison, 3-layer graphene films were used for all devices. Fig. 3a depicts the photovoltaic performance of the heterojunction solar cells with varied c-Si thickness under AM 1.5G illumination. Both Jsc and Voc decrease as the thickness of ultrathin c-Si is decreased from 40 μm to 10 μm. For the 40 μm-thick ultrathin c-Si based device, the Jsc and Voc are 22.86 mA cm−2 and 0.54 V, leading to a PCE of 5.06% before HNO3 doping, while the Jsc, Voc, and PCE decrease to 18.86 mA cm−2, 0.50 V, 3.45% and 12.06 mA cm−2, 0.45 V, 1.96% for 20 μm- and 10 μm-thick ultrathin c-Si based devices, respectively. The decrease of device performance is mainly attributed to the inadequate light absorption when the thickness of ultrathin c-Si substrate reduces down, which is observed from the absorption spectra of ultrathin c-Si in Fig. 1e. Once HNO3 treatment was applied, the performances of all tested solar cells were enhanced effectively, as presented in Fig. 3a. However, the trend of device performance after doping is similar to that before doping. On the other hand, to reveal how the layer number of graphene affects the photovoltaic characteristics, we investigated the device performance with various graphene layer numbers (Table 1), while the thickness of ultrathin c-Si substrates was fixed at 40 μm. Fig. 3c shows the typical J–V curves of the solar cells after HNO3 doping, and the relationship of the main device parameters with the graphene layer number is plotted in Fig. 3d. It is found that the device performance strongly depends on the graphene layer number; Voc is nearly unchanged and remains 0.53 V for both 1-layer graphene and 3-layer graphene, while Jsc and FF are significantly enhanced from 19.19 mA cm−2 and 0.31 for 1-layer graphene to 24.66 mA cm−2 and 0.56 for 3-layer graphene. As a result, the PCE of the 3-layer graphene based device reaches 7.61%, which is more than twice that of the 1-layer graphene based device (3.23%). The enhancement in sheet conductivity of multi-layer graphene films could be responsible for this result. However, we note that the device consisting of 5-layer graphene exhibits an obvious degradation of performance, because of the reduced optical transmittance of the thick graphene film, as shown in Fig. 1i.

(d) Plots of the main device parameters as a function of graphene layer number. 
Owing to the large flexibility of ultrathin c-Si as well as the graphene film, the graphene/ultrathin c-Si heterojunctions possess great potential for flexible solar cell applications. A new batch of graphene (3-layer)/c-Si (15 μm) devices were measured under bending conditions with a fixed bending radius of 8 mm without HNO3 doping (Fig. 4a). As presented in Fig. 4b, the photovoltaic characteristics of the device show negligible change after one bending cycle, revealing the excellent flexibility of the device. To better understand the mechanical flexibility, we also increased the bending cycles to 50 times by repeating the bending-recovering process. It is encouraging that our graphene/ultrathin c-Si solar cells show a good durability; the J–V curves of the device under different bending cycles almost overlap with each other. Fig. 4c and d plot the relationship of the photovoltaic parameters with bending cycles. The Jsc and Voc of the graphene/c-Si heterojunction solar cell decrease gently from 13.69 mA cm−2 and 0.45 V to 13.58 mA cm−2 and 0.44 V after 50 bending cycles, while the change in FF is almost nearly invisible. As a result, the PCE decreases slightly from 2.51% to 2.41%. The results unambiguously demonstrate the excellent flexibility as well as high durability of the graphene/ultrathin c-Si heterojunction solar cells.

Conclusions
In summary, we developed flexible graphene/silicon heterojunction solar cells by using ultrathin c-Si as substrates. By performing surface passivation on Si, inserting a layer of P3HT as an electron blocking layer, and controlling the layer number and doping of graphene, we demonstrated a PCE of 8.42% for a 40 μm-thick c-Si based solar cell. The devices exhibited excellent flexibility and durability; the performance remained unchanged with a bending radius of 8 mm and the device could sustain up to 50 bending cycles. Enormous improvements on the device performance can be envisioned by further enhancing the light-harvest of ultrathin c-Si substrates using silicon nanostructures, anti-reflection coatings, or metallic nanoparticles.43–46 In addition, the effective device area of the graphene/ultrathin c-Si heterojunction solar cell is about 0.13 cm2, which is still smaller than that of the conventional Si p–n junction solar cells (>1 cm2). The relatively small area of the devices is mainly attributed to the limit of graphene conductivity. Increasing the device area, but without improving the conductivity of the graphene film, will lead to the degradation of the device performance. In principle, the device area could be further increased by adding a mesh electrode on graphene or using metallic nanowires to enhance the conductivity of graphene. Given the high flexibility and solution process capability, it is expected that graphene/ultrathin c-Si heterojunction solar cells will have important applications for future low-cost, mechanically flexible, high performance solar cells.
