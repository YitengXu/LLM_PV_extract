    , Accepted 16th June 2020First published on 7th July 2020AbstractTwo perylenediimide (PDI) derivatives (FP4TT2T and FP43T) with extended conjugation have been successfully synthesized. Due to their long fused D–A (D: donor and A: acceptor) molecular structures, PDI-based heteroacenes have rigid backbones and exhibit strong light absorption in the 300–600 nm range. With the contribution from the PDI moiety with strong electron affinity, the molecules possess low energy levels of LUMOs (ca. −3.7 eV), fitting well as acceptors for fullerene-free organic solar cells (OSCs). OSC devices containing FP4TT2T and FP43T were fabricated and fully characterized. It is found that the geometric twist in PDI-based heteroacenes as acceptors could enhance the performance of OSC devices. OSCs based on FP43T with a more twisted geometry achieved a power conversion efficiency of 6.05%, which is higher than those based on the FP4TT2T counterpart.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs), capable of directly converting sunlight into electric energy in organic films, are considered as next-generation energy harvesting technology owing to a number of potential advantages, such as being low cost solution-processable, flexible, light-weighted, environmentally friendly, etc.1–3 However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs still lags far behind that of their inorganic counterparts. To address this issue, researchers have made strenuous efforts to improve the performance of OSCs through development of novel materials and also device engineering.4–9 In recent years, exploiting non-fullerene acceptors for highly efficient OSCs is one of the aims of research in this field.10–14 Compared to the fullerene acceptors with untunable energy levels, weak absorption in the visible region and poor photostability, e.g., PC61BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyrate methyl ester) and PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyrate methyl ester), non-fullerene acceptors present wide tunability in their opto-electric proprieties.15–18 Owing to their strong light absorption, tunable energy levels and low energy loss between donors and acceptors, OSCs based on non-fullerene acceptors have shown PCEs over 16% recently.18–21
Perylenediimide (PDI), which is composed of strong electron-withdrawing imide groups, and possesses high electron affinity, strong light absorption and high electron mobility, is appropriate for building blocks for non-fullerene acceptors.22–24 However, owing to its planar molecular configuration, unmodified PDI is prone to form unfavorable aggregates in the film state,25,26 which will generally result in poor performances in bulk-heterojunction solar cells. Hence, modification of the basic structure of PDI is essential to achieve high photovoltaic performance.27–32 To solve this problem, various strategies have been developed to suppress the large aggregation of PDI-based acceptors. The dimerization of PDI moieties with functional groups at the bay position is a successful strategy for designing twisted or non-planar PDI-based acceptors.33–35 On the other hand, designing new PDI-based molecular structures such as PDI derivatives with three-dimensional (3D) structures was considered as a more effective strategy for PDI-based acceptors.36–38 Although designing twisted or non-planar molecular structures seem to be a successful method for overcoming the strong aggregation tendency of PDIs, the detrimental effects on π–π stacking of PDIs induced by steric hindrance weaken their charge transport ability in the blend film. Hence, designing three-dimensional (3D) structures with an appropriate degree of steric hindrance was considered as an effective method for building a balance between the optimal phase separation morphology and better π–π stacking of molecules.28 Recently, Peng reported two novel PDI trimers (named Ta-PDI and Ph-PDI) based on 1,3,5-triazine and benzene as the core. By eliminating the H–H steric hindrance between the benzene and PDI units, the Ta-PDI exhibited a less twisted structure that leads to higher crystallinity, better π–π stacking, and higher carrier mobility of the acceptors. With these merits, the Ta-PDI-based OSCs exhibited a higher PCE of 9.15% than the Ph-PDI devices (5.57%).39
Among the derivatives of PDI, PDI-based heteroacenes, normally constructed by fusing PDI fragments with other aromatic rings, can largely extend the π electron delocalization. Therefore, PDI-based heteroacenes demonstrate enhanced light absorption and higher electron mobility, and are intensively investigated in OSCs and also organic field effect transistors (OFETs).29,40–45 In addition, their fused ring structure also imparts the molecules with rigidity and twisted geometry between two planar π moieties. Such a configuration is closely associated with the intermolecular interactions of the molecules in the solid state and their device performance.29,42,43
In this work, two PDI-based derivatives composed of four PDI units fused by aromatic rings with π extension, FP4TT2T and FP43T, were successfully synthesized. To form fused ring structures, thiophene or thienothiophene linkers were implanted through the Stille and Scholl coupling reactions. Both FP4TT2T and FP43T have the merits of suitable energy levels, strong light absorption and rigid molecular structures, which contribute to the high photovoltaic performance in their OSCs. Moreover, the geometric twist in FP4TT2T and FP43T is found to be an important factor impacting the photovoltaic performance.46–48 FP43T with a larger twist angle between PDI blocks achieved higher efficiency than FP4TT2T. This work demonstrates that tuning the torsional twist between the building blocks is an effective strategy for developing high-performance PDI-based heteroacene acceptors.
2. Results and discussion
The chemical structures of FP4TT2T and FP43T are shown in Fig. 1a. The two compounds were synthesized through multi-step Stille coupling and Scholl reactions (Scheme S1, ESI†). The details of the synthetic procedures are provided in the ESI.† NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF-mass spectroscopy were used to characterize and confirm the structures of the two compounds (Fig. S1–S15, ESI†). Due to the thiophene rings used as the bridges in the two heteroacenes, both FP4TT2T and FP43T contain isomers which cannot be isolated in the synthetic processes. Nevertheless, we pay our attention to the relationship between molecular structures and photovoltaic performances in this content. According to the thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), FP4TT2T and FP43T exhibited favorable thermal stability with decomposition temperatures of 407 °C and 409 °C at 5% weight loss (Fig. S16, ESI†). The differential scanning calorimetry measurement (DSC) did not exhibit melting or crystallization peaks between 30 °C and 350 °C (Fig. S17, ESI†), which indicated that FP4TT2T and FP43T are amorphous in the solid state. Owing to the solubilizing alkyl-chains introduced into the PDI units, the two compounds exhibited good solubility in most common polar solvents (e.g., chlorobenzene, chloroform, etc.).

The UV-vis absorption spectra of FP4TT2T and FP43T are shown in Fig. 1b and Fig. S18 (ESI†). Due to the long conjugation skeletons and strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) induced by the donor–acceptor molecular structures, FP4TT2T and FP43T showed intensive absorption from 300 nm to 600 nm, with a large molar absorption coefficient of 1.4 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 383 nm for FP43T and 1.1 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 404 nm for FP4TT2T (Fig. S26, ESI†). The absorption spectra of FP4TT2T in solution and film states demonstrated almost identical profiles. However, the onset of the absorption spectrum from the FP43T films showed a red-shift of 11 nm compared with that from the solution (Fig. S18b, ESI†). The red-shift of the UV spectra is ascribed to the π–π interactions of the molecules in the solid state which was expected to achieve high charge mobilities and good performance in OSCs.27,38,49 The optical bandgaps of FP4TT2T and FP43T are 2.11 eV and 2.01 eV estimated from the absorption onsets in films. The energy levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) and the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of FP4TT2T and FP43T were calculated from the reduction onset potential (Eredonset) measured by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry measurement (Fig. 1c) and optical bandgaps, and the values are −3.62 eV/−5.73 eV and −3.70 eV/−5.71 eV, respectively. The optical and electrochemical data of FP4TT2T and FP43T are summarized in Table 1. The energy levels of FP4TT2T and FP43T match well with most donors (like PTB7-Th) which guarantee the effective exciton separation and charge transport in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs.

The BHJ-OSC devices were fabricated with a conventional device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:FP4TT2T or FP43T/PDIN/Al to characterize the photovoltaic performance of FP4TT2T and FP43T. Because of the wide-bandgap properties of FP4TT2T and FP43T, the narrow-bandgap p-type polymer PTB7-Th was selected as the donor for effective light harvesting. The chemical structures of PTB7-Th and PDIN and the energy levels of different layers are shown in Fig. 2a and b. Batches of BHJ-OSC devices were fabricated and tested under different process conditions. The best photovoltaic performances were obtained with a donor/acceptor (D/A) ratio of 1:1 without any post-fabrication treatment for both FP4TT2T and FP43T. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized devices and the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 2c and d. The devices based on PTB7-Th:FP4TT2T showed the highest PCE of 4.62% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.92 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 11.9 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 42.1%. In comparison with PTB7-Th:FP4TT2T, PTB7-Th:FP43T based OSCs exhibited better performance with a PCE of 6.05%, a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 14.7 mA cm−2 and an FF of 48.1%. The decreased Voc of the FP43T-based OSC corresponds to the slightly lower LUMO energy level of FP43T in contrast with FP4TT2T. Owing to the complementary absorption spectra between donor and acceptors, the devices based on FP4TT2T and FP43T exhibited a broad spectral response in the range of 300 nm to 800 nm, as shown in Fig. 2d. Both donor (PTB7-Th) and acceptors (FP4TT2T and FP43T) contributed to the photocurrent generation. The peak EQEs for both devices located at 570 nm coincide with the UV absorption peaks of FP4TT2T and FP43T, which also prove the contribution of the acceptors in the active layers to the photocurrent generation. The calculated Jsc integrated from the EQE spectra matched well with the corresponding J–V test value. To characterize the bulk charge transport properties of the active layers, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model was applied to investigate the hole and electron mobilities with the device configurations of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:acceptors/MoO3/Al for holes and ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:acceptors/PDIN/Al for electrons (Fig. S21 and S22, ESI†). The calculated hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of the PTB7-Th:FP4TT2T based active layer are 3.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μh/μe value of 2.05. The calculated μh and μe of PTB7-Th:FP43T blend films are 6.30 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively, with a μh/μe value of 1.20. Compared with FP4TT2T, FP43T based OSCs exhibited higher and more balanced charge mobilities which are in accordance with the higher Jsc and FF.

Although the chemical structures are similar between FP4TT2T and FP43T, FP43T showed much better photovoltaic performance. Except for the lower Voc caused by lower LUMO, FP43T-based OSCs exhibited enhanced Jsc and FF. To understand the reasons behind the results, density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the Gaussian package at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level were performed to evaluate the differences in their molecular geometries and electronic properties between FP4TT2T and FP43T. As depicted in Fig. 3, both FP4TT2T and FP43T exhibit extended conjugation resulting from the ring fusion. The central two PDI units of FP4TT2T show planar conformation because of the enough space provided by thieno[3,2-b]thiophene. Arising from the limited space of thiophene, the lateral two PDI units of FP4TT2T present twisted conformation with dihedral angles between PDIs and thiophenes estimated to be 22.1° and 21.7°. In contrast with FP4TT2T, FP43T has more condensed molecular structures with composition units of PDI–thiophene. The dihedral angles caused by the steric hindrance between PDI and thiophene were estimated to be 22.8°, 13.6° and 22.8°. Corresponding to the extended π-conjugation, both FP4TT2T and FP43T illustrated well delocalization on the HOMO and LUMO orbitals. However, some distinction between FP4TT2T and FP43T can be observed. For FP4TT2T, although the LUMO orbital distributes around the four PDI units, the whole continuity of the LUMO orbital is attenuated on the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene part. The HOMO orbital of FP4TT2T is mainly delocalized on the central two PDI units and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene. In the case of FP43T, both LUMO and HOMO orbitals distribute continuously throughout the entire backbones. Concerning on the PDI-based non-fullerene acceptors, the structural twist is critical to the molecular interactions, the compatibility with donors and the film morphology. Combined with UV characterization, the proper torsional twist of FP43T is inferred to induce molecular interactions in the film state. Besides, the fully delocalized frontier orbitals of FP43T can stabilize the free charges and finally improve the charge mobilities. The calculation results coincide with the optical properties and photovoltaic performance.

To observe the relationship between the chemical structure and photovoltaic performance visually, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were adopted to characterize the film morphology and intermolecular interaction in solid states. As illustrated in Fig. 4, both PTB7-Th:FP4TT2T and PTB7-Th:FP43T blend films exhibit smooth and uniform surface morphology due to the rigid and twisted molecular conformations of the new PDI-based heteroacenes.50 The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the blend films was estimated to be 1.12 nm for PTB7-Th:FP4TT2T and 1.02 nm for PTB7-Th:FP43T, respectively, which indicates good miscibility of the donor and acceptor and could be beneficial to the enhancement of FF and Jsc in the devices. However, no desired distinct molecular aggregation occurs, and thus nanophase separation was not observed from AFM images. As mentioned above, the PTB7-Th:FP43T blend films also exhibit higher and more balanced charge mobilities. The higher electron mobility of FP43T is attributed to the stronger intermolecular interaction of FP43T in the solid state, which is evidenced by the XRD measurement (Fig. S23, ESI†) and red-shift UV absorption in the film state. Hence, the optimized twisted geometry of FP43T which finally leads to favorable film morphology and enhanced charge mobilities are responsible for the improved Jsc and FF in BHJ-OSCs.

To investigate the crystallinity and molecular orientation of the films of neat FP43T, FP4TT2T and their blends with PTB7-Th, grazing-incidence X-ray scattering (GIXRD) measurement was performed. The 2D-GIXRD patterns and the corresponding in-plane/out-of-plane line cuts are shown in Fig. S25 (ESI†). The neat and blend films did not show any Bragg reflections, indicating the lack of crystalline domains for the neat and blend films. The amorphous nature of the four films should be ascribed to the twisted geometry of FP43T and FP4TT2T molecules. The results illustrated that the incorporation of geometric twist into the fused PDI molecules is a promising approach to control the molecular aggregation in the films while maintaining high charge mobility and good power conversion efficiency in OPV devices.
3. Conclusions
In this study, two PDI-based heteroacenes were successfully synthesized and characterized. The well conjugated skeletons of FP4TT2T and FP43T endow the two molecules with strong light absorption from 300 nm to 600 nm. The two PDI-based heteroacenes possess suitable LUMO energy levels as non-fullerene acceptors in BHJ-OSCs. BHJ-OSCs based on PTB7-Th:FP4TT2T and PTB7-Th:FP43T achieved PCEs up to 4.62% and 6.05%, respectively. The molecular geometries of FP4TT2T and FP43T, playing a critical role in their photovoltaic performance, were deeply investigated. FP43T with suitable twisted molecular conformation induced a stronger intermolecular interaction and favorable film morphology. In comparison with the PTB7-Th:FP4TT2T blend film, the PTB7-Th:FP43T blend film exhibited higher and more balanced charge mobilities and thus better photovoltaic performance. The results demonstrated that the geometrical twist in PDI-based heteroacenes as non-fullerene acceptors has a significant influence on the photovoltaic performance in BHJ-OSCs.
