    , Accepted 25th March 2022First published on 26th March 2022AbstractA spray deposition procedure for the fabrication of polycrystalline MAPbBr3 thick films (20–100 μm) is developed and highly efficient (>5.5% under AM1.5 sunlight) hole-transport-material free perovskite solar cells are successfully made with 40 μm thick MAPbBr3 films.
Lead halide based perovskite films are very attractive for optoelectronic applications.1 Due to the strong light absorption, perovskite films with thickness <1 μm are normally enough to completely (>95%) absorb the photons above its bandgap across the AM1.5 solar spectrum.2 The as-photogenerated carriers have to be collected selectively at the electrodes, and perovskite devices are mostly made using thin films (<1 μm) to avoid unnecessary transport distance before carriers reach the electrodes.3 Owing to the advantage that less material is needed as the film thickness decreases, thin films have been widely used for solar cell and LED applications.4 On the thin film device platform, the power conversion efficiency for solar cells has reached >10% for bromide based lead perovskites5 and >25% for iodide based lead perovskites.6
On the other hand, thick films (>10 μm) are required for various applications for X-ray and gamma-ray detection since the absorption coefficients of lead halide perovskites for such highly energetic photons are small.7 Even for UV-visible-NIR photons across the solar spectrum, it is beneficial to obtain large film thickness to enhance photon absorption since semiconductors always have a low absorption coefficient near their bandgap. Thus thick film solar cells are advocated for extending the absorption wavelength range within the solar spectrum.8 However, excess film thickness becomes unnecessary for the wavelength region where perovskites already strongly absorb photons and causes extra burden on carrier transport inside devices as the perovskite film thickness increases. As a result, thick film solar cells might suffer from a huge efficiency loss during the power conversion process and thick perovskite films were only used for novel concept demonstration.9 Among the few efforts,9,10 the highest efficiency of 7.11% on a small area was demonstrated for solar cells of 16 μm thick MAPbBr3 films.10 As the film thickness increases further, the device efficiency drops quickly even when single crystalline MAPbBr3 films were used.10 To the best of our knowledge, solar cells have never been made from polycrystalline perovskite thick films and reports on thick films of polycrystalline perovskites7,11 and their polymer composites12 were mostly focused on applications for X-ray detection.
Here we developed a spray deposition technique to fabricate thick (40–100 μm) MAPbBr3 films across a large area of 8 cm × 8 cm. In both the UV-Vis spectrum and IPCE (Incident Photon-to-Current Efficiency) spectrum, the cutoff wavelength for absorption gets extended from 545 nm (for thin films) to 570 nm (for thick films). Combining with the upscalable doctor blading technique for fabrication of carbon electrodes on top of the MAPbBr3 layer, a power conversion efficiency of >5.5% is achieved under AM1.5 sunlight illumination (the active area for solar cells is 0.50 cm2). Increasing the thickness of MAPbBr3 films from 40 μm to 100 μm does not obviously decrease the solar cell performance.
In Fig. 1a, we observe that the MAPbBr3 films are made of cuboids and the edge size of the cuboids is widely distributed between 10 μm and 50 μm. The small dots (1–3 μm) appearing on the cuboid surface are found to be K+ rich (EDX analysis). It is known that K+ cannot be incorporated into the MAPbBr3 lattice due to the small ionic radius and might get phase segregated onto the surface of perovskite cuboids. No dots were observed if no KBr was added to the precursor solution (Fig. S1, ESI†). From cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 1b), the MAPbBr3 layer is ∼42 μm thick, which agrees well with the mass-based thickness estimation by assuming a bulk density of 3.8 g cm−3 for films. The large grains across the film thickness are different from the layers of small grains appearing in the literature,7 which indicates that the film growth during each spray cycle might be directed by the already formed film grains through epitaxy. The carbon electrode layer is ∼35 μm thick and forms an intimate contact with the MAPbBr3 layer. The MAPbBr3 films are dense and compact, and adhere strongly to the FTO substrates. From XRD patterns (Fig. 1c), it is obvious that the MAPbBr3 thick film is oriented in the 〈001〉 direction. Doublet peaks are clearly seen in (002), (003), and (004) for well crystallized thick MAPbBr3 films, which apparently come from the Kα1 (1.54056 Å) and Kα2 (1.54439 Å) lines from the Cu target during X-ray diffraction. Uniform films of large area up to 8 cm × 8 cm are made for demonstration (Fig. S2, ESI†), and the film thickness can reach higher when more spray cycles are repeated (Fig. S3, ESI†).
 Fig. 1  (a) Surface morphology of MAPbBr3 thick films fabricated through spray deposition on FTO, (b) cross-section of the MAPbBr3 film solar cell devices. The dashed line is used as a guide to the eye. Bottom layer is MAPbBr3 and the top layer is the carbon electrode. The 400 nm thick FTO substrate and the 30 nm thick TiO2 are barely visible at this scale. (c) XRD of the MAPbBr3 film device with thecarbon electrode on top. The peak marked as graphite comes from the carbon electrodes. (d) UV-Vis spectrum and photoluminescence spectrum of MAPbBr3 thick films. The MAPbBr3 film was excited via a diode laser (450 nm). The fluorescence emission peaks at 564 nm (2.19 eV), and the FWHM is 22 nm (85 meV). No sub-bandgap luminescence is present in the spectrum. 
In the UV-Vis spectrum, there is no absorption until the cut-off wavelength at 570 nm (Fig. 1d). Then a steep increase in photon absorption is observed and the absorption quickly reaches a plateau in the spectrum. The Urbach tail energy derived from the UV-Vis spectrum is 56 meV (Fig. S4, ESI†). Although it is larger than the bulk single crystals of MAPbBr3,13 the Urbach tail energy is close to the polycrystalline MAPbBr3 thin films, out of which highly efficient solar cells were made.14 The fluorescence peak is at 564 nm (2.19 eV) when thick MAPbBr3 films are excited via a 450 nm laser. The fluorescence peak position agrees with that reported for MAPbBr3 bulk single crystals.15 Previously, we have reported that the fluorescence peak for MAPbBr3 thin films is at 549 nm (2.26 eV).13 The 15 nm (0.07 eV) shift in the emission spectrum is not caused by the light reabsorption by the 40 μm thick film, since the peak position in the fluorescence spectrum collected from the front side (the illumination side) is the same as that collected from the rear side (Fig. S5, ESI†).16 Considering that huge difference in doping density exists for thin and thick MAPbBr3 films, we propose that the spectra shift might have resulted from the different electric fields inside MAPbBr3 films.17 The fluorescence decay curve of the MAPbBr3 films on TiO2 covered FTO can be fitted with a biexpotential model (Fig. S6, ESI†). The average lifetime of 17.9 ns (τ1 = 4.4 ns, 75% component; τ2 = 58.4 ns, 25% component) agrees with the fluorescence lifetime of high quality MAPbBr3 single crystals.17
The J–V curves under simulated AM1.5 sunlight illumination are shown in Fig. 2a. The J–V curve is different from the S-shaped curve from the literature, which could contribute to a significant part of efficiency loss.10 The Voc is 1.54 V, and it can reach as high as 1.62 V for thick film devices. The high Jsc up to 7.3 mA cm−2 (max. Jsc for a semiconductor of 2.18 eV bandgap under AM1.5 sunlight is 11.0 mA cm−2) proves that ∼70% of the holes generated inside MAPbBr3 can transport effectively across the 40 μm film thickness before reaching the carbon electrode and get collected. We emphasize that the IPCE at 550 nm for thick MAPbBr3 films here is 35% (Fig. 2b), while the IPCE at 550 nm for solar cells with thin films is almost zero.14 The Jsc obtained from the integration of the IPCE over the AM1.5 solar spectrum (Fig. 2b) is 6.38 mA cm−2, which is ∼10% less than the Jsc (7.31 mA cm−2) derived from the J–V curve measured under a solar simulator. The current mismatch, though still at an acceptable level, might come from the mismatch between the light spectrum from the solar simulator and the AM1.5 sunlight spectrum. The main loss for the MAPbBr3 thick film solar cells now comes from the low fill factor (<0.50), and Table S1 (ESI†) lists the photovoltaic performance data from other highly efficient thick film devices. A further increase of the efficiency for thick MAPbBr3 films should be feasible in the future as fill factor higher than 0.80 for solar cells with 20 μm thick perovskite films has already been reported.18
 Fig. 2  Photovoltaic performance of thick MAPbBr3 film devices. (a) J–V curves of the MAPbBr3 solar cell under simulated AM1.5 sunlight and in the dark. The power conversion efficiency for this cell is 5.52%. Voc is 1.54 V, Jsc is 7.31 mA cm−2, and FF is 0.49, respectively. (b) IPCE spectrum and the integration of IPCE over the standard AM1.5 spectrum for the MAPbBr3 film device. IPCE reaches a 70% plateau, and the integrated short circuit current density reaches 6.38 mA cm−2. (c) J–V curves in the dark and under illumination for a series of three solar cells with MAPbBr3 films of 40 μm, 80 μm and 100 μm thickness. (d) Evolution of the power conversion efficiency with air storage time for a solar cell with the MAPbBr3 thick film. Day 0 denotes measurements performed right after the carbon electrode was ready after heating at 120 °C. The device was not encapsulated and stored in air without humidity control. 
When the thickness of MAPbBr3 increases from 40 μm to 100 μm, the solar cell power conversion efficiency decreases, but only slightly from 5.32% to 4.38% (Fig. 2c). J–V characterization shows that Jsc decreases only a little bit (7.96 mA cm−2vs. 7.83 mA cm−2), Voc increases from 1.43 V to 1.58 V while the FF decreases from 0.47 to 0.38 as MAPbBr3 films become thicker. This is in sharp contrast to a previous report that stated that both Jsc and Voc decrease rapidly when the thickness of single crystalline MAPbBr3 films increases.10
In Fig. 2d, the evolution of the power conversion efficiency of a MAPbBr3 thick film solar cell over a period of 13 days is shown (Fig. S7, ESI† details the evolution of all the photovoltaic parameters). The power conversion efficiency increases during the first two days after device fabrication, and then becomes relatively stable over the next 10 days. Due to this fact, the photovoltaic performance data reported in this article were always measured two days after the fabrication, unless otherwise stated. Increase in efficiency during the initial two day period is always observed once KBr was added to the precursor solution, thus we propose the K+ redistribution between the MAPbBr3 grains inside thick films to account for the trend (Fig. S8, ESI†). Different from the reports that the addition of K+ could eliminate the hysteresis for thin film solar cells of composition engineered perovskites,19 hysteresis in the J–V curve still exists for MAPbBr3 thick film solar cells when K+ was present in the precursor solution (Fig. S9, ESI†).
In Fig. 3, three regions exist in the Mott–Schottky plot when the MAPbBr3 device is biased from 1.6 V to 0.0 V. From the linear region between 1.3 V and 1.0 V, the built-in voltage and the acceptor density can be derived for MAPbBr3 thick films. Considering that the relative dielectric constant for MAPbBr3 at infinite frequency was reported to be 25.5 or higher,20,21 the acceptor density inside thick MAPbBr3 films is calculated to be ∼3.9 × 1011 cm−3 or less. The value is almost 104 times lower than the acceptor density for polycrystalline thin MAPbBr3 films (>1015 cm−3),20 while it is only slightly higher than that for single crystalline MAPbBr3 films (∼1010 cm−3).10 The built-in voltage derived from Mott–Schottky plots is 1.27 V, which is close to the Voc measured under simulated AM1.5 sunlight. Both the acceptor density and the built-in voltage do not change as the modulation frequency increases for thick film devices. For thin MAPbBr3 films, we normally will find frequency dispersion with shifted built-in voltage (Fig. S10, ESI†), which is typically related to certain kinds of defects inside the films. However, we do note that the built-in voltage measured in the dark is ∼0.2 V smaller than the open circuit voltage measured under AM1.5 sunlight for thick MAPbBr3 films. The reason might be related to the migration of bromide ions inside MAPbBr3 films, although a detailed study is needed for future research. We also point out that the data in Fig. 3 clearly indicate that the MAPbBr3 films are fully depleted under short circuit conditions and photogenerated carriers will drift, instead of diffusing, through thick film MAPbBr3 before being collected via electrodes.
 Fig. 3  Mott–Schottky plots of a MAPbBr3 thick film device at different modulation frequencies. Three regions exist in the Mott–Schottky plot here. From 1.6 V to 1.3 V, the MAPbBr3 film is accumulated with free carriers as majority carriers are injected. Starting from 1.3 V, as free carriers are extracted by the modulation AC voltage imposed to the DC bias, the MAPbBr3 film starts to get depleted from free carriers and soon gets fully depleted when the depletion width reaches the film thickness. Below 1.0 V, the capacitance across the MAPbBr3 film does not change anymore. The frequency dispersion (3 kHz to 30 kHz) for the thick film device is close to ideal. The higher the frequency, the less the amount of free carriers can keep pace with the voltage modulation. 
As films become thick, the amount of defects inside semiconductor films will increase. For optoelectronic devices of traditional semiconductors, improving the crystallinity of the film is a common strategy to reduce possible detrimental effects from the defects. However, no highly efficient solar cell devices made from perovskite wafers (∼100 μm thick) sliced from bulk perovskite single crystals have been reported.22 Space confinement has been applied to thick perovskite film growth and device fabrication. However, this method currently suffers from the small area achievable for perovskite thick films (>10 μm) and the poor mechanical film adhesion to the substrate. Up to now, only applications like photodetectors with small aperture sizes could be demonstrated,23 and the electronic coupling between perovskite films and the substrates, either hole transport material covered or electron transport material covered, has become a limiting factor for improving the device performance.22 Research efforts on another process of doctor blading, which might be possible for thick film growth of perovskites and their composites,12 have been mainly limited to thin film fabrication.24,25
On the other hand, spray deposition has been widely used for film fabrication in industry. The technique of spray deposition is compatible with the solution processibility for lead halide based perovskites, which is one of the greatest advantages for this material family.26 However, it was only used for thin film (<1 μm thickness) fabrication of MAPbI3.27,28 In the only report on spray deposited thick MAPbI3 films,7 no photovoltaic performance data of thick film solar cells were reported. In our spray procedure, the usage of a single crystal precursor was found to be very important for getting high quality thick MAPbBr3 films (Table S2, ESI†). The pre-synthesized MAPbBr3 single crystals not only serve as the precursor with least amount of impurities inside,29 but also contain crystalline perovskite domains that will be partially kept in the DMF solution.30 Both these two factors will contribute to the formation of crystalline domains with less defects inside MAPbBr3 thick films which in turn gives higher performance for MAPbBr3 solar cells. Solvents of DMSO and DMF with different ratios and additives like formic acid were tested to dissolve large MAPbBr3 crystals into nanodomains. For now, it is found that pure DMF without additive works best for the sake of photovoltaic performance of thick MAPbBr3 films. Since the fingerprint vibrational peak from dimethyl ammonium (DMA)31 cations at 888 cm−1 is absent in the Raman spectra of MAPbBr3 films (Fig. S11, ESI†), we also prove that the high photovoltaic performance for MAPbBr3 solar cells is not due to the otherwise possible incorporation of DMA inside MAPbBr3 films.
The device architecture of the bladed carbon electrode directly on spray-deposited MAPbBr3 film here not only allows cost reduction for device fabrication, but also enables perovskite solar cell production on an industrial scale.9
Our results here show that the photovoltaic performance for 40 μm thick MAPbBr3 films is approaching close to that for thin film counterparts and the photovoltaic performance does not decrease obviously as the MAPbBr3 film thickness increases further to 100 μm. This proves that the polycrystalline MAPbBr3 films fabricated through spray deposition are of great quality. Though certain kinds of defects might still exist inside individual grains or at the grain boundaries, carrier transport across MAPbBr3 thick films is not disturbed by defect assisted recombination. In other words, the carrier transport process inside the polycrystalline MAPbBr3 films is tolerant of such defects. Due to the close-to intrinsic doping nature of MAPbBr3 and the presence of an electric field across the >40 μm thick films, we would like to emphasize that the high efficiencies achieved here with MAPbBr3 thick films should not be wrongly viewed as a confirmation that the diffusion length of holes inside MAPbBr3 can exceed 40 μm or an even longer distance.32
In summary, a spray deposition procedure has been developed for the fabrication of MAPbBr3 polycrystalline thick films. With carbon electrodes directly bladed on top, hole-transport-material free solar cells are constructed from MAPbBr3 thick films. A power conversion efficiency of >5.5% is demonstrated for solar cells with MAPbBr3 films of >40 μm thickness. The superior photovoltaic performance indicates that polycrystalline MAPbBr3 films are tolerant of the defects that might exist inside the thick films. Thick film perovskite solar cells explored here not only offer a platform for a fundamental study of material properties of perovskites, but also their photovoltaic performance poses to be a merit indicator for material quality for perovskites in optoelectronic devices.

The fluorescence emission peaks at 564 nm (2.19 eV), and the FWHM is 22 nm (85 meV). No sub-bandgap luminescence is present in the spectrum.	 

 	Fig. 2  Photovoltaic performance of thick MAPbBr3 film devices. (a) J–V curves of the MAPbBr3 solar cell under simulated AM1.5 sunlight and in the dark. The power conversion efficiency for this cell is 5.52%. Voc is 1.54 V, Jsc is 7.31 mA cm−2, and FF is 0.49, respectively. (b) IPCE spectrum and the integration of IPCE over the standard AM1.5 spectrum for the MAPbBr3 film device. IPCE reaches a 70% plateau, and the integrated short circuit current density reaches 6.38 mA cm−2. (c) J–V curves in the dark and under illumination for a series of three solar cells with MAPbBr3 films of 40 μm, 80 μm and 100 μm thickness. (d) Evolution of the power conversion efficiency with air storage time for a solar cell with the MAPbBr3 thick film. Day 0 denotes measurements performed right after the carbon electrode was ready after heating at 120 °C. The device was not encapsulated and stored in air without humidity control.	 

 	Fig. 3  Mott–Schottky plots of a MAPbBr3 thick film device at different modulation frequencies. Three regions exist in the Mott–Schottky plot here. From 1.6 V to 1.3 V, the MAPbBr3 film is accumulated with free carriers as majority carriers are injected. Starting from 1.3 V, as free carriers are extracted by the modulation AC voltage imposed to the DC bias, the MAPbBr3 film starts to get depleted from free carriers and soon gets fully depleted when the depletion width reaches the film thickness. Below 1.0 V, the capacitance across the MAPbBr3 film does not change anymore. The frequency dispersion (3 kHz to 30 kHz) for the thick film device is close to ideal. The higher the frequency, the less the amount of free carriers can keep pace with the voltage modulation.
