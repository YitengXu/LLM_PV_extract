    , Accepted 29th April 2021First published on 30th April 2021AbstractThe side chain engineering of photoactive materials is one of the most commonly used molecular design strategies for developing high performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, two alkyl (or alkoxyl) chains, corresponding to 4TIC-C8-2F and 4TIC-OC8-2F, are introduced to the two outmost thiophene rings of the A–D–A type fused ring electron acceptor (4TIC-2F). We demonstrate that the molecular orientation, crystallinity and blend film morphology can be effectively regulated by side chain engineering. Moreover, the introduction of the flexible chains can also lead to reduced energy loss of photovoltaic devices and give rise to a higher open-circuit voltage. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the PM6:4TIC-C8-2F and PM6:4TIC-OC8-2F based solar cells are 10.75% and 10.13%, respectively, higher than the PM6:4TIC-2F based devices (10.03%). Furthermore, the optimized devices based on PM6:4TIC-C8-2F give an enhanced PCE of 12.65%. Our results have revealed that side chain engineering is an efficient molecular design strategy in developing high performance small molecular acceptors.
Introduction
In recent years, the rapid development of organic solar cells (OSCs) has attracted a lot of attention. OSCs have many merits, such as low cost, flexibility, light weight, printability, etc.1–5 The vital photo absorbing active layer of the OSCs generally consists of a polymer donor and a small molecular acceptor. During the past two decades, fullerene derivatives have played a dominant role as small molecular acceptors due to their isotropic and high electron mobility.6,7 However, there are some inevitable shortcomings of the fullerene derivatives, such as highly expensive purification process, low absorption coefficient, narrow light absorption range, being hard to adjust the energy level, etc. As a result, fullerene based OSCs have encountered a bottleneck with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) hardly surpassing 11%, thus, they do not meet the requirements for commercial application.8–10 It is highly desired to develop novel acceptors to promote the progress of OSCs. Recently, many non-fullerene acceptors such as perylenediimides, naphthalimide derivatives and fused ring compounds are developed for efficient OSCs.2,3,11–13 Among them, the A–D–A type fused ring electron acceptors (FREAs) are the most widely studied due to their tunable absorption, and adjustable energy levels.14 Besides, A–π–D–π–A and A–DAD–A type FREAs are also developed.15–18 PCE up to 17% has been achieved for single-junction OSCs, which is promising for commercial application.19,20
Compared to the traditional fullerene derivatives, FREAs have an obvious superiority of easy tuning chemical structures. Hence, considerable efforts have been made to engineer the fused-ring core units, π-bridge units, electron withdrawing groups and side chains of the FREAs to improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.2,21 This comes with a significant redshift of acceptor which can help construct semi-transparent devices.22–24 Generally, utilizing the intramolecular noncovalent interactions to partially replace the covalent bonds in FREAs can simplify the synthetic route and adjust optical and electric properties.16,25–27 Besides, modifying the electron withdrawing end groups of FREAs can also result in modulated light absorption and molecular packing of the active layer.28–31 The side chain engineering can efficiently tune the electrical and optical properties of FREAs, adjust the crystallinity and film morphology of the active layer, and finally influence the device performance.32–35
Here, we design and synthesize three A–D–A type acceptors 4TIC-2F, 4TIC-C8-2F and 4TIC-OC8-2F without and with flexible alkyl (or alkoxy) side chains at the two outmost thiophene units. UV-Vis absorption, energy levels and molecular packing properties of these three acceptors are investigated. Furthermore, OSCs are fabricated with PM6 as the donor polymer and these three different molecules as the acceptor. PCE of the 4TIC-C8-2F based as-cast devices is 10.75%, which is higher than that of 4TIC-2F (10.03%) and 4TIC-OC8-2F (10.13%) based OSCs. After adding 1-CN as the additive and employing thermal annealing at 140 °C for 5 minutes, the PCE is further enhanced to 12.65% for the 4TIC-C8-2F based devices.
Results and discussion
The chemical structures of 4TIC-2F, 4TIC-C8-2F and 4TIC-OC8-2F and the synthetic routes of 4TIC-C8-2F and 4TIC-OC8-2F are shown in Scheme 1. Starting materials diethyl 2,5-dibromothieno[3,2-b]thiophene-3,6-dicarboxylate, tributyl(4-octylthiophen-2-yl)stannane, and tributyl(4-(octyloxy)thiophen-2-yl)stannane are prepared according to the literature procedures.36–38 Compounds 1a and 1b are synthesized via palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction in yields of 81% and 85%, respectively. n-BuLi is added to 1-bromo-4-hexylbenzene in THF solution at −78 °C to form 4-hexylphenyllithium, which is subsequently quenched by 1a or 1b to afford the tertiary alcohol intermediates, which are cyclized using BF3·OEt2 as the catalyst to furnish 2a and 2b in yields of 42% and 39%, respectively. Compounds 2a and 2b are transformed to dialdehyde intermediates 3a and 3bvia Vilsmeier–Haack reaction in yields of 72% and 68%, respectively. Finally, 4TIC-C8-2F and 4TIC-OC8-2F are prepared by Knoevenagel condensation of the dialdehyde intermediates 3a and 3b with 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile with pyridine as the catalyst in yields of 60% and 65%, respectively. These three acceptors all display good solubilities in common organic solvents. The synthetic details are also described in the ESI.†

UV-Vis absorption spectra of 4TIC-2F, 4TIC-C8-2F and 4TIC-OC8-2F in dilute chloroform solutions and as thin films are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. In dilute solutions, it can be observed that the alkyl or alkoxyl side chain modification only has a little influence on the absorption of the acceptor molecules. Absorption spectra of 4TIC-2F, 4TIC-C8-2F and 4TIC-OC8-2F cover the range of 600–850 nm with the maximum absorption peaks located at 762, 775 and 748 nm, respectively. In going from solutions to thin films, the absorptions are red-shifted by 34 nm for 4TIC-2F, 49 nm for 4TIC-C8-2F and 52 nm for 4TIC-OC8-2F. The full widths at half maximum (FWHM) values of the film absorption spectra are 175 nm for 4TIC-2F, 182 nm for 4TIC-C8-2F and 152 nm for 4TIC-OC8-2F. The above results indicate that these acceptors can form J-aggregations in the solid state and the side chains could influence the molecular packing according to the variation of FWHM.39 According to the equation: Eoptg = 1240/λonset, optical bandgaps of 4TIC-2F, 4TIC-C8-2F and 4TIC-OC8-2F are calculated to be 1.41, 1.36 and 1.41 eV, respectively.

The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement is carried out to estimate energy levels of the three acceptors by the equation: EHOMO/LUMO = −e[(Eox/red − E(Fc/Fc+) + 4.8 V)] (eV). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are determined to be −5.73/−3.82 eV for 4TIC-2F, −5.68/−3.88 eV for 4TIC-C8-2F and −5.78/−3.83 eV for 4TIC-OC8-2F. Obviously, the introduction of alkyl or alkoxyl side chains has a little influence on the energy levels. Optical and electronic properties of these three acceptors are summarized in Table 1, and the visualized energy diagram is shown in Fig. 1c.

The photovoltaic performance of OSCs based on 4TIC-2F, 4TIC-C8-2F and 4TIC-OC8-2F is investigated. These solar cells are based on an inverted device architecture of ITO/ZnO (30 nm)/PM6:acceptor (100 nm)/MoO3 (8 nm)/Ag (100 nm). Note that the ZnO interlayer is prepared according to the literature.40 A series of processing conditions including polymer concentrations, active layer compositions, spin-coating rates, the use of solvent additives and thermal annealing are optimized to improve the solar cell performance. The most efficient solar cells are fabricated with a polymer concentration of 8 mg mL−1, a spin-coating rate of 1300 rpm, and a D:A ratio of 1:1. The 4TIC-2F based devices display a maximum PCE of 10.03% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.79 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 18.90 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 66.8%. The solar cells based on 4TIC-C8-2F achieve a higher PCE of 10.75% with a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 20.02 mA cm−2, and an FF of 64.5%. The 4TIC-OC8-2F based devices give a moderate PCE of 10.13% with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 18.82 mA cm−2, and an FF of 63.7%. Obviously, the introduction of steric hindrance side chains (alkyl or alkoxyl side chains) can endow the devices with higher Voc (vide infra). The photovoltaic performance of the 4TIC-C8-2F based devices can be further enhanced by the use of 1% 1-CN and thermal annealing. A PCE of 12.65% is achieved with a Voc of 0.78 V, a Jsc of 22.70 mA cm−2, and an FF of 71.5%. The elevated Jsc and FF can be ascribed to the improved and more balanced hole and electron transport mobilities (vide infra). Details regarding the optimization of the solar cells are described in the ESI,† and the photovoltaic performance parameters and J–V curves are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 2, respectively. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) under the monochromatic light is measured to verify the Jsc obtained from the J–V curves. As shown in Fig. 2b, 4TIC-2F, 4TIC-C8-2F and 4TIC-OC8-2F based devices all display a broad photo-to-current response in the range of 300–900 nm. The absorption edge of 4TIC-C8-2F based devices is slightly red-shifted in comparison with those of the 4TIC-2F and the 4TIC-OC8-2F based devices, which is consistent with their UV-vis absorption spectra. Jsc values derived by integrating the EQE curves are all in the error range of 5% in comparison with those obtained from the J–V curves, indicating the veracity of J–V curves.

The dependence of photocurrent on illumination intensity is measured to investigate the reason for the varied FF of photovoltaic devices based on 4TIC-2F, 4TIC-C8-2F and 4TIC-OC8-2F. As shown in Fig. 2c, Jsc and light intensity (Plight) display a linear relation in the log–log coordinate. A Jsc∝PSlight relation is found, where S is an index factor. S values of the 4TIC-2F, 4TIC-C8-2F and 4TIC-OC8-2F based as-cast devices are 0.97, 0.96 and 0.95, respectively. Besides, a further improved S value of 0.99 is achieved in the optimized devices based on 4TIC-C8-2F, suggesting a negligible bimolecular recombination loss of the photocurrent in the solar cell under a short-circuit condition.41 Obviously, the variation of FF can be well explained by the different S values. The relationship between the photocurrent density (Jph) and the effective voltage (Veff) is also measured to further investigate the recombination process in the solar cells. Jph is estimated by JL and JD according to the equation: Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD represent the current density measured under light and dark conditions, respectively. Veff is determined according to the equation: Veff = V0 − V, in which V0 is the value of the voltage point at which JL = JD and V is the applied voltage. Jph of all devices reaches a saturation (Jsat) when Veff approaches to 1, which indicates an efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection. Furthermore, the Jph/Jsat ratios, describing the probability of the exciton dissociation in photovoltaic devices, are found to be 95.11%, 94.59% and 93.84% for the as-cast solar cells based on 4TIC-2F, 4TIC-C8-2F and 4TIC-OC8-2F, respectively. In addition, a higher Jph/Jsat value of 96.89% is achieved in the 4TIC-C8-2F based optimal devices, giving rise to the highest FF for the 4TIC-C8-2F based devices.
Highly sensitive external quantum efficiency (sEQE) and electroluminescence (EL) measurements are employed to investigate the difference of Voc in the organic solar cells based on different acceptors. As shown in Fig. 3, the energy of the charge transfer state (Ect) is calculated using a Gaussian fit to the tail of the EQE and EL spectra. Furthermore, energy loss (Eloss) determined by the difference of Eg and qVoc is examined. Here, the values for Eg are estimated from the intersection between the absorption and emission spectra of the low-bandgap acceptors.42 We find that the Eloss values of the 4TIC-2F, 4TIC-C8-2F and 4TIC-OC8-2F based devices are 0.68, 0.60 and 0.64 eV, respectively. Eloss can be divided into three parts: the radiative recombination energy loss (ΔE1), the charge generation energy (ΔE2), and the non-radiative recombination energy loss (ΔE3).43–46 ΔE1 exists in all types of solar cells, and it is related to the upper limit of Voc. ΔE2 can be calculated from the difference between Eg and Ect, representing the driving force needed for excitons to dissociate. Generally, a large driving force is needed to promote an efficient charge separation in the photo active layer. However, in recent studies, highly efficient charge separations were achieved in non-fullerene organic solar cells with negligible driving forces.47,48 In this work, we find that the 4TIC-2F, 4TIC-C8-2F and 4TIC-OC8-2F based devices have very low ΔE2 values, which are only 0.11, 0.07 and 0.09 eV, respectively. At last, ΔE3 is calculated for the solar cells, according to the equation: ΔE3 = −kTln(EQEEL), where EQEEL is the external quantum efficiency of electroluminescence. As shown in Fig. 3e, the ΔE3 values of the 4TIC-2F, 4TIC-C8-2F and 4TIC-OC8-2F based devices are 0.28, 0.25 and 0.26 eV, respectively. Obviously, the introduction of the steric side chains can reduce ΔE3 and Eloss of the solar cell, thus endowing photovoltaic devices with higher Voc. After employing solvent additives and thermal annealing to optimize the morphology of the active layer of the solar cell based on 4TIC-C8-2F for an improved Jsc, Ect of the solar cell is lowered and ΔE3 is increased, which are the reasons for the reduced Voc compared to the as-cast devices. The energy loss terms of the photovoltaic devices are also summarized in Table 3.

To further investigate the differences of the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells based on different acceptors, morphologies of the blend films (in Fig. 4) are measured via atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 4a–d, the root mean square (RMS) roughness values of the as-cast PM6:4TIC-2F, PM6:4TIC-C8-2F and PM6:4TIC-OC8-2F blend films are 1.85, 1.86 and 2.77 nm, respectively. After employing solvent additives and thermal annealing at 140 °C for 5 min, the optimized PM6:4TIC-C8-2F blend film gives a much higher RMS value of 3.13 nm and the contrast of dark/bright regions becomes more distinct, indicating that the crystallinity of the optimal blend film is enhanced. As shown in Fig. 4e–h, the TEM image of PM6:4TIC-2F shows tiny fibrils with the width lower than 10 nm. As for the PM6:4TIC-C8-2F and PM6:4TIC-OC8-2F blend films, nevertheless, slightly thicker nanofibrils with a width of 15–20 nm are formed. Generally, the formation of nanofibrils networks is beneficial for the charge transport. Compared with 4TIC-2F and 4TIC-OC8-2F based devices, 4TIC-C8-2F based devices display higher Jsc, which can be explained by their slightly red-shifted absorption and higher and more balanced hole/electron mobilities (vide infra). For the optimal blend film of PM6:4TIC-C8-2F, larger phase separation and enhanced crystallinity are found, which is consistent with the GIWAXS measurement (vide infra).

The space charge limited current (SCLC) method is used to measure the hole and the electron mobilities in the active layers based on different acceptors. For the SCLC measurements, a device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au or ITO/ZnO/active layer/Al was used. As shown in Fig. S2 and Table S8 (ESI†), hole/electron mobilities of PM6:4TIC-2F, PM6:4TIC-C8-2F and PM6:4TIC-OC8-2F based devices are 8.06 × 10−5/4.76 × 10−5, 1.04 × 10−4/6.82 × 10−5 and 6.97 × 10−5/4.10 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher and more balanced hole/electron mobilities of the PM6:4TIC-C8-2F based devices can be used to explain the higher Jsc. After employing solvent additives and thermal annealing at 140 °C for 5 min, the hole and the electron mobilities of the PM6:4TIC-C8-2F based devices are improved to 1.37 × 10−4 and 1.22 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μh/μe ratio of 1.12. The much higher and more balanced hole/electron mobilities are beneficial for the higher Jsc and FF.
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) is used to investigate the molecular packing and orientation of pure and blend films. As shown in Fig. 5, the face-on and edge-on orientations coexist in the neat 4TIC-2F and 4TIC-C8-2F films, whereas the face-on orientation is dominant in the neat 4TIC-OC8-2F film. The (100) diffraction at 0.36 Å−1 in the in-plane (IP) direction and the (010) diffraction at 1.70 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction can be obviously observed in the one-dimensional pattern of 4TIC-OC8-2F, corresponding to the lamellar and π–π stacking distance of 17.44 and 3.69 Å, respectively. In comparison, 4TIC-2F and 4TIC-C8-2F neat films display a weaker diffraction peak in the wide angle region, which corresponds to a slightly larger π–π stacking distance of approximately 4.33 Å. Besides, the crystal coherence length (CCL) is estimated to analyze molecular stacking.49–51 According to the equation: CCL = 2π/FWHM, CCL values of the (010) diffraction in the OOP direction are 10.4, 9.3 and 28.1 nm for 4TIC-2F, 4TIC-C8-2F and 4TIC-OC8-2F films, respectively, indicating that 4TIC-OC8-2F with alkoxyl side chains possesses better crystalline quality. Compared with PM6:4TIC-2F and PM6:4TIC-C8-2F blend films, the PM6:4TIC-OC8-2F blend film displays a more distinct face-on orientation in GIWAXS diffraction patterns. In particular, the optimal blend film of 4TIC-C8-2F tends to form the face-on orientation as observed in the GIWAXS diffraction patterns and the π–π stacking peak in the OOP direction becomes stronger, which is beneficial for the charge transport and can well explain the improved Jsc and FF for the 4TIC-C8-2F based optimal devices.

Conclusions
In summary, three A–D–A type FREAs, 4TIC-2F, 4TIC-C8-2F and 4TIC-OC8-2F, were designed and synthesized. As demonstrated by GIWAXS measurements, the molecular orientation, crystallinity and blend film morphology were effectively regulated by the introduction of the flexible side chains at the two outmost thiophene rings of the acceptor molecules. Solar cells based on 4TIC-C8-2F and 4TIC-OC8-2F displayed higher charge transfer state energy and lower energy loss, thus endowing the 4TIC-C8-2F and the 4TIC-OC8-2F based OSCs with higher Voc. As a result, the PCEs of PM6:4TIC-C8-2F and PM6:4TIC-OC8-2F based OSCs were 10.75% and 10.13%, respectively, higher than that of PM6:4TIC-2F based devices (10.03%). After employing 1-CN as the solvent additive and thermal annealing at 140 °C for 5 minutes, a PCE of 12.65% was realized in the optimized PM6:4TIC-C8-2F based OSCs. Our work demonstrates that side chain engineering is a highly promising strategy for developing high-efficiency FREAs.
