PANI was coated between the photoactive layer and the top anode in transparent flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). The performances of the devices with different PANI thicknesses were investigated. The results demonstrate that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increased nearly four-fold with an 18 nm thick PANI layer compared to the reference cell without PANI. The optimum device performance with an 18 nm PANI layer exhibits a Jsc of 11.60 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.89 V, a FF of 66.87%, and thus a PCE of 6.87% under AM1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The conversion efficiency of transparent flexible OSCs changes after 1500 bending cycles.IntroductionOrganic solar cells (OSCs) have recently received increased attention, having already demonstrated great potential as renewable, flexible, lightweight, transparent, and low-cost energy sources.1–4 Nowadays, the power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs has exceeded 10% in organic tandem solar cells,5 in which energy losses can be overcome by stacking two or more solar cells with different optical gaps. Nonetheless, to find practical applications for this fast emerging technology, further improvements in the power-conversion efficiency are desired.6In this present study, we demonstrate inverted transparent flexible OSCs with an efficiency of 6.87%, employing a versatile conducting polymer, polyaniline (PANI), as an anode buffer layer. To date, we have seen extensive investigations of transparent OSCs with an inverted device structure, using modified indium tin oxide (ITO) as the negative electrode. Many researchers have proposed various methods to modify the ITO interface such as the incorporation of n-type metal oxides or metal carbonates,7–13 titanium oxide, zinc oxide and cesium carbonate, conjugated polyelectrolyte,14–16 self-assembled crosslinked fullerene17,18 and self-assembled polar molecules.19 Furthermore, it is generally accepted that the inverted architecture improves the long-term shelf life stability by simply avoiding the need for the commonly employed conductive polymer; poly(3,4-ethylenedioxylenethiophene):poly(styrenesulphonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) as well as the low-work-function metal cathode (Ca, Mg, and Al), both of which are disadvantageous to device stability.18,20 Compared to tandem solar cells, an inverted transparent structure can also take advantage of the stacking of many cells to achieve higher performance as well as better stability. Thus, an inverted structure can be considered as the ideal configuration for OSCs. Despite these advantages, the performances of most transparent OSCs reported to date are mediocre compared to those of a conventional structure. Today, the ability of transparent OSCs to offer full control of photon harnessing from the solar spectrum has not been achieved. Consequently, not all solar light can be absorbed, leading to lower efficiency, low stability as well as low strength compared to the current state-of-the-art. Therefore, OSC technology, especially transparent OSC technology, is still in its early stages of development and is not ready for mass commercialization.Previously, Ecker and co-workers reported that PANI can be incorporated into OSCs to enhance hole injection from low-work-function metals such as Al (work function of 4.3 eV),21 and consequently can be used to establish high-efficiency and air-stable OSCs.21 In addition, we also found that efficient hole injection can be realized with a high work function metal, for example Au (5.2 eV), due to the presence of a strong interface dipole.2In this report, we demonstrate that the efficiency of transparent flexible OSCs can be enhanced to 6.87%, an improvement of 14.5% over the previously reported record efficiency of 6%.22 This increase in efficiency is obtained with the use of an inverted structure, where a self-assembled monolayer (C60-SAM)23 is used as the ITO surface modifier, a blend of poly[(4,4′-bis(3-(2-ethyl-hexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:3′-d]silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,5-(3-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole)]:indene-C60 bisadduct (PSEHTT:ICBA)24 is used as the photoactive layer (see Fig. 1), and PANI served as a hole transport layer (HTL). In contrast to previously reported transparent inverted OSCs,22 in which the HTL is based on thermally evaporated p-type metal oxides, our device is fully solution processed at room temperature (except the top electrode), thus enabling simple processability and cost-effectiveness over a large area. As a result, this technique is fully acquiescent to high throughput roll-to-roll manufacturing techniques, may be used to fabricate low-cost OSCs of a large area without the need for vacuum-deposition, and will find realistic applications in future mass commercialization. Fig. 1  (a) Fabrication process for the transparent flexible OSCs, and (b) energy levels of all materials used in transparent flexible OSCs. Results and discussionFig. 1a shows the fabrication steps of the transparent flexible OSCs while Fig. 1b depicts the energy levels of the materials used in this study. It is well known that PSEHTT and ICBA exist in an interpenetrating network, and could form a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of PANI is 5.1 eV,25 which is similar to that of the HOMO level of PSEHTT (5.1 eV).24 This well-matched energy level shows that PANI can extract holes from the photoactive layer. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of PANI is 2.6 eV,25 which is higher than that of ICBA (3.7 eV).26 As we can see from this energy diagram, the introduction of a PANI layer will halt electrons from being transported from the ICBA layer to the Ag top electrode. Consequently, the presence of the PANI layer results in the efficient avoidance of charge carrier recombination at the photoactive layer/Ag interface. When light is projected towards the device, PSEHTT absorbed light, generates excitons, which are subsequently separated into electrons and holes. The photogenerated holes are collected at the Ag electrode via the HOMO of PANI (5.1 eV),25i.e. it plays a role in this energy level step, which is favorable for hole transport. Moreover, the photogenerated electrons are collected by the PET electrode via the LUMO level of ICBA and the conduction band (CB) of TiO2. It is worth noting that the LUMO of PANI (2.6 eV) is slightly higher than that of ICBA (3.4 eV). In this device, the presence of C60-SAM basically improves the electron extraction at the interface of the photoactive layer/PET electrode. The collection enhancement of electrons and holes will result in the improvement of the photocurrent.In this article, we report high performance transparent flexible OSCs based on PSEHTT:ICBA.24 By controlling the thickness of the anode buffer layer, the PCEs of the transparent flexible OSCs range from 1.83 to 6.87% with the corresponding transparencies ranging from 300 to 800 nm. Fig. 2a depicts transmittance of the transparent flexible OSCs with different PANI thicknesses and Fig. 2b shows the chemical structure of our active materials.24 The average transmittances in the visible regime (370–740 nm) are presented in Table 1. As the thickness of the PANI varies from 0 to 18 nm, the average transmittance can be controlled accordingly from 36 to 53%. This indicates the flexibility of transparency management via controlling the thickness of the anode buffer layer. Moreover, Fig. 2a also illustrates the average transmittance of the device without the PANI (53%).

Fig. 3a demonstrates the J–V curves of transparent flexible OSCs with various PANI thicknesses (0 to 18 nm) under AM1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. Table 1 shows the extracted parameters from the J–V characteristics. The device without a PANI layer showed a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 3.75 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.89 V, a fill factor (FF) of 54.81%, and a PCE of 1.83%. We attribute the poor performance of the device without a PANI layer to the direct contact of the photoactive layer and the Ag electrode. There is also the possibility that ICBA will transfer electrons to the Ag electrode. As we can see from Fig. 3a, the performance of the device significantly increased with the introduction of a PANI layer. Upon the addition of an 18 nm layer of PANI, the device exhibited a Jsc of 11.60 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.89 V, a FF of 66.87%, and a PCE of 6.87%. The big enhancement of Jsc (65%) could be due to the fact that the PANI layer is able to block electrons and transport holes from the photoactive layer to the Ag electrode. As for the FF, it can be described that PANI layer probably modifies the photoactive layer/Ag interface, where it can be seen obviously in the series resistance (Rs), which is defined by the slope of the J–V curve at Jsc = 0 mA cm−2. The Rs is estimated to be 500 Ω for the device without PANI and 200 Ω with 18 nm PANI. The decrease in Rs is accompanied with an enlargement of FF from 54.81 to 66.89%. When the thickness of PANI continues to increase beyond 18 nm, the device performance degraded abruptly (Fig. S1†). Fig. 3  (a) J–V characteristics of the transparent flexible OSCs with different PANI thicknesses under AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2, and (b) external quantum efficiency of the transparent flexible OSCs with different PANI thicknesses. Fig. 3b shows the results of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements of the transparent flexible OSCs with various PANI thicknesses. The EQE of the device without the presence of a PANI layer shows a maximum of 29% at 580 nm. However, the EQE of the device with an 18 nm PANI layer shows a maximum of 60% at 560 nm, which is a dramatic improvement and is almost double that of the transparent flexible OSC without a PANI layer. It can be seen that 18 nm is the ideal thickness for the PANI layer in transparent flexible OSCs. The trend of EQE with different PANI thicknesses is consistent with the J–V characteristics (Fig. 3a). It is worth noting that the integration results of the EQE results are in good agreement with our experimental Jsc's to within a few percent.In order to demonstrate the flexibility of our transparent devices, bending tests were carried out as depicted in Fig. S2† and the curvature was defined as the inverse radius of the device on plastic. Fig. S2c and d† illustrate the physical tensile and compressive strain effects on the photovoltaic performance of our transparent flexible OSCs. As shown in Fig. S2c† (physical tensile strain test), no significant changes in the PCE were observed up to a tensile curvature radius of about 1 cm−1. Significant changes in the PCE can be seen as the curvature radius was increased further. We attribute this behavior to the vertical current path of the OSCs, scarcely influenced by the bending test. A similar trend occurred for the compressive strain test (Fig. S2d†), in which no significant changes were observed up to a compressive curvature radius of 1.1 cm−1.Fig. 4 illustrates that the photovoltaic performance was almost unchanged. Although the compressive curvature was further increased to a higher value, all photovoltaic parameters excluding Jsc remained unchanged. A small increase in Jsc was observed which we attribute to the high light trapping and light absorption due to the compressive bending tests. The effects on the performance of the transparent flexible OSCs were measured by evaluating their performance after application of tensile and compressive strain. Fig. 4  Normalized photovoltaic performance of the transparent flexible OSCs with different PANI thicknesses (a) 18 nm, and (b) 2 nm as a function of bending–compressing cycles. Bending–compressing was done to a radius of 4 mm. The results from the bending–relaxing–compressing–relaxing experiments are shown in Fig. 4. It is worth noting that in each cycle, the transparent flexible OSCs was first bent around a solid column (radius = 4 mm), relaxed, then compressed, and finally relaxed for the second measurement. For the bending curvature with a radius of 4 mm, the tensile strain is calculated to be 2.7%. In this study, the devices with two different PANI thicknesses (2 nm and 18 nm) were chosen for the bending–relaxing–compressing–relaxing experiments. The typical J–V characteristics for each transparent device after bending–compressing 300, 600, 900, 1200, 1500, 1800, and 2100 times are illustrated in Fig. 4a and b. It can be observed that the bending–compressing-induced variations of Jsc and FF are negligible, and only a slight decrease of Voc was observed after 1500 bending–compressing cycles. This slight reduction of Voc is probably induced by degradation of the interlayer contacts of the device. On the other hand, a significant decrease in PCE was observed after certain numbers of bending–compressing cycles, for the transparent flexible OSC with a 2 nm PANI layer.The plots of Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE of the transparent flexible OSCs as a function of the number of bending–compressing cycles for devices with 18 nm and 2 nm PANI layers are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. For the device with an 18 nm PANI layer, the value of Jsc remains constant for certain numbers of bending–compressing cycles followed by a tiny drop after more than 1500 cycles (Fig. 4a). The same trend is also observed for the value of PCE of the device. Note that the critical number of bending–compressing cycles to cause degradation of device performance in OSCs is totally different for the device with an 18 nm PANI layer and the device with a 2 nm PANI layer. In the device fabricated with a 2 nm thick PANI layer (Fig. 4b), Voc and PCE start to drop after around 600 cycles, while the transparent flexible OSCs with an 18 nm thick PANI layer (Fig. 4a) do not exhibit a drop in Voc or PCE until more than 1500 cycles. This indicates that the transparent flexible OSCs subjected to tensile and compressive stresses perform more stably when the PANI layer is relatively thicker. The PANI layer is composed of single-layer PANI, which has good mechanical flexibility and can recover immediately after the strain relaxation. In the thicker PANI layer, the probability of maintaining the initially good contact and resistance is higher, which enables it to resist much higher tensile stress. Therefore, it is worth noting that the 18 nm PANI-layer-based transparent flexible OSCs are able to undergo more than a thousand bending cycles (2.7% tensile strain) without significant loss of performance. This clearly indicates the high mechanical flexibility of the chemically derived PANI layer.As the efficiency of OPV devices increases continuously, their stability is one of the biggest issues. It is worth noting that an unencapsulated device degrades fast in ambient air. Many approaches have been put forward to alleviate the degradation process, for example, by making use of an inverted structure as well as using a less reactive metal top electrode such as Ag. Although Ag is used as the metal contact, the degradation process still occurred but at a relatively slower rate. In the present study, all of our devices were unencapsulated since the motivation was to fabricate a high performance flexible transparent device. The degradation of device performance can therefore be due to the devices’ unencapsulated nature or to physical damage sustained during the bending test. However, since both devices have a PANI layer, we therefore assumed that degradation was due to the physical damage sustained during the bending test.To further investigate the effect of the PANI buffer layer on the interface resistance of the devices, the impedance spectra of the devices were measured under dark conditions. Fig. S3a† reveals the complex impedance spectra of the devices with an 18 nm PANI layer and without a PANI layer. In the impedance spectra, we employed a Nyquist plot in the frequency range of 20 Hz to 2 MHz. As we can see from Fig. S3a,† two semicircles are observed, enabling one to investigate the internal resistance in the thin film transparent flexible OSCs. Fig. S3a† clearly illustrates that the diameter of the semicircle for the device with an 18 nm PANI buffer layer is smaller compared to the one without a PANI layer. A simplified circuit diagram can be drawn as shown in Fig. S3b,† where both resistance and capacitance are connected in parallel, which is equivalent to the transparent flexible OSCs since there are two semicircles located in the first quadrant of the Nyquist plot (Fig. S3a†).From Fig. S3b,† the resistance of the transparent flexible OSC integrated with an 18 nm PANI layer is smaller (0.5 Ω mm2) than that of the resistance of the transparent flexible OSC without any buffer layer (4.5 Ω mm2). Thus, we conclude that with the insertion of a PANI buffer layer, the performance of the transparent flexible OSCs was not only improved, but the contact between the photoactive layer and the top electrode (Ag) was also improved, resulting in a significant decrease in the resistance of the complete device.ConclusionsIn conclusion, we have showed that PANI is an effective anode buffer layer in transparent flexible OSCs. As can be seen from the energy levels of the respective layers, the PANI layer can block electrons and transport holes to the appropriate electrode. The device performance as a function of PANI layer thickness has been investigated. We found that 18 nm is the optimum thickness for the PANI layer in a transparent flexible OSC. The optimal device performance shows a Jsc of 11.60 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.89 V, a FF of 66.87%, and thus a PCE of 6.87% under AM1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. Our device also demonstrated a tiny drop in performance after 1500 cycles of bending–compressing tests under 2.7% tensile strain.Experimental sectionTiO2 layer preparationThe sol–gel procedure for producing TiO2 is as follows: titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4, Aldrich, 99.999%, 10 mL) was prepared as a precursor and mixed with 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, Aldrich, 99%, 50 mL) and ethanolamine (H2NCH2CH2OH, Aldrich, 99%, 5 mL) in a three-necked flask equipped with a condenser, a thermometer, and an argon-gas inlet/outlet. Then, the mixed solution was heated at 80 °C for 2 h in a silicon-oil bath with magnetic stirring, followed by heating to 120 °C for 1 h. The two-step heating process (80 and 120 °C) was then repeated. The typical TiO2 precursor solution was prepared in isopropyl alcohol.PANI layer preparationA highly conducting PANI layer was prepared as follows: aniline solution in HCl was added to a chloroform–water mixture and stirred at a desired temperature until the solution became a cloudy colloid. Ammonium persulfate solution in HCl was added dropwise to the cooled reaction mixture with stirring. The polymerization reactions were carried out in a 2 L jacketed reaction vessel with an anchor stirrer paddle connected to a circulation chiller unit. The synthesizing process was stopped when the solution turned green in color, characteristic of PANI emeraldine.Fabrication of transparent flexible OSCsFor the fabrication of transparent flexible OSCs, the PET substrates first underwent a routine cleaning step, which included sonication in detergent followed by repeated rinsing in acetone, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, deionized water, and finally treatment with ultraviolet (UV) ozone. Titanium oxide was first spin-coated onto the PET substrate at 4000 rpm to give a layer thickness of 25 nm. The resulting TiO2 layer was left for 1 h in air at room temperature to allow hydrolysis to occur. The coated substrate was then baked at 150 °C for 10 min inside a glove box, before spin-coating of the self-assembled fullerene C60.23 Poly[(4,4′-bis(3-(2-ethyl-hexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:3′-d]silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,5-(3-(2-ethyl-hexyl)thiophen-2-yl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole)]:indene-C60 bisadduct (PSEHTT:ICBA) (1:1, weight ratio) was dissolved in a solvent mixture of 1,2-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) and 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT) (ODCB:ODT = 100:2.5, v/v) for the first active layer.24 The synthesis of PSEHTT was performed according to the previously published work by Jenekhe and co-workers24 The ICBA (>99%, purified with isomers) was purchased from LUMTEC and used without any further purification. The active layer was obtained by spin-coating the blend at 700 rpm for 60 s and the thickness of the layer was ∼110 nm (vacuum dried 1 h), as measured with a Dektak profilometer. The PANI anode buffer layer was spin-coated at varying thicknesses from 0–18 nm using different spin-coating speeds (700–1400 rpm for 25 s). The active device area was 0.04 cm2. Before cathode deposition, the layer was vacuum dried for 30 min. The power conversion efficiencies of the inverted OPVs were measured under illumination of AM1.5G simulated solar light (Oriel Model 91192) at 100 mW cm−2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded with a Keithley 2410 source unit. The EQE measurements were performed using an EQE system (Model 74000) obtained from Newport Oriel Instruments USA and a HAMAMATSU calibrated silicon cell photodiode used as a reference diode. The wavelength was controlled with a 200–1600 nm monochromator. For bending–compressing cycle tests, we used a custom-made bending tester, which can vary both the number of bending cycles and the radius of curvature.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Industrial Strategic Technology Development (10045269, Development of Soluble TFT and Pixel Formation Materials/Process Technologies for AMOLED TV) funded by MOTIE/KEIT.ReferencesS.
