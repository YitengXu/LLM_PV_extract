    , Accepted 10th July 2014First published on 10th July 2014AbstractCopper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS) has attracted significant attention in the past few years as a next-generation absorber material, and is a promising candidate for the mass production of thin-film solar cells with high efficiencies. Here, we demonstrate a non-toxic solvent-based hybrid-ink approach for the fabrication of a high-quality CZTS absorber layer with a thickness of 1.3 μm and micrometer-scale grains (∼1 μm), resulting in an efficiency of 8.17%. In particular, we investigate the effects of the solid-state Zn metal or ZnS precursor on both the phase transformation and the device performance, which clearly suggests that the low-melting-point Zn phase effectively facilitates the phase-pure, high-performance CZTS absorber layer without the formation of secondary phases that have been observed in most cases of CZTS solar cells derived from wet chemical processes. We believe that our environmentally friendly approach will pave the way toward achieving low-cost, scalable solar cells with high efficiencies.
1. Introduction
Kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) is considered one of the most attractive materials to serve as an alternative to conventional Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2-based absorber layers, because CZTSSe is composed of earth-abundant and environmentally friendly constituents. It has an optimal direct band gap (1.0–1.5 eV) and a high absorption coefficient of 104 cm−1.1–9 To date, CZTSSe thin films have been prepared using two methods: vacuum-based and non-vacuum solution-based processes. Vacuum-based technologies such as co-evaporation10 and sputtering11 allow precise control of both the composition of the overall film and the phase profile along the film thickness. However, both methods are unfit, to some extent, for the cost-effective commercialization of large-area solar cells. Alternatively, non-vacuum solution-based approaches, including electrodeposition,12 nanocrystal ink,13 and hydrazine-based ink,14–16 could offer a low-cost route to the fabrication of these optoelectronically active devices because of their large-area deposition capabilities.17,18 Among the proposed techniques, the hydrazine-based hybrid-ink approach has received significant recent attention, which demonstrates the potential of solution-processed, highly efficient CZTSSe solar cells.19–22 Hydrazine (N2H4) is a carbon- and oxygen-free ideal solvent medium in which metal chalcogenides could be dissolved. This approach would eliminate the possibility of incorporating impurities. In hydrazine-based hybrid methodologies, Cu and Sn elemental constituents are dissolved with no additives, and ZnS nanoparticles are suspended in a precursor solution, acting as stress-relief and crack-deflection centers. This unique combination in an ink preparation enables the fabrication of highly pure and precisely stoichiometry-controlled CZTSSe films, leading to a maximum efficiency of 12.6%.19 However, hydrazine is highly toxic and explosive in practical usage, which has stimulated the development of non-hydrazine, non-toxic, environmentally friendly, solution-based approaches.19–22
A wide variety of alternative solvents has been explored to preclude the use of hydrazine. The Yang group developed a clear solution in which all precursors were dissolved in a mixture of ethanolamine and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). This procedure led to solution-deposited CZTSSe solar cells with efficiencies of 7.5%.22 However, this approach still required hydrazine to synthesize the relevant hydrazinium complexes that were soluble in the mixed solvent. Metal salt-based sol–gel methods, in which either 2-methoxyethanol, water, or DMSO was utilized as a solvent, have resulted in CZTSSe devices with efficiencies of 5.1–7.5%.23–25 Apart from the all-soluble precursor-based methods, we have previously reported a non-toxic solvent-based slurry approach in which all commercially available precursor particles were suspended in ethanol, resulting in 7.1% efficient CZTSSe cells.26 However, it should be noted that most of the prior research studies have exploited post-selenization processes under an extremely toxic Se atmosphere for the adjustment of the absorber layer band gap. Considering this, it is beneficial to develop highly efficient pure sulfide Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) solar cells without incorporating a harmful selenization process. To date, electrodeposited and selenization-free CZTS devices have been demonstrated with efficiencies of 7.99%.27 For solution-derived CZTS solar cells, the efficiencies have been limited to 5.14–5.29%.28,29
We present a non-toxic solvent-based hybrid-ink approach that retains the advantage associated with soluble/insoluble phase-mixed hybrid methods in producing highly efficient CZTS solar cells. Our hybrid inks are prepared with 2-methoxyethanol, an environmentally benign solvent, because it can evaporate quickly and thereby minimize the presence of residual carbon- or oxygen-containing impurities in the film. Cu and Sn precursors are completely dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol by complexation with thiourea,23,30 and an insoluble Zn precursor is employed in the precursor solution containing Cu and Sn components to form hybrid-type inks. We disperse either Zn metal or ZnS (here onwards denoted ZM and ZS, respectively) particles as a Zn precursor, with an emphasis on investigating the influence of solid precursors in hybrid inks on both the phase transition and the device performance. Other types of solid-state Zn sources, such as ZnO and Zn(OH)2, are not employed, to prevent the precursors from being present as an oxide phase or from oxidizing to an oxide phase during annealing; if this were the case, an additional reducing step would be required. After an in-depth study on the critical role of ZM as a low melting point phase, the resulting CZTS photovoltaic devices can be observed to demonstrate a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.17%. This result indicates that our approach is potentially viable for fabricating CZTS solar cells without the involvement of a complex synthesis, a highly toxic solvent, and harmful selenization. In particular, our non-toxic solvent based hybrid approach is cost-effective as compared with the hydrazine based slurry approach. The amount of waste stream is supposed to be similar, because the absorber layers are fabricated by a spin coating method in both approaches. However, the hydrazine must be handled using appropriate protective equipment to prevent physical contact with either a vapor or a liquid, because hydrazine is extremely toxic and dangerously unstable. Indeed, in terms of bio-degradability, which represents the chemical dissolution of materials by bacteria or other biological means without harmful residue, the bio-degradability of the hydrazine solvent is about 28%, which is quite lower than that of 2-methoxyethanol (∼97%) (Fig. S1, ESI†). These values suggest that our hybrid ink would significantly reduce the amount of hazardous waste treatment by ∼96% as compared with hydrazine based slurry.
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of ZM hybrid ink-derived films annealed under a H2S atmosphere at different temperatures. All samples were pre-annealed at 250 °C under a H2/Ar atmosphere. For the sulfurization process, Ar gas was supplied during a ramping period, and H2S gas was supplied upon approaching a desired temperature. At sulfurization temperatures ranging from 250 to 350 °C, the diffraction peaks at the 2θ values of 26.6° and 30.2°, corresponding to Cu2SnS3 with the wurtzite structure (JCPDS 27-0198, denoted WZ),31 were mainly observed along with a zinc blende Cu2SnS3 phase (JCPDS 33-0501, denoted ZB)31 at 28.45°, 47.3° and 56.2°. At temperatures above 400 °C, it was clearly observed that the peak at 26.6° disappeared and that the diffraction peaks at 28.45°, 32.98°, 47.3° and 56.2° evolved, which implies the formation of the CZTS phase (JCPDS 26-0575) at the expense of Cu2SnS3 even at relatively low temperatures. The formation enthalpy of the ZnS phase is lower than those of other binary sulfide compounds (e.g., CuS, Cu2S, SnS, and SnS2), which suggests that ZnS most likely forms during a sulfurization process32 but that the ZnS phase cannot be precisely detected in XRD spectra as a result of the low crystallinity of the corresponding phases and the ambiguity in individually identifying the CZTS, Cu2SnS3, and ZnS phases in the XRD spectra. However, it can be presumed that the formation of Zn-related phases, which involves an elemental loss in the form of volatile phases, did not evolve because the composition did not vary after sulfurization at elevated temperatures. The Cu:Zn:Sn compositional ratios were measured to be 1.78:1.1:1 and 1.77:1.1:1 for films pre-annealed at 250 °C and sulfurized at 550 °C, respectively. In the case of ZS hybrid ink-derived films, the thermal behavior in crystalline phase transformations differed from that of the ZM hybrid ink-based films (Fig. 1b). Both the wurtzite and zinc blende structured Cu2SnS3 phases co-existed when the film was sulfurized at temperatures as high as 400 °C, and the kesterite CZTS phase was observed only above 450 °C unlike the ZM hybrid ink-derived film for which the kesterite phase began to appear at 400 °C. However, it should be noted that the peaks at approximately 2θ = 28.45°, 47.3° and 56.2° overlap with the CZTS, Cu2SnS3, and ZnS phase characteristic peaks in the XRD spectrum, such that the phase purity of CZTS cannot be confirmed solely using XRD analysis. Therefore, Raman spectroscopy was utilized to assist with the phase identification.

Enlarged graphs in the 2θ range of 25° to 33° (right side) show traces of secondary phases. 

Fig. 2 shows Raman spectra measured using 514 nm excitation wavelength. After sulfurization at 250 °C, the ZM hybrid ink-derived film exhibited peaks at 290, 312, 331, and 352 cm−1 all of which are attributed to Cu2SnS3 (Fig. 2a).33 The Cu2SnS3 peaks in the zinc blende and wurtzite structures cannot be distinguished because of peak overlapping at 300–350 cm−1.34 At a sulfurization temperature of 350 °C, most of the peaks related to Cu2SnS3 (i.e., at 290 and 331 cm−1) disappeared, whereas the peaks at 287, 338, and 359 cm−1 ascribed to CZTS were detected. This result is indicative of the formation of CZTS together with Cu2SnS3 as a minor phase. Above 400 °C, all detected peaks were assigned to kesterite CZTS, which correlated well with the XRD analysis.33–35 In the case of ZS hybrid ink-derived films sulfurized at 250–350 °C, the ZnS phase was observed at 353 cm−1 together with the Cu2SnS3 phase. This result was indicated by peaks at 297 and 331 cm−1 (Fig. 2b). At 400 °C, Cu3SnS4 (or Cu5Sn2S7) was also detected by the peak at 312 cm−1,36 and phase-pure CZTS appeared at a sulfurization temperature above 450 °C. The ZnS is a well-known secondary phase present in solution-processed CZTS or in CZTSSe absorber layers,10,32–34 but it is difficult to precisely monitor the ZnS phase using Raman spectra with a 514 nm excitation wavelength. For further phase elucidation, we performed Raman analysis with a 325 nm excitation wavelength similar to the ZnS band gap (∼3.7 eV). In this case, strong resonant Raman scattering made it possible to detect even traces of ZnS.33–35 The ZM hybrid ink-derived film exhibited only the CZTS phase at 338 cm−1 without showing any ZnS phase when exposed to sulfurization temperatures ranging from 350 to 550 °C (Fig. 2c). By contrast, the ZnS phase was identified by peaks at 350 and 700 cm−1 in ZS hybrid ink-derived films regardless of the annealing temperatures (Fig. 2d). The ZnS remained an impurity even when the film was annealed to 550 °C.

The different reaction pathways in crystalline structural transformations toward a phase-pure CZTS layer were also confirmed by a thermo-gravimetric (TG) analysis under an inert atmosphere coupled with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). As shown in Fig. 3a, the ZM hybrid ink involved a weight loss of ∼2% with an exothermic peak at ∼200 °C, attributable to the decomposition of dissolved precursors. The broad endothermic peak at ∼250 °C is likely a result of the crystallization of Cu2SnS3, as indicated by the XRD and Raman analyses. The sharp endothermic peak at ∼320 °C would result from the melting of metallic Zn. It is possible that metallic Zn particles with a diameter of ∼70 nm melt at temperatures lower than the melting point of the bulk phase (420 °C).37 This characteristic melting behavior of metallic Zn nanoparticles reveals the evolution of a reactive liquid phase surrounding the Cu–Sn–S precursor phases during a ramping stage under an Ar atmosphere. Zn melting may induce a capillary force that pulls the particles together, leading the microstructural rearrangement toward more packed particulate films.38 When the H2S gas was supplied at high temperatures above 350 °C, the vigorous liquid phase diffusion and chemical reaction with vapor S molecules enabled a dense and phase-pure kesterite CZTS film to form, without leaving any secondary phases—including the ZnS phase. Reduced weight loss was observed until 400 °C using the ZS hybrid ink, although the overall loss was similar to that of the ZM hybrid ink. Two small endothermic inflection points were observed at 443 °C and 475 °C, with no sharp endothermic peak at ∼320 °C. Furthermore, the heat flow above 350 °C decayed more gradually than that of the ZM hybrid ink. This result may indicate a sluggish phase transformation from the ZS hybrid layer to the CZTS film. The ZnS phase presented in ZS hybrid films has a relatively high melting point of 1185 °C. It is therefore possible that the ZnS particles remain intact in the solid state during the sulfurization process. This solid-state reaction, even when involved with a gas phase reaction with H2S molecules, would retard the CZTS phase transformation, instead converting the preformed Cu2SnS3 phase into a Cu3SnS4 or a Cu5Sn2S7 phase. At sulfurization temperatures as high as 450 °C, ZnS began to take part in a reaction with the Cu2SnS3, Cu3SnS4 or Cu5Sn2S7 phases, from which the kesterite CZTS phase formed through a multi-step phase formation. Small endothermic inflection points in the TG-DSC indicated this phenomenon, which resulted in unreacted ZnS secondary phases.

Fig. 4 shows the microstructural evolution of non-toxic hybrid ink-derived absorbers after a sulfurization process at 550 °C. Both the ZM and ZS hybrid ink-derived films exhibited dense microstructures with large grains (>1 μm). To investigate the compositional uniformity, the lateral compositional distributions in the top surfaces of both films were determined using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). It was revealed that whereas the composition uniformity was obtainable in a ZM hybrid ink-derived film (Fig. 4a), the bright domain in an elemental map of Zn, indicative of a lump of ZnS, was distinctively detected in a ZS hybrid ink-derived film (Fig. 4b). This result is in accordance with the analytical result obtained by Raman spectroscopy. Cross-sectional images of the ZM hybrid- and ZS hybrid ink-derived films are shown in Fig. 4c and d, respectively. Both films had uniformly dense structures without large pores and cracks. However, as observed in the interfacial morphology (shown as inset images), the needle-like segregated phase was observed only in the ZS hybrid ink-derived CZTS films. The MoS2 in the ZS hybrid ink-derived CZTS films is thicker than that in the ZM hybrid-ink derived CZTS films.

The CZTS absorber layers, prepared after a sulfurization process at 550 °C, were employed during the fabrication of complete thin-film solar cells. Fig. 5a shows the cross-sectional SEM image of a complete CZTS solar cell with a ZM hybrid ink-derived absorber layer. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic of the highest performing CZTS solar cell under AM 1.5 illumination is shown in Fig. 5b, and the cell performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. The ZM hybrid ink-derived device, which had an effective area of 0.23 cm2, exhibited an efficiency of 8.17% [open-circuit voltage (VOC) = 0.56 V, short-circuit current density (JSC) = 26.95 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) = 55.17%]. The narrow performance deviation was also confirmed by a reproducibly high efficiency that exceeded 8% (Table S1, ESI†). The device employing the ZS hybrid ink-derived CZTS layer had an efficiency of 5.38%, which was characterized by a lower VOC and a higher RS compared with the ZM hybrid ink-derived counterpart. It is speculated that these values are attributed predominantly to the presence of ZnS as a secondary phase in an absorber layer.35,39 The ZnS phase has a higher band gap than CZTS, such that it could act as a resistance layer to impede charge carrier drift.10,35 The external quantum efficiency (EQE) as a function of photon wavelength is shown in Fig. 5c. EQE analysis indicated that the ZS hybrid-ink-derived cell suffered from quantum efficiency loss compared with ZM-based devices. This result is indicated by a steep downslope after the maximum quantum efficiency. The EQE spectra at short wavelengths (below ∼540 nm) are slightly poorer than those reported by others because the buffer layer thickness used was ∼60 nm. For ZM hybrid ink-derived cells, the maximum quantum efficiency of 82% was obtained at a photon wavelength of 540 nm, and the band gap was determined to be 1.46 eV from the EQE spectra by fitting a plot of [Eln(1 − EQE)]2vs. E near the band edge. The ZS hybrid ink-based device had a maximum quantum efficiency of 74% at 540 nm, with a band gap of 1.52 eV. The ratio of EQE at −1 and 0 V, or [EQE(−1.0 V)/EQE(0.0 V)], is indicative of the degree of carrier collection efficiency. In general, the minority carrier suffers from ineffective charge collection without external bias since its diffusion length is relatively short. By applying −1 V reverse bias, the depletion region can extend to assist the minority carrier to be effectively collected, which raises the EQE response. Consequently, the EQE(−1 V)/EQE(0 V) ratio above 1 suggests that the cell has a poor minority-carrier collection, particularly deep in the absorber layer. By contrast, an equivalent value, i.e., a ratio of 1, implies good charge collection.40 A better absorber quality was clearly observed in the EQE bias-ratio plot of the ZM hybrid ink-based cell as the ratio remained close to the equivalent value without deviation (Fig. 5c). However, the bias ratio of ZS-based solar cells significantly increased above unity at long wavelengths, implying incomplete carrier collection. This ineffective collection behavior has been previously observed for CZTS cells and CIGSSe devices with large band gap energy. This poor carrier collection efficiency is ascribed to a short carrier lifetime, which results from a high defect density in an absorber layer and higher recombination loss at a back contact or at a front interface.39–43

In order to ascertain the cause of a low carrier lifetime which limits VOC, the temperature-dependent transport characteristics were also investigated. It was observed that the efficiencies of the ZM hybrid- and ZS hybrid ink-derived CZTS gradually decreased from 300 to 113 K, concurrent with a linear increase in VOC (Fig. 6a and b). The relationship between VOC and temperature is generally given as follows:  where EA, A, JOO, and JL are the activation energy of the dominant recombination mechanism, the diode ideality factor, the reverse saturation current pre-factor, and the photocurrent, respectively.40 In well-behaved solar cells, the activation energy should be equal to the band gap of the absorber layer, indicating that the main recombination mechanism arises in the space charge region (SCR) of the absorber layer.40–43 If the value of activation energy is low compared to that of the band gap, recombination for the CZTS devices could occur at the CdS/CZTS interface, a defect in the interface or a cliff-type band alignment, where the conduction band edge of the absorber layer is higher than that of the buffer layer. To provide a better explanation for the recombination mechanism difference associated with ZM hybrid- and ZS hybrid-ink derived CZTS devices, energy level diagrams are illustrated in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The activation energy, EA = qVOC (∼ 1.41 eV), extracted from the extrapolation of VOC to T = 0 K, was similar to the band gap value (Eg = 1.46 eV) obtained from the EQE data for ZM hybrid ink-derived cells. However, lower activation energy (∼1.32 eV) compared with Eg (1.52 eV) was observed for the ZS hybrid ink-derived device. This fact suggests that the main recombination mechanism is dominated by an interface recombination for ZS hybrid ink-derived CZTS cells, which acts as a limiting factor for VOC. The general interface recombination for the CZTS solar cell occurs at the interface of CdS/CZTS or at the MoS2 layer of the CZTS/Mo interface.10,39 Therefore, this lower activation energy is indicative of an additional interface recombination mechanism, which might relate to a thick MoS2 layer and a ZnS impurity phase in the ZS hybrid ink-derived CZTS cell, as confirmed by XRD, Raman, and compositional analyses. ZnS phases remained as residue after sulfurization, which could act as a blocking layer and disturb carrier collection that formed at the near bottom of the absorber layer. Below 213 K, as shown in Fig. 6b–d, the fill factor and the short-circuit current dropped dramatically, while the series resistance (RS) increased greatly. This behavior resulted in an efficiency collapse as the temperature approached zero. RS of the ZS hybrid ink-derived CZTS cell increased by as much as ∼28 times from 300 to 113 K, compared with only ∼12 times for the ZM hybrid ink-derived CZTS cell. One plausible reason for this diverging series resistance at low temperatures is the formation of a blocking back contact in the form of a thick MoS2 layer (Fig. 4d) at the interface between the Mo and CZTS. This development might suppress the majority carrier (hole) transport. The presence of the high band gap ZnS in the ZS hybrid ink-derived cell is also implicated because the ZnS phase suppresses carrier transport behavior.39–43

Device parameters were extracted from the J–V measurement at 113–300 K under AM 1.5 illumination: (a) open circuit voltage (VOC), showing extrapolation of the linear region to determine the activation energy for recombination (EA), (b) efficiency and fill factor, (c) short circuit current, and (d) series resistance (RS). RS was estimated from the dark J–V curves using the following equation: dV/dJ = RS + AkBT/q(J − V/Rsh), where RS, Rsh, A, T, q and kB are the series resistance, shunt resistance, the diode ideality factor, temperature, electron charge, and Boltzmann constant, respectively. 
3. Conclusions
We developed a non-toxic solvent-based hybrid-ink approach that precludes the use of toxic solvents and a harmful selenization process for the production of 8.17% efficient CZTS solar cells. This readily achievable hybrid ink can be produced without the involvement of a complex particle synthesis. It enables a convenient methodology to be applied in the process of fabricating a high-quality CZTS absorber layer. We also investigated the influence of a solid-state Zn precursor incorporated with soluble Cu–Sn–S precursors on both the phase formation and the device performance. It was revealed that well-dispersed metallic Zn nanoparticles undergo melting at ∼320 °C, facilitating the formation of a dense, phase-pure kesterite CZTS film above 400 °C. By contrast, the ZnS particles that remained in the solid state, even at elevated temperatures below 550 °C, retarded the CZTS phase transformation, resulting in secondary phase-involved CZTS absorber layers. Distinct phase and microstructural evolutions that depended on the type of Zn solid component enabled their influence on device performance to be understood. The presence of the ZnS secondary phase plays a critical role in reducing the carrier lifetime, as well as lowering the VOC, both of which impair the device performance as compared with that of a ZM hybrid ink-derived cell.
4. Experimental
In a 50 mL glass vial, 1.428 M of copper(II) chloride anhydrous (CuCl2, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.995%), 0.8 M of tin(II) chloride dihydrate (SnCl2·2H2O, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.995%), and 4.8 M of thiourea (SC(NH2)2, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.0%) were dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol (C3H8O2, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%). The resulting opaque solution was stirred for 30 min at room temperature to prepare a transparent yellow Cu–Sn–S precursor solution. This solution was stable for at least several months. Either 0.88 M of zinc particles (average particle size ∼70 nm, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) or zinc sulfide particles (average particle size ∼80 nm, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) was mixed into the Cu–Sn–S solution with 3 wt% of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, MW ∼ 10000), followed by a planetary milling for 3 h to obtain two different CZTS hybrid inks. We accomplished an improvement in the dispersion property of either Zn or ZnS particles in the ink, as the agglomerate particles were separated by the physical impact when the balls rotated along the direction of the cylindrical vessel. Both the formulated inks retained a composition that was poor in Cu and rich in Zn (i.e., Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.85 and Zn/Sn = 1.1). The hybrid inks were coated on Mo-deposited soda lime glass substrates using a spin-coating method. Three consecutive coatings at 7000 rpm for 25 s were employed to achieve a film thickness of approximately 1.3 μm. The precursor film was pre-annealed at 250 °C under a reductive atmosphere consisting of H2 (5%) + Ar. To fabricate the highly efficient CZTS solar cells, the absorber layers were annealed at 550 °C under H2S (5%) + Ar with a controlled growth strategy to achieve highly dense and pinhole-free layers and large grains. To investigate the CZTS phase formation pathway that depended upon the precursor type in the hybrid inks, the films were sulfurized at temperatures ranging from 250 °C to 550 °C. The annealing process consisted of treatment under an inert atmosphere during the rampup, followed by sulfurization for 30 min under H2S (5%) + Ar at the final temperatures.
The annealed CZTS films were processed into photovoltaic devices following standard procedures with the structure of ITO/i-ZnO/CZTS/Mo/SLG. The transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer was deposited using sputtering. The CdS layer improving the lattice matching between the absorber and n-doped layers was deposited by a chemical bath deposition process with a thickness of 60 nm. 50 nm-thick i-ZnO and 200 nm-thick ITO transparent conductor layers were sputtered on top of the CdS layer. The thermal behavior of the precursor inks under an argon atmosphere was examined using thermo-gravimetry coupled with differential scanning calorimetry under an argon atmosphere (SDT Q600, TA Instruments). The microstructure of the sulfurized films was observed using a field effect scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM-6701F, ZEOL). The phase and crystal structures of the CZTS films were confirmed using X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/Max-2500H, Rigaku) and Raman spectroscopy (Lab Ram ARAMIS, Horriba Jovin Yvon) that used excitation wavelengths of 514 nm and 325 nm. The chemical compositions of the final CZTS films were measured using a FESEM equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, JSM-6701F, JEOL). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the CZTS-based cells were analyzed using a solar simulator (Oriel Sol3A Class AAA, Newport Corporation). An incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement unit (QEX 10, PV Measurements, Inc.) measured the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and the absorption behavior. For the low-temperature study, the cells were placed in a Linkam LTS420E temperature stage controlled by the T95-HS LinkPad (Linkam Scientific Instruments Ltd) to measure the J–V curve at temperatures ranging from 113 to 300 K.
