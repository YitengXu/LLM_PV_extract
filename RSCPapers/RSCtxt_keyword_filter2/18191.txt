    , Accepted 30th July 2014First published on 30th July 2014AbstractCrystal facets exposed on TiO2 nanoparticles strongly affect dye molecule adsorption and cell performance in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In this study, size- and morphology-controllable {010}-faceted anatase-type TiO2 nanocrystals, including rhombic, tetragonal, and leaflike nanocrystals and platelike mesocrystals, were synthesized via hydrothermal treatment of layered titanate (HTO) nanosheet colloidal solutions. The formation reactions and nanostructures of the anatase nanocrystals were investigated using XRD, FE-SEM, and TEM. There are two kinds of reactions in the formation process of the anatase nanocrystals from the HTO nanosheets. One is an in situ topotactic structural transformation reaction and another is a dissolution–deposition reaction. The DSSC performance of the {010}-faceted anatase nanocrystals was investigated by measurements of I–V characteristics, electrochemical impedance spectra, and dye adsorptions and compared with [111]-faceted P25 nanocrystals and spherical ST20 nanocrystals without a specific facet on the surface. The DSSC results suggested that the Jsc and η values increase in the order of spherical nanocrystals without a specific facet < [111]-faceted nanocrystals < {010}-faceted nanocrystals, which concludes that the facet on the nanoparticle surface significantly impacts on the DSSC performance and the {010}-faceted nanocrystals are promising for the high-performance DSSCs.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on a mesoporous nanocrystalline TiO2 film have attracted considerable attention due to their potentially low cost and relatively high energy conversion efficiency, safety, and non-pollution.1–3 Common DSSCs consist of three main parts, including a sensitized TiO2 or ZnO photoelectrode, a Pt counter electrode, and a redox electrolyte.4,5 The TiO2 photoelectrode is the most important part that strongly affects the DSSC performance. The TiO2 photoelectrode is fabricated using a conducting glass plate coating with a mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle film and by adsorption of sensitizer dye molecules on the nanoparticle surfaces. Therefore, a lot of effort has been made on the synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles to develop the high-performance TiO2 photoelectrodes.6–10 It is commonly considered that anatase-type TiO2 nanoparticles with a small particle size of about 20 nm and high crystallinity exhibit high performance.11 Usually spherical nanocrystals are used to fabricate the TiO2 photoelectrode, while addition of fibrous and rod-like particles into the spherical particles can increase the conductivity of the TiO2 film, which improves cell performance.12–14 Since dye adsorption reaction occurs on crystal surfaces, it is easy to understand that the adsorption reaction would be strongly dependent on the crystal facet on the particle surface. However, to study the effect of the crystal facet on the DSSC performance, it is necessary to prepare the TiO2 nanoparticles preferentially exposing a specific crystal facet on the surface, but it is not easy.
Wen et al. have reported for the first time a pioneering study on the hydrothermal soft chemical synthesis of anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with a specific crystal facet on the surface and found that {010}-faceted anatase TiO2 nanocrystals exhibit higher photocatalytic activity than the normal spherical nanocrystals without a specific facet on the surface.15,16 The results spur researchers to study the synthesis of TiO2 nanocrystals with a specific crystal facet and also the surface energy and photocatalytic activity of the crystal facets.17–23 Wu et al. have reported syntheses of {001}- and {010}-faceted anatase nanocrystals and their photocatalytic performance in degradation of methyl orange and found that the {010}-faceted nanocrystals exhibit higher photocatalytic activity than the {001}-faceted nanocrystals and the commercial P25 sample.24 Han et al. have reported that the {001}-faceted anatase nanosheets exhibit higher photocatalytic activity than the P25 sample.25 The Wulff construction and theoretically calculated surface energy predicts that the surface energy of anatase increases in the order of {101} facet (0.44 J m−2) < {010} facet (0.53 J m−2) < {001} facet (0.90 J m−2) < {111} facet (1.61 J m−2).26,27 The higher photocatalytic activity of the {010} facet than that of the {001} facet and {101} facet is due to the superior electronic band structure of the {010} facet for the photocatalytic reactions.28
However, up to now, most studies on the TiO2 facets have focused on their synthesis, surface energy, and photocatalytic activity. Recently, Wen et al. have reported studies on the effects of the crystal facet on the DSSC performance and sensitizer dye adsorption behavior for the first time.29,30 The results suggested that the dye adsorption behavior is strongly affected by the crystal surface properties of the TiO2 nanocrystals and the dye molecules are strongly adsorbed on the {010} facet which results in enhancement of short-circuit current density. After that, other studies have also confirmed that the crystal facets on the surfaces affect the DSSC performance.7,28 Very recently, it has been reported that {001}-faceted anatase TiO2 nanocrystals exhibit a high performance for DSSCs due to the enhancement in light-scattering effect and suppressed electron recombination,31 and also the strong adsorption of dye molecules on the {001} facet facilitates the electron transport from dye molecules to the conduction band of TiO2.32,33 Unfortunately, only a limited number of studies have been reported on the facet effect on the DSSC performance, maybe because the synthesis processes are difficult to provide enough amounts of nanocrystals with the specific facet for the DSSC characterization and/or the nanocrystal sizes are too large for high-performance DSSCs.
In the present study, we describe the synthesis of morphology-controllable {010}-faceted anatase TiO2 nanocrystals from exfoliated layered titanate nanosheets with a lepidocrocite-like structure. Regular rhombic, tetragonal, and leaflike anatase nanocrystals and platelike anatase mesocrystals constructed from oriented anatase nanocrystals can be achieved using this process. In this process, n-propylamine (PA) is chosen as the exfoliating agent because it is much cheaper than other exfoliating agents, such as tetrabutylammonium hydroxide and tetramethylammonium hydroxide; therefore, the mass production of the TiO2 nanoparticles is possible using PA exfoliating agents. The formation reaction mechanism of the anatase nanocrystals and mesocrystals is also investigated by a nanostructural analysis. The reaction mechanism is significant to understand the phase conversion and particle morphology evolution in the formation process of the {010}-faceted TiO2 nanoparticles from layered titanate nanosheets, which would give a guide for controlling particle morphology of the TiO2 nanoparticles with a specific facet on the surface. Furthermore, we characterized the DSSC performance of the {010}-faceted anatase nanocrystals in detail and compared their performance with that of commercial P25 nanocrystals containing [111]-faceted (facet vertical to [111] direction) anatase nanocrystals and spherical anatase nanocrystals without a specific facet on the surface. The {010}-faceted anatase nanocrystals exhibit the highest short-circuit current density that results in the highest energy conversion efficiency. The results reveal the significant effect of the crystal facet on the DSSC performance.
Experimental section
Preparation of layered titanate nanosheet colloidal solutions
The layered titanate nanosheet colloidal solutions were prepared from layered titanate K0.8Ti1.73Li0.27O4 (KTLO). A mixture of 5.1 g of KOH, 0.6 g of LiOH·H2O, 6.9 g of TiO2 (anatase form) and 25 mL of distilled water was sealed in a Hastelloy-C-lined vessel with an internal volume of 45 mL and then heated at 250 °C for 24 h under stirring conditions. The hydrothermally treated samples were washed with distilled water up to neutral and dried at room temperature to obtain the layered titanate KTLO as the precursor. The KTLO sample (10 g) was acid treated with a 0.2 M HNO3 solution (1 L) for 24 h under stirring conditions to exchange K+ ions and Li+ ions with H+ ions to obtain a H+-form layered titanate H1.07Ti1.73O4 (HTO). The acid treatment was repeated twice to complete the ion-exchange reaction. The HTO layered titanate was washed with distilled water several times and dried using a freeze drier. The layered titanate nanosheet colloidal solution was prepared by treating the HTO sample (10 g) in 0.1 M PA (1 L) solution under stirring conditions at room temperature for 24 h, and the nanosheet colloidal solution was named PA–HTO.
Preparation of TiO2 nanoparticles from PA–HTO solution
TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared by hydrothermal treatment of the PA–HTO nanosheet colloidal solution after adjusting to a desired pH value with a 3 M HCl solution in a pH range below 11.7 and a 1 M KOH solution in a pH range above about 11.7. The 40 mL pH-adjusted PA–HTO solution was sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel with an internal volume of 80 mL and then hydrothermally reacted at a desired temperature for 24 h. After the hydrothermal treatment, the samples were washed with distilled water several times and finally dried using a freeze drier. The obtained TiO2 sample was named as PA–X–Y, where X and Y were the temperature of the hydrothermal treatment and the pH value of the nanosheet solution used for the hydrothermal treatment, respectively.
Preparation of TiO2 nanoparticle paste
A TiO2 nanoparticle paste was prepared by mixing 0.5 g of the TiO2 nanoparticle sample, 2.5 g of ethanol, 2.0 g of α-terpineol, 1.4 g of 10 wt% solution of ethyl cellulose 10 (8–14 mPas), and 1.1 g of 10 wt% solution of ethyl cellulose 45 (45–65 mPas). The mixture was dispersed by ultrasonication for 30 min and then ball milling for 72 h. After ball milling, the ethanol was removed from the mixture using a rotary evaporator. The obtained pastes contain 18 wt% TiO2 nanoparticles, 9 wt% ethyl cellulose and 73 wt% α-terpineol. P25 and ST20 nanocrystal pastes were also prepared using a similar method. The P25 nanocrystal sample was purchased from Degussa. The ST20 nanocrystal sample was prepared by hydrothermal treatment of the ST01 (anatase phase with particle size of about 7 nm) sample purchased from Ishihara Sangyo at 200 °C and 12 h.
Preparation of TiO2 photoelectrodes
The TiO2 nanoparticle paste was applied repetitively to the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass plate as follows. The FTO glass plate was cleaned in distilled water and acetone by ultrasonication for 10 min. Then the FTO glass plate was dipped in 0.1 M titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) solution for 1 min and washed with distilled water and ethanol, dried at room temperature and calcined at 480 °C for 1 h to coat the FTO glass surface with a dense TiO2 thin film. The TiO2 paste was coated (10 × 10 mm) on the TTIP-treated FTO glass plates using a screen printing technique, and the plates were kept in an ethanol box until the TiO2 film surface became smooth and then dried at 120 °C for 10 min. This process was repeated to obtain the desired thickness of TiO2 film. After the TiO2 paste coating, the TiO2 film was calcined at 450 °C for 30 min to obtain a TiO2 porous electrode. The TiO2 porous electrodes were dipped in the 0.1 M TTIP solution for 1 min and washed with distilled water and ethanol, dried at room temperature and calcined at 480 °C for 1 h again. After cooling to 80 °C, the TiO2 porous electrodes were soaked in a 3 × 10−4 M N719 dye (di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2'-bipyridyl-4,4'-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)) solution for 24 h at room temperature and then washed with a t-butyl alcohol and acetonitrile (50%:50% v/v) mixed solvent.
Adsorption of N719 dye on TiO2 nanocrystals
Adsorption experiment of dye was carried out by a batch method. A TiO2 nanocrystal sample (10 mg) was added into an ethanol solution (5 mL) of the desired concentration of N719 dye and stirred at room temperature for 72 h. After the adsorption, the liquid phase was separated from the solid phase by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 min, and then the concentration of the remaining N719 dye in the liquid phase was analyzed using a SHIMADZU UV-2450 spectrophotometer. The amount of the N719 dye adsorbed was determined from the change in dye concentration in ethanol solution before and after the absorption. The TiO2 nanocrystal samples were calcined at 450 °C for 30 min before the adsorption experiment.
Fabrication and characterization of dye-sensitized solar cells
The DSSCs were composed of a dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode as an anode, a Pt-coated FTO glass as a cathode, and an electrolyte solution between the anode and the cathode. The electrolyte solution contains 0.1 M LiI, 0.01 M I2, 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.4 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate (GT) in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85%:15% v/v).
The photocurrent−voltage characteristic curves for the DSSCs were measured using a Hokuto-Denko BAS100B electrochemical analyzer under irradiation with simulated sunlight of AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) using a sunlight simulator (YSS-E40, Yamashita Denso). A light-passing mask was fixed on the surface of the FTO glass of the anode to set the effectively irradiating area on the cell as 0.25 cm2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analyses (EIS) were performed with an impedance analyzer (Solartron SI 1260) in the dark in a two-electrode configuration. The impedance spectra were recorded in a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz with an alternating current (AC) amplitude of 10 mV at an applied direct current (DC) bias of −0.7 V.
Physical analysis
The crystal structure of the sample was investigated using a powder X-ray diffractometer (Shimadzu, Model XRD-6100) with Cu Kα (λ = 0.15418 nm) radiation. The size and morphology of the samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (Hitachi, Model S-900). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) were performed using a JEOL Model JEM-3010 system at 300 kV. Nitrogen gas adsorption was carried out on a QUANTACHROME AUTOSORB-1-MP apparatus. The specific surface area of the TiO2 nanoparticles was calculated from the adsorption data using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method (Autosorb-1).
Results and discussion
Synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles from PA–HTO nanosheet solution
The PA–HTO nanosheet colloidal solutions with different pH values were hydrothermally treated at various temperatures to synthesize TiO2 nanoparticles. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the PA–HTO nanosheet sample and the products obtained at 120 °C. PA–HTO has a lepidocrocite-like layered structure with a strong (020) peak at d = 1.07 nm. It indicates that the layered structure has a basal spacing of 1.07 nm, which is larger than the value of 0.92 nm for H1.07Ti1.73O4 (HTO).16 This suggests that CH3(CH2)2NH2 (PA) molecules are intercalated into the interlayer of HTO and form PA–H+ with H+ in the interlayer. The intercalation of PA causes the swelling of the basal spacing of HTO layered titanate and finally exfoliation reaction of the HTO layered structure into its structural elementary layers, PA–HTO nanosheets. A single phase of the rutile type of TiO2 (JCPDS file no. 21-1276, tetragonal system, a = b = 0.459 nm, c = 0.296 nm) was formed at pH 0.5, and a single phase of the anatase type of TiO2 (JCPDS file no. 21-1272, tetragonal system, a = b = 0.380 nm, c = 0.951 nm) was formed at pH 3.0. A mixture of the PA–HTO phase and anatase phase was formed at pH 11.5, which means that PA–HTO nanosheets are partially changed to anatase TiO2. The PA-120-13.5 sample has a layered structure which corresponds to the K0.8Ti1.73Li0.27O4 (KTLO) structure (JCPDS file no. 25-1353, orthorhombic system, a = 0.382 nm, b = 1.559 nm, c = 0.298 nm) with a basal spacing of 0.87 nm. It can be explained by a restacking reaction of HTO nanosheets in the KOH solution. The restacking reaction accompanies an ion-exchange reaction of K+ and PA–H+ in the PA–HTO interlayer.

The PA–HTO nanosheet colloidal solutions were also hydrothermally treated at other temperatures, and the XRD patterns of products obtained under different conditions are shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† The dependence of the products on the reaction temperature and the pH value is summarized in Fig. 2. The products are strongly dependent on the pH value of the PA–HTO nanosheet solution. In a range of pH <1, the PA–HTO nanosheets are transformed to the rutile phase. In a range of 1 < pH < 13, the anatase phase is formed, where the temperature of formation of the anatase phase increases with the increase in the pH value. The HTO layered phase is stable in a range of pH >13, where K–HTO is formed.

Fig. 3 shows the FE-SEM images of the products obtained by the hydrothermal reaction of PA–HTO solutions. The PA-100-3.0 sample (Fig. 3a) exhibits a platelike particle morphology with small amounts of nanoparticles on the surface. This sample has a mixed phase of PA–HTO and anatase (Fig. 2). The small nanoparticles correspond to the anatase phase, and the platelike particles may correspond to the mixture of the PA–HTO nanosheet and anatase phases. Because the thickness of about 50 nm of the platelike particles is much larger than that of the PA–HTO nanosheet (about 1 nm), a restacking reaction of the PA–HTO nanosheets occurs under hydrothermal conditions. The nanosheetlike particles and leaflike nanoparticles were observed in PA-100-11.5. The PA–HTO nanosheets are partially transformed to leaflike anatase nanoparticles.

In PA-135-2.5, the platelike particles of the anatase phase were formed and the platelike particles were constructed from small nanoparticles with a size of about 20 nm. In PA-135-3.5, the regular rhombic (70%) and tetragonal (30%) nanoparticles of the anatase phase with a size of about 20 nm were formed. In PA-135-4.5, the rhombic and tetragonal anatase nanoparticles with a size of about 30 nm were also formed, but the content of the tetragonal nanoparticles increased to about 70% and the content of rhombic nanoparticles reduced to about 30%. In PA-135-9.5, the regular tetragonal anatase nanoparticles with a size of about 60 nm were formed. These results reveal that in the pH range of 3.5 to 9.5 the percentage of the tetragonal nanocrystal and its crystal size increase with the increase in the pH value. In PA-135-11.5, leaflike anatase nanoparticles with a size of about 300 nm in length and 30 nm in width were obtained. In PA-135-13.5, sheetlike particles with a size of about 1 μm in width and 50 nm in thickness were obtained. The sheetlike particles were formed by restacking HTO nanosheets in the KOH solution and kept the lepidocrocite-like layered structure after the hydrothermal reaction (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†).
In PA-155-3.5, the rhombic and tetragonal nanoparticles of the anatase phase were formed, but the particle sizes were larger than that in PA-135-3.5, suggesting that the crystal growth occurs under high temperature conditions. The FE-SEM results reveal that anatase nanocrystals can be prepared by hydrothermal treatment of HTO nanosheet solution, and the crystal size and morphology of anatase nanocrystals can be controlled by reaction temperature and the pH value of the solution.
TEM study on PA–HTO nanosheets and TiO2 nanocrystals
The nanostructures of the hydrothermal reaction products were investigated using TEM and SAED. Fig. 4 shows the TEM images and SAED patterns of PA–HTO nanosheets and hydrothermally treated samples. The PA–HTO nanosheet has a nanosheetlike particle morphology and shows a single-crystal SAED pattern, where the b-axis is vertical to the basal plane of the nanosheet. The PA-120-11.5 sample consists of a mixture of anatase and PA–HTO (Fig. 1(d)). It has a nanosheetlike particle morphology and shows simultaneously two sets of the SAED spot patterns corresponding to the anatase phase with diffractions of the (101) plane (d = 0.38 nm) and (200) plane (d = 0.185 nm) and the HTO phase with diffractions of the (400) plane (d = 0.088 nm) and (004) plane (d = 0.073) in one nanosheetlike particle. This result suggests that the HTO nanosheet is partially transformed to the anatase phase, namely, the HTO and anatase phases coexist in one nanosheetlike particle, which reveals that the HTO structure is transformed to the anatase structure by a topotactic mechanism under hydrothermal reaction conditions. There is a crystallographic relationship between the HTO structure and the anatase structure in the topotactic structural transformation reaction. The [010] direction of anatase phase corresponds to the [010] direction of the HTO phase that is vertical to the basal plane of the nanosheet, and the a- and c-axis orientations of the HTO structure are transformed to the a- and c-axis orientations of the anatase structure by rotating an angle of 60° on the (010) plane. The result reveals that {010}-faceted nanosheetlike anatase particles can be formed from the PA–HTO nanosheets by the hydrothermal reaction.
 Fig. 4  TEM images and SAED patterns of (a, b) HTO, (c, d) PA-120-11.5, (e) PA-135-2.5, (f) PA-135-3.5, (g) PA-135-9.5, and (h) PA-135-11.5 samples. 
Although the platelike particles of the PA-135-2.5 sample were constructed from anatase nanocrystals with a size of about 20 nm, it shows a SAED pattern similar to the single crystal of anatase (Fig. 4(e)), suggesting that almost all the anatase nanocrystals in one platelike particle align in the same crystal-axis orientation directions, namely, the platelike anatase particles are a mesocrystal.34 Furthermore, the platelike anatase mesocrystal shows a [010]-axis orientation, and the basal plane of the platelike particle corresponds to the (010) facet that is vertical to the [010] orientation. The orientation of the platelike mesocrystals corresponds to the orientation of the nanosheetlike anatase particles, revealing that the platelike anatase mesocrystals are also formed by the topotactic structural transformation mechanism. Since the thickness of about 50 nm of the mesocrystals is much larger than the that of the HTO nanosheet (about 1 nm), a restacking reaction of HTO nanosheets occurs in the low pH (<2.5) range, which accompanies an ion exchange of H+ with PA–H+ in the PA–HTO interlayer.
The lattice images of the rhombic, tetragonal, and leaflike anatase nanocrystals synthesized in the pH range of 3.5–11.5 are clearly observed (Fig. 4(f)–(h)), indicating that these nanoparticles are single nanocrystals with high crystallinity. About 90% of these anatase nanocrystals present the {010} facet on their basal plane. In the HR-TEM image of the rhombic nanocrystal, the lattice fringes of (101) (d = 0.352 nm) and (004) (d = 0.231) are observed, where two sides of the rhombic nanocrystal are parallel to the (101) facet, the other two sides are parallel to the (−101) facet, and the two corners are 68° and 112°. The lattice fringes of (101) (d = 0.352 nm) are observed in the HR-TEM image of the tetragonal nanocrystal, and diffraction spots of (101), (200), and (004) planes are observed in its SAED pattern. The result reveals that two sides of the tetragonal nanocrystal are parallel to the (101) facet and the other two sides are parallel to the facet vertical to the (101) facet. The lattice fringes of (−101) and (101) are observed in the HR-TEM image of the leaflike anatase nanocrystal. The axis direction of the leaflike nanocrystal corresponds to the c-axis of the anatase structure.
Transformation reaction mechanism from PA–HTO nanosheets to TiO2 nanocrystals
On the basis of the above results, we propose a reaction model for the formation of anatase nanocrystals from PA–HTO nanosheets in the hydrothermal reaction process, as shown in Fig. 5. In the pH range of 1 < pH < 3, PA–H+ ions adsorbed on the HTO nanosheet surface are ion exchanged with H+ ions in the acidic solution, and then the restacking reaction of the HTO nanosheets occurs, which causes formation of platelike HTO particles. Under hydrothermal conditions, the platelike HTO particles are transformed to platelike anatase particles by an in situ topotactic structural transformation reaction, which retains the platelike particle morphology. In the topotactic structural transformation reaction, the TiO6 octahedra in the HTO structure shift from the positions of the lepidocrocite-like layered structure to the positions of the anatase structure. There is a crystallographic relationship between the structure of the precursor and the structure of the product in the topotactic structural transformation reaction.35–37 In the present case, the [010] direction of the lepidocrocite-like layered structure corresponds to the [010] direction of the anatase phase, and the a- and c-axes of the layered structure transform to a- and c-axes of the anatase structure by rotating an angle of 60° on the (010) plane, as shown in Fig. 4(d). Therefore, {010}-faceted platelike anatase particles are formed by this reaction. Cracks are formed in the platelike anatase particles and split the platelike anatase particles into small anatase nanoparticles by dissolution–deposition reaction similar to normal hydrothermal reaction, but it retains the platelike particle morphology and the {010}-faceted orientation, resulting in the formation of {010}-faceted anatase mesocrystal (Fig. 4(e)).
 Fig. 5  Transformation reaction mechanism from PA–HTO nanosheets to TiO2 nanocrystals. 
In the pH range of 3 < pH < 13, firstly the PA–HTO nanosheets are transformed to the anatase phase by a similar topotactic structural transformation reaction to that described above, resulting in the formation of nanosheetlike anatase particles with the (010) facet on the nanosheetlike particle surface, and then the nanosheetlike anatase particles are split into rhombic, tetragonal, and leaflike nanocrystals by formation of cracks on the nanosheetlike particles owing to the dissolution–deposition reaction under hydrothermal conditions. At around pH 3.5, the cracks are formed mainly along the (101) and (−101) planes, and therefore, the main product is the rhombic nanocrystals with two sides parallel to the (101) facet and the other two sides parallel to the (−101) facet; therefore, two corners of 68° and 112° are formed. The angles of 68° and 112° are consistent with the angles between the (101) and (−101) planes (Fig. 4(f)). The crack formation along the (−101) plane decreases and that along the plane vertical to the (101) facet increases with the increase in the pH value in the pH range of 3.5–9.5. Therefore, the percentage of rhombic nanocrystals decreases and that of tetragonal nanocrystals increases in the products. The two sides of tetragonal nanocrystals are consistent with the (101) facet; the other two sides are consistent with the facet vertical to the (101) facet. In the range of 10 < pH < 13, cracks are formed mainly along the (100) and (001) planes, which split the nanosheetlike anatase particles to rodlike anatase nanocrystals with the axis of the rodlike crystal directing to the c-axis of the anatase structure. Then, the leaflike anatase nanocrystals are formed by dissolution of the edges of the rodlike nanocrystals.
The above results reveal that two types of reactions can occur simultaneously in the formation reaction processes of the anatase nanocrystals from PA–HTO nanosheets.16,35–37 One is the in situ topotactic transformation reaction, in which the structure of PA–HTO nanosheets is transformed to the anatase structure, and this reaction retains the morphology of the precursor after the reaction. Another is the dissolution–deposition reaction on the surface of the PA–HTO nanosheets, which is similar to the normal hydrothermal reaction, and the nanocrystal morphology and size can be changed by this reaction. In the PA–HTO nanosheet hydrothermal reaction system, the rutile phase is also formed in the pH range below 1. The rutile phase shows an irregular particle morphology without correlation with that of the PA–HTO nanosheet precursor (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). This result suggests that the rutile phase is formed by the dissolution–deposition reaction mechanism similar to the normal hydrothermal reaction but not by topotactic transformation reaction. It has been reported that the rutile phase is preferentially formed in acidic solution under hydrothermal conditions.38–40
DSSC performance of (010)-faceted TiO2 nanoparticles
We used five kinds of anatase nanocrystal samples, PA-135-3.5, PA-135-4.5, PA-135-6.5, PA-135-9.5, and PA-135-11.5, for the DSSC study. These samples have a {010} facet on the basal plane of the nanocrystals, but their crystal morphologies and particle sizes are different. Current–voltage characteristics and cell parameters for DSSCs fabricated using these anatase nanocrystal samples are shown in Fig. 6 and Table 1, respectively. For comparison, the thicknesses of the TiO2 porous films were kept almost the same at around 8 μm. The short-circuit current density (Jsc) increases in the order of PA-135-11.5 < PA-135-9.5 < PA-135-6.5 < PA-135-4.5 < PA-135-3.5, which is consistent with the decreasing order of the crystal size, while the open-circuit voltage (Voc) increases in an order consistent with the increase in the crystal size. The fill factor (ff) shows a similar trend to the Voc values. The energy conversion efficiency (η) increases in the order similar to the increasing order of the Jsc values, namely, the PA-135-3.5 sample shows the highest performance for DSSC. Because the smaller particles have larger surface area, they can absorb more dye molecules on the surface, which enhance the Jsc value.

An electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) study was carried out on the DSSCs (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†). The EIS parameters of the electron transport resistance (Rs), the charge transfer resistances related to recombination of electrons at the TiO2/electrolyte interface (Rrc) and reduction reaction of I3− at the Pt counter/electrode interface (RPt) can be evaluated from the EIS spectra, as shown in Table 1.41 The Rrc value decreases with the increase in the crystal size of TiO2 because of the increase in the surface area of the TiO2 electrode in contact with the electrolyte solution, which enhances electron recombination from the TiO2 conduction band to the I3− ions in the electrolyte solution. The electron recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface lowers the Voc value.42,43
N719 dye adsorption behavior on TiO2 nanocrystals with different facets on surfaces
To study the effect of the crystal facets on the DSSC performance, we used three kinds of TiO2 nanocrystal samples, PA-135-3.5, P25, and ST20, which have similar particle sizes of about 20 nm and different crystal facets on the nanocrystals surfaces. The PA-135-3.5 sample contains mainly rhombic nanocrystals which have two basal planes corresponding to the {010} facet and four planes corresponding to the {101} facet (Fig. 5). The PA-135-3.5 sample is used as the {010}-faceted nanocrystal sample because of its highest DSSC performance (η) in the {010}-faceted nanocrystal samples synthesized from PA–HTO nanosheets. P25 is a commercial TiO2 nanocrystal sample commonly used in DSSCs, which is a mixture of the anatase phase (80%) and the rutile phase (20%). Although P25 is commonly used in the DSSCs and photocatalytic studies, the nanostructures, especially the facet exposed on the nanocrystal surface, are still unclear yet. Therefore, a nanostructural study on P25 nanocrystals was carried out before the DSSC study.

Fig. 7 shows the FE-SEM and TEM images of P25 nanocrystals. This sample contains about 80% of nanocrystals with a size of about 20 nm and about 20% of nanocrystals with a size of about 80 nm. The nanocrystals with a size of about 20 nm are the anatase phase, while that with a size of about 80 nm are the rutile phase (Fig. 7(a)). There are two kinds of particle morphologies for the anatase nanocrystals. One is a near-spherical morphology (content of about 40%) and the other is a tetragonal morphology (content of about 40%). The near-spherical nanoparticles have no specific facet on the crystal surface, while tetragonal nanocrystals have a specific facet on the crystal surface. In the HR-TEM image of the tetragonal nanocrystal, the anatase lattice fringes of (101) and (011) (d = 0.352 nm) are observed (Fig. 7(c)). The HR-TEM image reveals that the basal plane of the tetragonal particle corresponds to a facet vertical to the [111] direction (we call it the [111] facet), and the other four planes correspond to the {101} facet as shown in Fig. 7(d). For the first time, we determine the facets on the P25 nanoparticle surfaces. The ST20 sample is the anatase phase with a spherical particle morphology without a specific facet on the surface and has a crystal size of about 20 nm (Fig. 7(b)).

We investigated N719 dye adsorption isotherms on these three kinds of TiO2 nanocrystals because the dye adsorption behavior significantly affects DSSC performance. The relationships between the concentration of the N719 dye and the dye adsorption densities are shown in Fig. 8. The adsorption isotherm data fitted with the Langmuir isotherm for these three kinds of nanoparticles, revealing Langmuir-type monomolecular layer adsorption on the TiO2 nanoparticles. The Langmuir equation can be represented as follows: Cs/Qs = 1/(Qm·Kad) + Cs/Qm(1)where Cs (mol dm−3) is the equilibrium concentration of the N719 dye in the solution, Qs (mol m−2) is the dye adsorption density, Kad (dm3 mol−1) is the adsorption constant, and Qm (mol m−2) is the maximum adsorption density. The adsorption constant and the maximum adsorption density were estimated by plotting Cs/Qs against Cs, and the results are listed in Table 2. The adsorption constant Kad increases in the order ST20 < P25 < PA-135-3.5 that corresponds to the increasing order of the binding energy of the dye molecules adsorbed on the TiO2 surfaces because Kad is a thermodynamic equilibrium constant. The maximum adsorption density Qm increases in the order ST20 < PA-135-3.5 < P25. In this study, we used 0.3 mM N719 solution in the fabrication of DSSCs; therefore, the adsorption densities Q0.3 at this concentration were estimated from the adsorption isotherms and are listed in Table 2. The dye adsorption density at 0.3 mM N719 concentration also increases in the order ST20 < PA-135-3.5 < P25. The dye adsorption results suggest that the TiO2 nanoparticles with different facets on the surface exhibit different adsorption behavior. The differences in dye adsorption can be attributed to the different kinds of lattice spaces and surface energy which have different tendencies to adsorb dye molecules.44,45

Effect of crystal facets on DSSC performance
To study the effect of the crystal facets on the DSSC performance, we used PA-135-3.5, P25, and ST20 TiO2 nanoparticle samples to fabricate DSSC cells and investigated their cell performance by I–V characteristics and EIS. Fig. 9 shows the dependence of DSSC cell parameters on the TiO2 film thickness of TiO2 electrodes. The Jsc values increase, reach the maximum values, and then decrease with the increase in the TiO2 film thickness for all the samples. PA-135-3.5, P25, and ST20 show the maximum values at around 8, 10, and 9 μm, respectively. The maximum Jsc value increases in the order ST20 (10.6 mA cm−2) < P25 (13.3 mA cm−2) < PA-135-3.5 (14.2 mA cm−2). The Voc values decrease linearly with the increase in the film thickness for all the samples, and the Voc values increase in the order PA-135-3.5 < ST20 < P25 when their thicknesses are the same. The ff values of the samples exhibit nearly the same trend that slightly decreases with the increase in the film thickness. The η values exhibit a similar behavior to the Jsc values, which increase, reach the maximum values, and then decrease with the increase in the film thickness for all the samples. The maximum η values are 5.5% at around 6 μm for PA-135-3.5, 4.9% at around 10 μm for P25, and 4.1% at around 9 μm for ST20. These results reveal that the η values are strongly dependent on the Jsc values, and PA-135-3.5 with the highest Jsc value gives the highest η value.

The above results suggest that the {010}-faceted nanoparticles (PA-135-3.5) exhibit higher DSSC performance (η) than that of the [111]-faceted nanocrystals (P25); furthermore, the spherical nanocrystals (ST20) without a specific facet on the surface exhibit the lowest DSSC performance, which suggests that the facet on the anatase nanocrystal surface affects the DSSC performance. The above results also reveal that the {010}-faceted PA-135-3.5 exhibits higher Jsc than that of [111]-faceted P25 and ST20 without a specific facet on the surface. This fact may be explained by the larger dye adsorption constant Kad on the {010} facet than that on the [111] facet and the spherical nanocrystal surface without a specific facet. The maximum Jsc increasing in the order ST20 < P25 < PA-135-3.5 corresponds to the increasing order of adsorption constant Kad, suggesting that the large Kad, namely, the strong anchoring of the dye molecule onto the TiO2 surface, can enhance Jsc. The strong anchoring can accelerate the injection rate of excited photoelectrons from the dye molecule into the TiO2 surface.30 The dye adsorption amount can also affect the DSCC performance. The increase in dye adsorption amount can enhance the light harvesting, which also enhances the Jsc.13
An EIS study was carried out on DSSCs fabricated using PA-135-3.5, ST20, and P25 with the same TiO2 film thickness (see Fig. S4 in the ESI†). Their I–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 10; the cell parameters and the EIS parameters are given in Table 3. P25 and ST20 provide almost the same Rrc value, and PA-135-3.5 provides a lower Rrc than P25 and ST20. This result is consistent with their Voc values, namely, the increase in Rrc causes a decrease in the charge recombination from the TiO2 conduction band to I3− in the electrolyte solution at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, which enhances Voc.13 It has been reported that the increase in dye adsorption density can enhance Voc values because of the reduction of charge recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface.30 In the present study, the dye adsorption density Q0.3 increasing in the order ST20 < PA-135-3.5 < P25 is a little different from the Voc increasing in the order PA-135-3.5 < ST20 < P25. This result implies that except for the dye adsorption density, other factors, such as the particle morphology, surface energy, and surface electronic band structure, may also affect the Voc.28,46 It has been reported that the surface electronic band structure of the {010} facet is suitable for the photocatalytic reaction.27 We think that the surface electronic band structure can also affect the DSSC performance.

Conclusions
The {010}-faceted anatase TiO2 nanocrystals can be synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of PA–HTO nanosheets. The particles sizes and morphologies of the TiO2 nanocrystals depend on the hydrothermal reaction temperature and the pH value of reaction solutions. There are two kinds of reactions in the formation process of the anatase nanocrystals. One is the in situ topotactic structural transformation reaction, and another is the dissolution–deposition reaction. The DSSC results for the {010}-faceted anatase nanoparticles reveal that the Jsc and η values increase with the decrease in crystal size, while the Voc and ff values increase with the increase in crystal size. Furthermore, the DSSC results for anatase nanocrystals with different facets on the surface suggest that the Jsc and η values increase in the order of spherical nanocrystals without a specific facet < [111]-faceted nanocrystals < {010}-faceted nanocrystals, which corresponds to the increasing order of the dye adsorption constants. Namely, the {010}-faceted nanocrystals with a large adsorption constant are promising for high-performance DSSCs. It means that the effect of the facet has a significant impact on DSSCs.
