The identified optimal non-stoichiometric composition Cs1.2PbI2Br1.2 delivered the best optoelectronic, structural and photovoltaic characteristics in combination with the improved stability. The elucidated remarkable effect of the Cs4PbI2Br4 impurity phase, serving as a reservoir of CsBr, on the photothermal stability and photovoltaic performance of CsPbI2Br perovskite films offers a new paradigm in the development of more efficient and stable all-inorganic perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Perovskite-type semiconductor materials based on lead complex halides with organic cations (methylammonium MA or formamidinium FA) and halogen anions have attracted much attention from both the scientific community and industry owing to their fantastic optoelectronic characteristics and impressive certified power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of >24% demonstrated for the best single-junction solar cells.1,2 However, hybrid perovskites comprising organic cations show unacceptably low intrinsic stability with respect to elevated temperatures,3,4 moisture,3,5–7 electric field and light exposure.4,8 The poor stability of hybrid perovskites leads to short operation lifetimes of photovoltaic cells and other types of electronic devices fabricated using these materials, which currently represents the main limitation for their practical implementation. Even if the problem of hydrolysis and/or photooxidation can essentially be solved using appropriate encapsulation, the intrinsic aging processes occurring in the solar cell active layer under elevated temperatures, light and electric field are very hard to prevent. Replacing fragile organic species with robust inorganic cations represents a promising approach to designing inherently more stable absorber materials. In particular, many research groups are intensively exploring all-inorganic lead-halide based perovskites CsPbI3−xBrx (x = 0–3), which show enhanced resistance towards moisture and improved thermal stability compared to the conventional hybrid perovskites.9–13 Recently the best power conversion efficiency of all-inorganic perovskite solar cells has exceeded 14%14,15 and in some cases reached 15–17%,16,17 which points to their high potential. However, despite the achieved progress, the problem of poor intrinsic stability of absorber materials and operation stability of the devices has not been solved until now. Generally, inorganic perovskites suffer from severe phase stability issues because the Cs+ ion is too small to stabilize the perovskite lattice at least when a considerable fraction of I anions is present. It is well known that the perovskite cubic phase of CsPbI3 is thermodynamically unstable at room temperature.18,19 Some stabilization of the CsPbI3 perovskite phase was recently achieved using certain additives and solvent engineering techniques for the film deposition.16,17,20
The most straightforward approach to improve the phase stability of all-inorganic lead halide perovskites is based on partial replacement of iodine in the CsPbI3 lattice with bromine. Therefore, mixed-halide CsPbI3−xBrx materials have received much attention within the last few years while addressing the phase stability problem.4,21 The systematic study performed by McGehee's group revealed that at least 30% of halogen atoms in CsPbI3 should be replaced with Br to achieve a good perovskite phase stability at room temperature.22 This report highlighted CsPbI2Br as the most promising all-inorganic perovskite absorber material due to its more suitable optoelectronic characteristics12 as compared to the bromine-enriched wide bandgap semiconductors CsPbIBr2 and CsPbBr3.23–25 Active exploration of this material in solar cells delivered decent power conversion efficiencies of ca. 10–14%.9,11,14,15,26–33
To boost the performance and improve the stability of all-inorganic perovskite solar cells different techniques were used: using certain additives and antisolvents affecting the film growth process, a partial Cs replacement with K and a partial Pb substitution with Sr.34,35 These modifications increased the stability of the cubic perovskite phase under ambient conditions (RH = 20%)14,15,29,35 and at elevated temperatures in the dark.33,35 Blending an overstoichiometric amount of CsBr with PbI2 resulted in a material with the reported composition of Cs1.3PbI2Br1.6, which also demonstrated improved ambient stability in air as compared to the stoichiometrically balanced CsPbI2Br and PbI2-enriched samples.36 It should be emphasized that intrinsic stability of the designed all-inorganic materials such as CsPbI2Br and its derivatives with respect to the stress factors relevant to the realistic solar cell operation conditions (e.g. illumination at elevated temperatures) has not been thoroughly assessed so far.
In this work, we report a systematic study of all-inorganic perovskite-inspired materials CsxPbI2Brx with x ranging from 0.95 to 4. It was shown, in particular, that the stoichiometrically balanced material CsPbI2Br is intrinsically unstable and undergoes facile disproportionation to CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 (yellow δ-phase) under elevated temperatures (55–60 °C) and/or light exposure, which makes it unfavourable with respect to practical applications. However, the non-stoichiometric composition Cs1.2PbI2Br1.2, representing the CsPbI2Br and Cs4PbI2Br4 blend, was fairly stable with respect to the elevated temperatures and illumination and showed even enhanced photovoltaic performance as compared to CsPbI2Br with the maximal solar cell efficiency exceeding 10%.
Results and discussion
The thin films of CsxPbI2Brx alloys with x ranging from 0.95 to 4 were grown by thermal co-evaporation of CsBr and PbI2 precursors in vacuum with subsequent thermal annealing at 270 °C (see details in Experimental section). The chemical composition of the CsxPbI2Brx films was confirmed by EDX analysis and also by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS data given in Table S1, ESI†). Fig. 1a shows the evolution of the absorption spectra of the prepared films as a function of their composition (x value). The increase in the amount of cesium bromide in the films resulted in the gradual bleaching of the absorption bands at 400–650 nm, which are characteristic for the cubic perovskite phase of CsPbI2Br. Meanwhile, new absorption features evolve at 380–405 nm corresponding to the mixed-halide Cs4PbX6 (X = I, Br).37 The estimated optical band gaps for thin films with the stoichiometric compositions CsPbI2Br and Cs4PbI2Br4 (X = I, Br) were within 1.86–1.91 eV and 3.05–3.26 eV ranges, respectively.

Fig. 1b summarizes the structural evolution of thin films of CsxPbI2Brx alloys with x ranging from 0.95 to 4. The XRD pattern of the CsBr-deficient (x = 0.95) film revealed clear diffraction peaks corresponding to the orthorhombic phase of CsPbI2Br.38,39 The stoichiometrically balanced CsPbI2Br films (x = 1) demonstrated the main diffraction signatures of the (100) and (200) planes in the CsPbI2Br perovskite cubic lattice at 2θ = 14.7 and 29.7 degrees (preferred orientation peaks consistent with those reported in the ref. 9), but with a small impurity of the orthorhombic CsPbI2Br phase. However, introducing even a small excess of cesium bromide (x > 1.05) eliminated completely the photochemically non-active orthorhombic phase from the material.
It should be emphasized that we did not observe crystalline phases of CsBr, CsI, PbI2 or PbBr2 in any of the prepared alloy samples. The highly crystalline cubic CsPbI2Br perovskite phase was formed in all alloys with 1.2 < x < 3 compositions as one can conclude from the appearance of distinct reflections at 2θ = 14.7, 20.9, 29.7, 33.6, and 37.8 degrees.12,27,40 The CsxPbI2Brx thin films with x ranging from 1.15 to 1.50 revealed the appearance of minor peaks at 2θ = 12.4, 23.5, 24.8° and also, probably, 33.6, and 37.8°, which can be attributed to the rhombohedral mixed-halide Cs4PbX6 (X = I, Br) phase (denoted as I-rich in Fig. 1). These peaks were previously observed in the XRD patterns of the Cs4PbX6 (X = Br, I) nanocrystals.37,41,42 Two peaks at 33.6 and 37.8° can be attributed to both the 3D (CsPbI2Br) and the 0D (Cs4PbX6) phases.42 The Cs4PbX6 impurity was formed in these alloys in the matrix of the main cubic CsPbI2Br perovskite phase, which might lead to the growth of nanocrystals with the same lattice parameters as reported previously for materials prepared using solution-based colloid methods.37,41,42
The CsxPbI2Brx alloys with x > 3 demonstrated peaks which match well the standard XRD pattern of the 0D phase of Cs4PbBr6.42 The observed minor shifts of the Cs4PbX6 diffraction peaks (denoted as Br-rich Cs4PbX6 in Fig. 1) to small angles indicates a distortion of the pristine Cs4PbBr6 lattice due to incorporation of larger iodine atoms instead of bromine.
The morphology of the CsxPbI2Brx thin films was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 2 shows that the films of stoichiometric CsPbI2Br have a homogeneous structure with an average grain size of 200 to 500 nm.
 Fig. 2  SEM images of the CsxPbI2Brx alloy thin films with different compositions. 
The increase in the amount of cesium bromide incorporated in the alloy films leads to the formation of two separate phases possessing compositions close to Cs4PbX6 (X = Br, I) (brighter regions) and CsPbI2Br (darker areas) as revealed by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. Interestingly, the films of the non-stoichiometric CsxPbI2Brx material with x = 1.2 showed improved morphology with the largest CsPbI2Br grains ranging in size from 500 nm to >1 μm. Higher loading of CsBr leads to a gradual increase in the amount of the second brighter phase and reduction of the grain size. The obtained data indicate that the morphology of the photoactive CsxPbI2Brx films can be tailored by changing the amount of CsBr incorporated in the material and the alloy with x = 1.2 seems to give the optimal characteristics in terms of the grain size and connectivity of the grains.
While investigating the stability of inorganic perovskites, much attention is paid to the effect of humidity, which can be avoided using proper device encapsulation, while the influence of other stress factors has received undeservedly less attention until now.11,26,36,37 It is known that the temperature of the operating solar panels can easily approach 90–100 °C and the active layer materials must be stable under these conditions and show no noticeable degradation.
We explored thermal stability of the CsxPbI2Brx thin films with stoichiometric (x = 1) and non-stoichiometric (x = 1.2) composition. The 120 nm thick films were deposited on glass substrates and continuously annealed at 90 °C for 500 hours in the dark under an inert atmosphere inside a nitrogen glove box (O2, H2O < 0.1 ppm). Fig. 3 shows the dynamics of the UV-Vis spectra and XRD patterns revealing that Cs1.2PbI2Br1.2 thin films are fairly stable at 90 °C.
 Fig. 3  Evolution of the absorption spectra (a and b) and XRD patterns (c and d) of thin films of the material with the stoichiometric composition CsPbI2Br (a and c) and the non-stoichiometric alloy Cs1.2PbI2Br1.2 (b and d) under thermal annealing at 90 °C in the dark. 
In contrast, CsPbI2Br films undergo a facile thermal degradation under these conditions. Thermal annealing leads to the phase separation of the stoichiometric CsPbI2Br material into Br-rich and I-rich domains as revealed by the evolution of the XRD patterns of the films.
The appearance of new peaks at 15.2° and 30.7° indicates the formation of a bromine-rich CsPbBr∼3I∼0 cubic perovskite phase. The iodine-rich cubic perovskite phase of CsPbI∼3Br∼0 is thermodynamically unstable at low temperatures (as emphasized above for CsPbI3) and undergoes transformation to the yellow δ-phase (orthorhombic or hexagonal), which has low crystallinity but still can be confidently detected in the samples at long annealing times. Thus, thermal annealing results in a continuous consumption of the CsPbI2Br perovskite phase, which disappears after 300–500 h. The halide phase separation in CsPbI2Br is completed after ∼500–1000 h and only the peaks of cubic CsPbBr3 and the yellow δ-phase of CsPbI3 can be detected.
The absorption spectra of CsPbI2Br films demonstrated a drastic change between 100 and 150 h of thermal annealing. Interestingly, XRD did not reveal such a steep transition showing the signatures of crystalline CsPbI2Br phase even after 300 h of annealing. Most probably, rapid decomposition of CsPbI2Br produces some amorphous phase (e.g. disordered mixture of cubic CsPbBr3 and the yellow δ-phase of CsPbI3), which defines the absorption profile of the film after aging, while its contribution to the XRD pattern is negligibly small. Indeed, a new band emerging at 500–530 nm is a very characteristic signature of the CsPbBr∼3I∼0 perovskite (Eg = 2.3 eV for CsPbBr312). At the same time, an intense band at 370–480 nm is formed due to the overlap of the absorption signatures of Br-rich CsPbBr∼3I∼0 perovskite and δ-phase of the I-rich CsPbI∼3Br∼0 (similar to the yellow δ-phase of CsPbI39). Thus, the optical spectroscopy data are consistent with the results of XRD analysis and evidence fast thermal decomposition of CsPbI2Br thin films.
It was reported recently that hybrid lead-based mixed halide perovskites can undergo photo-induced phase segregation into Br-rich and I-rich phases.43 We observed in this work similar heat-induced phase segregation for the all-inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite for the first time. It should be emphasized that CsPbI2Br perovskite was believed to be thermodynamically stable at room temperature and slightly elevated temperatures, which seems not to be the case according to the results obtained in this work. This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports published to date on long-term (e.g. 500–1000 h) intrinsic stability of unmodified CsPbI2Br perovskite, while the actual phase instability of this material could be overlooked in short-term studies (e.g. <100 h).
It is quite remarkable that the non-stoichiometric CsxPbI2Brx alloys with x = 1.2–1.5 do not show any signs of the thermal degradation within 1000 h as illustrated in Fig. 2 for the material with x = 1.2. Moreover, the Cs1.2PbI2Br1.2 alloy films did not show any change within 300 h of light soaking (100 mW cm−2, 70 °C, inert atmosphere), while the stoichiometric CsPbI2Br perovskite films degraded completely under the same conditions (Fig. S1, ESI†). Therefore, the presence of the Cs4PbX6 impurity phase suppressed somehow the heat- and light-induced segregation of the material into Br-rich and I-rich domains. The observed stabilization effect might be crucially important for further development of the perovskite photovoltaics, while understanding the underlying mechanisms requires additional studies.
The photovoltaic performance of the CsxPbI2Brx alloys was investigated in a planar junction n-i-p device configuration ITO/ZnO/CsxPbI2Brx/P3HT/Au (Fig. 4). Semitransparent ITO glass was solution-coated with a compact ZnO electron transport layer thus forming the electron-collecting electrode.

The CsxPbI2Brx films were grown by vacuum co-evaporation of CsBr and PbI2. A hole transport layer of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) or poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) was deposited above the photoactive layer by spin-coating and the device structure was completed by evaporation of the top gold electrodes. The detailed description of the device fabrication procedure is given in the Experimental section.

Fig. 4a and Table 1 demonstrate that overstoichiometric CsBr loading in the CsxPbI2Brx alloy films leads to a gradual improvement in their photovoltaic performance until the optimal composition is reached at x = 1.2.

It is notable that the Cs1.2PbI2Br1.2 alloy gives an increased short circuit current density and open circuit voltage compared to CsPbI2Br as it is shown in Fig. S2, ESI.† The short circuit current densities obtained in these measurements were reconfirmed by integration of the EQE spectra against the standard AM1.5G solar irradiation spectrum, as shown in Fig. 4c. Replacing P3HT with PTAA resulted in an additional minor improvement in the photovoltaic performance of the Cs1.2PbI2Br1.2 material yielding PCE values of up to 10.7% (Table 1).
The achieved decent photovoltaic performance in combination with the revealed superior thermal and photochemical stability of the Cs1.2PbI2Br1.2 alloy makes it rather promising with respect to potential practical applications. Further thorough optimization of these devices by tailoring charge-transport and electrode materials might increase their photovoltaic efficiency.
Current–voltage characteristics of the champion devices based on the CsPbI2Br and Cs1.2PbI2Br1.2 films measured in forward (F) and reverse (R) directions with the voltage sweep rate of 0.1 V s−1 shown in Fig. 4b demonstrate relatively small hysteresis. Replacing P3HT with PTAA results in hysteresis-free devices thus demonstrating the effect of the hole-transport material on the electrical characteristics of the devices.
Importantly, the devices based on the Cs1.2PbI2Br1.2 absorber exhibited a stable photocurrent near the maximum power point, which remained constant for >6000 s, while similar measurements for the stoichiometric CsPbI2Br system showed a decrease in the current by ∼5% (Fig. S3, ESI†).
The enhanced photovoltaic performance of the non-stoichiometric alloys CsxPbI2Brx with 1.0 < x ≤ 1.2 as compared to the pure CsPbI2Br perovskite might be related to the improved film morphology and crystallinity induced by the presence of the excessive amount of CsBr in the form of Cs4PbX6 phase (X = Br, and I). However, further CsBr loading (x > 1.2) leads to deterioration of all photovoltaic parameters (Fig. 4a, Table 1 and Fig. S1, ESI†) due to the increased fraction of the non-photoactive Cs4PbX6 material in the absorber films.
In order to understand better the influence of the Cs4PbX6 impurity phase on the photovoltaic performance of CsPbI2Br perovskite films we performed current mapping with an atomic force microscope integrated inside the glove box with a well-controlled inert argon environment. The current was measured under external bias (1 V) applied to the sample and additional illumination provided by a blue 405 nm laser. Additional current–voltage measurements were performed with the triangular voltage ramp from −2 V to +2 V.
It was shown that the grains corresponding to the cubic CsPbI2Br phase exhibit good conductivity, while the domains of the Cs4PbX6 (X = Br, I) phase are non-conductive or show extremely low conductivity (Fig. 5). Therefore, it is very unlikely that the Cs4PbX6 phase directly contributes to the charge transport in the film. However, Cs1.2PbI2Br1.2 alloy films demonstrate at least 4 times higher average conductivity as compared to the stoichiometric CsPbI2Br, which is evident from the Z-scale values in Fig. 5b, d, f and h and also histograms of the maximum photocurrent distribution for the corresponding films (Fig. S4, ESI†). These observations strongly suggest that introducing an overstoichiometric amount of CsBr in the Cs1.2PbI2Br1.2 films improves the electronic quality (perhaps by reducing the defect density) of the photoactive CsPbI2Br perovskite phase as compared to the samples with the stoichiometric composition.

Topography (c) and current (d) images measured under the same conditions on the CsPbI2Br sample show absence of non-conductive inclusions.

 Fig. 6  Cs1.2PbI2Br1.2 (blue) and CsPbI2Br (red) thin films are pumped at 400 nm at 285 K. Real (solid dot) and imaginary (hollow dot) parts of photoconductivity at (a) 5 ps and (b) 2 ns are obtained from the TRTS measurement. Drude–Smith fits to respective photoconductivity are plotted with solid lines. (c) Carrier density and (d) effective carrier mobility are extracted from the Drude–Smith fits. The peaks in Δσ1(ω) and Δσ2(ω) near 1.5 THz indicate the approximate energies of the phonon modes in this family of perovskites.46 
We performed time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy (TRTS) measurements to study the photogenerated free-carrier dynamics in CsPbI2Br and Cs1.2PbI2Br1.2 samples by tracking the time evolution of the photoinduced change in the complex optical conductivity (or photoconductivity) after photoexcitation.44,45 The experimental setup and the relevant data analysis were discussed in a previous paper.46 Both CsPbI2Br and Cs1.2PbI2Br1.2 samples were pumped with 400 nm laser pulses, at a fluence of 16.6 μJ cm−2 at 285 K, and probed with THz pulses at a well-defined pump–probe delay τ. The real and imaginary parts of the photoconductivity (Δ = Δσ1 + iΔσ2) at 5 ps and 2 ns are shown in Fig. 6. We see that at short time delays (e.g. 5 ps in Fig. 6a), the Cs1.2PbI2Br1.2 thin film shows a much larger photoinduced response (in the photoconductivity Δ) in comparison with the CsPbI2Br sample, while at longer time delays (e.g. 2 ns in Fig. 6b), both samples show similar photoinduced response.
In the lead halide perovskites, the complex photoconductivity can be fitted to the Drude–Smith model:46,47 Δ = (ε0ωp2)/(γ − iω)[1 + c1/(1 − iω/γ)], where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, ωp is the plasma frequency [related to carrier density n via ωp2 = (ne2)/(ε0m*) with m* being the electron–hole reduced mass48 (m* = 0.12m0) and e being the charge of carriers], c1 is the fraction of retained initial velocity of carriers after a collision and γ is the carrier scattering rate related to mobility μ = e/(m*γ). Due to the existence of backscattering,46 the free-carrier mobility is reduced by a factor (1 + c1), leading to an effective mobility μeff = (1 + c1)μ. From the least-square fits, we obtain parameters ωp2, γ and c1, hence carrier density n(τ) and effective carrier mobility μeff(τ) at various pump–probe time delay τ.

Fig. 6c shows that Cs1.2PbI2Br1.2 has a larger density of photogenerated carriers than the CsPbI2Br shortly after photoexcitation. In addition, the photon-to-charge quantum yield is ∅ = n0/nph, where n0 is the initial density of photogenerated carriers and nph is the absorbed photon density. Since the absorbance of the two samples at 400 nm is very similar (Fig. 1a), the larger carrier density in the Cs1.2PbI2Br1.2 sample also implies a higher quantum yield in this material. Moreover, Fig. 6d shows that the two samples have similar mobilities of ∼600 cm2 V−1 s−1. As the current density j is proportional to the product of carrier density and carrier mobility via j ∝ μeff × n, our extracted n(τ) and μeff(τ) at short time delays in the stabilized sample yields a larger current density, implying better photovoltaic performance.
It is not clear if the revealed superior electronic and photovoltaic properties of the Cs1.2PbI2Br1.2 alloy are directly associated with the formation of the Cs4PbX6 impurity phase, but they definitely correlate with the improved morphology and, presumably, crystallinity of the films of this material as compared to the conventional CsPbI2Br. Therefore, the presented approach of using non-stoichiometric alloy formulations might be useful in the design of novel all-inorganic and probably even hybrid materials for perovskite solar cells.
Finally, we evaluated the impact of the CsxPbI2Brx film composition on the operation stability of the solar cells. While running the aging test, the non-encapsulated devices were exposed to continuous white light illumination with the intensity of 100 mW cm−2 in an inert atmosphere (O2 and H2O content below 0.1 ppm). Fig. 7 shows that the devices comprising CsPbI2Br perovskite as active material degrade dramatically within ∼100 h.
 Fig. 7  Operation stability of the perovskite solar cells based on CsPbI2Br and Cs1.2PbI2Br1.2 absorber materials under continuous illumination (100 mW cm−2, T = 70 °C, inert atmosphere). 
In contrast, the solar cells based on the overstoichiometric Cs1.2PbI2Br1.2 alloy demonstrate much superior stability and preserve >70% of the initial efficiency after 500 h of aging. These results are fully consistent with the data presented above on the stability of thin CsxPbI2Brx films. Therefore, we can conclude that the light- and heat-induced decomposition of the active absorber material is limiting the operation stability of the photovoltaic cells.
It should be emphasized that the achieved improvement in the device stability (as illustrated by Fig. 7) is quite spectacular, thus pointing to a high potential of the alloy-type non-stoichiometric materials presented in this work.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have explored systematically all-inorganic CsxPbI2Brx systems with x ranging from ∼1 (CsPbI2Br perovskite) to 4 (non-perovskite Cs4PbI2Br4 material). The non-stoichiometric CsxPbI2Brx alloys with 1.1 < x ≤ 1.2 showed improved film morphology and superior electronic and photovoltaic properties as compared to the conventional CsPbI2Br. In particular, the best devices based on Cs1.2PbI2Br1.2 delivered PCEs of ∼10%, thus outperforming significantly the reference cells with the stoichiometric CsPbI2Br perovskite (PCE = 6.9%). Most importantly, the alloys with the overstoichiometric CsBr content showed advanced thermal and improved photochemical stabilities in both thin film samples and photovoltaic cells. In contrast, the conventional stoichiometric CsPbI2Br perovskite undergoes spontaneous transition to a non-photoactive yellow δ-phase of CsPbI3 and perovskite phase of CsPbBr3 at elevated temperatures and/or illumination. Therefore, the combination of improved photovoltaic performance and enhanced operation stability suggests the non-stoichiometric CsxPbI2Brx compositions with 1.1 < x ≤ 1.2 are highly promising materials for “perovskite-inspired” solar cells.
We strongly believe that similar alloys with superior properties can also be found for other inorganic and, probably, even hybrid complex metal halides, which opens a new dimension in the design of novel materials for emerging efficient and stable perovskite photovoltaics.
Experimental
Device fabrication and characterization
ITO glass (Kintec, 15 Ω sq−1) was cleaned sequentially with deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min. ZnO precursor solution consisting of 0.100 g zinc acetate dihydrate and 28.0 μl monoethanolamine in 1 ml of 2-methoxyethanol was stirred at room temperature overnight. The resulting solution was filtered using a 0.45 μm PTFE membrane filter prior to spin coating at 2000 rpm. The obtained ZnO films were annealed at 200 °C for 1 hour in air. Precursor cesium bromide (CsBr, 99.9% from Aldrich) and lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.9% from Aldrich) were thermally co-evaporated in a vacuum chamber integrated inside an MBraun glove box (4 × 10−6 mbar) at the balanced deposition rates of 0.5–2 Å s−1, producing CsxPbI2Brx films with x ranging from 0.95 to 4 and total thickness of 150 ± 10 nm. The thermal evaporation sources were carefully calibrated to achieve high accuracy and reproducibility in the thickness of the deposited films. Sequential layer-by-layer deposition of CsBr and PbI2 with the balanced layer thicknesses provided the required composition of the perovskite films. Composition of the films was additionally verified using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (see Table S1, ESI†). The freshly grown CsxPbI2Brx films were annealed at 270 °C for 10 min in a nitrogen atmosphere inside the glove box. A P3HT hole transport layer was deposited by spin-coating (15 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene) at 1200 rpm for 50 s. Top Au electrodes (150 nm) were thermally evaporated through a shadow mask in vacuum (5 × 10−6 mbar). The device active area was in the range of 0.3–0.4 cm2. The devices were characterized by I−V and EQE measurements as reported previously.49
Flame atomic absorption spectrometry
Cs/Pb atomic ratio in the deposited CsxPbI2Brx films was verified using flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The perovskite films were washed off from the glass substrates with 1 ml of 0.5 M KOH solution to obtain aqueous solutions. Next, the obtained solutions were quantitatively transferred with deionized water into volumetric flasks for quantitative measurements. The analysis was performed using a Zeiss AAS-3 spectrophotometer. Hollow cathode lamps for Pb and Cs were used as light sources, which operated at the current of 7 mA and wavelengths of 283.3 and 852.1 nm, respectively. Air/acetylene stoichiometric mixture was used to generate the flame. The relative standard deviations of the measurements were within 1%.
SEM and AFM microscopy and optical spectroscopy
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on a Zeiss SUPRA 25 instrument. The samples were prefixed on a microscope stage inside a glove box to reduce the exposure time in air down to ∼3–5 min.
The scanning probe microscopy measurements were conducted on a Cypher ES microscope (Asylum Research, CA) under dry inert Ar atmosphere in an MBraun glovebox with O2 < 0.1 ppm and H2O < 1 ppm. Electrical contact to the sample was provided through ITO and conductive Ag paint. Photocurrent was measured in a conductive SPM mode (c-SPM) with 1 V bias applied to the sample. Additional current–voltage measurements were performed with the triangular voltage ramp from −2 V to +2 V. A fully platinum cantilever from Rocky Mountain (25PT300B) was used. As the light source we used a Cypher Blue Drive laser diode with 405 nm wavelength. Power density was set to 122 mW cm−2.
TRTS setup and associated data analysis
A pulsed laser beam (Coherent Legend-Elite, 800 nm, 1 kHz repetition rate, pulse duration ∼35 fs) was split into three beams. One beam was used to generate a 400 nm beam through a beta-barium borate (BBO) crystal via second harmonic generation, the second one was used to generate a THz beam though a 1 mm-thick ZnTe crystal via optical rectification, and the third one was used to detect the transmitted terahertz electric field via electro-optic sampling in another ZnTe crystal. The samples were excited with 400 nm laser pulses (16.6 μJ cm−2) and probed with THz pulses at a well-defined pump–probe delay τ. The samples were deposited on z-cut quartz substrates, and bare z-cut quartz substrates were used to obtain the reference signal. Firstly, we measured transmitted THz electric field E(t,τ) and photoinduced change in THz electric field ΔE(t,τ) simultaneously, denoting Esam(t,τ) and ΔEsam(t,τ) for the sample on quartz and Eref(t,τ) and ΔEref(t,τ) for the reference. Secondly, we calculate the transmittance at every pump–probe delay τ from the transmitted THz electric field through the sample. Thirdly, we extract complex refractive indexes (ñ = n + ik) at τ from the transmittance:  where, ñsub is the refractive index of the z-cut quartz substrate, d is the film thickness, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and ΔL is the thickness difference between the sample and reference substrates.
We then calculate the complex conductivity  at τ, and the equilibrium conductivity 0 (τ < 0) through the equations , and  = 1 + i/ωε0. Finally we obtain the photoconductivity Δ = Δσ1 + iΔσ2via Δ(τ) = (τ) − 0.

The peaks in Δσ1(ω) and Δσ2(ω) near 1.5 THz indicate the approximate energies of the phonon modes in this family of perovskites.46
