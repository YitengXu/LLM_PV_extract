    , Accepted 12th September 2016First published on 13th September 2016AbstractIn the last two decades, organic photovoltaic devices, primarily bulk heterojunction solar cells, have progressed much in device performances but the requirement of a crystalline nanoscale phase separated domain has limited the modular characteristic of the approach and very specific donor:acceptor blends are preferred. Here, we show an alternative organic photovoltaic platform with dye sensitized architecture with excellent modular characteristics. Aniline in situ polymerized in the presence of different amounts (10, 12, 16, and 20 mg) of N,N-di((S)-1-carboxylphenylalanine)-3,4:9,10-perylenetetracarboxyldiimide (PPA) in citric acid medium results in composites designated as PP10, PP12, PP16 and PP20, respectively. Dye-sensitized organic solar cells fabricated with PP16 and N719 dye exhibit the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.32%. SEM study reveals dense rod-like nanosphere morphology; FTIR, UV-vis, and photoluminescence spectra suggest the presence of a π-stacking interaction between PPA and polyaniline (PANI). Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) results exhibit a maximum of 62% conversion of incident photons absorbing in the range of 360–680 nm. The lifetime of photo-injected electrons measured from impedance spectra confirms that the PP16 device has the highest lifetime (7.7 ms) accounting for the highest PCE. Comparison with the PCE of a reference device clearly indicates the influence of dopant acid of PANI and influence of interfacial interactions through a π-stacking process towards photovoltaic performance.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cell technology is the most promising alternative to inorganic material based solar cells for the development of low cost solution processed devices with the possibility of large area fabrication in conventional as well as flexible substrates.1 The commercial success of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) in digital displays demonstrates that the fabrication of efficient OPV solar cells with necessary long term stability for practical applications can be accessible. In the present scenario, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells represent the only OPV technology with sustainable potential for future development.2–4 The most prevalent BHJ solar cell is comprised of a photoactive layer containing a soluble polymer donor:fullerene acceptor blend that phase segregated into bicontinuous interpenetrating domains of nanoscale networks during processing stages. Upon light exposure, the recombination of photo-excitons occurs in the length scale of 10 nm and it implies that the phase separated network must be of the order of 10–20 nm for efficient charge separation and transport.5 The critical requirement of phase separated domains and complete absence of any control in such spontaneous nanoscale assembly renders the modulation of the OPV materials extremely difficult. This is manifested by the fact that despite fullerene derivatives having very low absorption in the visible region of the spectrum, any effort towards alternative acceptor molecules leads to a decrease in power conversion efficiency (PCE) in part due to the sub-optimum photoactive layer film morphology.6,7 A majority of non-fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells show efficiencies in the range of 1–6% (ref. 8–15) with few exceptional designs achieving the PCE around 8% (ref. 16 and 17). Moreover, the necessity of soluble photoactive materials to afford an interpenetrating network with a limiting film thickness of 100–200 nm for optimal performance impedes the exploitation of insoluble n-type semiconductor polymers such as polyaniline as acceptors.18 To remove the material and morphological constrain in the current OPV solar cell technology, a radical and fundamental improvement in a light harvesting phenomenon and device architecture is imperative.
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), introduced by Gräztel and co-workers, are a solution processed photovoltaic device consisting of ≈10 μm layer of n-type semiconducting metal oxide, mainly TiO2 nanoparticles, as an electron transport material that was sensitized by the dye molecule.19–21 The relatively high thickness of the photoactive layer and very high light absorption capability of the dyes indicate an OPV architecture adopting the dye sensitized module that would eliminate the existing shortcoming associated with present day organic solar cell devices.22
Based on this novel insight, here we have established a new approach towards the fabrication of OPV solar cells that show essential flexibility in materials design, photoactive layer thickness and morphology, light harvesting components and more significantly, it does not include the interpenetrating self-assembled network. The engineering of the device is based on our recent effort to explore and elaborate the existing OPV methodologies by fabrication of complete organic solar cells sensitized by dyes. Recently, for the first time, we have shown that replacement of metal oxide in a DSSC by an organic semiconductor blend polyaniline/N,N-di((S)-1-carboxylethyl)-3,4:9,10-perylenetetracarboxyldiimide (PANI–PTCDA) afforded an OPV solar cell with a PCE of 2.88% (ref. 23). To probe the high modularity of this new architecture, we have rationally modified the PTCDA component to N,N-di((S)-1-carboxylphenylalanine)-3,4:9,10-perylenetetracarboxyldiimide (PPA) producing a composite with PANI in citric acid having the possibility of high electron mobility. Consequently, the device reported here shows an impressive 50% increase in PCE to reach the value of 4.32%. A reference experiment of the PANI–PTCDA composite doped with citric acid reveals a PCE of 3.55% and the PANI–PPA composite prepared in acetic acid medium shows a PCE of 3.77%. Therefore, this study opens up an immense opportunity of future development that can encompass all the advances achieved in designing of a plethora of dyes in DSSCs and all electron transporting materials designed for BHJs as well as new innovative materials suitable for this endeavor.
Experimental
Materials
Citric acid and ammonium persulfate (APS) were purchased from E. Merck, Mumbai and were used as received. Aniline (E. Merck) was distilled before polymerization. 3,4,9,10-Perylenetetracarboxyl dianhydride, alanine and phenyl alanine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as received.
Synthetic procedure for preparation of N,N′-di((S)-1-carboxylphenylalanine)-3,4:9,10-perylenetetracarboxyldiimide (R = CH2Ph) (PPA)
3,4,9,10-Perylenetetracarboxyl dianhydride (500 mg, 1.274 mmol), L-phenylalanine (421 mg, 2.548 mmol) and imidazole (1.5 g) were placed in a 250 ml two-necked round-bottomed flask. The mixture was purged with nitrogen gas for 15 minutes. After that, the set-up was placed in an oil bath at 120 °C for 4 hours. The reaction mixture was then cooled and 200 ml de-ionized water was added to the mixture in an N2 atmosphere. A dark red solution was obtained at the end of the reaction. Unreacted 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxyl dianhydride was removed by filtering the dark red solution. The red solution was then acidified with an aqueous 2 (M) solution of HCl. The precipitate was washed thoroughly with deionized water by suction-filtration to maintain a neutral pH. The red solid was then collected and was dried at 50 °C in a vacuum oven for two days to constant weight. The 1H NMR spectrum (DMSO-d6, 400 MHz) of the sample exhibits a peak at ppm d 13.044, (bs, COOH), 8.517 (d, 4H, Ar), 8.338 (d, 4H, Ar), 7.226–7.038 (m, 10H, Ar), 5.951–5.913 (m, 2H, NCH(COOH)CH2Ph), 3.635–3.586 (m, 2H), and 3.443–3.383 (m, 2H). Yield: 648 mg (85.59%).
Synthesis of PANI–PPA composites
Aniline (182 μl) was in situ polymerized in the presence of different amounts of PPA (10, 12, 16, and 20 mg), and the resulting composites were designated as PP10, PP12, PP16 and PP20, respectively. In a typical procedure, PPA was added to 5 ml of 1 (M) citric acid solution and was ultrasonicated until the PPA was fully dispersed (1 h). Aniline was then added into the PPA solution at 0 °C, followed by the addition of ammonium persulfate as an oxidizing agent. PANI–PPA precipitated out from the reaction mixture and it was kept for 2 days in a refrigerator for self-organization. The products were then washed several times with distilled water followed by methanol to remove oligomers and other organic by-products and then dried at 50 °C in a vacuum oven for 3 days. The citric acid doped reference PANI–PTCDA composite was synthesized in a similar fashion to the PP16 sample. Another reference PANI–PPA composite of similar composition to that of PP16 was also produced in a similar fashion using acetic acid in place of citric acid.
Characterization
The powder samples were dispersed in water and the dispersions were drop cast on cover slips. Then they were platinum coated for evaluation of surface morphology. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of the above samples were recorded using a JEOL, JSM-6700F FE-SEM instrument. The FTIR spectra of the samples were taken from KBr pellets of the samples using a Shimadzu FTIR instrument (model 8400S). UV-vis spectra of the samples were taken in water solution (1 mg per 15 ml) using a UV-vis spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Cary 8454). The solutions were prepared by sonicating the samples in water and the spectra were taken from a quartz cell with a 1 cm path length. We measured the loading amount of N719 dye for each composite cell from UV-vis spectra. At first the cell was dipped in a 0.5 mM ethanolic solution of the dye for 12 h. After adsorption of the dye, the concentration of the residual dye solution was measured quantitatively from UV-vis spectra. The concentration of dye in the DSSC was measured from a calibration curve of known concentration of dye solution using the absorbance at the λmax = 389 nm. The amounts of dye for PP10, PP12, PP16 and PP20 DSSCs were 0.35 × 10−7, 1.05 × 10−7, 4.75 × 10−7 and 0.25 × 10−7 mol cm−2 (Fig. S1a–c†). To understand the interaction of the dye with the PP16 composite, solid state UV-vis spectroscopy was performed by drop casting the PP16 solution in acetonitrile, followed by drying in air and finally in a vacuum. The solid state UV-vis spectra of the dye adsorbed PP-16 sample were recorded after dipping the slide into the N719 dye solution in ethanol for 24 h, followed by drying as above. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded from ethanol dispersions of the pure (3.33 × 10−3%, w/v) and composite materials (6.66 × 10−3%, w/v) in a 1 cm quartz cell using a FluoroMax-3 (Horiba-JobinYvon) instrument by exciting at 486 nm.
Electronic/optoelectronic measurements
The dc-conductivity of PANI–PPA pellets was measured by a two-probe method using the same pressing protocol at room temperature. The diameter of the pellets was 2.5 mm and their average thickness was 0.42–0.5 mm. The thickness of the samples was measured using digital slide calipers. The dc-conductivity of the pellets was measured with an electrometer (Keithley, model 2401) at 25 °C using the equation: σ = 1/R × l/a where ‘l’ is the thickness, ‘a’ is the area and ‘R’ is the resistance of the sample. I–V characteristic curves of the samples were studied at 25 °C using the same samples by applying voltages from −2 to +2 V and the current was measured at each applied voltage.
Electrochemical impedance measurements were performed for different composite pellets with a Solartron SI1260 impedance analyzer. The impedance spectra of the composites were recorded at 25 °C over a frequency range from 32 MHz to 1 Hz with an oscillation voltage of 20 mV at 0 V dc level. In the Nyquist plot, the negative imaginary part of impedance (Z′′) was plotted on the +Y axis, and the real part (Z′) was plotted on the X axis, representing a typical Cole–Cole plot in the complex impedance plane. For the sample preparation for EIS spectra of the cell, we followed the procedure for fabrication of DSSCs as described below. The impedance spectra of the DSSC devices were recorded in a frequency range of 32 MHz to 1 mHz with an oscillation voltage of 100 mV at an applied dc voltage of 0.69 V, i.e. at the open circuit voltage of the cell.
Cyclic voltammetry experiments were carried out using an electrochemical workstation (CHI600E) in a three-electrode cell configuration consisting of a platinum working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl quasi reference electrode with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the internal standard using a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. PPA dissolved in THF and PANI dispersed in dichlorobenzene was cast onto the working electrode area, followed by coating with Nafion. The measurements were made using 0.1 mol l−1 tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as a background electrolyte in dry acetonitrile. All working solutions were thoroughly degassed with oxygen-free nitrogen and a nitrogen atmosphere was maintained above the solution throughout the experiments.
Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells
The substrates (PANI–PPA samples) were sensitized by immersing them in 0.5 mM ethanolic solution of the N719 dye. The photoelectrodes were fabricated on low-resistance FTO glass (2 × 2 cm2, 8–12 Ω □−1) by a drop-cast method. A thin layer of graphite was coated on the FTO using a pencil tip, which acts as the counter electrode (2 × 2 cm2). It is an advantage of our system to use the low cost graphite material as a counter electrode rather than the high cost platinum. The resulting dispersions in chlorobenzene were cast onto the FTO glass, with Scotch tape used as a frame and spacer to control the film thickness, and dried in air. The active area of the anode was about 0.24 cm2. The iodide–triiodide based electrolyte solution, consisting of 0.5 M KI, 0.05 M I2 in γ-butyrolactone, was placed on the active electrode area. Small spaces of bare FTO glass and graphite coated FTO were uncovered for wire connection on the anode. The configuration of the solar cell was achieved by sandwiching the samples between the FTO substrate and the counter electrode in a face-to-face fashion. The cell current between the two electrodes was measured using a Keithley source meter (model 2401) by illuminating under simulated sunlight from a 150 W xenon lamp equipped with an AM1.5G filter (Newport, 67005), at a calibrated intensity of 100 mW cm−2, as determined with a standard silicon reference cell (91150V Oriel Instruments). The same procedure of cell fabrication was adopted for the citric acid doped PANI–PTCDA sample and acetic acid doped PANI–PPA sample. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of wavelength was measured with a Newport 66902 150 watt Xe-lamp in combination with an Oriel Cornerstone 130 monochromator and a Keithley 236 source measurement unit controlled by Visual Basic software.
Results
The performance of the dye sensitized architecture depends on the effectiveness of the transfer of photogenerated electrons to the corresponding electrode and retardation of the competing back reactions such as a reverse charge transfer to the redox couple or to the dye molecules present in the system. The lower PCE observed for OPV devices with the PANI–PTCDA composite reported23 before can be attributed to the difficulty in electron flow through the external circuit due to nature of the composite causing the back reactions to be severe. This is manifested by the lower life time of the photoelectron and very low fill factor of the reported cells.
Design and characterization of PANI–PPA composites
To increase the efficiency of the OPV device and establish the modular nature of the n-type photoactive material, we have implemented two different modifications of the PANI–PTCDA composite.23 In one approach, we have modified the PTCDA component to enhance the interactions with PANI. PANI is in situ synthesized by the polymerization of the aniline monomer and has a very high content of aromatic phenyl moieties. Aromatic interaction or π-stacking is prevalent in such systems and it is envisioned that the introduction of aromatic phenyl residues into PTCDA would augment the interactions between PANI and PTCDA and it would also improve the mobility of electrons. Based on the assumptions, we replace the alanine module in PTCDA with phenylalanine as it is favorable for π-stacking and has a high aggregation propensity in various supramolecular self-assembled systems.24–27 In the second adjustment, we have altered the dopant acid employed during PANI polymerization. Literature reports suggest that the conductivity of PANI can be enhanced substantially by replacing acetic acid with higher molecular weight organic acids.28 This proceeds with fine tuning of the doping of PANI by using citric acid which affords a unique morphological transition as discussed below.
FESEM images of pure PANI and PANI–PPA composites are presented in Fig. 1 and ESI Fig. S2.†The ultrastructure of citric acid doped PANI showed a unique spherical structure (Fig. 1b) as compared to conventional tubular features produced in acetic acid.29 This observation is consistent with the fact that the morphology of PANI nano- and microstructure strongly depends on the reaction conditions and on the type of dopant acid.30,31 A close examination confirms that the surface of the spheres is very rough and has a substructure comprising dense aggregation of nanospheres (ESI Fig. S2a†). It can be envisaged that the larger sphere is formed through self-assembly of the small spheres to consummate a minimum surface energy. The average diameter of small spheres has varied from 50–60 nm and the average diameter for large spheres is in the range of 300–350 nm. PANI–PPA composites preserve the spherical structures with little variations in gross morphology and this proves that the polymerization of aniline is a robust process with potential to incorporate various additives (Fig. 1b–e and Fig. S2b†). A qualitative analysis of the SEM micrographs of different PANI–PPA composites reveals that the nature of PP16 is different from that of other composites and also from pure PANI. In addition to dense aggregation of spherical particles, a substantial population of nanorod-like morphology, formed by the fusion of smaller spheroids, is clearly visible (Fig. S2c and d†). This may indicate that the PP16 sample is superior to form interconnected network structures favoring effective electron transport processes.

To understand the interactions between pure PANI (PP0) and PPA, UV-vis spectra of PP0, PPA and their composites are investigated as shown in Fig. 2a. PP0 exhibits absorption maxima at 376 nm, 451 nm and 934 nm which correspond to the π–π* transition, polaron band to π* band transition and π band to polaron band transition of PANI, respectively and these peaks characterize the formation of the emeraldine salt (ES) form of PANI.32 It is important to note that although citric acid is a weak acid due to the polydentate nature of the acid, it assists the PANI chain to be more decoiled shifting the π band to polaron band transition peak to a very high value compared to that in acetic acid doped PANI (891 nm).23 PPA exhibits two strong absorption peaks at 486 and 524 nm. They can be ascribed to the vibrational fine structure of S0 to S1 electronic transitions of PPA associated with π–π* transition. The absorption maxima at 524 nm originate from the transition of the zero vibrational level of the S0 state to the zero vibrational level of the S1 state and the absorption peak at 486 nm corresponds to the electronic transition from the zero vibrational level of the S0 state to the first vibrational excited level of the S1 state, respectively.33,34 Although in the PANI–PPA composites the absorption peaks of PPA are not prominent, different shifts of the absorption maxima of PANI clearly indicate the interactions between PANI and PPA.

All the PANI–PPA composites display a large blue shift of the absorption maxima associated with π band to π* band and with π band to polaron band transitions, consequently polaron band to π* band transitions show a small red shift.35 As an example PP0 has an absorption maximum at 376 nm due to π to π* band transition and for the PP16 composite, it has blue shifted to a maximum of 362 nm indicating π–π interactions between PANI and PPA with H type aggregate formation.36 Due to better H-aggregate formation, PP16 also shows a maximum blue shift in the π band to polaron band transition of 114 nm from other composites. The blue shift of π to polaron band transition of PANI may be attributed to stabilization of the π-band of PANI due to π–π stacking with aromatic rings of PPA causing coiling of the PANI chain in the composite.
To further ascertain the nature of interactions between PANI and PPA, FTIR spectra of the pure PANI and different composites are studied as depicted in Fig. 2b. The stretching bands at 1582, 1490, 1296, 1117 and 811 cm−1 represent the characteristic vibration of PANI.37 PANI shows vibrational bands in the region 1582 cm−1 corresponding to CN and CC stretching of the quinonoid (Q) structure and the vibration band at 1490 cm−1 is attributed to the aromatic ring stretching of the benzenoid (B) structure of acid doped PANI.37 These two bands shift to lower frequency with incremental addition of PPA to PANI indicating the presence of π–π interactions between PANI and PPA. The vibrational peak at 1117 cm−1 suggests the presence of polaron band vibration (Q = N+H–B or B–N+H–B) due to doping of PANI.38 It is to be noted that for PP16 the polaronic band vibration is at the lowest level, 1075 cm−1 and it is broader in nature. This result indicates greater stabilization of polarons at this composition. So from the UV-vis and FTIR results, it may be summarized that the PP16 sample becomes more coiled than the others probably due to a better π-stacking interaction between PANI and aromatic rings of PPA.

Fig. 2c represents the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pure PPA and different PANI–PPA composites. In the inset of the figure the PL spectrum of PPA exhibits two peaks at 546 nm and 577 nm. PANI–PPA composites exhibit emission peaks at 537 and 574 nm and the shifting to lower wavelength may be attributed to π–π interactions between the aromatic core of PPA and PANI forming H-aggregates. A comparison of the intensity of composites indicates that PP16 has maximum PL-intensity among all the composites. The characteristic emission behavior may indicate that the H-aggregate formation in the PP16 composite is prominent in which substantial stabilization of the PPA energy level takes place.39 The fluorescence intensity of all the conjugates gradually increases with increasing PPA concentrations until the threshold value is observed for PP16. Further addition of PPA to PANI causes the self-aggregations of the added PPA from that of PP16 composites ensuing quenching of signals. It confirms that PP16 represents the optimal ratios of the PANI/PPA blend for photovoltaic study.
Photoelectronic properties of the composites
The dc-conductivity of pure PANI and PANI–PPA composite's pellets was measured by a two-probe method at 25 °C. From Fig. 3a it is apparent that the conductivity of the composites increases with succeeding addition of PPA. PP16 shows the highest conductivity and it reduces with further addition of PPA.

(c) On–off photocurrent response of the PP16 sample. (d) Nyquist plot from EIS measurements of PANI and PANI–PPA composites (the inset shows the equivalent circuit used for fitting the parameters). 

Fig. 3b and S3(a–c)† show the I–V characteristics of PP16 and different PANI–PPA composites, respectively. The I–V characteristics of PANI–PPA composites are measured from pellets by applying bias from −2 V to +2 V under dark and illuminated conditions with 1.5 AM irradiation and it reveals that the photocurrent is higher than that of the dark current for all the composites confirming the semiconducting nature of all the composites under both dark and illuminating conditions. The photo-response properties of the different composites are further investigated from the photocurrent growth (for 100 s) and decay (for 100 s) curves recorded at a time gap of 1000 ms on white light irradiation of 1 sun at a bias of 2 V (Fig. 3c and S4a–c†). Fig. 3c validates several such photocurrent cycles for PP16 samples, indicating that the material can be reversibly turned on and off under both illuminated and dark conditions, respectively. The photo-stability is found to be poor for PP10 and PP20 samples and it may be attributed to the lack of proper π-stacking; in the former the lower amount of PPA may not fully cover the PANI chain and in the latter the self-aggregation of PPA may be very high, causing higher photodegradation. But in PP12 and in PP16, the supramolecular organization between PPA and PANI is quite good allowing the systems to attain a good photo-stability. The relative increase in photocurrent of the composites for the second and fifth cycles is presented in Table S1,† indicating that PP16 exhibits the highest photocurrent increase compared to any other composites.
To probe the influence of PPA on composite characteristics, the ac impedance spectra of the citric acid doped polyaniline and PANI–PPA samples are measured and Fig. 3d illustrates the Cole–Cole plot between the real part (Z′) and the imaginary part (Z′′) of impedance at room temperature at a bias of 0.02 V. R1 represents the contact resistance to FTO and R2 corresponds to the composite resistance where C1 is the capacitance of the sample (shown in Table 1). The arcs of the impedance semi-circle decrease with decreasing the resistance up to addition of 16 mg of PPA to PANI and then again start to increase with further addition of PPA. PP16 shows the lowest resistance and highest capacitance value rather than the other composites, representing that PP16 is the optimized concentration with high charge carrier ability.

The energy levels of pure PANI and PPA are characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV). A modification of the position of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) occurs by introducing a phenyl alanine moiety into perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (HOMO −6.8ev and LUMO −4.7 eV).40 It is found that PPA shows a HOMO and LUMO energy level at −5.95 eV and −3.95 eV and PANI exhibits a HOMO at −4.99 eV (ESI Fig. S5a–d†). For further investigation we also measured the optical band gap of PPA from Tauc's plot (Fig. S5e†) and the band gap value (2.07 eV) matches well with the band gap obtained from CV (2.0 eV). The optical band gap of PANI is measured from Tauc's plot (Fig. S5f †) and is found to be 1.89 eV. The LUMO of PANI is calculated by adding it with the HOMO (−4.99 eV) obtained from CV and is found to be −3.10 eV. Thus the energy levels are well matched to facilitate efficient electron transfer in DSSCs.
Photovoltaic performance of the dye sensitized organic solar cells
We have fabricated dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with different PANI–PPA composites using N719 dye as a photo-sensitizer. A thin layer of graphite on the FTO is used as a counter electrode. In DSSCs, the white light is absorbed by the sensitizer, which is adsorbed on the surface of semiconducting PANI–PPA composites. The photo-induced electron injection occurs via the interface of the excited dye into the conduction band of the composite. This leads to an effective charge separation within the composites and holes are generated at the dye ground state (i.e. at the HOMO), which is further regenerated through reduction by electron donation from the electrolyte, such as the iodide/triiodide redox couple which itself is regenerated at the counter electrode by electrons through an external circuit.
The J–V characteristic curves of all the DSSCs of the four composites are compared in Fig. 4a and the important parameters including power conversion efficiency (PCE), open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) are summarized in Table 2. The thickness of the active layer of the DSSC (PP16) is measured from the cross-sectional SEM image and it is approximately 14.75 μm, shown in Fig. 4b.

The best performance is achieved with the PP16 device illustrating a short circuit current (Jsc) of 9.35 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.69 V and a higher fill factor (FF) of 0.67 leading to a power conversion efficiency(PCE) of 4.32% (see Table 2). The other composites exhibit a lower PCE than PP16. This outcome establishes that PP16 is the optimized concentration for the best solar cell performance among all the composites. With increasing or decreasing the doping level of PANI with PPA, the PCE of the devices does not increase and Jsc also decreases. These lower values of JSC for PP10, PP12 and PP20 composites may account for lower conductivity and a higher recombination rate during electron transport. To analyze the photon-to-electron conversion, the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) is measured for the PP16 composite based DSSC (Fig. 4c) and it shows absorption of light in the broad wavelength region of 360–680 nm with a moderate IPCE value of 62% at a wavelength of 549 nm. The IPCE value strongly depends on the light harvesting efficiency, the efficiency of electron injection from dye molecules to semiconductors and the efficiency of charge collection at the counter electrode. The light harvesting efficiency depends on the amount of dye adsorbed and other terms depend on the film thickness and morphology of the semiconductors.41 As the morphology and film thickness have a crucial role in IPCE, it can be assumed that different morphologies of PANI–PPA systems also have some effect on longer wavelength region absorption.
In order to justify our hypothesis we have synthesized a citric acid doped PANI–PTCDA sample in a similar fashion23 using citric acid instead of acetic acid and the photovoltaic performance is measured. The J–V characteristic curve is presented in Fig. S6.† The system exhibits a Jsc of 9.14 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.67 V and a lower fill factor (FF) of 0.58 yielding a PCE of 3.55%. The substantial decrease in the fill factor in this PANI–PTCDA compared to that of the PANI–PPA device might be a possible reason for lower PCE. This result proves our two hypotheses (i) use of polydentate citric acid increases the PCE by 23% compared to that in acetic acid and (ii) substitution of alanine in PTCDA by phenyl alanine increases the PCE by 22%. So the present PANI–PPA device reported here shows an overall 50% increase in PCE compared to that of the PANI–PTCDA system.23 Hence, without using the traditional TiO2, the PANI–PPA composites act as a good active material showing a moderate PCE of 4.32%.
To understand the anchoring mechanism between the PANI–PPA composite and N719 dye, we have performed an UV-vis study. N719 dye is a ruthenium based dye with two bipyridine ligands that have carboxylic acid substitutions. The UV-vis spectra of the PANI–PPA composite film containing N719 dye before and after the dye absorption are compared in Fig. S7a.† The dye exhibits two peaks at 400 and 552 nm which are attributed to metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions. The higher-energy MLCT has some character of π–π* (ligand centered) transition.42 It is evident from the figure that there is a red shift of both the absorption peaks of the dye in the PANI–PPA composite (412 and 560 nm) compared to that of pure dye and it has been attributed to the π-stacking interaction between the dye and PP16 sample.47 The π to polaron band transition peak of the dye adsorbed PANI–PPA system shows a blue shift from 976 nm to 947 nm, indicating an ionic interaction between radical cations of doped PANI and the carboxylate anion of the dye. In order to further support this we have recorded FTIR spectra of the dye adsorbed PP16. It is very much evident from Fig. S7b† that the polaronic (Q = N+H–B or B–N+H–B) vibration band has shifted from 1075 cm−1 in PP16 to 1105 cm−1 after dye adsorption supporting that radical cations of doped PANI interact with the carboxylate anions of the dye making the polarons more localized.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a well-established non-destructive technique for measuring the current response of a DSSC as a function of frequency by applying an ac voltage. The fundamental electronic and ionic processes occurring in the photovoltaic device are closely associated with the electron transport rate and electron lifetime in the mesoscopic film.43 The Nyquist diagram (Fig. 4d) obtained from the EIS of different PANI–PPA composite based DSSCs represents three semicircles. The high frequency small semicircle (Z1) corresponds to the redox reaction at the counter electrode, the middle frequency semicircle (Z2) represents the electron transfer at the composite/electrolyte interface and the low frequency semicircle (Z3) represents Nernstian diffusion of triiodide ions within the electrolyte. The effective electron lifetime, τ, can be calculated by fitting the EIS spectrum in an appropriate equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 4d.44 The fitting parameters obtained from the equivalent circuit are presented in Table 3 where Rd, Rrec and RCE denote diffusion, recombination and counter electrode resistances, respectively and Cμ represents the chemical capacitance at the composite and electrolyte interface. In low and high frequency regions, the semicircles are little bit flattened due to the rough surface of the electrode and hence capacitance (C) is replaced by a constant phase element (CPE). Of the three semicircles the middle frequency region is very important to govern the efficiency of the solar cell because the life time (τ) of photo-injected electrons in the cell can be calculated using the equation:τ = Rrec × Cμ

The electron-recombination process in the DSSC strongly depends on τ. It has been shown that PP16 has the highest electron lifetime compared to other composites. This result puts forward that PP16 has a lower electron recombination rate than other composites causing higher PCE. A probable reason for the highest lifetime in the PP16 sample may lie in the morphology of the system where rods are produced due to agglomeration of overlapping spheroids. Here the photoexcited electrons can stay for a longer time without going to recombination or back reaction processes.45 Wang et al. showed that a sphere based TiO2 film has a lower electron-recombination rate compared to nanoparticle based TiO2 based films.46 Recently we showed that the trihybrid fibrillar network structure has about 1% more PCE than the additive of the bicomponent systems.47 So morphology has strong influence on the lifetime and PCE of the DSSCs and hence it can be assumed that the fused spherical morphology of PANI–PPA forming some rod-like structures is the reason for higher electron lifetime yielding higher PCE. Also a higher chemical capacitance value of PP16 implies higher charge density due to better π-stacking in the system than other composites.
The functioning principle of the PANI–PPA composite-based DSSC is presented in a schematic diagram (Scheme 1) where the relative energy levels of p-type PANI and n-type PPA are shown.
 Scheme 1  Schematic model for the working principle of the PANI–PPA composite-based DSSCs. 
The LUMO of PANI (−3.10 eV) accepts electrons from the photo-excited dye and the excited electrons can pass through the PANI to the LUMO of PPA (−3.95 eV) without any obstruction as their energy levels are favorable for electron transfer. Due to the supramolecular interaction between PANI and PPA, the photo-injected electrons can pass from PANI to PPA to FTO quickly (Scheme 1).
Discussion
The increase in PCE with the PANI–PPA composite can be attributed to the presence of aromatic phenylalanine in PPA as a substitute to alanine in PTCDA and doping with citric acid instead of acetic acid. To confirm these observations several control experiments are performed to compare the properties of the PANI–PPA composites with the PANI–PTCDA composites using citric acid and acetic acids as dopants.
Comparison of morphology of PANI–PPA (PP16) in citric acid with PANI–PPA in acetic acid and PANI–PTCDA in citric acid
The morphology of PANI–PPA in acetic acid and PANI–PTCDA in citric acid studied by FESEM is shown in Fig. S8.† The PANI–PPA in acetic acid shows nanotubular morphology with a protruding hairy rough outer surface (Fig. S8a†). These structures reveal excellent similarity to the PANI–PTCDA composite made in acetic acid.23 Under analogous conditions, PANI–PTCDA in citric acid (Fig. S8b†) exhibits spherical structures as observed in the PANI–PPA system doped with citric acid. As mentioned above the spherical morphology is produced from the fusion of the small spherical objects. This study therefore confirms that PANI morphology is highly robust and has the potential to incorporate a variety of π-conjugated organic semiconductors showing dopant dependent morphology.
Comparison of UV-vis spectra of PANI–PPA (PP16) in citric acid with PANI–PPA in acetic acid and PANI–PTCDA in citric acid
Fig. S9† shows that the UV-vis spectrum of PP16 exhibits strong blue shifts to 820 nm and 362 nm in the π band to polaron band and π to π* band transition compared to those of PANI–PPA in acetic acid and PANI–PTCDA in citric acid medium. PANI–PPA in acetic acid displays these peaks at 868 nm and 371 nm and PANI–PTCDA in citric acid medium shows absorption at 910 and 376 nm. The blue shifts from that of pure PANI in citric acid (Fig. 2a) suggest the presence of a π–π interaction between PANI and the acceptors like PPA and PTCDA. The higher blue shifts of PP16 (π to π* and π to polaron bands) than those of PANI–PTCDA in citric acid may be attributed to a better π-stacking interaction between PANI and PPA than that of PANI and PTCDA due to the presence of phenyl alanine residues in place of alanine. The phenyl group of phenyl alanine provides a better π-stacking interaction in the PANI–PPA system. Several reports also suggest that the conjugation of aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine or tyrosine containing peptides to perylene favors the self-assembly involving π-stacking among other non-covalent interactions.48,49
For a comparison using dopants like acetic acid and citric acid for the same PANI–PPA composition (as in PP16) it is observed that the citric acid doped system exhibits a larger blue shift of π to π* and π to polaron bands compared to the acetic acid doped system. This indicates better π-stacking between PANI and PPA in citric acid medium compared to that in acetic acid medium. A probable reason may be that the polydentate citric acid causes the PANI chain to be more planar favoring the π-stacking process appreciably.
Comparison of FTIR spectra of PANI–PPA in citric acid and acetic acid and PANI–PTCDA in citric acid
It has been shown above that the citric acid doped PANI shows vibrational bands at 1582 and 1490 cm−1 corresponding to quinonoid (Q) and benzonoid (B) ring stretching of PANI. Fig. S10† shows that all these bands shift to lower frequency in the order PP16 > PANI–PPA in acetic acid > PANI–PTCDA in citric acid indicating that the π–π interaction between PANI and the acceptor molecules follows the same order. PP16 exhibits the highest shift of frequency at 1573 and 1481 cm−1 and in PANI–PPA with acetic acid, these peaks are at 1577 and 1485 cm−1. This result clearly indicates that citric acid doped PANI favors a better π-stacking interaction than acetic acid doped PANI. PANI–PTCDA in citric acid exhibits corresponding peaks at 1578 cm−1 and 1485 cm−1 suggesting that the π–π interaction between PANI and PPA is more favorable than that of PANI and PTCDA.
As discussed above (Fig. 2b) the vibrational peak at 1117 cm−1 of pure PANI represents the presence of polaron band vibration (Q = N+H–B or B–N+H–B) due to doping of PANI. This peak shifts to 1075 cm−1 for the PP16 composite, 1107 cm−1 for PANI–PPA with acetic acid and 1112 cm−1 for PANI–PTCDA in citric acid. The result therefore indicates that citric acid is a better dopant than acetic acid due to polydentate nature of doping of PANI. However, PANI–PTCDA in citric acid is not so well doped as in PANI–PPA indicating the presence of secondary doping due to the presence of phenyl alanine in PPA.
Comparison of photo-physical properties of PANI–PPA in citric acid with PANI–PPA in acetic acid and PANI–PTCDA in citric acid
The photovoltaic performance of a PANI–PPA composite prepared in acetic acid medium is recorded (Fig. S11a†) and it shows a PCE of 3.77% with a Jsc value of 8.17 mA cm−2, a Voc value of 0.71 V and a FF value of 0.65. This system has lower efficiency than the PANI–PPA citric acid doped system (PP16) due to a lower Jsc value and low fill factor in acetic acid medium. However, this system has higher efficiency compared to PANI–PTCDA in citric acid medium (PCE of 3.55%, Fig. S6†). For further investigation, we have also measured the electron lifetime from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Fig. S11b and Table S2†). It is clear that PANI–PPA in the acetic acid medium device has lower lifetime (5.97 ms) of photo-injected electrons compared to that in citric acid medium (7.7 ms). This is because of better π-stacking of PANI–PPA in citric acid than that in acetic acid as mentioned above and photo-injected electrons are resonating here for longer time. As the electron-recombination process depends on the electron lifetime of the device, it can be presumed that electron-recombination occurs more rapidly for PANI–PPA in the acetic acid medium system than the PP16 device. So overall it can be assumed that PANI–PPA in citric acid medium is the best device studied here for efficient solar energy conversion compared to the two other systems.
It is important to mention that the TiO2 based semiconductor materials represent the most well studied and standard system in DSSCs. Any effort to replace TiO2 with other semiconducting metal oxides invariably results in a decrease in PCE. This represents a crucial impediment in optimization of the DSSC technique. A majority of the effort towards the optimization of the DSSC platform has been devoted to the designing of novel dye molecules and development of suitable redox couples.50–52 In this study, we proved that the PANI–PPA system reported here has excellent modular characteristics. This has several advantages over the conventional TiO2-dye system as this would allow fine tuning of the components to afford better energy matching for efficient electron transfer without the constraint of matching the energy level with metal oxide semiconductors. Apart from that, the dye molecule may be covalently anchored to the perylene bisimide derivative leading to efficient charge injection53 and control over the dye loading during cell fabrication. This system therefore shows a possible way to develop efficient organic solar cell by tuning the chemical structure of the donor–acceptor system and also choosing an appropriate processing medium.
Conclusion
So, an excellent organic photovoltaic platform with dye sensitized architecture with outstanding modular characteristics has been designed with a citric acid doped PANI–PPA composite and N719 dye. The PP16 composite has a unique dense rod-like nanosphere morphology showing an optimum π-stacking between PPA and PANI. The reference device, citric acid doped PANI–PTCDA sample, exhibits a PCE value of 3.55% and the PANI–PPA composite doped with acetic acid exhibits a PCE of 3.77%. This result proves our two hypotheses (i) use of polydentate citric acid increases the PCE of PANI–PTCDA by 23% and the PCE of PP16 by 15% compared to those in acetic acid indicating the influence of dopants of PANI and (ii) substitution of alanine in PTCDA by phenyl alanine increases the PCE by 22% in citric acid confirming the role of interfacial interaction through π-stacking in the PCE of the device. Hence, without using the traditional TiO2, the purely organic PANI–PPA composites act as a good active material in DSSCs showing a moderate PCE of 4.32%. IPCE results exhibit a maximum of 62% conversion of incident photons in the wavelength range of 360–680 nm. The lifetime of photo-injected electrons measured from the Nyquist plot indicates that the PP16 composite based device had the highest lifetime (7.7 ms) accounting for the highest PCE among the composites. The work presented here will open up a new paradigm for further development of novel organic photovoltaic solar cells.
