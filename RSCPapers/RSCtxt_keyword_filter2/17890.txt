    , Accepted 11th May 2015First published on 14th May 2015AbstractIsomeric star-shaped molecules of TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3 and TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3 with different moiety sequences in their arms based on the triphenylamine (TPA) core were designed and synthesized in order to study the influence of inserting thiophene (T) units in their arms and the effects of their positions on the photo-physical and photovoltaic properties of their molecules. For comparison, parent molecules of TPA(BT–3Cz)3 were also prepared with three arms containing 4,7-benzothiadiazole (BT) and 3-carbazolyl (3Cz) units. After the thiophene unit was inserted, the molecular planarity, absorption spectra and hole mobility improved significantly in the resulting TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3 and TPA(T–BT–T–3Cz)3. However, only TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3 exhibited improved photovoltaic properties in contrast to TPA(BT–3Cz)3 in the solution-processable solar cells with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SMs:PC71BM/Ca/Al. A maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 5.07% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 10.08 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.90 V and a fill factor (FF) of 54.05% was obtained in the TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3-based solar cells. To the best of our knowledge, this PCE is one of the highest PCE values for star shaped molecules with the TPA core in organic solar cells. Our work further indicates that the PCE and Jsc values of organic solar cells with TPA-based star-shaped molecules can be increased by inserting T units and tuning the moiety sequence of their arms.
1. Introduction
Bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) are under increasing investigation currently due to their advantages of low cost, light weight and capability to be fabricated into flexible devices via printing and roll-to-roll coating technology.1–5 Among these developed OSCs based on polymers and small molecule (SM) donor materials, the state-of-the-art solution-processed SM-based OSCs (SM-OSCs) have demonstrated constantly increased power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, their highest PCE value of up to 8–10%6–8 has still not met the needs for their practical applications. In order to enhance the PCE in OSCs, the most common and successful approach is to construct low band-gap D–A-type materials by introducing the proper electron-rich moiety (D) and electron-deficient moiety (A).9,10 In these D–A-type materials, a much broader overlap with the solar spectrum was realized, which could lead to a higher short-circuit current density (Jsc).11–13 However, an improved PCE can only be obtained if the decrease of open-circuit voltage (Voc) due to the existence of a trade-off between Jsc and Voc for OSCs is effectively controlled.14 Therefore, finding ways to enhance all the three parameters simultaneously in OSCs, including Jsc, Voc and PCE, is the main challenge for developing the high-performance OSCs.
To enhance these three parameters, the first approach was to develop fluorinated copolymers owing to the fact that introducing fluorine (F) atoms could tune the electrochemical properties without disturbing the molecular planarity, and finally control the intermolecular interactions to increase charge transfer mobility of copolymers, resulting in the enhanced Jsc, Voc and PCE values.15–17 For instance, Wang et al. reported a fluorinated copolymer of PTQTI-F and the PCE of its solar cell was enhanced to be 6.32% with a simultaneous improvement of Jsc and Voc after the fluorine atoms were employed.18 The second approach was to optimize the device structure by device processing technology. For example, Cao and Wu et al. introduced an alcohol/water-soluble conjugated polymer of PFN as a cathode interlayer and obtained high-performance OSCs based on a polymeric donor material of PTB7 with an enhanced PCE of 8.37%.19 However, these approaches to improve the photovoltaic performance were mostly derived from the polymers rather than SMs in OSCs. Therefore, better development of molecular structures for SMs and investigation of the relationships between molecular structures and properties are still needed.
Star-shaped SMs usually exhibit stronger absorption and higher hole mobility than the linear SMs in these triphenylamine (TPA)-based molecules, resulting in enhanced Jsc and PCE.20–22 Our group recently reported star-shaped TPA-based SMs of TPA(BT–3Cz)3 with a moderate PCE of 3.94% and a Voc of 0.97 V in their OSCs, in which 4,7-benzothiadiazole (BT) and 3-carbazolyl (3Cz) were used as the arm units.23 However, the absorption profile covering only from 300 nm to 560 nm limited its achievement of high Jsc and PCE. In order to broaden the absorption and enhance the performance of OSCs further to study the influence of the inserted thiophene (T) unit and its position on photo-physical and photovoltaic properties, two SMs of TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3 and TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3 were designed and synthesized here by embedding the T unit in different positions at three molecular arms in the parent molecule of TPA(BT–3Cz)3. Both star-shaped SMs have the same building blocks but with different moiety sequences, as shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of star-shaped molecules of TPA(BT–3Cz)3, TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3 and TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3. 
In contrast to TPA(BT–3Cz)3, both TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3 and TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3 displayed better thermal stability, much broader absorption spectra as well as higher hole mobility due to their better planarity and enlarged conjugation. However, only TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3 exhibited much improved photovoltaic properties in the solution-processed solar cells with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SMs:PC71BM/Ca/Al. For the TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3-based devices, only a PCE of 3.82% with a Voc of 0.84 V and a Jsc of 8.77 mA cm−2 was obtained. While changing the inserted position of the thienyl unit between the BT and 3Cz groups, the resulting TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3 exhibited an enhanced PCE value of up to 5.07% in the OSCs with the improvement of Jsc, Voc and FF simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, this PCE is also one of the highest PCE values for the star-shaped SMs with the TPA core in OSCs. Therefore, inserting the thienyl units and tuning their sequence in the arms of star-shaped SMs were capable of enhancing the Jsc, Voc and FF simultaneously, then leading to the enhanced PCE values in their OSCs.

2.3. Characterization and measurement
All 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-400 using CDCl3 as the solvent. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric measurements were performed on a Bruker Biflex III MALDI TOF. The theoretical study was performed on the 6-31G** basis set in Gaussian09 using the density functional theory (DFT), as approximated by the B3LYP. UV-Vis spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 25 spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a Netzsch TG 209 analyzer and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement was conducted on a TA Q200 instrument under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were recorded with a three electrode electrochemical cell in a 0.1 M tetra(n-butyl)ammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) solution at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at room temperature under an argon atmosphere. Platinum wire and Ag/AgCl (0.1 M) were used as counter electrode and reference electrode. The thin films on the Pt disk, formed by drop-casting the molecule solution in chloroform (analytical reagent, 10 mg mL−1), were used as the working electrode. Surface morphologies were recorded by atomic force microscopy (AFM) on a Veeco-DI Multimode NS-3D apparatus in a trapping mode under normal air conditions at room temperature.
2.4. Fabrication and characterization of organic solar cells
The photovoltaic cells were constructed with a traditional sandwich structure through the following steps. Firstly, the indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were cleaned by a series of ultrasonic treatments in acetone, following by deionized water, and then 2-propanol each for 10 min. The substrates were dried under a stream of nitrogen and subjected to the treatment of Ar/O2 plasma for 5 min. Secondly, a filtered aqueous solution of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS; Bayer AG) was spun-cast onto the ITO surface at 4000 rpm for 30 s and then baked at 150 °C for 30 min to form a PEDOT:PSS thin film with a thickness of 30 nm. Thirdly, a blend solution of materials and [6,6]-phenyl-C-71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) in chlorobenzene (CB), filtered through a 0.45 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) filter, was spun cast at 3000 rpm for 30 s onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. The substrates were dried under N2 at room temperature and then annealed at 150 °C for 15 min in a nitrogen-filled glove-box. The devices were completed after thermal deposition of a 10 nm calcium and a 100 nm aluminum film as the cathode at a pressure of 6 × 10−4 Pa. The active area was 0.1 cm2 for each cell. The thicknesses of the spun-cast films were recorded by a profilometer (Alpha-Step 200; Tencor Instruments).
Device characterization was performed under an AM 1.5 G irradiation with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Oriel 91160, 300 W). Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured on a computer-controlled Keithley 2602 source measurement unit in the dark. PCE was detected under monochromatic illumination (Oriel Cornerstone 260 1/4 m monochromator equipped with an Oriel 70613NS QTH lamp) and the calibration of the incident light was performed with a mono-crystalline silicon diode. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured on a source meter, silicon photodiode and computer-controlled light source-monochromator-lock-in system. All device fabrication procedures and measurements were carried out in air at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and thermal stability
The synthesis routes to TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3 and TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3 are outlined in Scheme 1. The key bromo-intermediates of 3Cz–BT–T–Br and 3Cz–T–BT–Br were prepared by bromination and the Stille reaction with a moderate yield, respectively. Then the final star-type molecules of TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3 and TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3 were obtained through the well known Suzuki coupling reaction under catalytic effects of Pd2(dba)3 and P(o-Tol)3. Their chemical structures were confirmed with 1H NMR, 13C NMR, elemental analysis and TOF-MS. As the promoted effect of alkyl groups in carbazolyl moieties, both star-type molecules exhibit good solubility in the common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CHCl3), and chlorobenzene (CB).

In addition, no distinct endothermic peaks and exothermic peaks are exhibited for both novel molecules during the heating and cooling processes. The result here implies that inserting another T unit between the TPA and BT units or between the BT and Cz units in each armed branch would be beneficial to improve their thermal properties.25,26 Furthermore, both TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3 and TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3 tend to present an amorphous state.
3.2. Theoretical calculations
The geometrical and electronic properties of both molecules were studied by theoretical calculation using the density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G** level. An ethyl group was used to replace each long alkyl chain in both molecules for simplified calculation. Fig. 3 depicts their minimum-energy geometrical conformations and the molecular orbital electron-state-density distributions.

As shown in Fig. 3, while inserting another T unit in each armed branch, the dihedral angles (DH) whether between TPA and BT for TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3 or between BT and Cz for TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3 decreased significantly compared to the corresponding values of parent molecule TPA(BT–3Cz)3 due to the embedded T unit.24 Furthermore, TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3 presented a much better planar molecular structure than TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3, which indicated that the inserting position of the T unit in the armed branch plays a role in tuning molecular planarity. In general, better molecular planarity could facilitate π–π stacking and lead to increased Jsc and PCE.27–29 Therefore, it should be an efficient approach to tune the photovoltaic properties by changing the inserting position of the T unit in the armed branch. On the other hand, compared to these electron-state-density distributions of HOMO and LUMO for both molecules, it is found that the electron densities are delocalized mainly on the electron-rich TPA units for the HOMO and on the electron-deficient BT units for the LUMO, which suggest a strong intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) effect and is consistent with that reported in the literature.30
3.3. Optical properties and electrochemical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of these three molecules in chloroform solution and thin films are shown in Fig. 4 and their corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. Similar broad absorption spectra with two obvious absorption peaks from 300 nm to 600 nm are observed. The high-lying region from 320 nm to 400 nm corresponds to the π–π* transition and the low-lying region from 420 to 600 nm is assigned to the ICT interaction between electron-rich moiety (Cz and TPA) and electron-deficient moiety (BT).31 Compared with TPA(BT–3Cz)3, both TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3 and TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3 exhibit a much broader absorption spectra with a significant red-shift in both solution and solid film state, which is consistent with the enlarged conjugation and better molecular planarity for both molecules with the inserted T unit.32,33 It is also noted that TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3 displays a much broader absorption spectrum than TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3 in the film. The optical band gaps of TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3 and TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3 are estimated to be 2.03 and 1.93 eV, respectively, from their absorption onsets in films. Therefore, changing the inserted position of the T unit in the armed branch can further tune the UV absorption properties of the resulting molecules.

To investigate molecular electrochemical properties and estimate their HOMO and LUMO energy levels, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out. All reported potentials were calibrated against the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple, which was used as the internal standard. The recorded CV curves are illustrated in Fig. 5 and the correlated data are listed in Table 1. The potential of 0.46 V for the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple is observed, as well as the onset reduction potential (Ered) of −0.99 V and onset oxidation potential (Eox) of 1.59 V are exhibited for TPA(BT–3Cz)3vs. Ag/AgCl. As a result, according to the following equations, the corresponding HOMO and LUMO energy levels (EHOMO, ELUMO) of TPA(BT–3Cz)3 are calculated to be −5.93 and −3.45 eV, respectively.EHOMO (eV) = −(Eox − 0.46 + 4.8)ELUMO (eV) = −(Ered − 0.46 + 4.8)

While embedding the T bridges in the armed branch, it is found that the LUMO energy levels are decreased to be about −3.88 eV and the HOMO energy levels are raised to be about −5.80 eV for both TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3 and TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3, which are similar to those reported in the literature.24,32 The higher HOMO energy levels are considered to be related to the increased conjugation derived from the inserted T unit and are not helpful in obtaining a higher Voc. However, the embedded T bridges could increase the planarity of their resulting molecules, leading to a decreased electrochemical band-gap (Eecg) at the same time, which are expected to increase Jsc. Therefore, the inserted T bridges here played dual roles in reducing Voc and increasing Jsc.
3.4. Photovoltaic performance
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of these star-shaped molecules, bulk hetero-junction organic solar cells were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SM:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The processing parameters were primarily optimized. As a result, the solvent of CB, the spin-coating rate of about 2000 rpm, the SMs/PC71BM ratio (w/w) of 1:4 in the photo-active layer and the annealing temperature of 110 °C were selected as the optimized conditions. Fig. 6 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of these cells under illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW m−2 and their corresponding photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 2. Under these optimized conditions, TPA(BT–3Cz)3-based solar cells exhibited a maximum PCE of 3.94% with a Jsc of 8.80 mA cm−2, a FF of 40.4% and a Voc up to 0.97 V. It is interesting to note that TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3- and TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3-based solar cells presented significantly different photovoltaic properties, while embedding the T bridges in different positions in the armed branch. The TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3-based solar cells displayed a slightly decreased PCE of 3.82% with a Jsc of 8.77 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 0.84 V. However, a significantly enhanced PCE up to 5.07% with the improvement of Jsc, Voc and FF simultaneously was obtained in TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3-based solar cells. To the best of our knowledge, this PCE level in TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3-based cells is one of the highest PCE values for TPA-based star-shaped molecules. Therefore, despite Voc being slightly decreased, inserting the T unit between BT and Cz units is capable of significantly improving the Jsc and PCE values of the resulting molecules in cells. Here, the decreased Voc should result from the up-lifted HOMO energy levels of TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3 and TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices and surface morphologies of the photo-active layers under the optimized conditions can further explain why TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3 displays highest Jsc and FF values among these three molecules in the cells. Fig. 7 displays EQE curves of these three cells. Although the EQE spectra cover a nearly identical range, the position of EQE peaks in the low-energy region is in good agreement with their distinct different absorption spectra. As shown in Table 2, the Jsc values from EQE spectra were estimated to be 8.71, 8.61 and 9.98 mA cm−2 for the TPA(BT–3Cz)3, TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3 and TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3-based solar cells, respectively. And these estimated Jsc values are in good agreement with the measured Jsc values within a 2% error margin. Furthermore, the highest EQE value of 70% is observed in the TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3-based cells, which is available for TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3 to present an enhanced Jsc value in the corresponding OSCs.

Fig. 8 shows the surface morphologies of these photo-active layers recorded by atomic force microscopy (AFM). A homogeneous morphology with a root-mean-squared (RMS) surface roughness of 0.6 nm is observed in the TPA(BT–3Cz)3 blending film. While inserting the thiophene unit into different positions in the armed branch, both TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3 and TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3 blending films exhibited various surface morphologies. Their RMS surface roughness were increased to 0.8 nm for the TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3 blend, and decreased to 0.4 nm for the TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3 blend. The result here indicates that TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3 exhibited better film compatibility than TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3 to PC71BM in these blends, which would lead to an increased FF value of up to 54.05%.14,34,35

3.5. Hole mobility
Hole mobility of these three molecules was measured by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SM:PC71BM (w/w, 1:4)/Au. The SCLC can be approximated by the Mott–Gurney equation: J = (9/8)ε0εrμ(V/d3),36 where J is the current density, εr is the dielectric constant, ε0 is the free-space permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), d is the thickness of the blend films, V = Vappl − Vbi, Vappl is the applied potential, and Vbi is the built-in potential which results from the difference in the work function of the anode and the cathode. Fig. 9 displays the J1/2–V curves of the hole-only TPA(BT–3Cz)3, TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3 and TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3-based devices. Their corresponding hole mobility values are listed in Table 2. According to the above Mott–Gurney equation, the hole mobility of TPA(BT–3Cz)3 is calculated to be 9.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 from the slope of the plot. When inserting the T unit into the armed branch of TPA(BT–3Cz)3, the resulting molecules exhibited an enhanced hole mobility. The higher mobility should be ascribed to their more planar skeleton than that of TPA(BT–3Cz)3. A maximum value of up to 3.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved for TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3, which further corroborates the improvement of Jsc and PCE for the TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3-based solar cells.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, two novel star-shaped molecules of TPA(T–BT–3Cz)3 and TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3 were obtained. Significant influence of the inserted thiophene units into the armed branch of the parent TPA(BT–3Cz)3 and the inserted position on their photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties was observed. As anticipated, the TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3 with the inserted thiophene unit between the BT and Cz groups exhibited the best molecular planarity and photovoltaic properties among these three molecules. A maximum PCE of 5.07% with a Jsc of 10.08 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.90 V and a FF of 54.05% was obtained in the TPA(BT–T–3Cz)3-based solar cells. This work demonstrated that inserting the thiophene bridges into a proper position in the armed branch can significantly enhance PCE and Jsc values of the resulting molecule based solar cells.
