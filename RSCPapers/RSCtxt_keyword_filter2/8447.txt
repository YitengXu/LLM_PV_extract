    , Accepted 7th June 2016First published on 8th June 2016AbstractExploiting cost-effective and highly efficient counter electrodes (CEs) has been a persistent objective for practical application of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Here, we present an efficient CE by using pure three-dimensional (3D) nanomesh graphene frameworks (NGFs) which are synthesized via a template-directed chemical vapor deposition (CVD) approach. The high-surface-area 3D NGFs associated with the enriched surface edge defects make it very efficient towards I3− reduction even without any Pt catalyst. More interestingly, by virtue of the interpenetrating graphene frameworks, the NGFs exhibit excellent electron conductivity, thus leading to facile charge transfer. Consequently, the DSSCs with pure NGFs as CEs display a power conversion efficiency of 7.32%, which is comparable to that of Pt as CEs (7.28%), thereby exhibiting great potential as low-cost and highly efficient CE materials for large-scale deployment of DSSCs.
Introduction
The impending global energy crisis has prompted intense research aiming to exploit various types of sustainable energy conversion and storage systems. In particular, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received tremendous attention for the development of next-generation solar cells because of their ease of fabrication, cost-effectiveness and relatively high energy conversion efficiency.1–3 The prototypical architecture of a DSSC consists of a transparent conductive substrate, an electrolyte containing a redox couple such as iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−), a dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode, and a counter electrode (CE). As a crucial component of DSSCs, the CE plays a pivotal role in terms of transferring electrons from the external circuit and then injecting electrons into the electrolyte to reduce the redox species.4,5 Thus, the requirements for an efficient CE include high catalytic activity to reduce the redox couple and excellent charge-transfer properties to effectively conduct electrons. Traditionally, platinum (Pt) is the most preferred CE electrocatalyst for the DSSCs due to its excellent catalytic activity and high electrical conductivity.6,7 However, the high cost and poor durability of Pt catalysts in the electrolyte have significantly impeded their commercial application in DSSCs. Therefore, it is imperative to explore low-cost and earth-abundant substitutes in order to reduce the overall fabrication cost without sacrificing the DSSC photovoltaic performances.
To address these challenges, extensive efforts have been devoted to the exploration of alternative CE materials, such as inorganic materials, carbon nanomaterials, conductive polymer materials, and composite materials.8–12 By virtue of their activity for I3− reduction, good electrical conductivity, excellent electrochemical stability and easy availability, carbon nanomaterials including carbon black,13 porous carbon,14 carbon nanotubes,15 and graphene16,17 have been widely regarded as candidates and thus triggered intensive interest in the scientific community. Among them, graphene has drawn ever-increasing attention in recent years due to its large specific surface area, and exceptional electrical and mechanical properties.18–22 Nevertheless, the progress is not satisfactory by considering that the resultant DSSCs exhibit comparatively poor photovoltaic performance when comparing with those using Pt-based CEs. The reasons for that lie in the incapability of pure graphene materials in catalyzing the reduction of I3− due to their low intrinsic catalytic activity. It is widely believed that the catalytic activity of graphene materials is derived from defects and charge polarization caused by the different electronegativity between heteroatoms (e.g., N, O, S and B) and carbon atoms.23–27 On the other hand, the strong π–π interaction between graphene sheets would cause inevitable aggregation and restacking, which significantly reduces the surface area and active sites. In most cases, the specific surface areas of graphene materials are limited to lower than 500 m2 g−1, which hinders their practical applications in energy devices.28–30 Thus, two main approaches have been proposed to overcome the inert nature of graphene: (i) tailoring the morphology, generally by increasing the surface area and pore size; (ii) increasing the intrinsic activity via chemical modification.10,25,27,31,32 However, the most recent research has focused on the latter strategy to improve the catalytic activity. There are almost no reports on merely tuning the graphene structure and exploiting the graphene edge defect sites as active sites for CEs. This is because too much structure defects usually lead to the collapse of their structures and the deterioration of their electrical conductivity. Therefore, it is highly desirable to have a rationally designed graphene structure with abundant edge defect sites as catalytic sites for I3− reduction while at the same time maintaining high conductivity for electron transfer for efficient CE materials.
Herein, we provide a thorough analysis of DSSC CEs based on 3D nanomesh graphene frameworks (NGFs), a type of graphene currently synthesized at the kilogram-scale using porous MgO sheets as templates via a CVD approach. The 3D NGFs feature high-density nanopores on the graphene plane resulting in a high specific surface area (1920 m2 g−1) and a large number of edge defects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest surface area of the graphene-based material that is applied as CEs for DSSCs. More interestingly, although there are numerous mesopores on the graphene sheets, the unique interconnected structure enables the 3D NGFs to have high electrical conductivity which facilitates faster charge transfer. The catalytically active sites can be ascribed to the edge defect sites on the graphene sheets. Based on density functional theory calculations, we have further demonstrated that the graphene edge defect sites indeed enhance the activity for I3− reduction. Besides, the enriched in-plane nanopores not only dramatically improve the electrocatalytic activity of graphene but also substantially enhance the ion transport across the 2D graphene plane, thus forming a 3D ion diffusion mode within the electrode matrix. As a consequence, this unique structure of nanomesh graphene with mesoporous channels, abundant active edge defect sites and an interconnected electron highway exhibits high electrocatalytic activity and enhanced durability for I3− reduction. The DSSC devices made from the NGF CEs display a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.32%, which is comparable to that of Pt CEs (7.28%).
Experimental
Materials synthesis
3D nanomesh graphene frameworks (NGFs) were synthesised via the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) approach with CH4 as the carbon source in a vertical quartz fluidized-bed reactor. Briefly, the quartz reactor was heated to 900 °C in an argon flow of 1000 sccm min−1 at atmospheric pressure. CH4 with 800 sccm min−1 was introduced into the reactor after the reaction temperature was reached. Then, the MgO template (about 30 g) was fed into the reactor over 5 min from the top hopper. After 10 min or 20 min carbon deposition, CH4 was turned off and the reactor was cooled to room temperature under an Ar atmosphere. The obtained material was purified by acid washing (excessive amount of condensed hydrochloric acid diluted with deionized water, with a volume ratio of 1:1) with reflux for 1 hour to remove the MgO template. Finally, the resultant black powder was obtained by filtration and drying at 80 °C overnight in an oven.
Preparation of counter electrodes
The counter electrode was made by mixing the obtained NGF materials with a binder containing anhydrous terpineol, ethyl celluloses and ethanol, followed by stirring and sonication to form a CE slurry. The obtained slurry was coated on the FTO glass by the screen printing technique. Then the obtained CEs were heated in a tube furnace at 450 °C under an Ar atmosphere for 40 min. For comparison, the Pt CE was prepared by drop-casting 10 mM H2PtCl6 in 2-propanol and calcination at 400 °C for 15 min.
Characterization
The morphology of the synthesized sample was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM; FEI Quanta200F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; FEI F20). The specific surface area and pore size distribution were characterized by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed with a Thermo Fisher K-Alpha spectrometer. Raman spectra were recorded with a Renishaw inVia confocal Raman microscope system using green (532 nm) laser excitation. The electrical conductivity was measured using the four-probe technique on a NGF disk, which was prepared by compression at 10 MPa, with a thickness of ca. 1 mm and a diameter of 13.0 mm.
Fabrication of DSSCs
In the fabrication of the DSSC device, a screen-printed double layer of TiO2 particles (Kunshan Sunlaite New Energy Technology Co., Ltd, China) was used as photoelectrodes in this study. A 12 μm thick film consisting of 20 nm-sized TiO2 particles was first printed on the FTO electrode and further coated with a 2 μm thick second layer of 300 nm light-scattering TiO2 particles. The active area of the TiO2 electrodes was 0.16 cm2. Then the TiO2 electrodes were gradually heated to 450 °C (heating rate = 10 °C min−1) in air, and subsequently sintered at that temperature for 30 min. After sintering and cooling to 80 °C, the TiO2 electrodes were dye-coated by immersing them for 16 h into an N719 (Dalian HeptaChroma SolarTech Co., Ltd, China) dye (0.3 mM) ethanol solution at room temperature. The working electrode and counter electrode were sandwiched together with a 30 μm Surlyn film (Yingkou OPV Tech New Energy Co., Ltd, China) and then sealed through hot-pressing. The electrolyte which consists of 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine in acetonitrile was injected through a hole from the back side of the counter electrode via vacuum backfilling. Finally, the hole was sealed with a Surlyn film and a thin glass cover by heating.
Electrochemical measurements
Current–voltage characteristics of DSCCs were obtained with a computer-programmed Keithley 2400 source meter (Keithley, USA) under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) by using a Zolix's solar simulator. Each current–voltage curve was measured at least 10 times to eliminate the experimental error as possible, and a compromise curve was employed. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out using a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell by using NGFs as the working electrode, Pt foil as a counter electrode and Ag/Ag+ as a reference electrode in an acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 using an electrochemical workstation system (CS350, CorrTest, Wuhan). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements were conducted in the dark with symmetrical dummy cells (CE/electrolyte/CE) using an electrochemical workstation system at zero bias potential. The dummy cells consisted of an iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) electrolyte which is the same as that for DSSCs and two identical electrodes with an area of 0.25 cm2, separated by a Surlyn film with 45 μm thickness. The measured frequency ranged from 0.1 to 105 Hz, and the amplitude of the alternating current was 10 mV. Z-view software was used to fit the resultant impedance spectra with an equivalent circuit model. Tafel-polarization measurements were carried out with an electrochemical workstation system at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in a symmetrical dummy cell.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
Our calculations are based on DFT as implemented in the Gaussian 03 package with a B3LYP exchange–correlation functional of electrons and the basis set of 6-31G(d) for C and H atoms and an effective core potential (ECP) of Hay and Wadt47 with a (21/21/1) valence basis set augmented with a diffuse function (p shell, exponent 0.0308) for iodine. The geometrical and electronic structures of graphene discussed in this work are investigated by modeling regular and defective edges. Five configurations are optimized at the theoretical level and characterized as stable points (see the details in the ESI†).
Results and discussion
The typical preparation procedure of NGFs is schematically described in Fig. 1. Briefly, Mg(OH)2-derived porous MgO sheets are adopted as mesoporous catalysts for the templated growth of NGFs.33 The graphene is deposited onto the mesoporous template and cast into its mesoporous structure. The structure of the as-made NGFs has been investigated via field emission scanning microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It can be clearly seen that the NGFs still maintain their hexagonal appearance after removal of the MgO templates, which is inherited from the original templates (Fig. 2a, b and S1†). Notably, the whole graphene layer is crinkled and folded regularly (Fig. 2c and d), in which abundant mesopores are observed distinctly on the graphene sheets. Furthermore, the electron diffraction reveals polycrystalline ring patterns which arise from the scrolled or folded graphene sheets (ESI, Fig. S2†).

The mesoporous structure of NGFs has been further confirmed by nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms. Indeed, the obtained NGFs show a high specific surface area of 1920 m2 g−1, as calculated via the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. As shown in Fig. 3a, the type IV isotherm with a sharp increase at P/P0 > 0.45 indicates the existence of large amounts of mesopores with uniform pore size distribution. According to the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method, the pore sizes are mostly centralized in 3 to 5 nm (Fig. 3b). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is utilized for detecting element compositions of the NGFs. As expected, the NGFs show a dominant C 1s peak which is mainly sp2 hybridized and a very weak but noticeable O 1s (2.15 atomic%) peak which most probably arises from the physically adsorbed oxygen due to the high surface area (Fig. 3c). Interestingly, it is very impressive that although the graphene has a lot of mesopores on it, the main interconnected graphene skeleton can still maintain an excellent electrical conductivity of 3000 S m−1, which is much higher than those obtained from chemically derived graphene-based materials and activated carbon.34–36 Raman spectroscopy has been widely employed to characterize graphene structures.37 The Raman spectra of NGFs in Fig. 3d exhibit a clear G peak at around 1580 cm−1, providing evidence of sp2 bonded carbon. The high peak intensity of the D band (1350 cm−1) with respect to that of the G band indicates the presence of abundant surface defects that are commonly known as active sites for the reduction of I3−, which is well consistent with the observations in the TEM image (Fig. 2d). Also the 2D peak (2700 cm−1) of NGFs exhibits a low intensity, probably because of the enriched edge defects on the graphene sheets. In addition, the defect-related combination modes (D + G) at about 2930 cm−1 can also be observed.38 Therefore, based on their unique mesopore structure with a large surface area, along with the high electrical conductivity and abundant edge defect sites, it is highly expected that NGFs will exhibit an excellent electrochemical performance for DSSCs.

To investigate the electrocatalytic performance, NGFs have been deposited on FTO substrates using the screen printing technique. The cross-sectional SEM image reveals that the thickness of the NGF layer is about 8.0 μm (ESI, Fig. S3†), which could be controlled by tuning the screen-printing times. The obtained CEs are obviously nontransparent to visible light because of the large layer thickness. Furthermore, the catalytic activity will be affected by the thickness of the NGF layer (ESI, Fig. S4†). Prior to evaluating the performance of DSSC devices, the cyclic voltammograms (CV) of the I−/I3− redox couple based on both NGF and Pt electrodes have been obtained, and similar CV curves are obtained. Two typical pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks (Red-1/Ox-1 and Red-2/Ox-2) that correlate with two reactions: I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−(1)and 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−,(2)respectively, can be clearly seen for both samples in Fig. 4a. Since the CEs are responsible for catalyzing the reduction of I3− to I−, the characteristics of reaction (1) are the main focus in our analysis. Generally, the peak current intensity (JRed-1 or JOx-1) and the separation between Red-1 and Ox-1 peaks (Epp) are considered as two crucial parameters to evaluate the catalytic activities of different CEs, and the large JRed-1 and the small Epp values correspond to the high electrocatalytic activity. Obviously, the Epp for two electrodes is almost identical, while the peak current density of the NGF electrode is a bit higher than that of the Pt electrode, indicating that NGFs possess superior electrocatalytic activity for the regeneration of the I−/I3− redox couple.

(c) Electrochemical impedance spectra (inset: the corresponding equivalent circuits) and (d) Tafel polarization curves of the symmetric dummy cells fabricated with different CEs. 
Based on the promising CV results, the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of NGFs as CEs for DSSCs have been obtained, as shown in Fig. 4b. A conventional Pt electrode is tested under similar conditions to elucidate the feasibility of using NGFs as CEs in DSSCs. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters for these CEs are summarized in Table 1. The Pt-based reference DSSC exhibits a short circuit current (Jsc) of 14.64 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.728 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.683 and a PCE of 7.28%. The DSSC with the NGF CE displays an even higher Jsc of 14.70 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.736 V and a FF of 0.677, yielding a PCE of 7.32%. Obviously, these parameters are comparable to those of Pt CEs, indicating that the NGFs with abundant surface active edge defect sites have higher electrical conductivity and excellent electrocatalytic activities. More importantly, compared with the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs based on other pure graphene CEs (Table S1†), our NGF CEs not only show competitive conversion efficiency to Pt CEs, but also provide a facile approach for large-scale manufacturing of CEs with low-cost. Recently, graphene nanoplatelets as the electrocatalyst outperforming the conventional Pt in Co-based-mediated DSSCs have been reported.39 Therefore, it is possible that the NGFs can be exploited for the Co-mediated DSSCs in future with even higher performance. Besides, the total cost can be further reduced by using NGFs on cheaper FTO-free substrates, such as metallic meshes or metal-wire/polymer-fiber fabrics,40,41 due to the high cost of the FTO substrates.

In order to further understand the charge-transfer resistance at the interface between the CE and electrolyte, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of CEs based on NGFs and Pt has been conducted using a symmetrical dummy cell configuration in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz–105 Hz at open circuit with zero-bias potential. Fig. 4c shows the Nyquist plots and the corresponding equivalent circuits. The detailed parameters obtained by fitting the spectra via the Z-view software are listed in Table 1. According to the equivalent circuit, the intercept on the real axis represents the series resistance (Rs). Interestingly, in the case of the NGFs, an additional distorted arc appearing in the high frequency range is attributed to the diffusion resistance in the pores (Zpore). This is because the diffusion of I−/I3− in the electrolyte may be significantly affected by the pore structure.23,42 Nyquist plots of impedance spectra on a symmetrical dummy cell with NGF electrodes at various applied biases have been obtained to further comprehend this process, as shown in Fig. S5.† When the bias is applied, the ionic diffusion impedance increases dramatically as a result of depletion of I-ions from the bulk electrolyte. Furthermore, the Zpore becomes more prominent with the applied bias voltage in the high frequency range, indicating that the Nernst diffusion impedance resulting from diffusion through the electrode pores is valid. The second semicircle in the middle frequency range arises from the corresponding constant phase element (CPE) and the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface which changes inversely with the catalytic ability of CEs for the reduction of I3− to I−. It should be noted that the two CEs exhibit very similar Rs values, hence posing a similar influence on the photovoltaic performance of the respective devices using the NGF and Pt CEs. However, the CEs based on NGFs possess a little lower Rct (3.61 Ω cm2) than that of Pt (3.70 Ω cm2), which agrees well with its high catalytic activity for I−/I3−, as detected by the CV measurement. In addition, the third semicircle in the low frequency range can be ascribed to the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN), which corresponds to the diffusion resistance in the electrolyte, and it could be expressed by the following equation:  
Here, D is the diffusion coefficient of I3− in the cells, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, n is the number of electrons involved in the electrochemical reduction of I3− at the electrode (n = 2), e0 is the elementary charge, c is the concentration of I3−, A is the electrode area, ω is the angular frequency, and δ is the thickness of the diffusion layer.43 It can be found that the D is inversely proportional to ZN. From the Nyquist plots, the diffusion coefficient of I3− at the NGF CE is slightly lower than that of the Pt CE, being judged by the ZN of NGF (3.41 Ω cm2) and Pt (3.26 Ω cm2) CEs. Finally, the Tafel polarization curves are obtained using symmetrical dummy cells, as shown in Fig. 4d. Both the anodic and cathodic branches show slightly larger slopes for the NGF CEs than for the Pt CEs, suggesting higher exchange current density (J0) generated from the NGF CEs. This is consistent with the EIS values in terms of equation: J0 = RT/nFRct, where R is the gas constant, and F is the Faraday constant. Additionally, the intersection of the cathodic branch with the y-axis can be considered as the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim), which is proportional to D through Jlim = 2nFcD/δ.40 The obtained result of diffusion coefficient is in accordance with that calculated from the EIS measurement.
Our experiments clearly indicate that the graphene edge defect sites exhibit high electrocatalytic activity as the CE material. In order to gain further insight and support our experimental observation, we performed DFT calculations at the B3LYP/DZP level of theory on the structures of graphene with different edges: two typical forms armchair and zigzag, and three defective edges (see the details in ESI, Fig. S6†). According to the previous demonstration on the I3− reduction reaction mechanism, the adsorption of surface iodine atoms on the electron surface and further electron transfer are believed to determine the overall electrocatalytic activity.43–45 Therefore, we have calculated the geometric and electronic structures of iodine-adsorbed 1–3, namely 1_I, 2_I, and 3_I. They are all in the state of doublets (with one unpaired electron). As shown in Fig. 5, 3_I has a crooked form, while 1_I and 2_I have a planar structure. By investigating further their HOMO and LUMO energies, we find that from 1_Ivia2_I to 3_I the preference to accept an electron to generate an iodine ion is becoming strong due to the lowering HOMO energy. In other words, the configuration with a bent form and a bigger edge opening width is predicted to complete electron transfer (I3− + 2e− → 3I−) more easily. Therefore, the edge of defective graphene, especially those having a bigger opening and modest bending, has generally higher activity than others like regular ones consisting of only a 6-membered ring.

For gaining further insight into the unique structure of the NGFs, we have investigated how the specific surface area (SBET) of NGFs affects the DSSC performance. Due to the SBET of NGFs which can be readily controlled by simply adjusting the reaction time, NGFs-10 and NGFs-20 (corresponding to reaction times 10 and 20 min, respectively) have been prepared with a SBET of 1397 and 1920 m2 g−1, respectively (ESI, Fig. S8 and Table S2†). Additionally, we scrupulously chose activated carbon (AC) with a comparable SBET (1906 m2 g−1) to that of the NGFs-20. The J–V curve and EIS of different CEs have been obtained, as shown in Fig. 6a and b, and the corresponding detailed parameters are summarized in Table 2. Obviously, due to the smaller SBET of the NGFs-10, the Jsc (13.51 mA cm−2) and FF (0.623) decrease, reducing the PCE to 6.14%. The declined performance is mainly attributed to the decreased electrocatalytic activity which can be confirmed by the increase of Rct from 3.61 Ω cm2 to 5.92 Ω cm2. This is because the lower surface area produces a small number of active sites for I3− reduction. In the case of AC electrodes, although the SBET is almost identical to the NGFs-20, their electrocatalytic activities are apparently lower than those of the NGFs-20, as judged by Rct (7.49 Ω cm2) and PCE (5.54%). The reason for this phenomenon should be the unique microporous structure. Specifically, the AC exhibits a type-I nitrogen isotherm without any hysteresis loop (ESI, Fig. S8c and d†), which indicates that the pore structure is essentially microporous. Although it has a huge surface area, the dominant micropores (<1 nm) and severe pore tortuosity in the micrometer-sized carbon granules will restrict the triiodide ion transport.46,47 The microporous structure may have a detrimental effect on the diffusion and adsorption of I3−, which results in a higher Rct. On the other hand, NGFs are a promising platform since the interconnected graphene units can serve as more efficient electron pathways than activated carbon. Therefore, the NGFs-20 CEs with a unique mesoporous structure and high surface area show better electrocatalytic activity than AC CEs. After comprehensive analysis of the aforementioned results, it is reasonable to consider that the excellent performance of NGFs is mainly attributed to the following reasons. The 3D NGFs with abundant mesopores provide a large specific surface area which can increase the electrode–electrolyte contact area and thus improve the charge transfer kinetically. Besides, the enriched surface edge defects act as efficient active sites which will reduce the Rct and accelerate the I3− reduction, resulting in a high electrocatalytic activity. More interestingly, because of the interpenetrating porous graphene frameworks, the NGFs exhibit excellent electron conductivity, thus leading to efficient charge transfer.

To further examine the improved performance of NGF CEs for DSSCs, EIS measurements have been carried out on the complete DSSC devices (ESI, Fig. S9†). From the high-frequency region in Fig. S9b,† the Rs and Rct of the NGF-based DSSCs are 10.15 Ω cm2 and 0.46 Ω cm2, respectively, whereas the corresponding values of the Pt CE are 10.48 Ω cm2 and 0.69 Ω cm2, respectively. The lower Rct for NGFs suggests high catalytic activity for the reduction of I3−, which could enhance the DSSC performance. In addition, the Rs of a DSSC is generally composed of at least three internal resistances (namely anode, cathode and electrolyte). Considering that the electrolyte and anode resistances will not noticeably change in the DSSCs fabricated under the same conditions, the Rs is thus governed by the cathode resistance. Therefore, the lower Rs of the NGF-based DSSCs in comparison to that of the devices based on Pt can be attributed to the lower resistance of the NGF CEs. Based on the above mentioned results, it can be concluded that the improved performance for the DSSCs with NGF CEs can be explained by the synergistic effects with the lower Rct and Rs.
The electrochemical stability of CE materials is an important parameter that needs to be considered for potential application of DSSCs. For such a study, freshly assembled dummy cells have been first measured with EIS at room temperature, and then the dummy cells are subjected to CV cycles followed by EIS measurements. Fig. 7a and b show the impedance spectra of the fresh and aged dummy cells at open circuit under ambient conditions. Interestingly, there are no noticeable changes in both Rs and ZN for the dummy cells after being subjected to 10 cycles of scanning, suggesting that the cycling potential exerts trivial influence on the series resistance and the mass transport in the redox electrolyte solution. As shown in Fig. 7c, the Rct for the freshly assembled NGF CEs is initially 3.61 Ω cm2, and the value slightly increased to 3.96 Ω cm2 in the final cycle. However, for the Pt dummy cells, the Rct value is 3.70 Ω cm2 in the first cycle, but it is gradually increased up to 5.39 Ω cm2 in the final cycle. A similar deactivation effect has been previously reported for the Pt CE in the I−/I3− redox couple, where it is ascribed to the poisoning of the Pt catalyst.48,49 Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that NGF CEs in a I−/I3− medium have better electrochemical stability under prolonged cycling potential than Pt CEs.

The sequence of measurements is as follows: 2 × CV scans (from 0 V → 1 V → −1 V → 0 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1) followed by 30 s relaxation at 0 V and then EIS measurement is performed at 0 V from 105 to 0.1 Hz. This sequential electrochemical test is repeated 10 times. (c) Rct changes of the Pt and NGF CEs versus the EIS scan number. 
Conclusions
In summary, 3D graphene frameworks are prepared via an MgO-templated CVD approach. The 3D NGF structure possesses a high surface curvature, leading to a large fraction of exposed edge sites as well as a high surface area and tunnelling effect for facile electrolyte infiltration into the mesopores. Besides, the continuous NGF blocks endow it with excellent conductivity for facile electron transfer. Owing to these unique features of NGFs, when being applied as CEs for DSSCs, a higher PCE of 7.32% can be achieved, which is comparable to that with Pt CEs (7.28%). More importantly, the NGF CEs display better electrochemical stability than the Pt CEs. Our present results indicate that the NGFs are low-cost metal-free electrocatalysts that can be used as a promising candidate for the replacement of expensive and scarce Pt CEs in DSSCs. Additionally, the electrocatalytic behavior of NGF electrodes in the present study provides wide promising opportunities for other applications, such as hydrogen evolution reaction, electrochemical sensors, and oxygen reduction reaction.
