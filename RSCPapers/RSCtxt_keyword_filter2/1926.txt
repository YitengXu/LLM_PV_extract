    , Accepted 8th August 2019First published on 9th August 2019AbstractBy using the state-of-the-art theoretical method, we herein explore the potentiality of covalently linked periodically-ordered 1D chain, 2D hexagonal and square ordered superstructures of CdTe QDs in photovoltaics. One of the major factors that controls the photovoltaic efficiency is the electron–hole recombination which in turn depends on the spatial separation of these charge carriers. Our theoretical findings show that the HOMO and LUMO states are localized at two different ends of the assembled superstructures. This result indicates large spatial separation of photoexcited charge carriers which prolongs the carrier lifetime and thus reduces the chance of electron–hole recombination. We have also attached an acceptor fullerene molecule with the CdTe QD superstructure and studied the electronic structure of the composite system. The photoexcited electrons of the assembled QDs potentially transfer to the low energy lying conduction band of fullerene and show a large spatial charge separation. The assembled QD–fullerene composites exhibit a high photoconversion efficiency of 19.3%, opening up new possibilities for designing efficient solar energy harvesting devices based on assembled QDs.
1. Introduction
The conversion of the most important renewable energy, solar energy, to electricity is currently a topic of great interest to researchers concerned about the depletion of fossil fuel resources and global warming issues. Although initial efforts were predominantly focused on dye-sensitized or Grätzel-type solar cells, in the recent past, quantum dots (QDs) of group II–VI, III–V and IV–VI semiconductors have emerged as promising building blocks for photovoltaic applications.1–4 The tunability of electronic energy levels by varying the size, shape and composition of the QDs allows more flexibility in designing QD-based devices.5–11 Multiexciton generation (MEG) in QDs increases the efficiency of QD-sensitized solar cells.12–14 Owing to their ease of synthesis using colloidal solution processability and being inexpensive abundant materials, QD-based solar cells have attracted remarkable research interest and provide a viable route for delivering high efficiency devices.
By a self-assembly process, colloidal QDs can periodically be ordered into one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) superlattices, driven by dipole–dipole, van der Waals, hydrophobic, electrostatic and covalent interactions. The assembled QDs have the potential to show various functionalities and can be used in photodetectors,15 catalysis,16,17 photocatalysts,18,19 field-effect transistors and circuitry,20–23 biosensors,24 light-emitting diodes,25 solar cells26–30 and thermoelectric devices.31 The QD superlattices have a combined advantage of size tunable quantum confined electronic energy levels along with efficient charge transfer32–34 and lead to a record breaking performance of these systems. Experimental studies have shown that the carrier mobility of electrons in QD superlattices increases by many orders of magnitude as compared to single QDs and the lifetimes of mobile electrons are much longer than those of excitons and finally can achieve high photoconversion efficiency.35–38
Among different semiconductor nanoparticles, CdTe nanoparticles have drawn great attention due to their versatile applications from biological labelling to third generation solar cells.39–46 In 2002, Tang et al.47 for the first time showed that thioglycolic acid (TGA) capped CdTe QDs are spontaneously assembled into highly luminescent nanowires, driven by strong dipole–dipole interactions. Subsequently, there are several articles of self-assembled CdTe QD linear chains,48 nanowires,49–51 nanotubes,52 and nanoribbons,53,54 governed by electrostatic, van der Waals, and dipole–dipole interactions. In 2006, Tang et al.55 and Zhang et al.56 first observed that 2-(dimethylamino) ethanethiol capped CdTe QDs are assembled into 2D hexagonal sheets, driven by electrostatic interactions. Very recently, researchers have shown that thiol capped CdTe QDs have been assembled into 3D superlattices too.57–60
The growth of self-assembled nanostructures is also assisted by mixing different ligand capped QDs. The simultaneous presence of TGA and cysteine (or cysteamine) ligands lead to the formation of highly luminescent CdTe QD nanorods, driven by both electrostatic and covalent interactions.61,62 In another recent work, Zhang et al.63 have observed that the presence of both TGA and 1-thioglycerol (or cysteamine) ligands lead to a stable 1D CdTe QD nanostructure. Deng et al.64 have shown that the mixed ligand systems are assembled into 1D, 2D and 3D networks. Very recently, Evers et al.65 and Baumgardner et al.32 have experimentally observed that, by controlling the temperature and other reaction conditions, one may obtain 1D chains or 2D QD superlattices, the latter with hexagonal or square ordered superstructures.
Although there are many experimental studies devoted to the fabrication of CdTe QD superlattices, theoretical studies addressing the detailed electronic structure of such systems are still lacking in the literature. For real world wide-range applications of the QD superlattices, understanding of the electronic structure of these systems is of paramount importance. In this article, we present a systematic study on the detailed electronic structures of periodically-ordered covalently linked finite 1D linear chain, 2D hexagonal and square ordered superstructures of CdTe QDs. Our objective is to gain in-depth qualitative understanding of the photogenerated charge generation, separation and recombination dynamics to explore their applicability in photovoltaic devices. It is well known that fullerene and its derivative phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) are good acceptor molecules because they have low electron transfer reorganisation energy due to delocalized π-conjugated electronic structures.66–69 Hybrid solar cells comprising an inorganic CdTe QD as a sensitizer and an organic PCBM component as an acceptor are well studied.70,71 We have herein studied the CdTe QD assembled superstructure–fullerene hybrid nanocomposites to understand the efficiency of this new nanohybrid as an efficient solar energy harvester.
2. Details of computation
We have employed the self-consistent-charge density-functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) method to study the electronic structure of one and two dimensional CdTe QD assembled structures. The SCC-DFTB method is a parametrized density functional method and is discussed in detail elsewhere.72–75 This method makes a compromise between reasonable accuracy and computational cost and therefore can be used to study a system containing a large number of atoms. We have provided a detailed discussion on the SCC-DFTB method in the ESI.† In one of our previous studies, the accuracy of the SCC-DFTB parameter set for Cd–X (X = S, Se, Te) and their interactions with several different systems such as H, C, N, and O have already been established.76 Using this parameter set we have herein studied the electronic structure of the CdTe QD assembly. All the SCC-DFTB calculations are performed using the DFTB+ program package.77 For geometry optimizations, we have used the conjugate gradient algorithm with a force tolerence of 0.0005 eV Å−1.
We have herein chosen four different thiol-capped stoichiometric CdnTen quantum dots (n = 17, 34, 65, and 98) for the zinc blende structure. The radii of these QDs are 0.91, 1.08, 1.28, and 1.45 nm, respectively. In this context, we would like to mention that there are several previous experimental and theoretical studies on both stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric CdTe clusters along with the effect of stoichiometry on their stabilities and electronic properties.78–82 We have studied only the stoichiometric ones. Chaban et al. in a recent study on a CdSe–fullerene composite system have shown that the photoconversion efficiency increases by 2–3 orders of magnitude in covalently linked systems as compared to non-interacting composite systems.83 So, we have studied a covalently linked QD assembly. We have modeled the QD assembled structures where the QDs are connected to each other through amide linkage. Therefore, two different sets of bifunctional capping ligands are used such as –S–(CH2)4–H2 (4-mercaptobutyl amine) and –S–(CH2)4–COOH (5-mercaptovaleric acid). All the surface Cd atoms of QDs are passivated by thiol groups (–SH) except those which are functionalized by bifunctional ligands where the thiol groups at one end are used to passivate the surface Cd atoms of CdTe QDs whereas the acid and amine groups at another end are used to connect the QDs through amide (–CONH–) linkage by elimination of H2O. And finally all the surface Te atoms are passivated by H atoms. The QD–QD distance in the QD assembly is about 14.78 Å. This QD–QD distance in the QD-assembly is close to the length of capping linker molecules and the same for all sizes of QDs. It is worth mentioning here that we have also studied the QD-assembly where the QDs are connected through ester linkage and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. S1–S3 and Tables S1, S2 of the ESI.† We obtained a similar conclusion to that found in the amide linked QD assembly.
We have herein considered periodically ordered 1D linear chain, 2D hexagonal and square ordered assembled structures of different sizes by varying the number of QDs. We have modeled the following different systems: (i) 1D linear assembled structures of five different sizes containing two, three, four, five, and six QDs, respectively, (ii) 2D hexagonal ordered structures of two different sizes containing seven and sixteen QDs, respectively, and finally (iii) 2D square ordered structures of two different sizes containing four and sixteen QDs, respectively. It is worth mentioning here that, to study the hexagonal and square ordered assembly, we have first modeled the hexagonal and square ordered structures containing seven and four QDs, respectively. We then increase the number of QDs to get larger sized assembled structures. The representative optimized structures of amide linked 1D linear chain, 2D hexagonal and square ordered superstructures for one representative CdTe QD (Cd17Te17 QD) are shown in Fig. 1.

3. Results and discussion
The efficiency of photovoltaic devices strongly depends on their light harvesting properties as well as spatial charge separation which in turn reduces the electron–hole recombination process or prolongs the carrier lifetime. In the present study, to achieve the maximum photoconversion efficiency in CdTe QD assembly systems, we have considered three different strategies: (i) the first one is increasing the size of the assembled superstructure, (ii) the second one is increasing the size of the parent QD in the assembly, and (iii) finally, through covalent linking of the assembled CdTe QD with a fullerene acceptor.
Let us first discuss the highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO–LUMO) gap of CdTe (Cd17Te17, Cd34Te34, Cd65Te65 and Cd98Te98) QD-assembly systems. The band gap values of a single QD and an amide linked 1D assembly containing different numbers of QDs and also of different sizes are shown in Table 1, while that of the 2D assembly is shown in Table 2. The calculated HOMO–LUMO band gaps of a single CdnTen (n = 17, 34, 65, and 98) QD are in line with the experimental band gap values obtained from UV-vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry studies by Haram et al.84 A comparison of the calculated HOMO–LUMO energy levels and consequent band gaps with the experimental studies84 are shown in Table S3 of the ESI.† It is worthwhile to mention that, as the size of the QD studied by us did not exactly match with those of the experiment, a direct comparison is not possible. However, the range of band gap values is in close proximity to that of the experimental values. From Tables 1 and 2, it is seen that the band gap value decreases in the assembled QD as compared to the isolated single QD. The decrease in band gap in going from the individual QD to the assembly is in good agreement with the experimental studies.33,47–49,62 The charge transfer interactions between the quantum dots results in a reduced band gap in the assembled QD as compared to the single QD. Furthermore, we have calculated the absorbance spectra using the time-dependent density-functional tight-binding response theory.74 The absorption spectra for a particular size of CdTe QD (Cd17Te17 QD) and its amide linked assembly having different numbers of QDs are shown in Fig. 2. The figure shows that the effective absorption range of the studied assembled systems for different system sizes is basically the same. However, from Fig. 2, we see that there is a remarkable strong absorption over a broad range in the UV-visible region.

In our studied covalently linked assembled QDs (Fig. 1), the QDs are linked through amide linkages (⋯–QD–CONH–QD–CONH–QD–CONH–QD–⋯). The polarized molecular linking is the source of internal electric field along the chains. In recent years, Sobolewski et al.85 and Jankowska et al.86 have studied the polarized molecular assemblies for photovoltaic applications. They have shown that the polarization induced internal electric field in the molecular assembly can overcome the coulomb interaction of the exciton and dissociate the photogenerated electron–hole pairs and drive them to opposite ends of molecularly assembled structures and thus make them potential candidates for photovoltaic applications. This type of phenomenon is quite different from the conventional photovoltaic effect in p–n junction semiconductors. In p–n junction based photovoltaic cells, the internal electric field is only present within the depletion layer at the interface and the photogenerated charge carriers are swept out of the depletion region and diffuse to the cathode or anode. The transport of charge carriers in p–n junction devices is limited by diffusion. In contrast, in polarized ferroelectric materials, a permanent dipole moment and polarization induced electric field are present over the whole system, rather than just in the interfacial layer. In this case, the diffusion of charge carriers is not limited by any energy barrier at the interfacial junction. The electron and hole transfer processes in polarized ferroelectric semiconductors are shown in Scheme 1.

Once the system is exposed to sunlight, different excitations occur and electron and hole pairs are created. The calculated transition energies with oscillator strengths and the involved molecular orbitals of the assembled QD for a particular QD (Cd17Te17 QD) for the lowest 40 singlet excited states are listed in Tables S4 and S5 of the ESI.† From this table, we can see that there may be transitions other than HOMO to LUMO such as HOMO−1 to LUMO, HOMO to LUMO+1, etc. Among these transitions, the oscillator strength of some transitions may be small and for some transitions it may be large. A closer inspection of the spatial localization of the frontier orbitals such as HOMO−n and LUMO+n with n being 0, 1, 2,…, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S4 of the ESI,† reveals that the HOMOs and LUMOs are localized on particular QDs of the assembled superstructures. Due to the localization of the orbitals, photoexcitation occurs at a particular QD. The energies of these HOMOs and LUMOs are plotted in Fig. 4. The monotonic change of occupied and unoccupied orbitals localized on subsequent QDs creates an internal electric field. This electric field facilitates the dissociation of photogenerated charge carriers. Due to this electric potential gradient, orbitals having a higher (lower) energy than the LUMO (HOMO) are enriched with electrons (holes) and are ultimately transferred and localized on the LUMO (HOMO). The interaction of HOMOs and LUMOs localized on adjacent QDs provides a force to the holes and electrons for their conduction toward the terminal HOMO and LUMO, respectively. The force is unidirectional and the energy gradient for hole and electron charge carriers is in the opposite direction (Fig. 4). Noteworthily, the electric driving force governed by the energy difference between the terminal occupied and unoccupied orbitals (HOMO–LUMO band gap) saturates at a constant value with an increase in the size of the assembled system for a fixed size of parent QD (Table 1). A similar type of phenomenon for a molecularly assembled cluster has already been reported by Sobolewski et al.85 Actually, when the number of QDs increases in the assembly, the change in energy of occupied orbitals and unoccupied orbitals with the size of the assembled system is small (Fig. 4) due to which the band gap saturates at a constant value.

H stand for HOMO and L stand for LUMO. 
The internal electric field which overcomes the coulomb interaction of electron–hole pairs and governs the photoinduced charge separation is directly connected to the polarity of the system which is measured by the dipole moment of the system.85,86 We performed Mulliken population analysis to see the charge population on each QD and the charge population of each QD in assembled superstructures is shown in Fig. 5. We see that the assembled QD is strongly polarized. The HOMO state is electron populated and the LUMO state is electron depleted along with only minor contributions to other QDs. The dipole moment values along the chain of the assembled QD are shown in Table 3. The table shows that our studied systems are strongly polarized with high dipole moments and the average dipole moment increases with increasing the size of the assembled QD. Noteworthily, after a certain assembled superstructure size, the increase in the average dipole moment is small. Moreover, the collective polarity of the assembled QD may provide an important factor for separating the photoexcited charge carriers.

We have studied amide linked assembled QD superstructures where the amide linkages are orderly aligned (⋯–QD–CONH–QD–CONH–QD–CONH–QD–⋯). Another possibility may arise when the QDs are linked as ⋯–QD–CONH–QD–NHCO–QD–CONH–QD–⋯ (see Fig. S5 of the ESI†). Notably, in this type of assembly, the amide linkages (–CONH–) are not orderly aligned unlike the previous ones we have studied. So, a natural question that arises is whether the dipole moment of this type of assembly is robust or not? Our results show reduced dipole moments as compared to the previous ones (Tables S6 and S7 of the ESI†). So, the dipole moment is dependent on the orientation of the amide linkage. Therefore, the insight obtained in this study suggests experimentalists to fabricate an amide linked QD-assembly where the amide linkages (–CONH–) are orderly aligned and exhibit large dipole moments because the internal electric field, which facilitates photogenerated exciton dissociation and drives electrons and holes in opposite directions toward the cathode and anode, respectively, is dependent on the dipole moment of the system.
Therefore, from Fig. 3 and Fig. S4 of the ESI,† we can see that the HOMO and LUMO states are located on two opposite ends of the assembled structures. This remains true irrespective of the size of the assembled structure, dimensionality (whether it is 1D chain or 2D hexagonal or square ordered) and the size of the parent QD as shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. S6 of the ESI.† The understanding of spatial localization of the frontier orbitals gives a qualitative idea about the recombination dynamics of photoexcited charge carriers. The large separation of HOMO and LUMO states drastically hinders electron–hole recombination and leads to longer carrier lifetimes. The carrier lifetime increases when the assembled superstructure size increases. Our theoretical findings are in line with the experimental observation of Talgorn et al.35 where authors have observed that the lifetime of mobile charge carriers in a QD assembly is larger than the exciton radiative lifetime of 17 nanoseconds. Thus, these systems when coupled to a suitable acceptor will be much more promising for application in solar cells.

As we have already discussed that the fullerene molecule acts as a good acceptor, we attached a fullerene molecule to the CdTe QD assembly. Mikroyannidis et al.87 have observed that hydrolysis of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) to carboxylic acid (PCBA) makes it more soluble in organic solvents. We therefore attached the QD (where LUMO state of assembly is localized) to the –COOH group end of PCBA through an amide linkage (Fig. 7). In the CdTe QD assembly–PCBA hybrid composite, the contribution of PCBA to light absorption is very small whereas the CdTe QD assembly generates a large number of excitons upon incident light. As PCBA has a low energy lying LUMO level, the photoexcited electrons of the CdTe QD assembly potentially transfer to the PCBA and show distinct charge separation, which is reflected from the HOMO–LUMO charge densities and projected density of states (PDOS) as shown in Fig. 7 and 8, respectively, where the LUMO resides on PCBA and the HOMO resides on the CdTe QD. For a single QD–fullerene composite, the LUMO (localized on fullerene) and HOMO (localized on QD) are located as neighbors as shown in Fig. 7a but for QD assembly–fullerene composites, the spatial charge separation increases with increasing system size as shown in Fig. 7b and c. This large spatial charge separation in the assembled QD–fullerene composite causes a drastic reduction of the electron–hole recombination rate and prolongs the carrier lifetime. This result shows that assembled QD–fullerene composites are more appealing for solar energy harvesting devices as compared to the single QD–fullerene composite system. It is a well known phenomenon that electron injection from the donor to acceptor increases the exciton dissociation efficiency and thereby the photovoltaic performance.88 To get an idea about the potential use of such hybrid systems in photovoltaic devices, we estimate the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) defined as89–91 (1)where Jsc, Voc, βFF, and Psolar are the short circuit current, the open-circuit voltage, the fill factor, and the incident solar flux, respectively. Here, 0.65 is the fill-factor,89,90Eg (in eV) is the band gap of the donor, ΔEc (in eV) is the energy difference of the donor and acceptor LUMO and 0.3 eV is an empirical factor for energy conversion kinetics. P(ħω)92 (expressed in W m−2 eV−1) is the solar energy flux at photon energy ħω. The (Eg − ΔEc − 0.3) term is the maximum open circuit voltage (expressed in eV) and the integral in the numerator is the short circuit current, Jsc, calculated using a limit of external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 100%. The Psolar in the denominator is the integrated AM 1.5 solar energy flux, which amounts to 1000 W m−2.89,90 Note that the PCE value depends on Eg and ΔEc. Using the above formula we have calculated the PCE of CdTe QD assembly–fullerene hybrid systems for three different sized QDs (Cd34Te34, Cd65Te65 and Cd98Te98). As the change in HOMO–LUMO energy levels and the respective band gap values of assembled superstructures with the number of QDs are very small (see Table 1), we have calculated the photoconversion efficiency of one representative composite system [CdTe QD assembly (containing four QDs)–fullerene hybrid]. The donor band gap (Eg) and energy offsets between the donor and acceptor LUMO (ΔEc) of QD assembly–fullerene hybrid composites for three different sized QDs [Cd34Te34, Cd65Te65 and Cd98Te98] are shown in the inset of Fig. 8a–c, respectively. It should be noticed that, when the CdTe QD assembly is covalently linked with the fullerene acceptor the band gap is slightly changed for the QD assembly due to the interaction with fullerene. Our calculations show that Cd34Te34, Cd65Te65 and the Cd98Te98 QD assembly–fullerene hybrid composites achieve photoconversion efficiencies as high as 8.64%, 13.2% and 19.3%, respectively. The smaller band gap of the Cd98Te98 QD assembly enables absorption of visible light of longer wavelength and thus Jsc increases and finally, the photoconversion efficiency increases. The large PCE value of CdTe QD assembly–fullerene composites makes it competitive with recently proposed inorganic–organic hybrid solar cells such as PCBM/CBN heterojunction (10–20%),89 porphyrin/phosphorene antidot lattice nanocomposite (13.5%)93 and phosphorene/MoS2 (16–18%),94 phosphorene/ZrS2 (12%)95 heterostructure solar cells.

The zero energy is set at the top of the HOMO as indicated by the vertical dashed black line. The inset shows the band gap of the donor and the energy offset between the donor and acceptor LUMO. 
It is worthwhile to mention here that eqn (1) depicts the maximum PCE of a pair of donor–acceptor system, for our QD assembly–fullerene composite where the QD assembly acts as a donor and fullerene act as an acceptor. Eqn (1) basically depends on the donor band gap and energy offset between the donor and acceptor LUMO. However, eqn (1) does not take into account the effect of the large spatial separation which increases with the assembled system size. The large spatial charge separation reduces the electron–hole recombination drastically. The electron–hole recombination has a great role in controlling the efficiency. In the composite system [assembled CdTe QD–fullerene], the electron of the donor [assembled QD] after getting photoexcited reaches the LUMO and then from this LUMO to the LUMO of the acceptor [fullerene] molecule. Now, as the LUMO of the assembled QD as well as the LUMO of the assembled QD–fullerene composites are largely separated from their position of the HOMO the chance of electron–hole recombination is less. As the spatial separation of the LUMO of both assembled QD and assembled QD–fullerene hybrid and HOMOs increases with increasing size of the assembled QD, the chance of electron–hole recombination is lower. Thus, from this spatial charge separation (which increases with system size), we qualitatively argued that, for the assembled QD–fullerene composite because of the large spatial charge separation, the electron–hole recombination dynamics will be slow and results in longer carrier lifetimes. Therefore, we strongly believe that the CdTe QD assembly–fullerene hybrid composite we proposed is a new entity in the realm of photovoltaic devices and thus deserves great attention for the design of efficient solar energy harvesting devices.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we have studied detailed electronic structures of covalently linked periodically-ordered finite 1D linear, 2D hexagonal and square ordered CdTe QD superstructures to understand the suitability of their potential application in photovoltaic devices. The efficiency of photovoltaic devices depends on their light harvesting properties as well as the spatial separation of photoexcited electrons and hole charge carriers which reduces the electron–hole recombination and prolongs the carrier lifetime. Our results show that the HOMO and LUMO states are localized at two different ends of the assembled superstructures irrespective of the size of the parent QD. This result indicates a large spatial charge separation of photoexcited electrons and hole pairs which causes a longer carrier lifetime. We also studied the electronic structure of CdTe QD assembly–fullerene nanohybrids. In assembled CdTe QD–fullerene hybrid nanocomposites, the photoexcited electrons of the QD assembly potentially transfer to the low energy lying LUMO of fullerene, thereby showing distinct charge separation. We found that the separation of the HOMO (localized on the QD) and LUMO (localized on fullerene) states increases upon increasing the size of the assembled QD, promising a novel feature to reduce the electron–hole recombination effectively by increasing the assembled structure size. This result shows that assembled QD–fullerene composites are more appealing for photovoltaic devices as compared to a single QD–fullerene composite system. Our study reveals that such assembled QD–fullerene inorganic–organic hybrid composites exhibit a high photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of about 19.3% which makes them competitive with other inorganic–organic hybrid and two-dimensional heterojunction solar cells. The seminal concept in the present study may open up a new avenue for designing efficient solar energy harvesting devices based on assembled QDs (assembly of nanocrystals of group II–VI, III–V and IV–VI semiconductors).
