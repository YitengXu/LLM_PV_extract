    , Accepted 27th July 2021First published on 27th July 2021AbstractNowadays, overcoming the stability issue of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) while retaining high efficiency has become an urgent need for the future of this technology. By using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and introducing solvent profile evolution monitoring by the glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GD-OES) technique, we have highlighted the effect of potassium chloride and ammonium chloride additives on the formation mechanism of Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 films upon annealing. Two formation steps are distinguished: first, the superficial residual solvent is eliminated; second, the solvent in the depth of the film is evaporated. The elimination profile depicts the final morphology of the layer. The downward (top-down) growth has been encountered for the pristine and potassium chloride additive cases. It led to the formation of multiple boundaries and middle-sized grain morphology. We unveil that employing both potassium chloride and ammonium chloride additives forces the homogeneous elimination of the solvent across the layer, and thus the lateral growth of the grains. It resulted in large size, monolithic and defect-poor grains with good coverage of the substrate which are the targeted properties for high efficiency. By combining this approach with the film surface treatment with n-propylammonium iodide (PAI), further performance and stability increases have been achieved. It resulted in a stabilized power conversion efficiency over 21%. These PSCs are also proven to be highly resistant to external stressors such as light, moisture, and temperature.
1. Introduction
Photovoltaic (PV) solar cells still need to be improved for cost-effectiveness, saving of raw material and gain in pay-back energy consumption. Beyond the now mature silicon technologies, solid-state halide perovskite (PVK) solar cells (PSCs) have emerged during the last few years as a possible alternative or complementary PV technology.1–9 Single junction PSCs have achieved the present 25.5% record power conversion efficiency (PCE)10 which is the best among the thin film technologies and approaches that of the best single crystalline silicon ones. However, the vast deployment of PSCs still needs a significant improvement in their stability since classical PVKs are sensitive notably to moisture, oxygen and heat, while efficiency must be kept high. Most of these agents initiate degradation of PVK films at the grain boundaries.
A great strength of PSCs is that the perovskite functional layer is prepared at mild temperature (≤160 °C) from perovskite precursor solutions (PPSs). The chemistry of these solutions is key for the final properties of the absorber film and PPSs must be formulated with care to optimize the final PV properties of the films. They contain two kinds of important component for the final PSC performance, (i) those which will form the film and will define the final composition of the layer, and (ii) those that help the synthesis of the film and are eliminated upon the final annealing step. They are dissolved in polar aprotic organic solvents. By working on this chemistry and on the crystallization control, the device performance, as well as the material thin film stability, can be dramatically increased, not only by reaching the intrinsic entropic stabilization, but also by enhancing the crystallinity, suppressing defect formation, and stabilizing grain boundaries. Additives have a key role in the film formation which remains to be deeply understood. In particular, synergistic effects, which can arise when two additives are combined in the PPS, are intriguing and promising for the future of PSC technology. They allow the realization of the target film properties which are full coverage, absence of pinholes, and good crystallization of films composed of large grains. These characteristics are reached by finely controlling the nucleation and growth of the perovskite grains forming the film during the annealing treatment.11,12 At this stage, the amount of grain boundaries as well as the structural and grain boundary defects such as Frenkel ones13 must be drastically limited.14–16
The present paper focuses on the simple Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 perovskite. From the point of view of the composition, methylammonium (MA+)-free PVKs are desirable since MA+ can decompose with heating, outgases with time and is hygroscopic while this composition must also avoid halide mixtures which can be at the origin of phase separation.17–28 We show that the use of ammonium chloride and potassium chloride mixed PPS additives controls the crystallization and leads to the desirable lateral growth of the perovskite films. Their mixture allows the formation of an initial yellow translucent layer after a one-step spin-coating with dripping chlorobenzene antisolvent. This layer contains Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 in a δ-phase and, also, in the α-phase in a significant amount combined with wetting solvent. By using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and introducing solvent profile evolution monitoring by the glow discharge-optical emission spectroscopy (GD-OES) technique, we unveil the formation mechanism of the films upon annealing. Two formation phases are distinguished: first, the superficial residual solvent is eliminated, prior to the solvent in the depth of the film. The elimination profile depicts the final morphology of the layer. We show that when the chloride mixture is employed, the solvent is homogeneously eliminated across the layer, leading to the lateral growth of the grains. It results in large, monolithic and defect-poor grains with good coverage of the substrate. By combining this approach with the film surface treatment with n-propylammonium iodide (PAI), further performance and stability increases have been achieved. It resulted in a best stabilized PCE of 21.03%, which is among the best for methylammonium-free PSCs (see Table S1, ESI†). These PSCs are proven to be highly resistant to external stressors such as light, moisture, and temperature.
2. Experimental
The preparation of the fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) substrates, deposition of the 20 nm thick compact TiO2 layer (c-TiO2) by spray pyrolysis and the preparation of the 120 nm thick nanoparticle-based mesoporous TiO2 layer by spin coating were performed as in our previous studies.7,29
The basic protocol of Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 perovskite layer preparation was first to mix 156 mg of formamidinium iodide (FAI, Greatcell), 461 mg of lead iodide (PbI2, TCI), and 26 mg cesium iodide (CsI, TCI) in a 900 μL/100 μL anhydrous DMF and DMSO solvent mixture. 45 μL of this solution was deposited on top of the substrate and the sample was first spun at 1000 rpm for 10 s and then at 4000 rpm for 20 s. The sample was treated by dripping 100 μL of anhydrous chlorobenzene 15 s to 20 s after the starting of the spinning routine. The film was finally annealed on a hotplate for 20 min at 155 °C. For the AC film and KC film preparations, the procedure was the same except that 15 mg of NH4Cl and 6.7 mg of KCl, respectively, were added to the perovskite precursor solution. For the mixed-additive AKC film, the protocol was the same except that 15 mg of NH4Cl and 3.7 mg of KCl were added to the perovskite precursor solution. Full details on the PVK syntheses are provided in Section F of the ESI.† The perovskite film thicknesses ranged between 360 nm and 400 nm in addition to the PVK filling the mesoporous TiO2 layer.

n-Propylammonium iodide (or propylamine hydroiodide, CH3CH2CH2NH3I), denoted as PAI, has been used in a few papers for the preparation of 2D/3D perovskite.30,31 It remains unexplored for the surface treatment of the perovskite layer since, to our knowledge, only Li et al.19 report a PAI treatment to form an interfacial capping layer. In our work, 4 mg of PAI was dissolved in 1 mL isopropyl alcohol (IPA). 60 μL of this solution was deposited on the cooled perovskite film. The spin-coating program was run just after the solution deposition (2000 rpm s−1 acceleration, 3000 rpm for 20 s). The 200 nm thick hole transporting material (HTM) layer was prepared as described in the ESI.†32 The device was completed by a gold back contact with a thickness of 70–80 nm deposited by thermal evaporation.
The XRD patterns were measured using a PANalytical X'Pert high-resolution X-ray diffractometer (XRD) operated at 40 kV and 45 mA and using CuKα radiation with λ = 1.5406 Å. The morphology of perovskite thin films was observed using field-emission SEM equipment (Zeiss Supra 40) in the in-lens mode. The EDX mapping spectra were measured with a Quantax system from Compact 30 mm Bruker operated at 15 kV. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves were measured on precipitated sample adducts using a DSC 3 apparatus from STAR System, operated under a N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The solar cell was mounted on an O-ring at one side of the plasma chamber and was used as a cathode. The film's specular absorbance was measured using a Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. A glass/FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2 sample was employed for the baseline. The photoluminescence spectra were measured using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) curves were measured under a microscope (numerical aperture 0.7). The perovskites layers were spin-coated onto a glass/FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2 substrate. The top of the PVK layers was excited by a 470 nm diode laser (Picoquant) and the emission was filtered by a 488 nm longpass filter. It was analyzed for time-resolved photoluminescence decay using a PerkinElmer SPCM avalanche photodiode combined with a Picoharp acquisition card (500 ps characteristic time of the total system response function) used with the laser in a pulsed mode at a 10 nW excitation power (pulse duration 70 ps).
Up to now, the GD-OES technique has been employed only in a few papers in connection with PSC half cells33 and full cells.25,34–36 GD-OES experiments consisted in directly Ar-sputtering the devices to detect the optical emission of the elements etched and released from the various layers. It allowed the depth-profile distribution of the solar cell constituent elements to be obtained. Moreover, by doing GD-OES profiling, before and after polarization, the profile change of iodide distribution due to migration has been disclosed.25,35 Our GD-OES analyses were performed using HORIBA Jobin Yvon GD Profiler 2 equipment. This instrument was equipped with a RF-generator (at 13.56 MHz), a standard HORIBA Jobin Yvon glow discharge source with a cylindrical anode of 4 mm internal diameter and two optical spectrometers (a polychromator and a monochromator) for fast optical detection. The Ar plasma was generated at an Ar pressure of 420 Pa and an applied power of 17 W.
The solar cell J–V curves were recorded using a Keithley 2410 digital sourcemeter, using a 0.1 V s−1 voltage scan rate. The solar cells were illuminated with a solar simulator (Abet Technology Sun 2000) filtered to mimic AM 1.5 G conditions (100 mW cm−2). The illuminated surface was delimited by a black mask with an aperture diameter of 3 mm. The power density was calibrated at 100 mW cm−2 by the use of a reference silicon solar cell. For the statistical analysis, a minimum of 15 cells for each condition were investigated and the results are provided in the ESI.† The EQE spectra were measured with an Oriel Instruments QuantX-300 system.
3. Results and discussion

Table 1 summarizes the effect of employing chloride additives for the preparation of Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 perovskite films on the performances of solar cells with the configuration of compact TiO2 (c-TiO2)/mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2)/perovskite/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N′-di-4-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD)/Au as schematized in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The pristine cells (layers and cells hereinafter denoted as Ref) exhibited poor performances with a PCE of 16.2% in the reverse scan (Fig. 1a) and a large hysteresis. Using an optimized 30 mol% amount of NH4Cl additive in the PPS (see Annex A of the ESI†) resulted in a best PCE of 19.3% with a quite large hysteresis index (HI) of 18% (Table 1) (layers and cells hereinafter denoted as AC). KCl as a chloride additive was then investigated and the detailed study is reported in Annex B of the ESI.† The best improvement was achieved for a KCl content at 9 mol% of molar PbI2 content in the PPS (layers and cells hereinafter denoted as KC). A PCE of 19.1% was achieved with a very low HI of 1% (Table 1). The optimization of NH4Cl/KCl additive mixtures is described in Annex C (ESI†). An optimum for the open circuit voltage (Voc), the short circuit current density (Jsc) and the fill factor (FF) was found for NH4Cl at 30 mol% and KCl at 5 mol%. It resulted in a best PCE measured on the reverse scan above 20% (Table 1 and Fig. 1a). Interestingly, this PCE was better than for the cells prepared with each individual chloride additive (Table 1) and both additives acted synergistically. This best composition has been retained in the rest of the paper and these PSCs and layer are denoted as AKC. The effect of additive on the device performance was confirmed by the average values provided in Table S3 (ESI†) and by measuring the stabilized efficiencies. We found PCEs of 15.69%, 18.71%, 19.00% and 20.02% for Ref, AC, KC and AKC solar cells, respectively (Fig. 1b).

To further improve the device performance, the PVK surface was treated by a solution of n-propylammonium iodide (PAI) in isopropyl alcohol (IPA). The optimization and characterization studies are detailed in Annex D of the ESI.† The 4 mg mL−1 concentration resulted in the best PCE of 21.08% (Table 1 and Fig. 1a). The optimized treated films are denoted as AKC–PAI hereafter. The beneficial effect of KCl additive was preserved since the hysteresis remained negligible with an HI of 3% (Table 1). The significant improvement was confirmed by measuring the steady-state PCE (Fig. 1b) which reached 21.03% for AKC–PAI, a value very close to the one measured on the J–V curve, and gained 1% absolute compared to the untreated AKC cells. Combined scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and absorbance analysis showed that this treatment generates a crystallized low-dimensional capping layer identified as (PA)2FAPb2I7 by XRD (Fig. 1c–e and S11, ESI†). The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) curves of AKC and AKC–PAI samples are displayed in Fig. S13 (ESI†). They have been fitted by a triple exponential function and the results are gathered in Table S5 (ESI†). The fast time constant (τfast) decreased from 1.9 ns to 1.2 ns with the PAI treatment. It shows a fast charge transfer toward the low-dimensional capping layer. The slow time constant (τslow) is related with the perovskite film quality. It increased from 168 ns (Ref) to 551 ns (AKC) upon using the mixed chloride additive. The PAI treatment resulted in a further increase to 570 ns. This gain shows the passivation of defects in the perovskite film near the surface. We measured the Voc of Ref, AKC and AKC–PAI cells under various continuous light power densities (I). A white light source was employed, and the curves are shown in Fig. S14a (ESI†). AKC cells exhibited higher Voc than the Ref one and the PAI-treated cell exhibited the highest Voc throughout the investigated light intensity range. The Voc scaled logarithmically with I and followed the relationship qVoc = Eg + nIDkTln(I/I0)(1)with q the elementary charge, k the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature and nID the ideality factor. nID was determined from the curve fits. It is related to the main recombination phenomena occurring at the Voc.37–40 In classical semiconductor theory, a value of 1 for this parameter indicates a bimolecular recombination of free charges while a value of 2 reflects a monomolecular non-radiative recombination, typically a trap-assisted recombination through mid-gap states.38,40 Deviation of nID from 1 to 2 reflects the increasing occurrence of trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination through perovskite intragap defects.37,38nID was measured at 1.98 for the Ref cell and 1.59 for the AKC cell and it decreased to 1.52 after the PAI treatment. It shows that interfacial recombinations are markedly depleted with the use of the mixed additive. The treatment is also beneficial because the presence of the (PA)2FAPb2I7 layer favors the transfer to the HTM contact and thus lowers recombinations. The beneficial effect of the PAI treatment has also been shown by measuring the dark current of AKC cells. Fig. S14b (ESI†) shows that the PAI treatment markedly reduces the dark current and thus the recombinations occurring in the cells.
Our study highlights the major role of the chloride additives in the final performances of the PSCs which requires a detailed study focusing both on the final layers produced and on the effect of the additives on the film formation mechanism. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the reference layers showed small grains with a mean size of 319 nm and the presence of pinholes (Fig. 2a). The SEM cross-sectional images revealed multiple grain boundaries and the presence of voids at the perovskite/m-TiO2 interface (Fig. S15a, ESI†). The XRD patterns disclosed peaks indexed by the perovskite α-phase (Fig. 1f).41 However, extra peaks indexed by the PbI2 parasitic phase were also present and the moderate peak intensity showed that the crystallinity of the sample was not very high. These features are detrimental for the performances. The PbI2 impurity phase was also detected in the XRD pattern in the AC sample (Fig. 1f and 2p). The most striking effect was that NH4Cl mediates the PVK crystal growth. It resulted in a larger grain size with a mean value of 750 nm (Fig. 2b and e). The films were texturised with the (00l) planes parallel to the substrate and they presented an improved crystallinity (Fig. 1f). The KCl additive provided a battery of beneficial effects: it prevented the formation of pinholes and voids (Fig. 2c) and the formation of PbI2 (Fig. 1f and 2o). The layer was well-covering and was made of a pure Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 photoactive α-phase. However, this additive did not improve the crystallinity and the PVK grains were still small with a mean size measured at about 387 nm (Fig. 2c and e). The mixed additive film (AKC) retained the NH4Cl effect of mediating the formation of large grains with an average size of 935 nm (Fig. 2d and e). The cross-sectional view (Fig. S15d, ESI†) showed vertical grain boundaries and a monolithic structure, which is the desired one for high device efficiency. Moreover, the AKC film's XRD pattern exhibited a high crystallinity as found with the NH4Cl additive (Fig. 1f and 2q). The elemental composition of the various samples was mapped by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (Fig. S16a–d, ESI†). Pb, I and Cs were always detected. In contrast, Cl, present in a large amount as an additive in the AC, KC and AKC PPSs, was not detected in the final films either by EDX or GD-OES (Fig. S16, ESI†). It means that chloride is almost fully eliminated in the annealing step. On the other hand, the K element was present in the layers when KCl was used as an additive and it was distributed homogeneously in the prepared layers.25

Ammonium and potassium chloride additives and their mixture control the perovskite film formation. To better understand the layer crystallization aspects, we compared the XRD patterns of the wet films obtained after spin-coating, after a 5 s annealing time and those resulting from a full thermal annealing treatment. The former patterns are displayed in Fig. 2f–i. They all showed a main diffraction peak at 11.8° assigned to the Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 δ-phase with hexagonal symmetry ((010) diffraction plane) (P63mc space group).41 This phase was more intense when NH4Cl was employed while KCl had no effect on the initial phase. The NH4Cl additive led also to the initial presence of the Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 α-phase as shown by the presence of a peak at about 14° assigned to its (001) reflection. XRD shows that the phase change to the photoactive α-phase occurred quickly, upon the first 5 s of annealing at 155 °C (Fig. 2j–m). We note that this peak was stronger when the α-phase was present originally. It then favored a higher film crystallinity.
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was employed to further understand the effect of Cs, ammonium and chloride ions on the formation of the crystallized perovskite. The curves were measured on the four samples prepared as powder adducts (Fig. 3a–d), completed by a FAPbI3 powder adduct for reference (Fig. S17, ESI†). The first endothermic peak was observed at ∼70–90 °C, assigned to the evaporation of DMSO (DMF was eliminated upon washing the adducts with diethyl ether)42 since DMSO mixed with PbI2 has been shown to start to evaporate at temperatures as low as 75 °C.43 First, a higher peak temperature was found for FAPbI3 (82.7 °C) compared to Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 (78.5 °C). It suggests that the presence of CsI weakens the DMSO bonding. The evaporation temperature did not change significantly with the chloride additives (NH4Cl, KCl or both). For the FAPbI3 sample, an endothermic peak was observed at 101.5 °C which is attributed in the literature to the crystallization of the perovskite yellow δ-phase.43,44 In the case of Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 samples, this peak was not visible. Above 100 °C, an extended endothermic feature was found, assigned to the crystallization/phase change from the precursor to the α-phase perovskite compounds. In the case of FAPbI3, it extended up to 162 °C with a minimum at 153.5 °C. This minimum can be roughly taken as the temperature at which the crystallization and growth steps end and allows a clear comparison between the samples. Adding CsI significantly reduced this temperature at 137.3 °C. Also, a low temperature was found for the KCl additive (minimum at 132.4 °C). Therefore, in both cases (Ref and KC), a fast crystallization and growth occurred. On the other hand, the NH4Cl additive delays and slows down the perovskite crystal growth and it favors the formation of large grains. This effect of NH4Cl was also observed by in situ microscopy in the case of MAPbI3 perovskite by Dai et al.45

The residual solvent elimination is an important occurrence during the film crystallization and growth. To our knowledge, the present work is the first to use the GD-OES technique to follow the depth profile of the solvent leaving by evaporation upon the annealing of a perovskite film. Indeed, the solvent employed is a DMF–DMSO mixture and the S element contained in DMSO can be tracked by this technique. The S element profiles for the various films and various annealing times are presented in Fig. 3e–l. With the increasing sputtering time, deeper and deeper part of the PVK layer is analyzed until reaching the meso-TiO2 layer (dashed black line in Fig. 3e–h). Before annealing, the DMSO profile is asymmetrical in every case, and we observe that the outer part of the film is richer in solvent than the inner part. For the annealing, our results distinguish two stages. The first one occurs during the first 5 seconds of annealing on a hotplate. The initial film changes from translucent yellow to brown. During this stage, most of the superficial residual solvent evaporates and is almost fully eliminated at the uttermost surface while the Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 present in the wet layer is fully transformed into the α-phase (Fig. 2j–m). The Ref sample is the only one for which the inner solvent is not partially eliminated but entrapped during this step. The next stage corresponds to 5 s to 30 s annealing times, when the film becomes dark brown. We observed a clear effect of the additive on the solvent distribution upon annealing. In the case of the Ref sample, DMSO is eliminated fast near the surface while it remains in the deeper part of the layer. The same behavior is observed for the KC sample. For these two films, the grains grow downward, from the top to the bottom. It favors multiple and oblique grain boundaries and rather small perovskite grains are produced. In the presence of AC, the profiles are different. For AC, the S profile is more extended throughout the layer thickness. For the double additives (AKC), the solvent profile decreases uniformly throughout the layer thickness. In this case bulk grain lateral growth occurs, and it results in more homogeneous films with large monolithic grains as shown by SEM (Fig. S15, ESI†). In all cases, the solvent was fully eliminated after 2 min (Fig. S18, ESI†). A striking result of this study is that the additive mixture regulates the homogeneous solvent elimination and thus the growth of the film throughout its depth. It boosts the quality of the film.
When the growth is regulated by the co-additives, the monolithic structure, which is the targeted one for high performances, is achieved. Voids and pinholes are eliminated, the films are more homogeneous, and the density of defects is reduced. The latter is shown by further scrutinizing TRPL measurements (Fig. 3m and n and Annex E, ESI†). τslow was measured at 168 ns for the reference sample and at 243 ns and 254 ns for the AC and KC films, respectively. By mixing both potassium and ammonium chloride, we achieved a remarkable 551 ns value. It demonstrates that very high bulk perovskite quality was achieved then. It is conspicuous that additives reduce the structural defects in the methylammonium-free perovskite.
This study illustrates that grain growth is linked to the solvent elimination from the film and we can distinguish different cases as schematized in Fig. 4. For the Ref sample, the solvent evaporation mainly occurs at the film surface. The film grows downward and multiple-boundary perovskite grains are formed while the solvent in the inner part of the film remains entrapped and is the reason for void formation and the poor m-TiO2/perovskite interface. In the case of the KC sample, the solvent is better eliminated but the film still grows downward, and it is formed of multiple-boundary grains. For double ammonium chloride and potassium chloride additives (AKC samples), the solvent is homogeneously eliminated in the depth of the film which leads to the lateral growth of the grains and results in large monolithic grains with low defect density. It is the targeted morphology for high efficiency. Finally, the AC film formation mechanism is intermediate between that of KC and AKC.

The future of the PSC technology will depend on the ability of scientists to develop devices that are highly resistant to heat, moisture, and light and which can withstand long-term operation. This led us to evaluate the effect of our double engineering approach on the stability toward various degradation agents. First, the stability of unencapsulated cells under one sun illumination was followed by tracking at their maximum power point (MPP). Fig. 5a shows that the Ref cell was poorly stable since its PCE continuously decreased during the test. The stability was markedly increased by using the double chloride additives. Finally, the PAI-treated cell was the most efficient and stable. After a small PCE decrease during the first 70 min, the PCE increased slowly for the next few hours. It suggests some initial interfacial reorganization before stabilization and improvement. If we compare with other perovskites published by the group46 (Fig. S19, ESI†), only the FA0.94MA0.06PbI3 cell exhibited such high stability while the PCE of the MAPbI3 and Cs0.08FA0.80MA0.12Pb(I0.88Br0.12)3 cells continuously decreased.

The insets are pictures of the layers. (e) Normalized PCE evolution of cells stored under ambient conditions and very high humidity (RH ≥ 90%). 
We also implemented accelerated aging tests. The thermal stability was investigated by heating the layers at 130 °C for 4 h in a N2-filled glovebox. The results, disclosed in Fig. S20 (ESI†), show that PbI2 is the heating degradation product of α-Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3. The Ref sample was less stable with a large increase of the PbI2 diffraction peaks. Using the chloride mixed-additives led to films with less initial PbI2, which led to a decrease of the PbI2 formation by heating and thus slowed down the thermal degradation. The capping layer further suppressed the degradation and the AKC–PAI layer was much more stable than the Ref one. After 4 hours, the PVK/PbI2 peak ratio (at 13.9° and 12.7°) was 3.4 for the AKC sample and 4.6 for the AKC–PAI sample. The aging of the layers stored under ambient air (20 °C, 55 ± 10% relative humidity (RH)) was followed by XRD. Fig. 5b–d show that the Ref sample was fully degraded after only 13 days. The degradation product was the δ-phase in this case which is the phase stable at room temperature. The employment of the chloride additives was of great effectiveness since the α-phase was still present after 35 days in the AKC sample even if the δ-phase (010) peak was more intense then than the α-phase (001) one. The interesting point is that the capping layer further increased the stability. After 13 days of aging, the XRD pattern was unchanged. After 35 days, the sample was still black colored and the most intense diffraction peaks were those of the α-phase.
Obtaining PSCs that are highly stable under high moisture is the trickiest issue because PVKs form hydrate compounds in the presence of humidity.47,48 We performed a highly demanding test by following unencapsulated cells aged under a high humidity environment (RH ≥ 90%, the other conditions being ambient) for several days. Fig. 5e presents the normalized PCE of Ref, KC, AC, AKC and AKC–PAI cells. The first very interesting observation is that the KC cell was less stable. On the other hand, obtaining large grains with the NH4Cl additive was beneficial for the stability against humidity. The stability was better when the two chloride additives were mixed. The remarkable result is that coupling the mixed chloride additives and the surface treatment even further improved the stability of the cells. The unencapsulated AKC–PAI cells retained about 80% of their initial PCE after 40 h of aging in this case. This stability result is much better than those we obtained for optimized MA-containing perovskites, namely MAPbI3, Cs0.08FA0.80MA0.12Pb(I0.88Br0.12)3 and FA0.94MA0.06PbI3, published in ref. 46 and presented in Fig. S21 (ESI†). The best of them retained less than 60% of their initial PCE after 40 h of aging. This test, performed under highly demanding conditions, is an accelerated one, and one can expect a much better stability for devices after their ad hoc encapsulation.
4. Conclusions
In summary we have developed a two-step engineering approach for the preparation of MA-free and Br-free Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 perovskite films for PSC application. Introducing mixed NH4Cl and KCl additives into the PPS to assist the PVK formation allowed us to obtain films with outstanding properties. The first, employed at a large mol%, led to a good film coverage, large grains, good crystallinity and reduced structural defects. The second also reduced the structural defects, reduced the PbI2 phase content and suppressed the hysteresis. By combining XRD, SEM, DSC and GD-OES techniques, the effects of the additives on the film formation mechanism and grain growth direction have been unveiled. The initial yellow translucent layer formed by spin-coating contains Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 in the δ-phase and in the α-phase combined with wetting residual solvent. During the first 5 s of annealing, the δ-phase is transformed into the α-phase and the surface solvent is greatly eliminated. Then the profile of the solvent elimination allowed us to understand the final properties of the layers. When the solvent in the deep is difficult to eliminate, the growth occurs downward, and voids at the perovskite/oxide interface, small grains and oblique multiple-grain boundaries are formed. When the elimination speed decreases with the depth without entrapped solvent, the same morphology is obtained without voids. Finally, using both NH4Cl and KCl (and to a lesser extent only NH4Cl) allows an uniform elimination of the solvent and thus the lateral growth of the perovskite grains. It results in vertical grain boundaries along with large, monolithic and defect-poor grains with good coverage of the substrate. Combining the latter type of growth with the film surface treatment with n-propylammonium iodide (PAI) resulted in a record stabilized PCE of 21.03%. Finally, we have proven that the optimized films are highly resistant to external stressors such as electrical stimulation, light, moisture, and temperature and that this resistance is reinforced by the capping interfacial layer.
