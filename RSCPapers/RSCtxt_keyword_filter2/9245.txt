    , Accepted 15th February 2019First published on 16th February 2019AbstractHigh efficiency and performance stability are the two key challenges for polymer solar cells before their commercialization. With the development of high-performance conjugated polymer donors and small-molecule acceptors, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells now reaches 17%. A method that can improve the PCE while keeping the high device stability of polymer solar cells is therefore strongly needed. In this paper, we report the use of piperazine as a molecular dopant in the blends of the well-investigated polymer–fullerene solar cell systems, including P3HT:PC61BM, PTB7-Th:PC61BM and PffBT4T-2OD:PC61BM. The results indicate that both the efficiency and stability of these polymer solar cells are improved simultaneously after such a molecular doping process. The electron mobility of the piperazine-doped P3HT:PC61BM film (1.68 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) was found to be enhanced by almost 10 times in comparison with that of the pristine P3HT:PC61BM film (2.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) by measuring the injection-charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (i-CELIV) in a metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) diode, which is due to the intermolecular electron transfer between piperazine and PC61BM, as confirmed by the dark electron spin resonance (ESR) measurement. In addition, piperazine molecules are able to reduce oxidized P3HT, yielding neutral P3HT, which is considered as the second reason for the performance enhancement. Photon-induced charge transfer between PC61BM and piperazine was confirmed by light electron spin resonance (LESR) measurements. Such a charge transfer process leads to the quenching of PC61BM excitons by piperazine, which decreases the PC61BM dimerization rate and consequently suppresses the “burn-in” degradation of polymer solar cells. The current work provides an effective method that can simultaneously improve the efficiency and stability of polymer–fullerene solar cells.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells are considered to be the next generation of photovoltaic technology owing to their advantages of light weight, flexibility and ease of large-area fabrication.1–4 In the past two decades, tremendous efforts have been made to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells by developing new conjugated polymers and small molecules, and high PCEs of more than 14%5–7 and 17%8 have been reported in the literature for single and tandem junction solar cells, respectively, demonstrating excellent application prospects in the near future. With the achievement of such high PCEs, long-term stability is now the most pertinent obstacle for polymer solar cells before commercialization.4,9,10
Previous work has demonstrated that most of polymer solar cells show fast exponential performance decay, called “burn-in” degradation,11–13 which dominates the overall performance decay of polymer solar cells in the first hundred hours.11 Understanding the “burn-in” degradation mechanism and finding an effective method to suppress such exponential decay is therefore of high importance. Recent results have shown that for amorphous polymer systems, the burn-in degradation is mainly due to the broadening of the density of states (DOS),14 which leads to a fast VOC decay, whereas for crystalline polymer systems, such “burn-in” degradation is mainly due to the formation of fullerene dimers, which leads to fast JSC decay.13,15 Our recent work demonstrated that the “burn-in” degradation process of P3HT:PC61BM cells is external-load-dependent. In other words, such “burn-in” degradation is directly related to the exciton concentration during aging since the external load determines the exciton concentration within the blend film.16 However, a detailed pathway for the formation of PC61BM dimers is not yet clear.
Using a chemical stabilizer that can improve the device stability by blending within the photoactive layer is considered as an effective way to improve device stability. Many attempts have been made in this respect, including oxygen quenchers17,18 and radical quenchers,19 as well as cross-linkers.20 However, in many cases, blending the stabilizer within the photoactive layer causes an initial performance reduction,18,19,21 and only a few studies have reported the use of chemical dopants in both performance and stability improvement.20 In this study, we report that chemical doping of polymer–fullerene film with piperazine is able to improve the efficiency of polymer–fullerene solar cells, including P3HT:PC61BM, PTB7-Th:PC61BM and PffBT4T-2OD:PC61BM. More importantly, such doping can effectively suppress the “burn-in” decay process, especially the short circuit current (JSC) decay, and hence improve the device stability. Dark- and photon-induced electron transfer between piperazine and PC61BM, as confirmed by ESR measurements, explains the enhancement of the electron mobility of the blend film, which can be ascribed to the increased electron mobility of the blend film. In addition, photoinduced charge transfer between piperazine and PC61BM leading to the PC61BM triplet being quenched by piperazine is thought to be the main reason for the stability improvement of the polymer–fullerene cells, since dimerization of PC61BM is related to the PC61BM triplet concentration. For the first time, we have clearly demonstrated the degradation mechanism of polymer–fullerene solar cells on a molecular level.
Experimental
2.1 Materials
Regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (SMI-P3HT, Mn = 5.0 × 104 g mol−1, PDI = 1.7, regioregularity Rr = 95%), poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th), poly[(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4,7-diyl)-alt-(3,3′′′-di(2-octyldodecyl)-2,2′;5′,2′′;5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophen-5,5′′′-diyl)] (PffBT4T-2OD), and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) were purchased from Solarmer Energy, Inc. (Beijing). Piperazine was purchased from J&K China Chemical Co. Ltd. All of the materials were used as received without further purification. ZnO colloidal particles were prepared through the reaction of KOH and Zn(OAc)2 in methanol solvent, as reported by Beek et al.22,23
2.2 Solar cell fabrication and characterization
Solar cells were fabricated on patterned ITO glass, which was purchased from Shenzhen Huayu Union Technology Co. Ltd. Before the device fabrication, ITO glass substrates were sequentially sonically cleaned in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol. A nitrogen flow was used to dry the cleaned ITO glass substrates, followed by a cleaning process using a UV-ozone oven for 30 min. The ZnO (10 mg mL−1 in acetone) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass substrates at a speed of 2000 rpm for 60 s, which were then placed on a hot plate at 120 °C for 10 min. The prepared samples were then transferred into a glove box filled with N2 for spin-coating of the photoactive layer. Note that the piperazine doping ratio discussed in this study is the weight ratio of piperazine to the total weight of polymer donor and fullerene acceptor. For the P3HT:PC61BM solar cells, P3HT, PC61BM, and piperazine were mixed in various weight ratios of 1:1:x/2% (x = 0, 1, 3, 5, 7), dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), and stirred at 50 °C overnight. The total concentration of P3HT and PC61BM was 40 mg mL−1. Then the active layers composed of P3HT:PC61BM were spin-coated onto the top of the ZnO layers at 600 rpm for 60 s. Then, the wet P3HT:PC61BM blend films were put into covered Petri dishes for 1.5 hours. Subsequently, the active layers were annealed at 120 °C for 10 min in an N2-filled glove box. For the PTB7-Th:PC61BM solar cells, PTB7-Th, PC61BM and piperazine were mixed in various weight ratios of 1:1.5:x/2.5% (x = 0, 0.05, 0.2, 0.5), dissolved in chlorobenzene with the addition of 3% volume ratio of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), and stirred at 50 °C for 3 hours. The total concentration of PTB7-Th and PC61BM was 25 mg mL−1. The mixture solution was spin-coated onto the top of the ZnO layer at 1000 rpm for 60 s. Then, the wet PTB7-Th:PC61BM blend films were transferred to a chamber and the vacuum was pumped down to 10−1 Pa by mechanical pump then kept at that level for 120 min. For the PffBT4T-2OD:PC61BM solar cells, PffBT4T-2OD, PC61BM and piperazine were mixed in various weight ratios of 1:1.2:x/2.2% (x = 0, 0.1, 0.5, 3), dissolved in chlorobenzene with the addition of 3% volume ratio of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), and stirred at 110 °C for 3 hours. The total concentration of PffBT4T-2OD and PC61BM was 22 mg mL−1. The mixture solution was spin-coated onto the top of the ZnO layer at 600 rpm for 60 s. Then, the active layers were annealed at 85 °C for 5 min. Finally, MoO3 (20 nm) and Al (100 nm) were sequentially vacuum-deposited on the top of the active layer at pressure <1 × 10−4 Pa. The effective area of the devices was 0.09 cm2. The molecular structures of P3HT, PTB7-Th, PffBT4T-2OD, PC61BM and piperazine as well as the device structure are shown in Fig. 1.

2.3 Solar cell characterization

J–V curves of all of the devices were measured in a N2-filled glove box using a Keithley 2400 source meter under the illumination of simulated AM 1.5 G sunlight (Verasol-2, LED 3A Sun Simulator, Newport). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) values were measured under simulated 1 sun operating conditions using bias light from a 532 nm solid-state laser. Light from a 150 W tungsten halogen lamp (Osram 64610) was used as the probe light and was modulated with a mechanical chopper before passing the monochromator (Zolix, Omni-k300) to select the wavelength. The response was recorded as the voltage by an I–V converter (DNR-IV Convertor, Suzhou D&R Instruments) using a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR 830). A calibrated Si cell was used as the reference. The device for EQE measurements was kept behind a quartz window in a nitrogen-filled container.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the active layers were obtained using a Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin 200 kV field-emission electron microscope (FEI). Photoluminescence spectra (PL) and UV-Vis absorption of the composite films were recorded using an F4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi) and a Lambda 750 UV/vis/NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer), respectively. Injection-charge extraction by linearly increasing the voltage in a metal-insulator-semiconductor diode (MIS-CELIV) tests were conducted in a N2-filled glove box. For the electron mobility tests, a linearly increasing voltage pulse in reverse bias (the positive probe was connected to the Al electrode and the negative probe was connected to the ITO electrode) was applied using a wave generator (Agilent 33522A) (as shown in Fig. 5a). The voltage amplitude and ramp were set to 2 V and 1.6 × 105 V s−1, respectively. The current transients were monitored through a 50 Ω load on an oscilloscope (Tektronix MSO2024). For the hole mobility tests, a linearly increasing voltage pulse in reverse bias (the positive probe was connected to the ITO electrode and the negative probe connected to the Al electrode) was applied using a wave generator (as shown in Fig. S8†). The voltage amplitude and ramp were set to 3 V and 9.0 × 104 V s−1, respectively. Electron-only and hole-only MIS diodes were made with a device structure of ITO/LiF (140 nm)/active layer (200 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) and ITO/active layer (200 nm)/LiF (140 nm)/Al (100 nm), respectively.
2.4 Solar cell performance decay testing
Long-term stability measurements of the un-encapsulated devices were conducted using a solar cell performance decay test system (PVLT-G8100, Suzhou D&R Instruments) under test conditions in accordance with ISOS. In detail, the un-encapsulated devices were put inside a glove box (H2O < 10 ppm, O2 < 10 ppm), and continuously illuminated with LED white light (D&R Light, LW5300KA-150, Suzhou D&R Instruments). The illumination light intensity was initially set so that the output device short circuit current was equal to JSC measured under standard conditions. The illumination light intensity was monitored by a photodiode (Hamamatsu S1336-8BQ). J–V curves of the devices were checked periodically, and the photovoltaic performance data (VOC, JSC, FF and PCE) were calculated automatically accordingly to the J–V results. The maximum power outputs (mpp) of these devices were checked periodically according to the J–V measurements, and the devices were attached with an external load at the maximum power output point under illumination. The photovoltaic performances of the devices (VOC, JSC, FF, PCE, Rs, and Rsh) were continuously monitored and recorded every 30 min. The cell temperature was measured occasionally, and a temperature range of 40–45 °C was measured during aging.
2.5 Electronic spin resonance spectroscopic measurements
For the P3HT:PC61BM system, 200 μL of solutions of pristine PC61BM (20 mg mL−1), P3HT (20 mg mL−1) and P3HT:PC61BM (1:1, 40 mg mL−1) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene were introduced into standard 5 mm o.d. NMR tubes. For the PTB7-Th:PC61BM and PffBT4T-2OD:PC61BM systems, PTB7-Th (10 mg mL−1), PffBT4T-2OD (10 mg mL−1), PTB7-Th:PC61BM (1:1.5, 25 mg mL−1), and PffBT4T-2OD:PC61BM (1:1.2, 22 mg mL−1) in chlorobenzene were introduced into standard 5 mm o.d. NMR tubes. These tubes were immediately connected to a vacuum line to remove the solvent under reduced pressure (0.1–0.8 mbar). Gentle shaking was applied during the solvent evaporation to achieve homogeneous coating of the internal walls of the tubes with thin films of the material. The resulting films were transferred immediately to a nitrogen glove box and dried under high vacuum (0.1 mbar) overnight to ensure the removal of trace amounts of the solvent and absorbed reactive species (oxygen and moisture). Then, the tubes were sealed under anaerobic conditions (O2 and H2O < 0.1 ppm) inside a nitrogen glove box. The ESR spectra were recorded using an electron spin resonance spectrometer (JEOL JES-X320). All of the measurements were carried out at 123 K under the same experimental conditions.
Results and discussion
3.1 Photovoltaic performance of P3HT:PC61BM cells with piperazine doping

Fig. 2a and b depict the J–V and EQE spectra of the best P3HT:PC61BM cells with different piperazine doping concentrations. Fig. S1† shows the statistical data distribution of the open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current (JSC), fill factor (FF) and the PCE of these cells, and Table 1 lists the photovoltaic performance data. As can be seen here, the pristine P3HT:PC61BM cells showed an averaged PCE of 3.18% with average VOC of 0.608 V, JSC of 8.67 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.60, which are comparable with the data reported in the literature.24 Doping with 1% piperazine increased the device PCE to 3.60%, while the highest average PCE of 3.92% was achieved for the 3% piperazine-doped cells. Such a performance enhancement was mainly due to a large increase in the JSC value and a slightly increased VOC value. Further increasing the piperazine doping concentration, however, decreased the device performance, mainly due to a decrease in the FF value. It is worth pointing out that even at a high doping concentration of 7%, the device performance was still higher than that of the pristine cell. These results unambiguously confirm that doping the P3HT:PC61BM film with piperazine is able to improve device performance. On the other hand, the relatively high device performance of these pristine and doped cells makes them comparable in terms of stability.

The stability of these cells was then checked inside the glovebox with continuous LED light illumination according to the ISOS-L1 testing standard.25 To better simulate the degradation behavior of these cells under real working conditions, all of the cells were aged at the maximum power point (mpp). Fig. 3 depicts the evolution of VOC, JSC, FF and PCE of cells with different piperazine doping concentrations. As can be seen, the pristine P3HT:PC61BM cells display a typical fast “burn-in” degradation after the first 200 hours, mainly due to the JSC decay. After aging for 200 h, the P3HT:PC61BM devices without piperazine doping display an overall 48% PCE degradation. In contrast, P3HT:PC61BM cells doped with piperazine show almost no “burn-in” degradation, and a less than 10% PCE decrease was found for these cells, even after aging for over 1000 hours, demonstrating the excellent stabilization effect of piperazine. Unlike the pristine cells,16 the piperazine-doped P3HT:PC61BM cells do not show external-load-dependent decay behavior (Fig. S2 in the ESI†), suggesting that the exciton concentration-related degradation behavior was fully suppressed by piperazine.

3.2 Piperazine doping effect in high-performance polymer–fullerene cells
To check the generality of the performance and stability improvement of piperazine doping, PTB7-Th:PC61BM and PffBT4T-2OD:PC61BM cells were also fabricated and tested. Fig. 4a and b display the J–V curves of these two types of cells with different piperazine doping concentrations, respectively. The photovoltaic performance data are also shown in Table 1. As can be seen, doping the photoactive layer with piperazine also improves the device performance of these two systems. After the addition of 0.2% piperazine, the best PCE of the PTB7-Th:PC61BM cells increased from 8.21% to 8.74%. Meanwhile, the best PCE of PffBT4T-2OD:PC61BM cells increased from 7.66% to 8.20% with the addition of 0.5% piperazine. It is worth pointing out that the optimal doping concentrations of the PTB7-Th:PC61BM and PffBT4T-2OD:PC61BM cells are different from that of the P3HT:PC61BM cell. This could be due to the difference in the nanomorphology of the different blend films, which influences the intermolecular interaction between the piperazine and fullerene molecules. Interestingly, for all three types of cell, the performance enhancement was mainly due to an increase in the JSC value. Morphology analyses on the blend films confirmed that piperazine doping does not change the nanomorphology of the films (vide infra), whereas charge carrier mobility measurements confirmed that piperazine doping enhances the electron mobility of the blend films. Therefore, the enhancement of EQE (Fig. S3†) was then ascribed to the enhanced electron mobility rather than the optimization of the thin film nanomorphology. Nevertheless, doping with piperazine slightly increases the performance of PTB7-Th:PC61BM and PffBT4T-2OD:PC61BM cells, ensuring that it is reasonable to compare the stability of these cells under light illumination.

Fig. S4 and S5† depict the evolution of VOC, JSC, FF and PCE for PTB7-Th:PC61BM and PffBT4T-2OD:PC61BM cells aged inside the glovebox with continuous light illumination. As can be seen, both types of cells show typical “burn-in” decays under light illumination. Similar to the P3HT:PC61BM cells, JSC decay dominates the overall performance losses. However, the time scale and overall PCE decay for the “burn-in” process are different for the different cells. The pristine PTB7-Th:PC61BM cells showed a “burn-in” process within a time period of 100 hours, leading to an overall PCE decay of 50%, whereas the PffBT4T-2OD:PC61BM cells showed a “burn-in” decay after the first 30 hours, where an overall 30% PCE decay was measured. For the PTB7-Th:PC61BM cells, by doping with piperazine at a low concentration of 0.05–0.5%, JSC decay can be effectively suppressed, leading to a slow-down of the PCE decay (Fig. S4†). Similarly, stabilization of JSC decay can be also seen in the PffBT4T-2OD:PC61BM cells (Fig. S5†), where fast “burn-in” decay can be successfully suppressed by doping the photoactive layer with 0.1% piperazine. Further increasing the piperazine doping concentration can further stabilize the JSC; however, this also leads to a fast decay of VOC and FF, and consequently yields PCE decay. The detailed reason for the fast decay of VOC and FF is not fully understood yet, and an interfacial degradation between the photoactive layer and the electrode buffer layer was supposed to be the main reason since it is known that PffBT4T-2OD:PC61BM cells are very sensitive to the interfacial properties. Further investigation of this effect is ongoing; however, this is beyond the scope of this study. Nevertheless, the current work unambiguously confirms that doping the polymer:PC61BM films with piperazine is able to stabilize the solar cell performance by decreasing the JSC decay.
3.3 Morphology of the photoactive layer after piperazine doping
To further understand the effect of piperazine doping, the morphologies of the photoactive layers were carefully characterized. Fig. S6† shows the Grazing-Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) patterns of the P3HT:PC61BM blend films with different piperazine doping concentrations. The diffraction profiles along the in-plane (qxy) and out-of-plane (qz) directions are shown in Fig. S6f and g.† As can be seen here, there is no obvious morphology difference for the film before and after piperazine doping, suggesting that the crystallinity and molecular stacking of the P3HT:PC61BM film are not influenced by piperazine doping. Furthermore, the aged P3HT:PC61BM blend film was also characterized for comparison, as shown in Fig. S6e–g.† It can be seen that there is no obvious morphology change in the active layer after the device degradation. TEM images of the P3HT:PC61BM films with different piperazine doping concentrations were obtained and are shown in Fig. S7.† As can be seen, the P3HT nanowires can be distinguished in all these films; however, no obvious difference was detected for these films with different piperazine doping concentrations. This result indicates that doping with piperazine does not change the nanomorphology of the P3HT:PC61BM film, which is in good agreement with the GIWAXS results. In other words, the effect of piperazine doping on polymer solar cell performance stability enhancement cannot be attributed to the change in nanomorphology.
3.4 Charge carrier mobility of the blend films
In order to understand the doping effect of piperazine, the charge carrier mobility of the polymer:fullerene blend films was measured by MIS-CELIV.26 The dark MIS-CELIV transients of electron-only P3HT:PC61BM with and without piperazine devices at various offsets are shown in Fig. 5c and d, respectively. The mobility value was calculated from the results with moderate offsets according to eqn (1) and (2).27 (1) (2)where t2j0 is the time at which the current density reaches j = 2j0 and j0 is the displacement current corresponding to the capacitance of the entire diode, including both the semiconductor and insulator layers. ds is the thickness of the semiconductor layer, di is the thickness of the insulator layer, εs is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor layer, εi is the dielectric constant of the insulator layer, μ is the charge carrier mobility, and A is the voltage ramp (A = dU/dt). The electron mobility results in the dark MIS-CELIV are summarized in Table 2. In this context, we calculate (as shown in Fig. 5c) an electron mobility of 2.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the P3HT:PC61BM active layer. However, after doping with piperazine (3%), the electron mobility of the active layer increased to 1.68 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 5d), which is around ten times that for the P3HT:PC61BM active layer without piperazine. This result is in good agreement with the increased EQE over a long wavelength range. On the other hand, the hole mobility of the hole-only P3HT:PC61BM does not change much after piperazine doping (see Fig. S8 in the ESI† for measurement setup and CELIV curves), which also indicates that the crystallinity of the P3HT domain in the blend film does not change much after piperazine doping. Therefore, the higher electron mobility is then supposed to be the reason for the high performance of the polymer solar cells after doping with piperazine.

3.5 Intermolecular interactions between P3HT and piperazine
To better understand the doping effect of piperazine in these polymer–fullerene films, the interactions of piperazine with PC61BM and P3HT were investigated by dark- and light-induced ESR. Fig. 6a–c show the ESR spectra for the PC61BM, P3HT and P3HT:PC61BM films with piperazine. As can be seen in Fig. 6a, the pristine PC61BM film shows a weak and broad ESR resonance signal with a g value of 2.0044, which was attributed to the oxidized PC61BM.28 After blending with piperazine, the PC61BM film showed an additional sharp ESR peak in the dark with a g value of 1.9995, which was attributed to the PC61BM radical anions,29,30 unambiguously confirming the electron transfer between PC61BM and piperazine even in the dark (Fig. 6d). Illuminating the PC61BM:piperazine blend increases the ESR peak intensity of the PC61BM radical anion, suggesting that light illumination promotes the electron transfer between PC61BM and piperazine, which is also supported by the fluorescence quenching experiment (Fig. S9 in the ESI†).

On the other hand, the pristine P3HT film also showed an ESR peak in the dark with a g value of 2.0004 (Fig. 6b, black line). This resonance peak was then attributed to the P3HT polaron originating from the oxidation of P3HT by residual oxygen.29 Light illuminated on the P3HT film increases the ESR intensity of the P3HT polaron, suggesting that light is able to promote the oxidation process of P3HT as well. Interestingly, blending the P3HT film with piperazine totally eliminates the ESR signal of P3HT polarons. Light illumination on the P3HT film, however, showed an ESR signal of P3HT polarons, but with lower intensity, indicating that piperazine is able to reduce the oxidized P3HT and release the oxidized P3HT to a neutral state (Fig. 6e).
The P3HT:PC61BM blend film showed a weak resonance peak with a g value of 2.0004 (Fig. 6c), which is ascribed to the signal of oxidized P3HT. Under light illumination, except for the signal of the P3HT polaron, the P3HT:PC61BM blend film showed strong PC61BM radical anions with a g value of 1.9995, which is ascribed to the light-induced electron transfer between P3HT and PC61BM.31 Doping the blend film with piperazine decreased the ESR signal intensity of P3HT polaron in the dark for the P3HT:PC61BM film (Fig. 6c). This is similar to the P3HT pristine film and is ascribed to the release of oxidized P3HT by piperazine (Fig. 6e). However, the P3HT:PC61BM:piperazine blend film showed a more intensive ESR signal of PC61BM anions under light illumination. Similar phenomena were also observed for the PTB7-Th:PC61BM (Fig. S10†) and PffBT4T-2OD:PC61BM films (Fig. S11†), suggesting that piperazine doping is able to enhance the formation of PC61BM anions under light illumination in the blend films, which was supposed to be one of the reasons for the performance enhancement of piperazine doping.
3.6 Further discussion on the piperazine doping effect
It is known that piperazine is a solid chemical with melting and boiling points of 106 °C and 146 °C, respectively. Although it is rather difficult to confirm the existence of piperazine in the blend films owing to the low doping concentration, increased charge carrier mobility as well as clear (L)ESR signals confirm the doping effect of piperazine. On the other hand, the optimized doping weight ratio of piperazine to polymer:fullerene is around 0.1–5%, corresponding to a weight to volume ratio of 0.02–1 mg mL−1. This number is much less than the solvent additive blending ratio that is used to optimize the nanomorphology of the blend films (e.g. the volume blend ratio for diiodooctane is typically 2.5% in volume, corresponding to 46 mg mL−1), therefore the performance and stability improvement of piperazine doping cannot be ascribed to a solvent additive effect, but rather the intermolecular interaction between piperazine and fullerene molecules.32,33
ESR results indicate that doping piperazine within the P3HT film releases the oxidized P3HT to a neutral state. This is helpful in charge separation between P3HT and PC61BM, which is ascribed as one of the reasons for the performance enhancement of the solar cells. Meanwhile, piperazine is also able to promote the formation of PC61BM anions in the blend films under light illumination (Section 3.5). According to the reported literature,34 the charge carrier mobility of disordered semiconducting polymers depends on the charge carrier density. The higher PC61BM anion concentration is therefore ascribed to be one of the reasons for the higher electron mobility for the blend film, as confirmed by MIS-CELIV measurements (Section 3.4 and Table 2). More importantly, doping piperazine is also able to stabilize the JSC decay process within the “burn-in” period. Our recent work demonstrated that the fast JSC decay of polymer–fullerene cells is directly related to the exciton concentration of PC61BM,16 and more detailed evidence of the formation of PC61BM dimers under light illumination was provided by Brabec et al.15 Photon-induced triplet quenching of PC61BM with piperazine was then supposed to be the main mechanism for the stability improvement, since it is known that formation of PC61BM dimers is generally through a triplet pathway.35,36 Although there are theoretical studies reporting that PC61BM dimers can be formed through an intermolecular charge transfer species of PC61BM,37,38 the LESR results (Fig. 6a) confirm that photon-induced charge transfer between piperazine and PC61BM leads to a higher concentration of PC61BM anions. However, a lower “burn-in” JSC decay was measured for the piperazine-doped cells, confirming that the formation of PC61BM is not related to the charge transfer state, but rather the triplet state.
Conclusions
In summary, piperazine was found to be able to simultaneously improve the device performance and stability of polymer:PC61BM cells. Intermolecular electron transfer between piperazine and PC61BM leading to the formation of PC61BM anions, leading to improved electron mobility of the blended film from 2.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the pristine P3HT:PC61BM film to 1.68 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the piperazine-doped P3HT:PC61BM film, which is considered to be one of the main reasons for device performance enhancement. On the other hand, photon-induced electron transfer between piperazine and PC61BM leads to the quenching of PC61BM excitons, which would reduce the dimerization tendency of PC61BM and consequently improve the device stability. Our results demonstrate that doping with piperazine is a versatile way of simultaneously improving the efficiency and stability of polymer solar cells.
