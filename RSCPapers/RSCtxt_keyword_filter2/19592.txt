These perovskite optoelectronics can realize the reciprocal conversion of light and electricity.

Broader context
The successive improvement of conversion efficiency has witnessed the booming advancement of perovskite optoelectronics. However, the high index and thin thickness of perovskite films cause Fresnel reflection and transmission of incident light, and confine the emitted photons in waveguide and substrate modes. This undesired light management affects the utilization of incident photons and extraction of emitted photons, thus deteriorating the conversion efficiency of optoelectronic devices. Therefore, light management is crucial for perovskites, given their direct band gap and high refractive index. Photonic structures afford robust means to manipulate photons through the interaction between media and photons. In this review, the light-manipulation mechanism of photonic structures is discussed, and a reasonable structural design on different functional layers of individual optoelectronics is presented. In addition, promising strategies for high-performance multifunctional perovskite optoelectronics are proposed to promote their practical applications.

1. Introduction
Optoelectronic devices have attracted intense interest in this resource shortage society since they can convert optical and electrical signals reciprocally.1,2 Perovskites are an emerging competitive photoactive semiconductor with a stoichiometric formula of ABX3 (A, B, and X denote the organic or inorganic cations: CH3NH3+ (MA+), CH (NH2)2+ (FA+), and Cs+, metal cations: Pb2+, Sn2+, and Ge2+, and halide anions: I−, Cl−, and Br−, respectively).3,4 Because of the simple solution processing and excellent photophysical properties, including large light absorption coefficients (>105 cm−1),5 tunable bandgaps (ultraviolet to near-infrared),6,7 long carrier diffusion length (>10 μm),8 and high carrier mobility (>10 cm2 V−1 s−1),9 perovskites have been widely applied in solar cells (SCs), light-emitting diodes (LEDs), photodetectors (PDs), and lasers.10–13 After decades of advancements, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite SCs has reached 25.8%,14,15 and the specific detectivity (D*) of perovskite PDs has reached up to 1015 Jones.16 As a light-emitting layer, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of perovskite LEDs has exceeded 28%,17,18 and the room-temperature continuous-wave perovskite lasers have been achieved, providing possibilities for electrically-pumped lasers.19,20
Despite the substantial progress that has been achieved, the further improvement of conversion efficiency is hampered by the intrinsic properties of perovskite materials or device structures.21–23 To tackle these obstacles, strategies including additives, solvents, and interface and crystal engineering have been implemented to improve the crystalline quality and optimize the device structures.24–27 However, the high index and low thickness of perovskite films are ongoing issues that cause Fresnel reflection and transmission of incident light and confine the emitted photons in waveguide and substrate modes.28,29 The undesired light management affects the utilization of incident photons and extraction of emitted photons, thus deteriorating the conversion efficiency of optoelectronic devices.28,30–32 For perovskite SCs, the simulation results indicate that the light absorption efficiency is only ∼65%, with remaining light loss including light escape of ∼15% and reflection of ∼4%.33,34 For perovskite materials, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is close to 100%, yet only ∼20% of the emitted light is extracted from perovskite LEDs.35–37 Therefore, the inefficient light utilization or light extraction of perovskite optoelectronics has spurred tremendous efforts to manipulate photons.28,38 Light management is more desirable for direct bandgap perovskites, because it can lead to photon recycling near the band edge.39–41
Photonic structures with periodic features are capable of redirecting light into and out of the perovskite optoelectronics, providing a powerful way to manipulate photons.42–46 Owing to the different operating mechanisms of the devices, the functionalities of the identical photonic structures are also different. For light-absorbing optoelectronics, the interaction between light and structures can prolong the optical path, and couple the incident photons into perovskite active layers, thus enhancing the light absorption and short-circuit current density (Jsc), increasing the recombination current and open circuit voltage (Voc), and leading to a high PCE.47–49 Meanwhile, a reasonable structural design is favorable for the transportation and collection of photogenerated carriers, promoting the optical and electrical performance simultaneously.38,50–54 In light-emitting optoelectronics, certain unextracted photons will be confined within waveguide and substrate modes due to the large index mismatch at interfaces, which may turn into heat, leading to performance roll-off.36,55 This phenomenon is even worse in perovskite LEDs because of the high refractive index and poor thermal stability of the active materials.56,57 The strong interaction between light and photonic structures can redirect the emitted photons to escape from devices, thus improving the light out-coupling efficiency and EQE of devices.58–60 The enhanced light extraction capacity facilitates the emitted photons from the active layer to reach outside, especially for blue perovskite LEDs with a low internal quantum efficiency (IQE).61,62 In addition, constructing the photonic structures also endows perovskite optoelectronics with several novel optical functionalities, such as colorfulness and semitransparency, polarization-sensitive detection and imaging, light modulation, and ease of integration.63–67 Light management can lead to function integration, improving the optoelectronic performance and enabling multifunctional applications of devices without increasing material consumption.68,69 It is worth noting that the fundamental theories for photonic structures with microscale and nanoscale dimensions are different.70 The statistical ray optics models follow that the maximum light absorption enhancement is the Yablonvoitch limit of 4n2, where n is the refractive index of photosensitive semiconductors.71 When introducing nanoscale structures, the conventional ray optics analysis may not be advisable, and the wave optics theory is necessary for proposing a new performance limit.72,73 Both microscale and nanoscale photonic structures are involved in perovskite optoelectronic devices, such as perovskite thin films with nanoscale photonic structures, other functional layers (electron transport layer, ETL; hole transport layer, HTL; metal electrodes; and substrates), and multifunctional optoelectronics with microscale photonic structures.33,74–76
In this review, we start with a detailed discussion of general light management strategies from the perspective of photo-physics, including antireflection modes, scattering enhancement, Fabry–Pérot resonance, diffracted grating resonance, guide resonance, Mie resonance, and photonic crystals. The developments of design and application of these photonic elements in perovskite optoelectronics are then systemically summarized for a deeper understanding of the photonic structure-functionalized optoelectronics. Finally, the promising proposals and guidelines for high-performance and multifunctional perovskite optoelectronics are provided to expedite their practical applications.
2. Light management strategies of photonic structures
Optoelectronic devices can realize the conversion between optical and electrical signals, maximizing the use of clean solar energy and enabling efficient optical communication. Light management of photonic structures is crucial for high-refractive-index and thin-film-based optoelectronic devices, especially for perovskite materials with a refractive index of ∼2.5.77 The interaction between light and photonic structures can enhance the light absorption and emission of optoelectronic devices.78–80 Furthermore, the unique structural features afford some novel optical properties and feasible approaches for integrated optoelectronics (Fig. 1). This chapter mainly focuses on the general light management strategies of photonic structures and the different optical modes of these light management strategies in high-index thin-film optoelectronic devices.

2.1. General light management strategies
2.1.1. Antireflection and scattering enhancement. When light beam is incident on an interface between two different media, where the refractive indices are n1 and n2, respectively, the light would be reflected, refracted, and scattered simultaneously (Fig. 2a). The surface morphology would affect the ratio of different light paths significantly. For a smooth surface, the light would be mainly reflected, whose intensity can be evaluated using the equation R = [(n1 − n2)/(n1 + n2)]2.71 According to the equation, the reflected light intensity is strongly dependent on the refractive index difference between the two media. This indicates that light reflection can be suppressed by decreasing the index difference between the two media. Inspired by the strong antireflection properties of moth eyes which have nanostructured surfaces, a strategy has been proposed to realize broadband and angularly independent reduction in light reflection, which involves constructing ordered subwavelength nanostructures at the interface.81 As shown in Fig. 2b, the nanocones can serve as effective media whose refractive index increases gradually to minimize the reflection. Besides the antireflection, the nanostructured surface can also enhance the scattering by tailoring the shape and size of the nanostructures. Generally, the high-aspect-ratio nanostructures on the surface tend to suppress reflection, whereas the low-aspect-ratio nanostructures usually enhance light scattering, as shown in Fig. 2c.78 Here, the optimum structure spacing should be close to the target light-trapping wavelength. In addition, achieving high scattering from the substrate can also be accomplished by using a high-index dielectric material to construct the nanostructure or by coating a layer of highly reflective material on the nanostructure.82 Such a nanostructure is usually applied on the rear surfaces to strengthen the guided resonances.

2.1.2. Resonances. When a plane wave light is incident on a thin film of thickness d and refractive index nb with the angles of incidence and refraction denoted as θa and θb, the light will be reflected by the two interfaces of the thin film, thus leading to two reflected light rays (light 1 and light 2, Fig. 2d). The two light rays will interfere with each other, and this interference is highly dependent on the thickness of the film and their phase difference. If the film is attached to a material with a lower refractive index than itself, constructive interference occurs when 2nbdcosθb = (m − 1/2)λ, where λ is the wavelength of the maximum reflectivity and m is an integer.83 Deconstructive interference could occur when 2nbdcosb = mλ, which is commonly used for anti-reflective coating.84 However, such antireflective coatings only work well for a limited range of wavelengths and angles of incidence. Things alter slightly when the film is attached to media with a higher refractive index than itself because the reflection at the interface changes its phase by 180°. Normally, thin-film interference is obscure to the eye unless it is observed at large angles. To enhance the interference of the thin film, a standard strategy of using a pair of partially reflecting mirrors is applied to increase the reflectivity at the interface. Due to the high reflectivity of the two interfaces, the light can undergo multiple reflections between the two interfaces and resonate with each other. Such a structure is called a Fabry–Pérot (F–P) resonant cavity.85 The resonance induced by this cavity can drastically prolong the light path within the waveguide layer, associated with the enhancement of light–matter interaction and light trapping of the material.Similar resonance can also be found in some other two-dimensional (2D) in-plane photonic structures, like gratings (Fig. 2e).28 Apart from the effects of diffraction and light splitting, the periodic structure can produce a strong resonance along the horizontal plane, leading to light trapping. According to a perturbation approach, the phase-matching condition for the one-dimensional (1D) grating can be expressed as: 
(2.1)where βm is the in-plane wave number of the mth guided mode of the stack, p is the diffraction order, and Λ is the period of the 1D grating.86 By coupling light in the guided mode, the light can be well confined into the structure, enabling useful adsorption when an equilibrium is reached between diffraction efficiency and absorption. Another typical resonance can be generated by a spherical or a polygonal structure, as shown in Fig. 2f. When a beam of light impinges a high-refractive-index medium from one with a low refractive index at a large incident angle, the light would be trapped in the cavity by the curved high-index interface.87 This is also known as the whispering gallery (WG) mode, which can provide a higher Q factor than the Fabry cavity.88,89 Consequently, the WG resonance has been widely used for lasers.

2.1.3. Photonic crystals. Photonic crystals (PCs) are materials with periodic spatial refractive indices. Classified by the dimensions in which the periodicity exists, PCs can be divided into 1D, 2D, and three-dimensional (3D) PCs, as shown in Fig. 2g.90 The periodic refractive index endows the PCs with a photonic bandgap, in which the light with specified wavelengths cannot propagate through the structure.91 The prohibited light wavelength is determined from the periodicity and effective refractive index of the nanostructures. Another extraordinary attribute of PCs is their birefringent and anisotropic dispersion, which makes them a promising candidate for reflective polarizers, and optical waveplates. The final important property of PCs is nonlinear dispersion, where the group velocity of the light turns anomalously small near the wavelength of a stopband. This results in the localization of light near the stopband in PCs. In detail, since the light can be considered as a standing wave, the light at the red edge of the stopband is localized in the high dielectric part of PCs, while the light at the blue edge is localized in the low dielectric part (Fig. 2h).92 The localization of light in different parts of PCs depends on the energy, leading to a strong light–matter interaction. By designing PCs with appropriate periodicity and refractive indices, the light-harvesting efficiency of the media can be improved, showing a great potential in optoelectronic devices.
2.2. Coupled optical modes in high-index optoelectronic devices
In high-index thin-film-based optoelectronic devices, such as perovskite thin-film optoelectronics, different optical modes can be generated inside the device by the light management of the photonic structures. The coupling mechanism of these optical modes is studied by simulating the electromagnetic field energy distribution and intensity. Here, we take the enhanced light-trapping capacity as an example to discuss the light management of the photonic structures. Fig. 3a shows a schematic illustration of four common optical modes in a high-index thin-film optoelectronic device with a structured semiconductor active layer.70 The number 1, 2, 3, and 4 label notes the Mie resonance, Fabry–Pérot resonance, waveguide resonance, and diffracted gratings resonance modes, respectively. The photonic structure is constructed on the top surface of the active layer. Once excited by incident light, the photons can be coupled into the active layer, and enhanced light absorption is achieved within the spectral region. As shown in Fig. 3b, the light absorption of the active layer as a function of light wavelength and incident angle is plotted.70 The 2D light absorption mapping illustrates the strong absorption feature of the active layer, which results from the resonance coupling effect of four different resonance modes. The different field distributions correspond to different resonance modes, which are dependent on the incident angle and wavelength. These differences are what distinguish these resonance modes from each other. Fig. 3c and d show the spatial profiles of electromagnetic energy density inside an optoelectronic device, and the incident wavelength is 880, 1031, 946, and 1011 nm, respectively.70 The white dotted line in each profile outlines the structured active layer. The symmetrical hexagonal distribution of electromagnetic energy density clearly demonstrates a Mie resonance within the photonic structure (Fig. 3c). The Mie resonance and other guide resonances are hybridized. A Fabry–Pérot resonance can be formed inside the active layer owing to the high-index surface of the active layer and the feedback mirror of metal, and this resonance confines the incident photons and produces a standing wave within the active layer (Fig. 3d). Fig. 3e exhibits the electromagnetic energy distribution of the waveguide resonance mode, and this resonance mode is generated by the periodic patterned arrays that act as a diffracted grating structure, effectively coupling the phase-matching incident light wave into a waveguide resonance inside a high-index active layer. The diffracted grating resonance mode (Fig. 3f) can redirect the incident light into the active layer, and this resonance effect can be extended to the underlying active film, which confines more photons within the active layer and facilitates efficient absorption. In optoelectronic devices, micro-nano-scaled photonic structures may support a collection of various optical modes, ensuring powerful means to manipulate the wavelength-specific photons.

3. Light management strategies for perovskite optoelectronics
3.1. Perovskite solar cells
Thin-film SCs with low consumption of materials can convert renewable and clean solar energy into electronic power.93–95 Perovskites with fascinating photophysical properties and low-cost fabrication processing have been a competitive photoactive layer for SCs, and the successive improvement of PCE has witnessed the booming advancement of perovskite SCs.96 However, the high refractive index and low thickness of the perovskite film cause light reflection and leakage, decreasing the utilization of incident light and hampering the further improvement of conversion efficiency.33,77 According to the results of theoretical calculations, perovskite SCs exhibit ∼4% reflected light, ∼15% transmitted light, and ∼16% parasitic absorption ligh(Fig. 4a).97 As discussed above, introducing photonic structures can enhance useful absorption through the interaction between structures and light. The current density of photovoltaics can be improved by light management using photonic structures, and the increased radiation recombination rate may have a positive effect on the Voc, which is expressed using the following equation and affected by the nonradiative recombination-induced dark current.98,99 
(3.1)in which k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, the temperature of devices, and the elementary charge, respectively.70 Iphoto and Idark denote the photocurrent and dark current, respectively. In addition, the trade-off between optical (Jsc) and electrical (fill factor, FF) performance can be overcome by designing reasonable structures, and multifunctional SCs, such as colorful and semitransparent perovskite, can be achieved with photonic structures. The light-trapping of photonic structures on the perovskite active layer, ETL, HTL, metal electrode, and substrate, perovskite-based tandem SCs, and the corresponding colorful and semitransparent perovskite SCs are systematically summarized to deepen the understanding of the photophysical properties of photonic structured perovskite SCs.

3.1.1. Perovskite active layer with photonic structures. Considering that light propagates at interfaces with large differences in refractive indices (nperovskites ≥ ntransport layers), the perovskite active layer with photonic structures may be more effective in manipulating photons. Furthermore, the solution-processed fabrication affords an operational window that leverages the film-forming intermediate state to construct photonic structures on the perovskite active layer.100–102 Wang et al. reported moiré-perovskite SCs with dual grating structured perovskite films, fabricated by a nanoimprinting approach with a commercial DVD disc (Fig. 4b).97 The intermediate state when the perovskite film is wet just after spin-coating sets aside some time to imprint photonic structures. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Fig. 4c) show that the period, line width, and height of the imprinted grating structure were ∼0.75, ∼0.25, and ∼0.1 μm, respectively, confirming that the grating morphology was successfully transformed from optical DVD discs to perovskite films.97 Fig. 4d demonstrates the optical photograph of the moiré structure. It is clearly illustrated that three sets of diffracted beams could be achieved when a laser was illuminated upon the moiré structure.97 Two sets of diffracted beams originate from the first-order diffraction of the grating structure, while the other set of diffracted beams is a result of the moiré structure with dual grating which induces multiple couplings. A perovskite film with dual grating structures means that the moiré-structure interface is formed in SCs, in which one grating structure on the surface can reduce the light reflection, and the other grating structure serves as a feedback mirror to decrease the light leakage. This synergistic effect of antireflection and back reflection enhances the light absorption of perovskite SCs (Fig. 4b). The Jsc of moiré-perovskite SCs was up to 23.74 mA cm−2, higher than that of pristine perovskite SCs (21.77 mA cm−2, Fig. 4e), suggesting that more incident photons are trapped in the perovskite active layer for efficient absorption.97 Moreover, the moiré interface is favorable for the transportation and collection of carriers owing to the directional 1D grating structure, and the imprinted process improves the crystalline quality of perovskite films, thanks to the spatial confinement effect. These advantages endow moiré-perovskite SCs with an FF of 76.95% and a Voc of 1.104 V. In addition, the effective light management of the dual-grated moiré structure can also generate structural colors (Fig. 4e).97 Notably, the light-trapping capability of the moiré-perovskite SCs is related to the rotation angle of the dual grating structure, and the rotation angle in this study was 30°. The WG mode affords a strong optical resonance that confines the photons into the resonant cavity through multiple reflections. Inspired by this light trapping in the WG mode, Wang et al. presented WG perovskite films through an imprinting approach using round micro-pillar arrays. The WG structure acts as a resonant cavity and captures the incident photons within the cavity to enhance the light absorption of the perovskite active layer (Fig. 4f).103 The imprinted height of the WG structure was ∼70 nm (AFM image, Fig. 4g), lower than the thickness of the perovskite thin film (∼350 nm).103 This unpenetrated WG structure not only provides the feedback reflection for light trapping, but also facilitates the transportation and collection of photogenerated carriers. Under laser illumination, the pristine perovskite film exhibited a single spot, while the WG perovskite film had hexagonal diffraction spots (Fig. 4h), indicating the strong light management provided by the WG structure.103 The WG perovskite films were applied in SCs with FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide)/TiO2 ETL/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD HTL/Au structure, and the refractive indexes of perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD were ∼2.5 and ∼1.7, respectively. From the result of the finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) simulation (λ = 730 nm), the time-averaged electromagnetic density is high in the WG structure at the interface of the perovskite active layer and spiro-OMeTAD HTL (Fig. 4i), suggesting that the incident photons are confined in the WG cavity through multiple reflections when the light propagates from the perovskite active layer with a high index into the spiro-OMeTAD HTL with a low index, thus improving the light-trapping capability of SCs.103 The Jsc and PCE of WG perovskite SCs were 23.62 mA cm−2 and 19.38%, respectively, higher than those of pristine perovskite SCs (Jsc: 20.90 mA cm−2, PCE: 14.54%).In addition, Pascoe et al. fabricated a textured perovskite active layer on mesoporous TiO2 ETL by a gas-assisted crystallization approach.104 The textured perovskite film had a multitiered nanostructure, which was beneficial for light absorption and carrier collection of perovskite SCs.104 Kim et al. demonstrated the perovskite films with hexagonal nanohole arrays using polyurethane stamps to imprint the perovskite intermediate state.105 The as-prepared perovskite films exhibited the preferred crystalline orientation and large grain sizes owing to the uniaxial compression induced in a confined space during the imprinting process. The nanohole array serves as a cavity structure that couples the incident photons into nanoholes to enhance the useful absorption of perovskite SCs.105 Lu et al. also showed coral-like perovskite films by surface modification using dimethylformamide/isopropanol as a co-solvent.106 The sequential growth process of coral-like perovskite films entailed the decomposition and recrystallization of perovskite, and the extraction of excessive PbI2. The enhanced light scattering of the coral-like nanostructure reduced the light reflection and improved the light trapping of perovskite SCs.106 Moreover, the unique morphological configuration accelerated the separation and collection of carriers.

3.1.2. Other functional layers with photonic structures. Apart from the structured perovskite active layer, the photonic structures can also be constructed on electron and hole transport layers for light trapping. Generally, the geometrical conformity in SCs provides another way to construct photonic structures on electron and hole transport layers, in which the photonic structure with micro–nano scale is transformed from the perovskite active layer to electron and hole transport layers, including the metal electrode. Kang et al. reported a conical-shaped moth-eye TiO2 ETL for enhancing the light-harvesting efficiency of perovskite SCs (Fig. 5a).107 The conical-shaped moth-eye structure was imprinted using a polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) mold, and the pitch and height of the moth-eye structured TiO2 ETL were 480 and 160 nm, respectively. According to the FDTD result (λ = 700 nm), the electromagnetic energy at the interface of the perovskite film and TiO2 ETL was strong (Fig. 5b), indicating that the incident photons were trapped in the perovskite active layer through the light management of moth-eye structure.107 The moth-eye structure with a conical shape had the graded index, which redirected the incident light into the structure and improveed the light absorption of perovskite films. Compared to flat TiO2 ETL, the light-harvesting efficiency of moth-eye structure was enhanced over the entire visible band. The J–V curves show that Jsc and PCE of perovskite SCs with moth-eye TiO2 ETLs were 23.92 mA cm−2 and 17.48% (Fig. 5c), respectively, higher than those of the flat counterparts by ∼5.3% and ∼10.7%, respectively.107 Hu et al. presented a nanocellular poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) HTL by a nanosphere etching approach (Fig. 5d).108 The diameter of nanocellular structure was ∼200 nm, which was consistent with the diameter of polystyrene (PS) nanospheres (Fig. 5e).108 Reflectance spectra demonstrate that the antireflection of nanocellular structure was over the entire visible spectrum (Fig. 5f), covering the absorption band of perovskite materials.108 The distribution of optical electric field in nanocellular perovskite SCs was calculated (Fig. 5g); there was enhanced optical electric density in the perovskite active layer, and the optical electric intensity means light absorption, suggesting that the nanocellular structure as a cavity can couple the incident photons within the perovskite active layer, improving the light absorption of SCs.108 Wei et al. fabricated two photonic structures of grating and moth-eye [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) ETLs for perovskite SCs via a PDMS mold nanoimprinting route (Fig. 5h).109 The imprinting period and groove depth of grating and moth-eye structures were ∼500, ∼60, ∼400, and ∼60 nm, respectively (Fig. 5i).109 The FDTD approach was used to define the distribution of electric field intensity in perovskite SCs (Fig. 5j); it is clearly evident that the field intensity in the perovskite active layer was strong both in grating and moth-eye patterned SCs.109 Different from the above works, the grating and moth-eye PCBM ETLs herein were back electrodes. Photonic structures served as a feedback mirror to reduce the light leakage from devices, thus confining photons within the perovskite active layer for useful absorption. The enhanced light absorption of two photonic structures occurred across the whole visible range (Fig. 5k), and the moth-eye structure exhibited a little higher light-harvesting efficiency than that of the grating structure owing to the broadband light response of moth-eye structure.109

From the different functional layers of SCs, many studies focus on the construction of photonic structures on metal electrodes and substrates. In general, the antireflection optical mode is dominant for substrates with photonic structures, and the back reflection/scattering optical mode is common for metal electrodes with photonic structures. Peng et al. demonstrated a nanorod-patterned TiO2 ETL with an electron-beam lithography technique (Fig. 6a).110 The diameter and height of nanorod-patterned TiO2 were 50 and 200 nm (Fig. 6b), respectively, and the corresponding periods with 300, 600, and 1000 nm were tuned.110 The 300 nm pitch nanopatterned perovskite SCs had an average FF of 0.824 ± 0.012 and a PCE of 21.91 ± 0.57%, compared with 0.741 ± 0.017 and19.64 ± 0.55% for planar perovskite SCs (Fig. 6c), respectively.110 The improved FF and PCE result from the reduced series resistance and enhanced light absorption of nanopatterned structures. Tavakoli et al. reported a nanocone-patterned PDMS layer by duplicating the mold, which was attached to the front of perovskite SCs (Fig. 6d).111 The duplicated PDMS nanocone array had a pitch of 1 μm and a depth of 1 μm (Fig. 6e).111 Perovskite SCs attached with the PDMS nanocone array exhibited vivid structural colors. The PDMS nanocone array acting as an antireflection layer can facilitate the optical transmittance and improve the light absorption of SCs through scattering enhancement (Fig. 6f).111 Jsc and PCE of perovskite SCs with nanocone arrays were 19.3 mA cm−2 and 13.14%, 9.04% and 8.96% improvement of control SCs. Zhang et al. demonstrated a rear random nanotexture interface between the Au electrode and HTL by transforming the nanotextured perovskite surface (Fig. 6g).112 The random nanostructure has been proven to support the light-absorption enhancement comparable with the periodic nanostructure. The random nanotextured interface can reduce light escape by the strong light scattering effect, and the light-trapping occurs across the entire wavelength region (Fig. 6h). The light that passes through the perovskite active layer is backscattered into the device, and the backscattered light propagates along paths 1 and 2 (Fig. 6h).112 Path 1 is the non-normal reflection and path 2 is the total internal reflection at interfaces, which prolong the light propagation and redirect the light into the perovskite active layer (Fig. 6h).112 In addition, the surface plasmon resonance of metal contributes to light absorption. The broader backscattering nanotexture increased the Jsc from 22.7 to 23.6 mA cm−2, and PCE from 19.3 to19.8% (Fig. 6i).112 For comparison, perovskite SCs with photonic structures on different functional layers are summarized in Table 1.

3.1.3. Tandem solar cells with photonic structures. Monolithic perovskite tandem (perovskite/perovskite, perovskite/silicon, and perovskite/organic) SCs provide a desirable avenue to improve the conversion efficiency beyond the limits of single-junction SCs.130–132 Combining perovskites with other photosensitive semiconductors in tandem SCs allows for the formation of a complementary bandgap structure that enables efficient utilization of sunlight by broadening the absorption spectrum.133–137 Generally, the front SC has a wide bandgap, which can absorb the short-wavelength photons with high energy. The rear SC has a narrow bandgap, which ensures that the transmitted long-wavelength photons with low energy can be used (Fig. 7a–c).138,139 The effective compensation of bandgaps results in absorbing more photons and reducing the loss of thermalization in SCs (Fig. 7c). In a monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem SC, the mismatch of the refractive index at different interfaces causes the reflection loss (R1 on the surface of perovskite, R2 on the surface of silicon, and R3 on the surface of electrode) of light (Fig. 7a).139 The simulated absorptance and reflectance profiles of current indicate that R1 was dominant in the short-wavelength range, and R2 and R3 were concentrated in the long-wavelength range. Parasitic absorption from other functional layers (indium tin oxide: ITO and HTM) is also found. It is worth noting that the thickness of active layers in tandem SCs is well-adjusted to obtain the current matching of front and rear cells (17.28 mA cm−2). The absorptance and reflectance of current in perovskite/silicon tandem SCs with double-sided texture were also simulated to study the optical loss. The pyramid texture as an antireflection layer on the front and rear cells can effectively decrease the sum of R1, R2, and R3 (Fig. 7b).139 A higher matched current density reached 20.25 mA cm−2. Compared to the planar counterpart, the reduced reflection loss from the mismatched index of media can enhance the current density of tandem SCs. Aydin et al. reported the two-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem SCs on the silicon wafers with double-sided pyramid texture (Fig. 7d).140 The uniform perovskite film and other transport layers were conformally deposited and electrically interconnected on the textured silicon (Fig. 7e and f).140 The double-sided pyramid texture reduced the reflection loss and coupled the light into perovskite (visible light) and silicon (near-infrared light) active layers (Fig. 7g).140 The bandgap and thickness of the perovskite layer were well-tuned to achieve a matched current density of 19.8 mA cm−2, and the PCE of champion tandem SCs was up to 25.1%. Xiao et al. demonstrated the construction of all-perovskite tandem SCs with a narrow-bandgap (1.22 eV) Pb–Sn hybrid perovskite subcell and a wide-bandgap (1.77 eV) pure Pb perovskite subcell (Fig. 7h).141 The simulated current density dependence on the thickness of perovskite films (Fig. 7i) shows that the narrow-bandgap perovskite film with a thickness range of 950–1150 nm and the reasonable thickness of wide-bandgap perovskite films (∼350 nm) would enable a highly matched current density.141 Berry et al. presented three configurations of all-perovskite tandem SCs based on the reported results of Xiao et al., including the planar structure, single 2D PC structure on the 1.77 eV perovskite film, double 2D PC structure on 1.77 eV and 1.22 eV perovskite films (Fig. 7j).28 The structural parameters of 2D PCs were well-adjusted to manipulate the photons corresponding to the bandgaps of perovskites. The results of simulated absorption indicated that the double-sided perovskite films with 2D PC structures can reduce the light reflection and improve the light trapping of SCs. Compared to the planar and single 2D PC SCs, the reduced light loss endowed double 2D PC SCs with a higher integrated Jsc. According to theoretical simulations, the PCE of all-perovskite tandem SCs will exceed 30% through rational optical and electrical design.142

3.1.4. Colorful and semitransparent solar cells. To fulfil the development of building integration and the requirement of visual aesthetics, colorful and semitransparent photovoltaic devices are necessary.63,143 Light management through photonic structures enables the reflection of light with specific wavelengths generating bright structural colors, and allows for the coupling of light into the photoactive layer to compensate for reduced absorption induced by excessive light transmittance.74,144,145 Photonic structures are crucial for the integration of performance and functionalities for colorful and semitransparent photovoltaics. Eperon et al. presented perovskite “islands” with microstructure arrays fabricated by spontaneous dewetting (Fig. 8a).146 The perovskite “islands” with microstructure arrays were length-scale small, and the discontinuous morphology ensured unattenuated light transmission between the two islands (Fig. 8b).146 The “islands” were thick enough to guarantee sufficient light absorption. Dye D102 was incorporated in the spiro-OMeTAD HTL, allowing for “color-tinting” of perovskite SCs without sacrificing transmittance (Fig. 8c and d).146 Owing to the inherent rectification of the ETL and HTL, a relatively high Voc of 0.87 V was achieved, and PCE was up to 6.5%. Kwon et al. fabricated a 1D nanopillar perovskite layer within the anodized aluminum oxide template for SCs (Fig. 8e).118 A 1D nanopillar perovskite layer was applied for a 40.8 cm2 semitransparent perovskite solar module, and the optimized nanopillar perovskite SCs exhibited an average visible-light transmittance of 30.2% (Fig. 8f).118 The vertically aligned nanopillar structure facilitates the light absorption and carrier collection owing to the reduced reflection and directional channel, which improves the optical and electric performance simultaneously. Deng et al. demonstrated the construction of vividly colorful perovskite SCs by constructing 2D photonic structures on a perovskite film. The photonic structure was composed of a large domain grain spanning hundreds of micrometers and one concentric ring structure within the domain (Fig. 8g and h), which was formed via the Rayleigh–Benard convective model and “coffee-ring” effect during the blade coating process.119 The period of the ring photonic structure was controlled by the temperature of the substrate and concentration of the precursor solution. Both perovskite films and SCs exhibited vivid structural color owing to the light management provided by photonic structures (Fig. 8i and j).119 The concentric ring structure in perovskite SCs is also favorable for carrier collection and defect physics (Fig. 8i), and PCE of perovskite SCs based on this photonic structure was up to 12.2%.119

3.2. Perovskite light-emitting diodes
Unlike SCs, LEDs are devices that can convert electrical energy into light, in which the spontaneous recombination of injected electrons and holes produces photoluminescence. The photoluminescence emitted from devices is determined by the IQE of light-emitting materials and light out-coupling efficiency (η) of devices.147 EQE is an important parameter to access the efficiency of LEDs, calculated using the following equation: 
EQE = η·IQE = η·γ·ηS/T·qeff
(3.2)The EQE of LEDs is closely related to the IQE and η. The IQE of active materials is the number of photons radiated by exciton recombination and accounts for the percentage of the number of carriers injected into the device, reflecting the luminescence properties of materials. The IQE depends on the injection balance factor (γ) of electrons and holes, the radiation attenuation fraction (ηS/T) of excitons at room temperature, and radiative quantum yield (qeff).148,149 For light-emitting materials with large exciton binding energy, such as 2D perovskites, ηS/T is unity as the organometallic complex is composed of heavy atoms.56,150 For 3D perovskites with small exciton binding energy, the emission should be a band-to-band transition of free carriers in direct-gap semiconductors. In this case, ηS/T could not be taken into account.151 Based on this, η is crucial for high EQE.152 Unfortunately, compared to the organic functional layer with a refractive index of 1.4–2.0, the perovskite active layer with a high refractive index of ∼2.5 (2.2–2.6) can confine the emitted photons within devices when the emitted light propagates from the perovskite film to organic film.153,154 According to the results of theoretical simulation, only ∼20% of emitted light can be extracted from perovskite LEDs (Fig. 9a), and part of the emitted light is lost through parasitic absorption, and the remaining emitted light is confined in waveguide and substrate modes.155 The unextracted emitted light in LED devices, especially within waveguide and substrate modes, can be converted into heat, which greatly damages the perovskite materials and deteriorates the performance of devices, leading to the roll-off of EQE. Light management of photonic structures is imperative to enhance the light out-coupling efficiency of η, thus improving the EQE.156

3.2.1. Light out-coupling in the waveguide mode. In conventional LEDs, an optical microcavity is formed between ITO and metal electrodes. Owing to the weak cavity effect, the length of the microcavity is adjusted to achieve the maximum light out-coupling efficiency, which results in Lambertian-like light emission from devices (Fig. 9b).157 The emitted light is confined within waveguide and substrate modes due to the significant disparity in the refractive index between the interfaces. Constructing photonic structures on functional layers not only suppresses the substrate mode and extracts the light from the waveguide mode, but also redirects the light emission direction to realize the all-area highly directional polarized light emission (Fig. 9c).157 Cao et al. demonstrated perovskite LEDs with spontaneously formed submicrometre-scale perovskite structures (Fig. 9d).158 The submicrometre-scale structure was spontaneously formed by a simple solvent engineering method at low temperature. The resulting perovskite film was discontinuous with random faceted platelets and roughly rectangular shapes, and the grain size was 100–500 nm (Fig. 9e).158 The irregular structure with a concave–convex feature was constructed on both the high-index perovskite and low-index organic functional layers through the use of structure conformality (Fig. 9d and e).158 Ray A in Fig. 9d is the conventional light propagation path, in which the emitted light enters the organic layer and glass substrate. Ray B and C are the omnidirectional light-emitting path derived by the light manipulation of the spontaneous concave–convex structure on perovskite and organic layers. The continuous photon cycle of the photonic structures can extract the light confined in the waveguide mode and promote the light out-coupling efficiency of η, leading to a high peak emission EQE of 20.7% and an energy-conversion efficiency (ECE) of 12% at a current density of 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 9f).158 Shen et al. presented bioinspired perovskite LEDs by nanoimprinting the moth-eye nanostructure at the interface between the front electrode and the perovskite active layer (Fig. 9g).159 The moth-eye nanostructure had a period of ∼400 nm, and a groove depth of ∼50 nm (Fig. 9h).159 From the results of FDTD simulation, the near-field intensity of transverse electric (TE) polarized light is effectively outcoupled by the photonic structure (Fig. 9i), and the calculated enhancement of light out-coupling efficiency is 1.94 compared to the flat pristine perovskite LEDs.159 The maximum EQE of moth-eye perovskite LEDs was improved to 20.3%, and an EQE of 28.2% was achieved by using a half-ball lens. In addition, the moth-eye perovskite LEDs exhibited angular independent light emission. These results indicate that the moth-eye nanostructure constructed at the interface between the front electrode and the perovskite active layer facilitates the light extraction from devices, especially for photons confined within the waveguide mode.
3.2.2. Light out-coupling in substrate modes and 3D curved LEDs. From the calculated power fraction of optical models in perovskite LEDs, the confinement of emitted photons in substrate modes is another issue that deteriorates the efficiency of devices.160–163 Light management of photonic structures is also beneficial to mitigate the mismatch of refractive index and extract the emitted photons within the substrate mode.156,164 In addition, curved LEDs with photonic structures can bring a better visual experience and greater flexibility than their planar counterparts.165–167 However, the issues of technology and materials, such as the non-uniformity of perovskite film formation, poor material stability (low moisture resistance is limited to a glovebox), and substrate size constraints, hamper the widely used spin-coating method in the large area or non-planar (curved) LEDs. Constructing photonic structures using a vapour reaction approach can help tackle this problem. Zhang et al. reported the large-area planar and spherical light-emitting diodes based on the crystalline perovskite quantum wires (Fig. 10a), which were grown into a hydrophobic porous alumina membrane by a close-spaced vapour reaction method.168 The thickness of the porous alumina membrane was ∼5 nm, serving as a tunneling layer for electron injection. The diameter and height of perovskite quantum wires were ∼6 and ∼200 nm (Fig. 10b), respectively.168 Benefiting from the enhanced light out-coupling efficiency and quantum confinement effect of perovskite quantum nanowires, EQE and current efficiency of perovskite LEDs reached 7.3% and 22 cd A−1 (Fig. 10c), respectively.168 The perovskite quantum nanowires were also applied to spherical LEDs by taking advantage of this fabrication method (Fig. 10d).168 The 3D perovskite spherical LEDs exhibited spatially uniform electroluminescence (Fig. 10e, the yellow shadow was attributed to the background light reflection).168 Zhang et al. demonstrated perovskite LEDs with nanodome and nanowire structures (Fig. 10f).169 The anodic alumina membrane was used as a 3D photonic substrate, with the nanodome structure acting as a light coupler and the nanowire structure serving as an optical antenna to enhance the light extraction from LEDs. The thickness, pore diameter, and two pitches of the anodic alumina membrane were ∼3 μm, ∼120 nm, and 500 and 1000 nm, respectively (Fig. 10g).169 Different functional layers in LEDs had conformal nanodome structures derived from the porous alumina membrane, and the pores of the alumina membrane were embedded with TiO2 nanowires. Owing to the higher refractive index of TiO2 (n = 2.6) than that of alumina (n = 1.7), the TiO2 nanowires in the alumina membrane can function as an optical antenna. The FDTD method was used to simulate the field intensity in LEDs (Fig. 10h).169 The dashed line in the cross-sectional profile is the light-out plane. It is clearly evident that the waveguide and substrate modes were converted to a leaky mode that can be extracted as radiative light. The photonic substrate in perovskite LEDs undergoes a two-step light extraction process including the light out-coupling of the nanodome coupler into the nanowire antenna and conversion of the confined energy in guided modes into a leaky mode by the nanowire antenna. This synergistic effect endowed perovskite LEDs with an EQE of 17.5%, twice higher than that of planar LEDs. Miao et al. presented a microcavity top-emission in perovskite LEDs.170 The microcavity was constructed using two Au electrodes comprising a total-reflection bottom electrode and a semitransparent top electrode in devices. By adjusting the length of the optical microcavity by altering the thickness of the carrier transport layer, the microcavity effect can be strengthened, enhancing the light out-coupling efficiency. A high EQE of 20.2% and radiant exitance of 114.9 mW cm−2 were achieved. The key parameters of perovskite LEDs with photonic structures are summarized in Table 2.

3.3. Perovskite photodetectors
PDs are devices that can convert light signals into electrical signals, having great potential applications in bioimaging, optical communication, environmental monitoring, and aerial detection.175,176 Perovskite materials with exceptional photophysical properties are promising for PDs with highly sensitive light detection. However, the poor light absorption due to the high refractive index of perovskites, and the requirement for integration and novel functionalities in devices limit the practical applications of perovskites in PDs.177,178 These limits have prompted great efforts in photonic structures with micro-nano periodic arrays for perovskite PDs. In addition to the improved light trapping in PDs through light management by the photonic structures, the unique feature of structural morphology can also lead to novel optical performance, such as polarized light imaging and detection of 1D structure patterned perovskite PDs. Moreover, the perovskite films with structure arrays provide a feasible approach for integrated optoelectronic devices.
3.3.1. Light trapping of photonic structures. As a light-absorbing layer in PDs, the introduction of photonic structures can reduce the mismatch of refractive indexes at interfaces (nperovskites ≥ ntransport layers or nperovskites ≥ nair), thus enhancing the light trapping and sensitive detection of devices. The light-trapping of photonic structures in PDs is similar to that in SCs. Zhan et al. reported a butterfly-inspired hierarchical light-trapping structure for perovskite PDs by nanoimprinting and nanosphere lithography approaches (Fig. 11a).179 In this hierarchical light-trapping structure, the diffracted nanograting as an antireflective structure can reduce the light reflection and prolong the optical path through the diffracted effect. The porous PS as a back mirror can reflect the transmitted light into light-absorbing layer. In addition, the waveguide can be generated in perovskite films due to the large index difference between perovskites and air (nperovskites ≥ nair). The hierarchical architecture composed of 1D diffracted nanogratings and 2D porous PCs can effectively couple more incident photons into the perovskite active layer and enhance the light utilization (Fig. 11a and b).179 The nanograting structure had a period of ∼750 nm, a line width of ∼250 nm, and a nanoimprinted height of ∼120 nm. The diameter of porous size in PCs was ∼450 nm (Fig. 11b1 and b2).179 The bright and vivid structural color on both the front and back sides confirmed that the hierarchical photonic structure was successfully constructed on perovskite films (Fig. 11b3).179 The results of FDTD simulation (λ = 750 nm) also indicated that the field intensity in the perovskite layer with the hierarchical structure is higher than that of other perovskite layers with a single or without photonic structure, especially in the band near the bandgap of materials (Fig. 11c).179 As mentioned above, the reduced light reflection and transmission caused by the hierarchical structure can promote the light absorption in perovskite films. This synergistic effect of antireflection and back reflection of the hierarchical light-trapping structure enabled a D* of up to 3.22 × 1013 Jones for perovskite PDs, 6 times higher than that of planar PDs (Fig. 11d).179 Xue et al. fabricated Mie-scattering porous perovskite films for PDs using a freeze-drying recrystallization technique (Fig. 11e).180 The Mie porous perovskite films were compact and consistent, and the fused interface between two grains was electrically conductive for the transportation and collection of photogenerated carriers (Fig. 11f and g).180 The Mie scattering in a porous structure can reduce the light reflection and redirect the scattered light into the perovskite layer to enhance its absorption. Improvements in both optical and electrical performance endowed perovskite PDs with a light responsivity of 2.7 A W−1 (Fig. 11h).180 Cao et al. demonstrated bionic perovskite PDs for selective near-infrared I photon detection and imaging by designing delicate optical microcavities (Fig. 11i).181 The bionic microcavity was constructed with consecutively alternating layers of LiF (n = 1.33) and N,N′-bis(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine (NPB, n = 2.1), and the thickness of each layer was tuned to be a quarter of the target wavelength (Fig. 11j).181 The waveband (700–900 nm wavelength, covering the near-infrared I range) with a half maximum of <50 nm was achieved by adjusting the thickness of the dielectric medium (Fig. 11k).181 Taking the specific wavelength of 850 nm as an example, the thicknesses of LiF and NPB were chosen as 158 and 116 nm, respectively. This selective near-infrared I photon detection via the reasonable optical microcavity structure holds great promise for bioimaging and optical communication. The key parameters of perovskite PDs with different photonic structures are summarized in Table 3.

3.3.2. Polarized light detection and imaging with photonic structures. Not only can photonic structures improve the optical and electrical performance of perovskite PDs, but also afford the novel optical properties owing to the unique structure feature.3,201–205 Zhou et al. reported a perovskite nanowire–block copolymer composite with polarization anisotropy (Fig. 12a).206 The orientation and composition of composite were well controlled via a 3D printing method, in which the ink was composed of perovskite nanowires suspended in a block copolymer matrix. The shear-induced alignment of nanowires and copolymers, and the geometric confinement effect from the supramolecular architecture of copolymers endowed the resulting composite with programmable orientation. The preferred orientation enabled the composite with polarized and angular emission owing to the anisotropy of 1D nanowires (Fig. 12b).206 In the Fourier images, a horizontally aligned nanowire had bright lobes at an angle perpendicular to the axis, and a vertically aligned nanowire exhibited a symmetric dipole about the azimuthal angle (φ) owing to the rotational symmetry. One polarizer was used in the emission path, and two polarizers were used in both the excitation and emission paths to study the polarized light emission of as-fabricated composite (Fig. 12c).206 The emitted light exhibited an angle-dependent emission behavior, and the polarization ratio of emission was improved by using two polarizers. Song et al. presented the moiré perovskite PDs with a stacked dual shallow nanograting structure via the nanoimprinting method (Fig. 12d and e).182 The enhanced light-harvesting capability was achieved through the synergistic effect of multiple mechanisms including the antireflection of front grating, waveguide in active layer, and back reflection of back grating (Fig. 12e and f).182 Benefiting from the anisotropy of 1D directional dual grating structure, polarized light detection and imaging were realized by moiré perovskite PDs. When the incident light propagated through a polarizer installed in the excitation path, the polarized light was formed by changing the relative angle between the polarizer and the moiré perovskite PDs. A sample with s-and p-polarization properties was fabricated for polarized light imaging (Fig. 12g), and a digital polarization image with different current distribution was obtained using a 576 pixels sensor array (Fig. 12h).182

3.3.3. Integrated optoelectronics with photonic structures. Integrated optoelectronics with small size and light weight can strengthen the fidelity of information and facilitate device miniaturization, making them highly suitable for applications in flexible wearable devices, soft robots, and imaging systems.207–209 Photonic structure arrays provide a feasible and low-cost fabrication approach for integrated optoelectronics.210–213 Gu et al. demonstrated a bioinspired electrochemical eye using perovskite nanowire arrays as a hemispherical retina (Fig. 13a).183 The perovskite nanowire array acted as a PD (photoreceptor) for light detection and imaging. A perovskite nanowire array with a high density of 4.6 × 108 cm−2 was fabricated in a hemispherical porous aluminum oxide membrane via vapor deposition reaction (Fig. 13b1).183 The bottom channel of the porous aluminum oxide membrane was filled with perovskite single crystals and the pitch of nanowires array was ∼500 nm (Fig. 13b2 and b3).183 In this artificial eye, an ionic liquid was selected as an electrolyte to establish contact with nanowires on the front side, which mimics the role of vitreous humour in human eyes. The liquid–metal wires were used as back contacts for light signals taking inspiration from the human nerve fibers. Each individual perovskite nanowire was contacted and selected by the corresponding liquid–metal wire, reducing the loss and distraction of information in signal transmission (Fig. 13c).183 When contacting with external circuitry through the liquid–metal wires, each perovskite nanowire PD was powered by electricity and high-resolution imaging was achieved using this artificial eye (Fig. 13d).183 Deng et al. reported an integrated PD with perovskite single-crystal arrays using a microchannel-confined crystallization technique (Fig. 13e).214 The crystallization of perovskites confined in the microchannel enabled the blade coating of uniform single-crystal arrays with suitable thickness. The integrated image sensor with a vertically stacked structure was fabricated based on these perovskite single-crystal arrays. 2D current mapping of letter “A” was obtained indicating the successful operation of all pixels and uniform photoresponse of the integrated device (Fig. 13f).214 Wu et al. presented an integrated PD using perovskite arrays on a patterned Al2O3 layer with hydrophilic–hydrophobic treatment (Fig. 13g).215 An individual perovskite array as a PD was extracted by establishing contact with the metal electrode for integration (Fig. 13h).215 The integrated PD was also fabricated on a flexible substrate for large-scale and flexible devices (Fig. 13i).215 The letter “H” was used for light imaging (Fig. 13j).215 When the white light passed through the letter, a significant electrical signal was obtained for high-resolution imaging. These photonic structure arrays are feasible for integrated optoelectronics with photosensitive detection and imaging.

3.4. Perovskite lasers
A laser is composed of a gain medium capable of amplifying light within a resonator or cavity, which serves as feedback.216–218 The amplification occurs through a stimulated emission mechanism (Fig. 14a).219 A photon stimulation may lead to stimulated absorption and stimulated radiation in the gain medium. Once the number of photons from the stimulated radiation exceeds the number of photons of stimulated absorption, an amplified light emission is achieved. The optical loss in a laser mainly comes from the light emitted from the reflective surface and the light absorption of the medium. Benefiting from the tunable bandgap, narrow full width at half maximum, high PLQY, and optical gain, perovskite materials hold great promise in laser applications.220 Photonic structures play a positive role in amplified light emission by providing an optical cavity or a resonator as feedback for more stimulated radiation photons, thus producing laser oscillations.216,221–223 Moreover, the optical mode of simulated light emission can be well modulated via photonic structures.224–226

3.4.1. Amplified light emission with photonic structures. Superior photophysical properties make perovskite materials a competitive gain medium for lasers. The optical cavity or resonator structure as feedback is favorable for light emission amplification. As mentioned in Section 3.4, both gain medium and feedback are indispensable elements in perovskite lasers. The aim of the feedback induced from the optical cavity or resonator is to build an intense optical field in lasers by driving the resonant light that repeatedly passes through the gain medium. One simple optical cavity can be considered as two mirrors, with the same configuration as that of the Fabry–Pérot resonance cavity. The gain medium is located between two mirrors (Fig. 14b).219 As the gain medium was stimulated, a standing-wave optical field was generated between two mirrors. The second optical cavity is a ring optical resonator with three or more mirrors, such as the configuration of WG resonance structures (Fig. 14b). In this resonator, the stimulated light circulates as a travelling wave along the circular route. Cho et al. reported submicrometer perovskite lasers with 3D plasmonic cavities at room temperature. The 3D submicrometer perovskites, including both cuboid-shaped structures with size 0.58 μm × 0.56 μm × 0.32 μm and plate-shaped structures with size 0.79 μm × 0.66 μm × 0.18 μm, were fabricated on an Au substrate coated with the polynorepinephrine polymer (Fig. 14c).227 The field intensity distribution of theoretical simulation shows that the perovskite lasers (0.58 μm × 0.56 μm × 0.32 μm) had two optical modes (mode 1, M1 and mode 2, M2, Fig. 14d).227 M1 was a Fabry–Pérot resonance mode, and M2 appeared to be a WG resonance mode. The field intensity distributed inside the gap along with the presence of intense energy in the crystal, indicating that both optical modes exhibited hybrid resonances (Fig. 14d).227 This device exhibited multimode lasers (MI and M2) above the threshold fluence (Fig. 14e), which was consistent with that of the theoretical simulation.227 In addition, the strong reflection compensated for the parasitic absorption loss caused by the Au substrate. These hybrid resonances in this plasmonic cavity mode contributed to achieving the lasing threshold. Yang et al. demonstrated the giant Purcell enhancement in the perovskite lasers with a subwavelength-scale cavity, leading to an unrivalled spatiotemporal control via the tailored ultrafast emission dynamics and radiation patterns (Fig. 14f).228 The strong Purcell effect was achieved through hybrid surface plasmon polaritons coupled with perovskites, and the plasmonic and loss channels of trapping state were greatly reduced. The perovskite–plasmon cavity was constructed on the Ag substrate coated with thin MgF2 films, in which the electromagnetic energy was concentrated in the gap region (<λ/100), resulting in the normalized electric field distribution. This configuration not only produced strong optical confinement but also reduced parasitic absorption losses associated with the metal substrate. In addition, the smooth surface of the Ag substrate decreased the scattering loss. The high field intensity at the interface between the perovskite and Ag substrate indicated internal reflection (Fig. 14g).228 These collective advantages produced an enhanced Purcell effect in the perovskite–plasmon cavity.Chen et al. presented a laser by spin-coating the precursor solution onto the patterned 2D PC substrate. The 2D PC perovskite film was uniform, and the period of PC array was ∼400 nm (Fig. 14h).229 The 2D PC resonator with hexagonal symmetry afforded a feedback effect, and a large difference in the refractive index between perovskites (n ∼ 2.7) and the quartz substrate (n ∼ 1.5) strengthened the optical mode at the symmetry Γ-points, which is beneficial for single-mode lasing. The diffraction spot was found by propagating the emitted laser from a rectangular aperture (Fig. 14i).229 Below the threshold, the lasing emission had a broad spectrum with a line width of 32.2 nm. Above the threshold, the emission peak and line width of 2D PC perovskite lasers were 788.1 nm and 0.24 nm, respectively (Fig. 14j).229 Pourdavoud et al. fabricated low-threshold perovskite lasers using a grated substrate by a nanoimprinting method. The perovskite films exhibited high crystallinity with large grain sizes through thermal nanoimprinting with a flat stamp. The nanograted substrate with a mismatched index at the interface provides a strong distributed feedback for amplified spontaneous emission originating from the vertical cavity surface. Above the threshold, a laser with an emission peak of 539.1 nm at a low threshold of 7.2 μJ cm−2 was achieved (Fig. 14k).230

3.4.2. Light modulation with photonic structures. Apart from the amplified light emission from the perovskite gain medium, the photonic structures also serve as an optical modulator for tunable light emission modulation via light–structure interaction.231 Huang et al. demonstrated an approach for ultrafast control of vortex microlasers using a perovskite metasurface (Fig. 15a and b).232 When a blue pumping laser passed through the perovskite metasurface, a green vortex beam in the vertical direction was achieved (Fig. 15a).232 The structural parameters of the metasurface were optimized by theoretical calculation to obtain high-quality factors and low-threshold lasing. At low pumping intensity, a broad spectrum at 520 nm was observed. By increasing the pumping intensity, a single narrow spectrum at 552 nm was observed (Fig. 15c).232 The continuous lasing with different pumping intensities exhibited an S-shape curve (Fig. 15d).232 On this periodic perovskite metasurface, bounded states in the continuum were formed by the interaction between the resonance modes and radiation modes, which led to the ultrafast control of transition from vortex lasers to conventional linearly polarized lasers within ∼1.5 ps. The transition between asymmetric pump light and circular beam turned two linearly polarized beams back into vortex lasers within ∼1.5 ps (Fig. 15e).232 This controlling method overcomes the trade-off between low-energy consumption and fast-speed modulation at room temperature. Sun et al. presented a vortex perovskite microlaser by introducing a bullseye-like ring grating structure (Fig. 15f).233 The period and duty ratio of the bullseye-like ring were 282 nm and 0.7, respectively. The resonances in the bullseye-like ring grating structure suggested that only one optical mode with high-quality factors was found, which was confined to the perovskite waveguide due to the low index of air in the spiral space (Fig. 15g).233 From the rotational symmetry of bullseye-like ring, the beam profiles of perovskite microlasers from the front and back sides exhibited a donut-shaped beam (Fig. 15h).233 When the polarized laser propagated through the perovskite microlasers, the donut laser beam was transformed into two lobes and the direction of the two lobes changed with the angle of the polarizer. Furthermore, the Archimedean spiral of the vortex grating structure was adjusted by the electron beam lithography method. The different Archimedean spirals of the vortex grating structure correspond to the respective topological charges. The self-coherent interference of the vortex grating structure that corresponds to the topological charges indicated the existence of phase singularity.

4. Summary and outlook
Perovskites with superior photophysical properties and simple solution processing have emerged as a competitive photosensitive semiconductor for SCs, LEDs, PDs, and lasers. The remarkable conversion efficiency has witnessed the booming development of perovskite optoelectronics in the last decade. However, the further improvement of conversion efficiency and commercial demand for multifunctional performance have spurred the research focus on the intrinsic properties of perovskite materials and the structure designing of optoelectronic devices. The high refractive index issue of perovskites leads to the index mismatch at the interface, which results in poor unitization of light from the Fresnel reflection and transmission,115,234,235 and low light extraction efficiency due to the waveguide and substrate modes.171,236 Photonic structures with periodic features are of significant importance for light management, redirecting the optical path and coupling the photons into or out of devices.237–239 Given the different working mechanisms of light-absorbing and light-emitting devices, the functionalities of the photonic structures are not identical. Light-management strategies including antireflection, scattering enhancement, resonance modes, and PCs are predominant ways for light trapping, light out-coupling, light emission, and light modulation. Based on the reported works, perovskite optoelectronics with photonic structures have attracted intense attention, and great progress has been achieved. In addition to the improvement of conversion efficiency, other multifunctional performance involving colorful, semitransparent, polarization-sensitive, and 3D spherical optoelectronic devices have been demonstrated. The current progress is encouraging, but there is still a long way to go before commercialization can be realized. Therefore, we conceive the following strategies to make further progress towards the target of developing multifunctional commercial perovskite optoelectronics.
i. Reasonable structure design for effective light management and carrier transportation should be taken into consideration. The trade-off between optical and electrical performance is always an obstacle. The general view is that more defect sites are created with the increased specific surface area by introducing photonic structures at the interface, which affect the carrier transportation and collection.240–242 To tackle this obstacle, radial p–n junctions with an ordered structure are constructed to facilitate carrier transportation and collection by shortening the transportation path along the unidirectional channel.243 Moreover, the structural parameters, such as the shape morphology, periodic pitch, and aspect ratio should be optimized by the theoretical simulation to guarantee the uniformity of functional layers and promote carrier distribution. The time-averaged electromagnetic field distribution and intensity in devices can help us design the rational structure. It is worth noting that the photonic structure with a high aspect ratio should be avoided, which is harmful for the transportation and collection of photogenerated carriers.
ii. Alternative fabrication techniques should be explored to realize the universal and scale-up construction of photonic structures, especially for non-planar structures.244 During the solution-processing of perovskite films, the intermediate state opens a window for fabricating optoelectronics with photonic structures. Nanoimprinting is also appropriate to prepare structures by taking advantage of the intermediate states. Photolithography and ion beam etching technologies can help construct structures on the fabricated perovskite films, but would cause damage to the films.245–247 In addition, the template with patterned structure arrays is favorable for the growth of perovskites and the integration of devices.185,248,249 For non-planar optoelectronics, such as 3D spherical PDs and LEDs, and perovskite/silicon tandem SCs with double-sided pyramid texture, the chemical vapor-assisted deposition method can provide the exact conformality for structural transformation.250
iii. Perovskite single-crystal arrays with photonic structures have great potential in integrated optoelectronics applications. However, the reported works mainly focus on the micro–nano structured polycrystalline arrays, and the perovskite single-crystal arrays are rare. Compared to polycrystalline perovskites, single-crystal arrays are more attractive for high-performance optoelectronics since their high crystallinity generates fewer defects. The synchronization of structure construction and perovskite crystallization in a micro–nano channel or on a patterned template can lead to the production of a single-crystal array with fewer defects owing to the space-confined effect.251–253 Recently, the nanoimprinting approach has been developed to construct photonic structures on single crystals during crystallization.198,254 Given the time-consuming fabrication of perovskite single crystals, exploring alternative promising technologies for constructing single-crystal arrays is necessary. Photonic structured perovskite single-crystal arrays will open a new avenue for multifunctional optoelectronics.
iv. The functionalities of photonic structures should be integrated within perovskite optoelectronics for practical applications. For example, 3D artificial retina with perovskite single-crystal arrays as photosensors in a bioinspired electrochemical eye was demonstrated for light perception as well as high-resolution light imaging.183 The perovskite quantum wires in 3D spherical LEDs as a light-emitting layer enhanced the light out-coupling efficiency and produced angular-independent emission.168 The nanocellular-structured PEDOT:PSS in wearable perovskite SCs was reported to improve the light-harvesting efficiency and mechanical robustness as a stress buffer.108 A moiré perovskite PD with a double 1D nanograting structure was presented to possess enhanced light absorption and polarization-sensitive imaging.182 The photonic structure endowed colorful and semitransparent perovskite SCs with high conversion efficiency owing to the light management.118,120 The integrated functionalities of photonic structures have become a trend and new direction for multifunctional perovskite optoelectronics.
In short, photonic structures can realize the integration of morphology and functionalities for high-performance and multifunctional perovskite optoelectronic devices, promoting their practical applications in wearable flexible optoelectronics, optical communication, imaging, and displays.

Broader context
The successive improvement of conversion efficiency has witnessed the booming advancement of perovskite optoelectronics. However, the high index and thin thickness of perovskite films cause Fresnel reflection and transmission of incident light, and confine the emitted photons in waveguide and substrate modes. This undesired light management affects the utilization of incident photons and extraction of emitted photons, thus deteriorating the conversion efficiency of optoelectronic devices. Therefore, light management is crucial for perovskites, given their direct band gap and high refractive index. Photonic structures afford robust means to manipulate photons through the interaction between media and photons. In this review, the light-manipulation mechanism of photonic structures is discussed, and a reasonable structural design on different functional layers of individual optoelectronics is presented. In addition, promising strategies for high-performance multifunctional perovskite optoelectronics are proposed to promote their practical applications.
