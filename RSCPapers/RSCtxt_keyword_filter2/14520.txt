        TiO2
nanotube arrays (NTAs) on transparent conducting oxides (TCO) have attracted great attention due to the potential application in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Here, we introduce the template-assisted process for direct fabrication of aligned TiO2 NTAs on TCO substrates, involving layer-by-layer adsorption and reaction (LBL-AR) assembled TiO2 coating on ZnO nanorods (NR). Key factors of the fabrication process on the microstructures of TiO2 NTAs are analyzed, and the geometry effects of TiO2 NTAs on the performance and electron transport properties of DSCs are investigated by using electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). An efficiency of 4.25% (under AM1.5 irradiation, 100 mW cm−2) is obtained from N719 sensitized 20 μm thick TiO2 NTAs with a wall thickness of 20 nm, with Jsc = 8.2 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.81 V and FF = 63%.
Introduction
As a potential cost-effective photovoltaic device, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are of great interest with the increasing demands on clean energy.1 Recently, DSCs with conversion efficiencies of approaching 12% have been reported,2 with 10 μm thick TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) films as the photoanodes. The highly porous structure in TiO2 NP photoanodes provides high surface area for sufficient dye loading and light harvesting. However, the tremendous crystalline boundaries and disordered pore structures were found to induce carrier losses by limiting the electron diffusion and redox infiltration.3 Therefore, considerable efforts have been devoted to explore alternative photoanode structures for superior carrier collection and light harvesting abilities,4,5 including one-dimensional (1D) nanowires, nanotube arrays, hierarchical and hybrid structures. Among them, ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTAs) have attracted much attention for advantages of reduced crystalline boundaries, vectorial electron transport along the axis and internal electrical field that facilitated carrier separation.6–11 Besides, the arrays structure is also preferred by electrolyte penetration and would benefit the potential solid state DSCs by avoiding voids in the hole transport materials (HTMs).
The typical methods that have been developed for ordered TiO2 NTAs include the anodization technique and template-assisted processes. So far, the direct anodization of Ti foils are still the most prevailing method, since the geometry parameters of length, radius and wall thickness have been well investigated and could be tuned over a broad range.12–14 The dye loading capability of anodized TiO2 NTAs with diameters of 95 nm and wall thicknesses of 10 nm approaches that of nanocrystalline films, however, the resulting TiO2 NTA-based DSCs are generally constructed in a back illuminated geometry and their performances are limited by the losses (∼25%) at the counter electrode and electrolyte.12 Efficiencies of above 7% are generally reported with anodized Ti foils, which are comparable with the nanocrystalline photoanodes in the same configuration. By combining the sputtering technique, Grimes et al. have demonstrated front illuminated nanotube DSCs.15 After overcoming challenges on interface etching and surface debris during the anodization, thick TiO2 nanotube arrays up to 33 μm were successfully fabricated on TCO recently.16 However, the efficiency (6.86%) they reported is slightly lower than that of back illuminated nanotube DSCs, which is probably limited by the thick oxide barrier layer at the bottom of the anodized TiO2 nanotubes. Another instance to transfer anodized TiO2 NTAs to TCO glass is the peeling off and adhesion strategy,17 which has shown promising efficiencies of above 9% with the assistance of TiO2 nanocrystalline pastes. However, the scale up fabrication is still the major obstacle for these processes, from either the cost effective view or fragile manipulation of TiO2 nanotube membrane.
Compared to the anodization technique, the template-assisted strategies are far from developed. It generally involves three steps: (i) fabrication of templates, (ii) TiO2 backfilling to obtain laminated layer structures, and (iii) selectively removing the template to obtain TiO2 NTAs. Many templates have been employed in this method, including anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) and ZnO nanorod arrays (NRAs). In the case of AAO, a variety of backfilling approaches have been employed for the formation of TiO2 coating, such as sol–gel,18,19atomic layer deposition (ALD) and the recent liquid phase ALD.20,21 However, the templated TiO2 NTAs seem to suffer the same adhesion problems as those fabricated from the common anodization technique.22,23 Besides, the AAO template-assisted processes have to face the same challenges as anodized TiO2 nanotubes when transferred to TCO substrates. On the contrary, the ZnO NRAs template may provide an optimal solution, since its large scale fabrication on various substrates, such as fluorine tin oxide (FTO) and Si, have been well developed. The preferential etching characteristic along [0001] would also facilitate the mild template removal with a top-down etching process. Leu et al. developed a liquid phase deposition (LPD) for simultaneous coating of TiO2 and etching of the inner ZnO core, which has been widely employed for the fabrication of TiO2 NTAs on TCO.24 Incorporating this process, Gao et al. have fabricated 11 μm thick TiO2 NTAs on TCO which yielded an efficiency of 3.6% when applied in DSCs.25 Earlier in 2006, we also reported a sol–gel process on ZnO NRAs and fabricated 1.5 μm thick TiO2 nanotube arrays on glass substrates.26,27 However, the shrinkage of absorbed TiO2 sol made it difficult to obtain well dispersed and crack free nanotube arrays, especially in the case of high aspect ratio ZnO NRAs. At the same time, the length of ZnO NRAs templated TiO2 NTAs is not comparable with that of anodized TiO2, limiting its application in DSCs due to insufficient surface area for dye-loading.
Here, layer by layer adsorption and reaction (LBL-AR) was used as a backfilling approach to deposit TiO2 coating on the surface of ZnO NRAs template. The LBL-AR procedure, similar to the successive layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) procedure,28 involves multiple successive dipping of the substrate in different reaction precursors and the substrate rinsing procedures in between. Results show that compared with other backfilling approaches, the LBL-AR method shows several merits, including: (1) high deposition efficiency as well as high quality coating, (2) environmentally friendly as well as low cost., (3) mesoporous structure as well as vertical alignment, (4) precise structural control as well as broad fabrication conditions and (5) abundant structural derivations as well as facile surface-functionalization.29 In this work, based on our fabrication of ultralong ZnO NRA templates by using the improved hydrothermal method,30 we investigate the key factors of LBL-AR, such as ZnO NRAs length, coating cycle number and etching solution agents for aligned TiO2 NTAs on TCO substrates. At the same time, the geometry effects of TiO2 NTAs on the performance and electron transport properties of DSCs are investigated by using electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), exploiting the potential for a further increase in power conversion efficiency.
Experimental
The fabrication process involves preparation of template ZnO NRAs, surface coating of TiO2 shell via LBL-AR manner and mild acid etching by dilute TiCl4 or HCl, which is generally illustrated in Fig. 1. ZnO NRAs grown on the TCO substrates with various lengths of 10, 20, 30, 50, 80μm are employed as the templates for the following derivation toward TiO2 NTAs. The general preparation of ZnO NRAs templates could be found in our earlier work30 with the details provided in current supporting information.

Fabrication of TiO2 nanotube arrays
Layer by layer adsorption and reaction (LBL-AR) was carried out in a homemade three-dimensional autonomic dip-coating apparatus. One LBL-AR cycle consists of four typical steps: (1) adsorption of Ti species by immersing ZnO NRAs templates into TiO2 sol, (2) removal of loosely bound species by rinsing in ethanol, (3) hydrolysis into TiO2 coating by immersing into distilled water and adsorption of hydroxyls, and (4) dissolving excess water and weakly-bound TiO2 nanoparticles by rinsing in ethanol. The TiO2 sol is composed of 0.5 M tetrabutyltitanate (TBT) and 0.5 M acetylacetone in ethanol, while the hydroxyls are simply provided by the distilled water. The acetylacetone is introduced into the TiO2 sol as a modifying agent, to inhibit unfavorable homogeneous precipitation during hydrolysis reactions. Besides, stability of the TiO2 sol in humid environments is also improved, which makes this process more reliable. In practice, the templates are immersed in each solution for 45 s to achieve thorough desorption of excess species and high quality surface coating. The prepared ZnO–TiO2 core–shell samples are calcined at 550 °C for the initial removal of organic residuals. The inner core of the ZnO–TiO2 core–shell structure is removed by selective wet chemical etching in a dilute aqueous solution of HCl (1%) or TiCl4 (15 mM) for 2 h. Here, the etching time must be precisely controlled to (i) completely remove the ZnO NRAs templates and (ii) prevent the dissolution of the ZnO seed layer for a good adhesion between TiO2 NTAs and TCO substrate. The obtained nanotube samples are then calcined at 550 °C for crystallization. All of the above chemicals are of analytical grade and used as received.
Surface area and pore analysis
The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method is used to determine the specific surface area of TiO2 NTAs. Size distribution of the pores is estimated by analyzing the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The corresponding pore structure on nanotube walls is observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F). Dye desorption experiments in dilute NaOH solution are also conducted to verify the surface area information, assuming monolayer dye molecular coverage on TiO2 surface.

DSC fabrication and photovoltaic characterization

          TiO2
          NTAs (after post treatment in 40 mM TiCl4 solution, 70 °C, followed by calcination at 550 °C) are sensitized by N719 by immersing in 0.5 mM ethanol solution of N719 for 12 h. The catalytic counter electrodes are 50 nm thick Pt coated F:SnO2 glass, which are deposited by e-beam evaporation. Hot-melt polypropylene spacers with a thickness of 100 μm are used to seal the photoanodes and counter electrodes into sandwich cells. The electrolyte (0.5 M tetrabutylammonium iodide, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M 4-tertbutylpyridine in acetonitrile), was then introduced in by injection and capillary force. A mask of 0.25 cm2 as the photoanode area is employed during the characterization for the calibration of cell area. Silver contacts were made on the electrodes by colloidal silver paste to minimize the contact resistance during the photovoltaic measurements. Photovoltaic characterization of fabricated nanotube DSCs is conducted on an electrochemical work station (CHI-660B), simulated AM1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2) is provided by an Oriel simulator (300 W, 91160B).
Definition of transport and recombination parameters
Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) are measured at open circuit voltage with an ac bias signal of 10 mV in the frequency range 10−1–105 Hz, to analyze the electron transport properties in prepared TiO2 NTA-based DSCs. A suggested equivalent circuit (see Fig. 7c), which is proposed according to the diffusion–recombination model,31 is employed to fit the impedance spectra for extracting the impedance of the TiO2 NTA photoanode. The transmission line model (DX type 11-Bisquert #2, in Zview) is used to simulate the behavior of TiO2 NTAs in contact with the electrolyte, is discussed later. Parameters of transport resistance rw, recombination resistance rk and chemical capacitance cp are obtained in the form of unit length of nanotube (1 μm). Taking account of the overall length of the nanotube L, these parameters are respectively Rw = rwL, Rk = rk/L, Cp = cpL. The charge transfer coefficient across the TiO2 nanotube/electrolyte interface is defined as Keff = RkCp, the diffusion coefficient is Deff = RkL2Keff/Rw, and the electron collection efficiency ηcc = 1-Rw/Rk. Electron density at Voc is also calculated by ns = kBTL/e2ARwDeff, in which kB, T, e and A are respectively the Boltzmann's constant, absolute temperature, elementary charge and electrode area.32,33
Results and discussion
The structural features of ZnO NRA templates obtained from our previous work,30 as shown in the ESI (Fig. S1†), can meet the requirements to fabricate aligned TiO2 NTAs for DSCs: (1) a sufficient length for large surface area (dye-loading), (2) an appropriate density for complete coating and (3) a dispersed nanorod root for a good adhesion with TCO substrates.

Fig. 2 shows typical FESEM images of TiO2 NTAs with lengths of 80 μm under different magnifications. The typical low- and middle-magnification side-view FESEM images in Fig. 2a, 2b and 2c show that TiO2 NTAs grown on transparent FTO glass substrate are close-ended. Figures from 2d to 2h show high-magnification FESEM images captured from different regions of TiO2 NTAs, as indicated by white rectangles in Fig. 2c. It is clear that TiO2 NTAs consist of parallel and dispersed TiO2 nanotubes with an average outer diameter of 240 nm. The FESEM image from the root of TiO2 NTAs, as shown in Fig. 2d, reveals that dispersed TiO2 nanotubes vertically stand on the substrates and are in good contact with the FTO films, which is attributed to the shaping ability of the LBL-AR backfilling approach. A bundling phenomenon was observed at the top region of TiO2 NTAs, as shown in Fig. 2g. A bundle usually consists of tens of TiO2 nanotubes and exhibits a diameter in the range from 500 nm to 1μm. Further experimental results (shown later) demonstrate that the bundling can be restrained by decreasing the length or increasing the diameter of ZnO NRAs templates. Therefore, it is believed that the bundle is a result of the balance between the capillary interaction and mechanical bending of nanotubes resulting from the spreading of liquid during drying. A higher-magnification FESEM image further reveals that every dispersed nanotube is constructed from TiO2 nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 2i. By precisely adjusting the etching duration (2 h), a small amount of ZnO content is observed in the TiO2 NTAs from the energy dispersive spectra (EDS), as shown in the ESI† (Fig. S2), which results from the ZnO seed layer, rather than the ZnO NRA templates.

The tubular structure of TiO2 NTAs was further confirmed by TEM images. Low-magnification TEM images captured from different parts of TiO2 NTAs, as shown in Fig. 3a, 3b and 3c, apparently show a complete hollow configuration, indicating that the ZnO NR templates were removed by TiCl4 etching solution after 2 h. At the same time, the wall-thickness is uniform along the length of the nanotube. High-magnification TEM in Fig. 3d and 3e show that the wall thickness of TiO2 nanotubes is 20 nm and reveals a rough surface with a disordered porous structure, constructed of stacking nanoparticles with a diameter of 3–5 nm. It is the pores on the wall, which may come from the interstitials among nanocrystallines, that become the conduits for conveying the etching solution, resulting in the formation of close-ended TiO2 NTAs. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3f) reveals the polycrystalline anatase composition of TiO2 NTAs.

The porous structure was also indicated by the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of TiO2 NTAs peeled-off from the substrates, as shown in Fig. 4a, revealing the presence of mesopores together with macropores. The isotherms at a relative pressure of 0.45∼0.8 can be classified as type IV, typical of mesoporous materials. The adsorption and desorption activity at high relative pressure of 0.9∼1.0, implying the presence of macropores, derives from the large inner channels of the TiO2 nanotubes. The BJH pore diameter distribution plot shows that average pore diameter of the mesopores centers at a diameter of 2.9 nm, as shown in Fig. 4b. BET surface area are 119 m2 g−1, which is obviously larger than that of nanocrystalline (commercial P25, ∼ 80 m2 g−1) and anodized nanotube samples (∼30 m2 g−1).34,35

Inset is the typical high magnification TEM of TiO2 NTAs etched by HCl (left) and TiCl4 (right) solutions. 
BET surface area of TiO2 NTAs etched by HCl solution is 84 m2 g−1, as shown in inset of Fig. 4a, lower than that etched by TiCl4 solution, indicating TiCl4 etching also contribute to the high surface area of 119 m2g−1. The TEM image of HCl etched TiO2 NTAs, as shown in inset (left) of Fig. 4b, displays a smooth surface, therefore, it is believe that the increased BET surface of TiCl4 etched TiO2 NTAs results from attaching small clusters from the hydrolysis of TiCl4 during etching duration.

Fig. 5 shows the plot of the wall thickness of TiO2 NTAsversus the LBL-AR cycle number and the corresponding side-view FESEM images. Clearly, the wall thickness of TiO2 NTAs increases linearly from 10 nm to 40 nm with increasing LBL-AR cycle number from 10 to 50, with an average rate of 0.8∼0.9 nm per cycle. The coating rate helps to minimize the shrinkage phenomenon that is usually encountered in the traditional sol–gel process, and is important to precisely control the wall thickness. Only tube-like fragments were observed on the FTO substrate surface as the LBL-AR cycle number is less than 10. Highly ordered TiO2 NTAs perpendicular to the FTO substrates were obtained when LBL-AR cycle ranged from 10 to 20, and there is no evidence of lodgings, cracks, or overlayers in the FESEM image, except a slightly top bundling, as shown in Fig. 5b. When the LBL-AR cycle is more than 20, however, top bundling is more evident, resulting in a reduced degree of morphological alignment, as shown in Fig. 5c. Further increasing the LBL-AR cycle number up to 50, the root of TiO2 nanotubes begins to coalesce to each other along their side surfaces to form a continuously connected film, and deep micro cracks appear in the connected film, as shown in Fig. 5d. This is due to the fact that the spacing between adjacent ZnO nanorods was completely filled with TiO2 nanoparticles, resulting from the increased wall thickness. Therefore, the optimize LBL-AR cycle number for aligned TiO2 NTAs is in the range from 10 to 20.

Fig. 6 shows the typical side-view FESEM images of TiO2 NTAs synthesized from ZnO NR templates with different lengths ranging from 8 to 80μm. It is obvious that under the fixed LBL-AR cycle number (20 here), the length variation of ZnO NRAs templates has little influence on the morphologies of TiO2 NTAs, indicating a good versatility and applicability of the LBL-AR backfilling method. Noticeably, although the top bundling is more and more pronounced with increasing TiO2 NTAs length, bundle-free TiO2 NTAs could be obtained after the diameter of ZnO NRAs reaches 400 nm (shown in ESI,† Fig. S3), which were prepared with a higher growth solution concentration (0.05 M).

Fig. 7a shows the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of 20 μm thick TiO2 NTA-based DSCs with various wall thicknesses. A maximum conversion efficiency of 4.25% was achieved for DSCs based on TiO2 NTAs with a 20 nm wall thickness, which was obtained from 20 LBL-AR cycles. The Jsc initially increases from 7.95 to 8.2 mA cm−2 with an increasing LBL-AR cycle number from 10 to 20, which is attributed to the increase in the dye loading, as shown in Table 1, coming from the augment of surface area TiO2 NTAs. However, when the LBL-AR cycle number increased further, for example, from 30 to 40, the Jsc reduces from 8.2 to 6.1 mA cm−2, resulting in a decrease of DSC efficiency from 4.25% to 3.12%. The electron transport properties of TiO2 NTA-based DSCs were investigated by using electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). Fig. 7b shows the measured Nyquist plots at open circuit voltages in the frequency range 0.1∼105 Hz. A suggested equivalent circuit was shown in Fig. 7c, which is proposed according to the diffusion–recombination model, and the simulated parameters were summarized in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the change of the electron density ns and capacitance Cp are identical to that of dye loading, essentially consistent with the efficiency of DSCs, confirming that the improvement of DSC performance is due to the increased dye loading (surface area) by increasing the LBL-AR cycle number. However, it should be noticed that the LBL-AR number which corresponds to the highest η is inconsistent with that for maximum dye-loading, Cp and ns. It is believed that, based on the topographical evolution of TiO2 NTAs with LBL-AR cycle number, the discrepancy in LBL-AR number for the highest η and for the maximum dye-loading and the abrupt decrease of Cp and ns is mainly caused by the morphological deterioration of TiO2 NTAs after the LBL-AR cycle number is over 20, including alignment and bundling. As revealed in Table 1, Rk and Rw firstly decrease then subsequently increase with increasing the LBL-AR number, corresponding to an opposite variation of Deff. It is obvious that the maximum efficiency η was obtained at the lowest Rw and the largest Deff with 20 cycles, which is consistent with the previous report that the much larger Rw in the DSCs results in the smaller Deff and thus the poor efficiency.36 A relatively small electron collection efficiency ηcc is obtained at the thinnest wall-thickness with 10 cycles, most likely due to the high recombination resulting from thin wall-thickness and the loosely packed structure of TiO2 nanoparticles. No “high speed lane”, which is created by upwardly bending the conduction and valence band edges of TiO2 nanoparticles, can be formed on the thin wall thickness, leading to increased recombination between the electrons and the electrolyte.37–39 Subsequently ηcc sharply increases from 67% to 80%, meaning that electrons flow more freely with thickening the wall thickness, which is attributed to fast and uninterrupted electron transportation through the thick nanotubes, which thickness is wide enough to form a space charge layer as “high speed lane”. The decrease of ηcc is consistent with increasing Rw, due to the additional electron transport pathways resulting from worsen the morphological disorder, arising from the top bundling and the bottom coalescence of TiO2 nanotubes.40Dye loading capability in the present nanotube arrays is still lower than that of anodized TiO2 NTAs due to the density limitation of ZnO NRAs templates.

Fig. 8 shows the J–V properties of DSCs as a function of the length of TiO2 NTAs with fixed wall-thickness of 20 nm, and the simulated parameters are summarized in Table 2. It was reported that there exists an optimal TiO2 NTA length for an optimal electron collection in consideration of dye loading capacity and electron diffusion length.41,42 As shown in Fig. 8a, the Jsc initially increases from 5.0 to 8.2 mA cm−2 with increasing the length of TiO2 NTAs from 10 to 20μm, then reduces to 7.1 mA cm−2 with further increasing the length up to 50 μm. The increase of Jsc can be attributed to two reasons: (i) the increase in the dye loading due to the increased length, (ii) the improvement in the light-harvesting efficiency resulting from a stronger light-scattering effects by increasing the length of TiO2 NTAs.43 The subsequent decrease of Jsc is due to the decrease of electron collection efficiency ηcc, as shown in Table 2. The Voc of the DSCs obviously decreases from 0.85 to 0.81 eV with increasing length of TiO2 NTAs from 10 to 20μm, and remains a steady state after when the length exceeds 20 μm. The decrease of Voc is generally due to the reason: the additional charge-recombination sites provided by augmentation of the length,44 confirmed by the increase of Rw and the fall of ns, as shown in Table 2. A similar result was also reported in previous TiO2 nanoparticle- and anodized TiO2 NTA-based DSCs.45,46 The fill factor does not show any obvious changes for the different length. Hence, the photovoltaic performance initially increased and then decreased with increasing the length of TiO2 NTAs. Finally, the highest overall performance of 4.25% is achieved for a 20 μm thick TiO2 TNT, with a Voc of 0.81 V, Jsc of 8.2 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 63%.

Remarkably, the electron diffusion length (Ln) at the highest performance in our case is calculated via √Deff/Keff to be 47 μm, which is lower than ∼100 μm estimated for TiO2 nanotube based DSCs,47–49 indicating that the length of TiO2 NTAs doesn't hit the limitation length for maximum efficiency. Therefore, by further treatments, such as increasing size and improving the crystallinity and growth orientation of wall nanoparticles, increasing the alignment and achieve top bundle-free TiO2 NTAs, a higher performance may be achievable at thicker TiO2 NTAs.
Conclusions
In summary, this work presents the fabrication of aligned TiO2 NTAs on TCO substrate from ZnO NRA template assisted LBL-AR method, investigating the wall thickness and length effect on DSCs applications. The resulting end-closed TiO2 NTAs are tuned in the range 5–80 μm, with a wall thickness of 10–40 nm by tailoring the ZnO NRAs length and LBL-AR cycle number. The results suggest that the vertical feature of the TiO2 NTAs is also crucial for high conversion efficiency by improving the electron transport properties. At present, the best performance of 4.25% was achieved from 20 μm thick TiO2 NTAs with a wall thickness of 20 nm, yielding a short-circuit current density of 8.2 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage of 0.81 V and fill factor of 63%. Further enhancement of the cell performance seems to be possible by further increasing the surface area of TiO2 NTAs with the optimization of high alignment degree, involving coarse surface, higher density or multiple-wall nanotubes. Additionally, as a low-cost and environmentally friendly approach, this manner could be utilized to fabricate other oxide nanotube arrays for a good alignment and uniformity.
