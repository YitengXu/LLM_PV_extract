    , Accepted 2nd March 2019First published on 7th March 2019AbstractHerein we report on four perylene diimide (PDI) variants to study the effects that N-annulation and dimerization have on optoelectronic properties and organic solar cell device performance. The PDI compounds were synthesized following a scalable and efficient procedure and studied by cyclic voltammetry, solution and solid-state optical absorption spectroscopy, emission spectroscopy, and density functional theory analysis. The thin-film morphology was probed by optical and atomic force microscopy. Dimerization stabilized the frontier molecular orbital energy levels and reduced aggregation in the thin-films. N-Annulation resulted in a destabilization of the frontier molecular orbital energy levels in both the monomers and dimers and enabled the formation of smoother films with smaller domain sizes. Each PDI molecule was evaluated as a non-fullerene acceptor in bulk-heterojunction solar cells using the donor polymers PTB7-Th and PffBT4T-2OD. The dimers outperformed the monomers, while N-annulated PDIs led to devices with higher open-circuit voltages.
Introduction
Functional organic π-conjugated molecules and polymers have been widely used as active materials in photovoltaic devices.1–4 Ease of synthetic modification to the π-conjugated backbone and periphery functional groups allows for facile tuning of physical, optical, and electronic properties, which enables tailored device properties that can lead to improved performance.5–8 Molecules and polymers based on thiophenes9,10 and/or dye materials11–13 have been most commonly used in solution processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) owing to their optoelectronic properties being well suited to visible light absorption and charge transfer. Over the past few years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs has dramatically improved with current records of >14% for singe-junction14 and >15% for tandem devices.15,16
Many OSCs use fullerene acceptors owing to excellent electron transport properties and tendency to form organized nanoaggregates in BHJ films.17–19 However, fullerenes suffer from several disadvantages including poor visible light absorption, lack of energy level tunability, photochemical instability, and difficulty in synthesis and purification.20,21 For these reasons, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have been extensively studied in recent years.8,14,15,22–27 Indacenodithiophene-based compounds (IDTs) have proved quite effective owing to strong low-energy optical absorption and good miscibility with donor polymers leading to favorable phase separated BHJ morphologies.28–30 Indeed IDT-based OSCs exhibit remarkably high fill factors (FF).30–32 However, high performing IDT-based NFAs typically require multiple synthetic steps, which makes large scale production more difficult.33 An alternative to IDT based NFAs are those based on perylene diimides (PDIs), which are easily synthesized and modified via simple chemical reactions from cheap and abundant dyes and pigments.13,34–37 They exhibit strong light absorption in the blue-green region of the visible spectrum, have deep electronic energy levels, and are good electron transport materials making them compatible with nearly all low-band gap hole transporting polymers. Indeed, polymer-based OSCs that use dimeric or tetrameric PDI NFAs have achieved >9%38 and >10%39 PCE, respectively.
The PDI chromophore is quite versatile as it can be easily functionalized at the bay, headland, and/or imide positions to tune molecular and bulk properties (Fig. 1). A common method of functionalization of PDI is to dimerize at the bay position. One such PDI dimer has achieved PCE of up to 6% in OSC devices.40 Another common functionalization is heteroatom annulation at the bay position, which has been an effective strategy to control the solubility, self-assembly, and optoelectronic properties of PDI materials. For OSC applications, PDI dimers with S and Se annulation have been reported with PCEs above 7% and 8%, respectively.41,42 In our group, we have focused on N-annulated PDI compounds,43–46 which, in addition to tuning the optoelectronic properties like S and Se annulation, provides an additional handle for functionalization to tune solubility and self-assembly.45,47–51 OSC devices with PCEs above 7% have been achieved using these N-annulated PDI NFAs.52
 Fig. 1  Functionalization points for the PDI chromophore and chemical structures of the PDI materials directly compared in this study. 
While investigating the N-annulated PDI dimers over the past few years, we noticed that there has never been a direct comparison between non-annulated PDI and N-annulated PDI monomers and dimers for OSCs. It is important to fully study the impact of such structural changes to gain a greater understanding of how these molecules function in OSC devices. This study serves to fill that gap and provides a structure–property-functional relationship study. The structures of PDI acceptors used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. Compounds 1, 2, and 4 have been reported previously while compound 3 is new. Full synthetic details can be found in the ESI.†
Optical properties
The solution and film optical absorption properties of compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 were determined using UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 2). The solution spectra of the monomers (1 and 2) exhibit characteristic transitions for PDI based materials. They exhibit absorption from 400–550 nm with three distinct bands for the 0-0, 0-1 and 0-2 vibronic transitions.53 A transition from solution to film reveals differences between the two compounds. For 1 the onset of absorption is red-shifted by Δ72 nm to 627 nm, while 2 is only red-shifted by Δ48 nm to 606 nm. The difference implies weaker intermolecular coupling in films of 2vs.1, attributed to the presence of the N-alkyl functional group.

The solution spectra of the dimers (3 and 4) are different from their monomeric analogues. While compound 3 exhibits similar absorption from 400–500 nm with three distinct transitions, the absorption band is broadened and the absorption peaks less sharp. The onset of absorption is also red-shifted compared to 1. The features of compound 3 are nearly identical to a similar PDI dimer with longer alkyl chains off the imide N-atoms.54,55 The solution spectra of 4 is the most different with only two distinct vibronic transitions, with the 0-0 (ca. 537 nm) transition the most intense. Such differences can be attributed to the more isotropic shape of the dimeric compounds leading to different intra and intermolecular electronic interactions. Of note the solution spectra of each compound do not change upon heating implying no significant aggregation in solution (Fig. S6, ESI†). The thin-film spectra of 3 and 4 are only slightly red-shifted from the solution spectra, much less than their monomeric analogues, consistent with less intermolecular coupling in these systems owing to the non-planar geometries.56,57 All optical absorption data are listed in Table 1.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of all compounds were measured in solution and film (Table 1 and Fig. S7, ESI†). Solutions of compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 show emission maxima at 578, 580, 612, and 588 nm, respectively, and have shapes typical of PDI materials. Both the monomers 1 and 2 have two emission bands while the dimers have only one. Quantum yields were measured to be 91, 64, 10, and 60% for compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 solutions in C6H5Cl, respectively. Compound 3 has the largest Stokes shift and lowest quantum yield indicating significant non-radiative energy loss, an unusual phenomenon.
Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the PDI materials were determined using solution cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 3 and Fig. S8, ESI†). All compounds exhibit fully reversible reduction waves. The monomers 1 and 2 exhibit two reduction waves while the dimers 3 and 4 exhibit four reduction waves, which is typical for PDI monomers and dimers, as the PDI chromophore is stable as a radical dianion.41,52,54 The N-annulated compounds 2 and 4 exhibited two reversible oxidation waves while compounds 1 and 3 did not reversibly oxidize, consistent with the literature.52,54 Oxidation occurs at the electron rich pyrrole ring at the bay position in 2 and 4. The E1/2 oxidation and reduction potentials for each compound were used to experimentally determine the ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) energies, respectively, which correspond to theoretical HOMO and LUMO energy levels (Table 1). A conversion factor of 4.8 eV (accepted HOMO energy level of ferrocene) was used.58
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammograms (with ferrocene internal standard) of PDI materials (A) 1, (B) 2, (C) 3, and (D) 4 with E1/2 potentials shown. 

N-Annulation has a large effect on the reduction potentials for PDI. Compounds 2 (ca. −1.30 V) and 4 (ca. −1.29 V) have significantly more negative E1/2 reduction potentials than in their counterparts 1 (ca. −1.15 V) and 3 (ca. −1.04 V). As a result, the EA of 2 and 4 is decreased compared to 1 and 3. This is a powerful example of how N-annulation of PDI can influence and tune the electrochemical properties by increasing the electron density within the polycyclic aromatic core. This has a consequence for OSC devices in terms of increased open-circuit voltages. The differences in electronic energy levels were confirmed using DFT and TD-DFT calculations (Fig. S10 and Table S1, ESI†).
Thin-film morphology
The thin-film morphology of compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 were investigated using polarized optical microscopy (POM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 4). All films were spin-coated from 10 mg mL−1 C6H5Cl solutions onto cleaned glass substrates under identical conditions. All compounds formed uniform films but with very different roughness and domain sizes. The non-annulated PDI monomer 1 formed highly aggregated films with large domains upwards of 1000 nm in width (Fig. 4A). The N-annulated PDI monomer 2 also formed aggregated films but with smaller more fibril like domains ranging from 300–500 nm in width. These aggregated films are consistent with literature findings for monomeric PDIs which are well known to self-assemble into organized nanostructures in the solid-state via strong π–π interactions.59 A major difference is seen with the PDI dimers. Both compounds 3 and 4 form very smooth films with small domain sizes. The film of 3 shows fibril like features of several hundred nanometers in size, while the film of 4 is nearly feature less. These results confirm the long-standing notion that dimerization of PDI chromophores reduces aggregation and that the introduction of an N-hexyl chain further reduces the tendency of the PDI chromophores to form aggregated solid-state morphologies with large features. For OSCs, smaller, less aggregated domains usually lead to best performance. Thus, the N-annulated dimer is expected to yield the best photovoltaic devices.

Organic solar cells
Due to the critical role of donor/acceptor pairings in the efficiency of the device, OSC devices were fabricated under identical conditions with compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 using two different polymer donors (Fig. 5). PTB7-Th and PffBT4T-2OD, also referred to as PCE10 and PCE11, respectively, were selected as they have complementary optical absorption (ca. 400–800 nm), appropriately offset electronic energy levels, and are proven to yield good PCE devices with PDI based NFAs.45,60,61 Due to ease of fabrication and greater environmental stability,62 OSCs were fabricated using an air-processed and air-tested inverted geometry: ITO/ZnO/BHJ/MoOx/Ag.63

(B) Optical absorption spectra of PTB7-Th and PffBT4T-2OD films spin-cast from 5 mg mL−1 under identical conditions. The lower absorption intensity of PTB7-Th reflects its lower solution viscosity. (C) Energy level plot of the polymer donors and PDI acceptors. Values estimated from CV data obtained in our labs (Fig. S8, ESI†). HOMO energy levels of 1 and 3 could not be determined by CV. 
BHJ films using the donor polymers PTB7-Th and PffBT4T-2OD were fabricated from C6H5Cl solutions (10 mg mL−1) using a 1:1 polymer:PDI weight ratio. The active layers were spin-cast in the air, with room temperature solutions and substrates, without additives or any post-deposition treatments. Controlled processing conditions were used to ensure a direct comparison of the PDI materials. We fully recognize that solar cell performance can be improved though processing optimization but that was beyond the scope of this study. Tabulated data for all devices is given in Table 2. Current–voltage curves and graphical metric comparison for PTB7-Th:PDI and PffBT4T-2OD:PDI based OSCs are shown in Fig. 6.

The optical absorption spectra of PTB7-Th:PDI films (Fig. S11A, ESI†) exhibit absorption from 400–800 nm whereas those of PffBT4T-2OD:PDI films (Fig. S12A, ESI†) exhibit absorption from 350–750 nm, both suitable for solar photon harvesting. For all films (expect PffBT4T-2OD:1) the emission of the polymer donor was efficiently quenched by the PDI acceptor indicating electron transfer occurs in the BHJ films. PL spectra of blended films are given in the ESI† (Fig. S11B and S12B). The lack of PL quenching in the film of PffBT4T-2OD:1 is explained by the large phase separated surface seen in the AFM image (Fig. 13A, ESI†). Lack of donor–acceptor interface interaction inhibits electron transfer.
OSCs with PTB7-Th:1 active layer had average PCE of 3.4%. This performance is on par with related solar cells using monomeric PDIs.64,65 OSCs using the N-annulated PDI 2 had a reduced average PCE of 2.3%. Despite the lower PCE, PTB7-Th:2 OSCs had a higher VOC because of the raised LUMO level of compound 2 leading to a larger energy gap between the polymer HOMO energy level and acceptor LUMO energy level. PTB7-Th:3 based OSCs had an average PCE of 3.9% while PTB7-Th:4 based OSCs had average PCE of 5.5%. Consistent with the comparison of 1vs.2, the OSCs based on 4 had higher VOC than those based on 3. Again, a result of N-annulation destabilizing the PDIs LUMO energy level. Although devices based on 4 had slightly lower fill factors compared to 3 based devices, higher PCEs were obtained owing to a higher VOC and JSC. The best PCE of 5.5% for PTB7-Th:4 OSCs is consistent with literature results.46–48,52,66,67
OSCs with PffBT4T-2OD:1 active layer gave an average PCE of 1.25%. The OSCs with BHJ active layers using the N-annulated monomer 2 gave slightly higher efficiency (ca. 1.45%) due to the higher VOC (0.95 V vs. 0.78 V). Use of the dimeric PDI acceptors led to higher PCEs of 3.59% and 3.06%, respectively, for PffBT4T-2OD:3 and PffBT4T-2OD:4 based OSCs. Although devices based on N-annulated PDI dimer 4 gave slightly lower efficiency due to the lower short-circuit current and FF (JSC = 7.34 mA cm−1, FF = 40.31%), using compound 4 lead to significantly higher VOC (0.78 V for PffBT4T-2OD:3 films vs. 1.02 V for PffBT4T-2OD:4 films).
In general, use of the N-annulated PDI materials (2 and 4) lead to solar cells with significantly higher VOC, over 200 mV on average, compared to the non-annulated PDI materials (1 and 3). This result highlights the positive impact of N-annulation on the electronic properties of the PDI that results in improved solar cell device characteristics. Furthermore, use of the dimeric compounds (3 and 4) resulted in better performing OSCs than those based on the monomeric analogues (1 and 2), emphasizing the long-standing notion that best PDI NFAs should be comprised of two or more PDI chromophores.
To help rationalize these results, the surface morphology was analysed using AFM. Phase and height images are shown in Fig. S12 and S13 (ESI†). BHJ blends using compound 1 had a high surface roughness (RMS = 7 nm for PTB7-Th blends and RMS = 17 nm for PffBT4T-2OD blends) owing to the stronger aggregation tendencies of the planar PDI. Domain sizes were on the order of microns, not suitable for efficient charge separation, thus the overall lower PCE. Blends using compound 2 had much smoother films (RMS < 3 nm) but appeared to be very intermixed based on the uniform and featureless phase images. The lack of order and phase separation may explain the poor FF leading to the low PCE. Thus, while the N-annulation is favourable for improving the energetics of the blends (i.e. increased VOC), the additional N-hexyl group seems to impede phase-separation and molecular organization lowering (i.e. lower JSC and FF), in the monomeric systems. All blends using the dimeric PDI materials exhibited smooth uniform films but with more defined features than that of compound 2. Blends films using 3 or 4 are very similar, and this reflects the similar JSC and FF seen on all OSCs using these acceptors. Once again, the biggest difference in device performance is a result of the VOC and the relative electronic energy levels of the materials.
Conclusion
In this contribution we have compared four different PDI molecular materials relevant to the field of organic photovoltaics. The impact of N-annulation at the bay position of the PDI chromophore and dimerization of the PDI chromophore were evaluated. We have shown that N-annulation serves to both decrease the electron affinity of the PDI and the tendency of the PDI to form large aggregates in the film. Dimerization of the PDI chromophore reduces the tendency of the materials to aggregate in the film with the N-annulated PDI dimer exhibiting the smoothest films. In terms of OSC performance, all PDI materials were tested as non-fullerene acceptors with two different donor polymers in inverted single-junction bulk heterojunction devices. In all cases OSCs using the N-annulated PDI materials exhibited higher open circuit voltages by ∼200 mV when compared to those OSC using the non-annulated PDI materials. This is a clear result of the lower electron affinity of the PDI core afforded by the addition of the electron rich N-atom in the bay positions. The dimeric PDI materials gave OSCs with slightly better performance than those fabricated with monomeric PDIs (ca. ∼3–5% PCE vs. ∼1–3% PCE). This was attributed to the fact that the dimeric PDI materials lead to BHJ blends with smooth, well organized films. OSCs based on the donor polymer PTB7-Th and the N-annulated PDI acceptor 4 gave best PCE of 5.5% and highlights the potential of this class of materials for the development of high performance, fullerene-free OSCs.
