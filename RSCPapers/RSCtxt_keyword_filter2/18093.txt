Because the surface reflectance of a textured surface with SiNX film on a silicon solar cell in the UV wavelength region (250–450 nm) is higher than ∼27%, silicon solar-cells cannot effectively convert UV light into photo-voltaic power. We implemented the concept of energy-down-shift using CdSe/ZnS core/shell quantum-dots (QDs) on p-type silicon solar-cells to absorb more UV light. CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs demonstrated clear evidence of energy-down-shift, which absorbed UV light and emitted green-light photoluminescence signals at a wavelength of 542 nm. The implementation of 0.2 wt% (8.8 nm QDs layer) green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs reduced the surface reflectance of the textured surface with SiNX film on a silicon solar-cell from 27% to 15% and enhanced the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of silicon solar-cells to around 30% in the UV wavelength region, thereby enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) for p-type silicon solar-cells by 5.5%.
Introduction
For the past few decades, silicon solar-cells have been researched to try and improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) by using n-type silicon wafers, surface texturing,1 anti-reflection coating,2 plasma doping, selective emitters,3 back contact solar-cell,4 and metallization, saturated with the maximum PCE of ∼23% for n-type silicon solar-cells.5,6 In addition, research has been carried out on silicon,7–12 dye-sensitized,13–17 and organic solar-cells18–21 implemented with quantum dots (QDs), but clear evidence of the PCE enhancement induced by energy-down-shift utilizing the absorption of UV lights has not been reported.22–26 Thus, we have implemented the concept of energy-down-shift by using core/shell structure QDs, e.g., CdSe core QD coated with a ZnS shell layer, on silicon solar-cells. CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs were spin-coated on the textured silicon solar-cell with SiNX film, as shown in Fig. 1a. The CdSe/ZnS core/shell QD was composed of a CdSe core QD ∼3 nm in diameter coated with a 2.6 nm thick ZnS shell layer, as shown in Fig. 1b. Because the energy band-gap of the ZnS shell layer is higher than that of the CdSe core QD and the diameter of the CdSe core QD is considerably smaller, both the conduction energy band and the under valance energy band in the CdSe core QD could be easily quantized, generating E1, E2, E3, etc. and H1, H2, H3, etc., where E and H are the quantized energy states for the electron and the hole, respectively, and the subscript is a quantum number. Note that the ZnS shell layer acts as an energy barrier for the CdSe core QD, confining the energy bands of CdSe QD and de-generating the quantized energy states. Electron–hole pairs at E2 and H1 or E3 and H1 are generated when the CdSe core QD absorbs UV light, as shown in Fig. 1c. Afterwards, the excited electrons and holes are passed to E3 and E1 or E2 and E1 by transferring thermal energy to the CdSe core QD lattices. Finally, the recombination of electrons at E1 and holes at H1 emits visible light determined by the CdSe core-QD diameter, called the energy-down-shift. The visible light is emitted by core/shell QDs via the energy-down-shift and it is absorbed into the textured surface with SiNX film on p-type silicon solar cells, enhancing the short-circuit current density (JSC) and PCE. In this study, the effect of the QD type, CdSe QD, green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QD, and red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QD, on energy-down-shift characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) enhancement in UV region was investigated. In addition, we present clear evidence of energy-down-shift and EQE enhancement in the UV region via CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs achieved with a p-type silicon solar-cell.

Results and discussion
To prove the energy-down-shift of QDs, wavelengths of UV light were illuminated in the solutions with three types of QDs dispersed in them. CdSe QD, green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QD, and red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QD emitted the 575 nm yellow light, 542 nm green light and 607 nm red light, respectively, when 254 and 365 nm UV light were illuminated in the solutions with QDs dispersed in them, as shown in the photographs of quartz cubic cells in Fig. 2a–c. These results demonstrated clear evidence of the energy-down-shift because the three types of QDs absorbed UV light and emitted light at visible wavelengths. To confirm the energy-down-shift of QDs, we investigated the absorption and photoluminescence (PL) signal for three types of QDs as a function of wavelength. Note that the wavelength of the HeCd laser source in PL measurements was 325 nm. CdSe QDs absorbed light from ∼600 to 240 nm and emitted the 575 nm PL peak signal with the intensity of 642 arbitrary units (quantum yield: ∼11.1% and it was also 11.1% for Rhodamine 6G in ethanol and quinine sulfate in 0.5 M H2SO4) for 0.5 wt% CdSe QDs, as shown in Fig. 2a. Also, green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs absorbed light from ∼570 to 240 nm and the absorption for green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs was larger than that for CdSe QDs, as can be seen by comparing Fig. 2a with 2b. Their absorption was increased when the QD concentration increased, as shown in Fig. 2b. Furthermore, 0.5 wt% of green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs emitted 542 nm PL peak signals with the intensity of 20067 arbitrary units (quantum yield: ∼74.1% and 74.4% on Rhodamine 6G in ethanol and quinine sulfate in 0.5 M H2SO4). In addition, red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs absorbed light from ∼630 to 240 nm, as shown in Fig. 2c. Their absorption was also increased when the QD concentration increased. However, the absorption for red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs was larger than that for green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs, as can be seen by comparing Fig. 2b with 2c. In addition, 0.5 wt% of red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs emitted the 607 nm PL peak signal with the intensity of 2984 arbitrary units (quantum yield: ∼48.8% and 49.0% on Rhodamine 6G in ethanol and quinine sulfate in 0.5 M H2SO4). The correlation between the absorption and PL signal demonstrated that three types of QDs absorb UV light and emit their specific visible light through energy-down-shift. In order to confirm that the three types of QDs absorbed UV light and emitted their specific visible light on the solar cell via energy-down-shift, the emitted light intensities from the solar-cell surface spin-coated with the QDs after illuminating them with UV light at 365 nm were observed as a function of the QD types and QD concentration, as shown in Fig. 2d–f. For all QD types, the emitted light intensity after illumination with UV light at 365 nm increased with the QD concentration (wt%). In particular, the highest emitting light was green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS QD, followed by red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS QD, and CdSe QD on p-type silicon solar cells. These results confirmed the energy-down-shift of the QDs absorbing UV light and emitting their specific visible light. Note that the results for the dependencies of the absorption, PL intensity, and emitted light intensity on the QD concentration for the QDs solution in the quartz cuvette in Fig. 2a–c correlated well with the results for the thin film of the QDs in Fig. 2d–f.

Fig. 3a–c show the HRTEM images and QD size distribution for CdSe QDs, green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QD, and red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QD, and the average QD size was ∼4.2, 8.2, and 7.4 nm, respectively. TEM images showed that the QDs had a spherical shape and were well crystallized and well dispersed. Fig. 3d–e present the chemical composition and core/shell structure of QD, analyzed by an EDX line-scan profile. The chemical composition of the CdSe QD was 1:1 of Cd and Se for both green-light and red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs, otherwise, the chemical composition of the core QD was 1:1 of Cd and Se and that of the shell surrounding the core QD was 1:1 of Zn and S. Fig. 3g–i show the crystal structure of the QD and the core/shell QD. The CdSe QD had a rock-salt structure of (111), (220), (311), and (420) according to JCPDS card 11-9010. Otherwise, for the green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell, the CdSe core QD presented a salt-rock structure of (200) and (400), while the ZnS shell showed the wurtzite structure of (100), (002), (100), and (112) according to JCPDS card 04-5197. In addition, for the red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QD, the CdSe core QD presented the salt-rock structure of (111), (220), (311), and (420), whereas the ZnS shell showed the wurtzite structure of (100), (110), and (201). The PL signals and core QD size determined from the TEM images were used to derive the energy band diagrams of the QD and core/shell QDs, as shown in Fig. 3j–l. For the CdSe QD, the QD emitted the PL signal at 575 nm, which corresponded to the energy band gap of 2.16 eV, as shown in Fig. 3j. The PL signal from the CdSe QD could be used to estimate the CdSe QD size using the following equation:27,28 D = (1.6122 × 10−9)λ4 − (2.6575 × 10−6)λ3 + (1.6242 × 10−3)λ2 − (0.4277)λ + 41.57(1)

(a)–(c) Size distribution and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image, (d)–(f) chemical composition was determined using energy-dispersive-X-ray-spectroscopy (EDX) line scan profile, (g)–(i) crystal structure determined using X-ray diffraction patterns, and (j)–(l) energy band diagrams. 
The calculated CdSe QD diameter was ∼4.1 nm, which correlates well with the CdSe QD diameter (∼4.2 and 4.5 nm) obtained from the TEM image and Scherrer's equation from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern measurement. For the green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QD, the CdSe core QD emitted the PL signal at 542 nm, corresponding to the energy band gap of 2.29 eV, as shown in Fig. 3k. The calculated CdSe core QD size was ∼2.9 nm, which correlates well with the CdSe core size (∼3.0 and 3.1 nm) obtained from the TEM image and Scherrer's equation from XRD pattern measurement. In addition, the energy band gap of the ZnS shell surrounding the green-light emitting CdSe core QD would be ∼4.12 eV29 because of the ZnS shell layer thickness surrounding the green-light emitting CdSe core QD. For the red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QD, the CdSe core QD emitted the PL signal at 607 nm, which corresponded to the energy band gap of 2.04 eV, as shown in Fig. 3l. The calculated CdSe core QD size was ∼4.9 nm, which correlates well with the CdSe core size (∼4.9 and 5.1 nm) obtained from the TEM image and Scherrer's equation from XRD pattern measurement. In addition, the energy band gap of the ZnS shell surrounding the red-light emitting CdSe core QD would be higher than ∼4.12 eV because the ZnS shell layer thickness (∼1.3 nm) surrounding the red-light emitting CdSe core QD was thinner than that (∼2.6 nm) surrounding the green-light emitting CdSe core QD. The energy band diagrams show why the CdSe QD (∼11.1%), the green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QD (∼74.1%), and the red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QD (∼48.8%) presented a different quantum yield to one another. Because the green or red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs would be more quantized in the core QD than the CdSe QD, the quantum yield of the green- or red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs was higher than that of the CdSe QD. In addition, because the ZnS shell layer thickness of the green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs (∼2.6 nm) was thicker than that of the red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QD (∼1.3 nm), the green- or red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs would be more quantized in the core QD than the red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs.28 As a result, the quantum yield of the green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs was higher than the quantum yield of the red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs.
Next, three types of QDs were implanted on a textured surface with SiNX film to investigate how core/shell QDs enhance the photovoltaic performance of silicon solar cells by energy-down-shift. For all the QDs, the addition of QDs on the textured surface with SiNX film considerably reduced the surface reflectance in the UV wavelength region (250–450 nm) compared with the reference without the additions of QDs, as shown in Fig. 4a–c. Note that, the diffuse reflectance accessory (internal) used in the surface reflectance measurement was used because the incident light would be reflected and scattered at both surfaces of the silicon solar cell and the QD layer indicating that a lower reflectance means a high absorption of light. It is important to remember that less surface reflectance corresponds to a higher light absorption. In particular, the surface reflectance in the UV wavelength region (300–450 nm) decreased as the thickness of the QD layer increased while that in the visible wavelength region (450–1100 nm) very slightly increased as the thickness of QD layer increased. However, the higher sequence of the reduction of the surface reflectance in the UV wavelength region was followed by green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs, red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs and CdSe QDs, as shown in Fig. 4a–c. The surface reflectance trend in the UV region from each type of QD correlated well with the absorption trend, as can be seen by comparing Fig. 3a–c with Fig. 5a–c. To understand how much energy-down-shift enhances photovoltaic performance, EQE for p-type silicon solar-cells with three types of QDs added were estimated. CdSe QDs did not enhance the EQE in the UV region (300–450 nm) although they reduced the surface reflectance, because the emission efficiency of visible light through the CdSe QDs (i.e., 642 arbitrary units in PL intensity and quantum yield: ∼11.1%) was extremely low, as can be seen by comparing Fig. 2a, 4a and 4d. However, for both green- and red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs, the EQE increased from ∼30 to 60% in the UV region, compared with the reference without QDs added, and a peak EQE was shown at a QDs layer thickness of 14.8 nm, as shown in Fig. 4d–f. In addition, the EQE in the visible wavelength region was very slightly decreased when the thickness of the QD layer increased because of increasing the surface reflectance. A good correlation between the surface reflectance and EQE in the UV region proves that the energy-down-shift through the core/shell QDs could enhance JSC for silicon solar cells. Furthermore, the EQE in the UV region for green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs was higher than that for red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs, as can be seen by comparing the inset in Fig. 4e with that in Fig. 4f.

(a) Short circuit current-density (JSC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) for CdSe QDs, (b) for green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs, (c) for red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs, (d) fill factor (FF) and PCE for CdSe QDs, (e) for green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs, and (f) for red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs. 
For p-type silicon solar cells coated with the QD layer, the dependency of photovoltaic performance, such as JSC, open-circuit voltage (VOC), FF and PCE, on the average QD layer thickness is shown in Fig. 5. For CdSe QDs, photovoltaic performance did not change, as shown in Fig. 5a and d. However, for green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs, the JSC rapidly increased up to a QD layer thickness of 8.8 nm and then slightly decreased as the QD layer thickness increased, whereas VOC was independent of the QD layer thickness, as shown in Fig. 5b. FF slightly decreased as the QD layer thickness increased and PCE rapidly increased up to a QD layer thickness of 8.8 nm and then decreased as the QD layer thickness increased, as shown in Fig. 5e. Surprisingly, the QD layer thickness of 8.8 nm (0.2 wt%) for green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs was enhanced by ∼0.93% in PCE, corresponding to a 5.5% PCE enhancement compared with the reference (without QDs layer). In addition, for red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs, the dependencies of JSC, VOC, FF and PCE on the QD layer thickness were similar to those for the green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs, as shown in Fig. 5c and 5f. Thus, red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell were enhanced by ∼0.55% in PCE. The PCE enhancement for green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS QDs (∼0.93%) was higher than that for red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS QD (∼0.55%) because of lower surface reflectance in the UV region and higher emission efficiency of the visible wavelength light through energy-down-shift.
Experimental
Quantum dot synthesis
Three types of QDs were synthesized by a hot injection method. For CdSe QDs, cadmium oxide, oleic acid, and 1-octadecene were mixed at room temperature and reacted at 250 °C under vacuum. For both green- and red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs, cadmium oxide, oleic acid, zinc acetate, and 1-octadecene were mixed at room temperature and heated up to 150 °C under vacuum. Subsequently, the distilled mixture chemical was heated up to 310 °C, and then selenium and a sulfur solution were rapidly injected and reacted for 30 min. The difference between green- and red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs was a different ratio of selenium and sulfur in the composition. Note that selenium and sulfur powders were dissolved in trioctylphosphine at 100 °C. After the reaction, the solutions dispersed with QDs were cooled down at room temperature and then centrifuged with ethanol. Finally, the precipitated QDs were re-dispersed with chloroform. The detailed morphology, size distribution, absorption, composition ratio and PL for QDs were characterized using a TEM at a 200 kV acceleration voltage, UV visible spectroscopy, XRD, EDX line-scan profile and photoluminescence spectroscopy using an HeCd laser source with at a wavelength of 325 nm. The quantum yields of the QDs were measured and estimated by comparing their fluorescence intensities with those of primary standard solutions (quantum yield: 95% Rhodamine 6G in ethanol and 54% quinine sulfate in 0.5 M H2SO4) at the same optical density (optical density = 0.05) at the same excitation wavelength (325 nm).29,30
Solar cell fabrication
Boron-doped (10 Ω cm) Czochralski silicon wafers with an area of 20 × 20 mm2 and thickness of 200 μm were used in this experiment. The wafers were etched by KOH at 80 °C for 10 min, producing a random pyramid textured surface. Then, the wafers were subjected to POCl3 diffusion at 860 °C for 5 min, producing an n-doped layer of ∼0.5 μm with an emitter sheet resistance of 58 Ω/□ (or Ω/sq). Afterward, the wafers were etched using diluted hydrofluoric acid to remove a glass oxide film. A 95 nm thick SiNX film was deposited on the wafers to form an anti-reflective layer. The wafers were subjected to screen printing using Ag and Al paste to produce top and bottom electrodes, respectively. Finally, the wafers were fired using rapid thermal annealing at 68 °C for 2 s. After the fabrication of the p-type silicon solar cells, three types of QDs were spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 60 s on to a textured surface with SiNX film. After spin-coating, the p-type silicon solar cells were annealed at 60 °C for 10 min and 95 °C for 5 min to dry the solvent. In order to correlate the optical characteristics between QDs in solvent and the QD layer on the silicon solar cell, the thickness of the QD layer after spin-coating was measured using TEM. The thickness of the QD layer for the QD solutions of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 1.0 wt% were 7.9, 8.8, 12.6, 14.8, 21.9, and 34.9 nm at the green-emitting QD layer, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6. The PL has been used to measure the quantum yield of the QD solution. The EQE and photovoltaic performance such as JSC, open circuit voltage (VOC), FF, and PCE for the silicon solar cells were estimated using a spectral incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) measurement system and solar simulator, respectively.

Conclusions
QDs coated with or without a shell layer absorb UV wavelength light and emit visible wavelength light by energy-down-shift. However, the sequence of higher UV light absorption and visible light emission was followed by green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs, red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs, and CdSe QDs. These results mean that core/shell QDs are more effective for the PCE enhancement via energy-down-shift than QDs without a shell layer coating. Thus, implementing green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs on a textured surface with SiNX film in a p-type silicon solar cell could achieve ∼0.93% PCE enhancement, although ∼74.1% of the emitted visible light by energy-down-shift was absorbed. In the future, the design of a capping layer on the core/shell QDs will be the key to maximizing the absorption of emitted visible light from QDs.

 	Fig. 1  Design of energy-down-shift using CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs on a silicon solar-cell. (a) Schematic of p-type silicon solar-cell achieved with CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs. The thicknesses of the SiNX film and the n+ diffusion layer were 95 nm and ∼0.5 μm, respectively. Al and Ag were used for the emitter and collector electrodes, respectively. (b) The TEM image (200 kV accelerating voltage) and schematic of the CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs located inside the valley of the textured surface with an SiNX film of a silicon solar cell. (c) Energy-band diagram of CdSe/ZnS core/shell QD.	 

 	Fig. 2  Absorption, photoluminescence, and emitting light photography, for three types of QDs. The absorption was measured at 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 1.0 wt%. Photoluminescence was obtained at 0.5 wt%. The emitting light photography was taken after UV light illumination at a wavelength of 365 nm. The absorption and photoluminescence for (a) CdSe QDs, (b) green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs, and (c) red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs. The photographs of three types of spin-coated QDs with 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 1.0 wt% were taken after UV light illumination at a wavelength of 365 nm. Emitting light photography for (d) CdSe QDs, (e) green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs, and (f) red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs.	 
D = (1.6122 × 10−9)λ4 − (2.6575 × 10−6)λ3 + (1.6242 × 10−3)λ2 − (0.4277)λ + 41.57	(1)

 	Fig. 3  Physical characteristics for the CdSe QD, green-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QD, and red-light emitting CdSe/ZnS core/shell QD. (a)–(c) Size distribution and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image, (d)–(f) chemical composition was determined using energy-dispersive-X-ray-spectroscopy (EDX) line scan profile, (g)–(i) crystal structure determined using X-ray diffraction patterns, and (j)–(l) energy band diagrams.	 

 	Fig. 4  Surface reflectance of the textured surface with SiNX film and EQE for p-type silicon solar cells achieved using three types of QDs. The surface reflectances between 250 and 450 nm and the EQE between 300 and 450 nm are magnified in the inset boxes.
