    , Accepted 29th January 2018First published on 30th January 2018AbstractThe blade coating process, which exhibits the merits of rapid film growth and less consumption of materials, has been regarded as a promising method for the fabrication of scalable perovskite films. However, achieving controllable film growth with a high quality is still a challenge. Herein, a rotating magnetic field (RMF) is proposed to manipulate the crystallization of perovskite thin-films during blade coating in air. Improved film quality with good surface coverage and efficient charge transportation has been successfully accomplished in the as-produced smooth, uniform and dense perovskite layers. Thus, an enhanced photovoltaic performance with an average increase of ∼15% in power conversion efficiency was realized in devices configured on the RMF-manipulated perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) thin-film when compared with that of the conventional devices. This work well demonstrates a novel strategy to physically manipulate the crystallization of perovskite films with the purpose of a controllable and low-cost fabrication of high performance PSCs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have been demonstrated as one of the most attractive photovoltaic materials due to their tailorable crystallinity, high absorption coefficient, long charge carrier diffusion length, outstanding charge carrier mobility, and simple solution synthesis approach,1–5 resulting in the rapid development of the corresponding perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) having quickly increased from ∼3.8% to over 22% within just eight years.2,6 In the past few years, significant effort has been made, such as interface engineering,7 use of compositional materials,8 additive employment,9 solvent engineering10 and so on, to improve the quality of perovskite thin-films as well as the device performance, including increasing the PCE, reducing hysteresis, and improving long-term stability. Commonly, these strategies are chemistry-based modification methods for thin-film growth. In fact, physical manipulation, i.e. with a magnetic field, has been well-accepted to be capable of influencing the crystal growth and certain properties of a material.11 Recently, a rotating magnetic field (RMF) has been employed to modify the growth of alloys such as CdTe and CdTe0.9Se0.1.12 Perovskites, a group of hybrid materials with a structure of ABX3 (commonly, A stands for methylamine or formamidine, B is lead or tin, and X represents halide or mixed halides), are believed to have tailorable magnetic characteristics besides their unique optical, electronic and mechanical properties,13 indicating a potential relationship between perovskite materials and magnetism. Investigations regarding the effect of a magnetic field on the photoluminescent (PL) properties of fully inorganic CsPbBr3 (ref. 14) and the carrier dynamics of hybrid perovskite devices,15e.g. magneto-electroluminescence, magneto-photocurrent, and magneto-photoluminescence responses, have ever been carried out. Recently, H. Wang et al. also demonstrated the preparation of perovskite films with the assistance of a magnetic field by the spin coating method.16 However, it is still challenging to understand the mechanisms of the nucleation and crystal growth of perovskites within the environment of a magnetic field and to further develop a universal application to other potential large-scale fabrication processes.
On the other hand, besides the frequently employed spin coating process, other desirable film-forming techniques, including slot-die coating,17 blade coating,18 bar coating,19 printing techniques,20etc., have also been developed for the preparation of perovskite films. Among them, the blade coating method exhibits a promising prospect for the mass-production of PSCs due to the simple, scalable and low-cost fabrication procedure. However, it is still difficult to control the quality and morphology of perovskite thin-films during the coating process. Although different methods, such as variation of the stoichiometric ratio of the precursor, changing the post-annealing temperature, adjusting the doctor-blade conditions21 and so on, have been proposed to control the morphology of perovskite films, fundamental routes for manipulating the growth of crystalline grains are still lacking. Therefore, a strategy which can help to control the crystal growth and substantially improve the quality and morphology of perovskite films is in urgent demand for the scalable fabrication of PSCs towards commercialization in the future.
In this work, a physical manipulation method based on a rotating magnetic field (RMF) for the growth of high-quality perovskite thin films was proposed and implemented in the case of CH3NH3PbI3 during the blade coating solution process in air. The smooth, uniform, and dense perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 thin-films were controllably produced, which consequently yielded an improved photovoltaic performance of the corresponding devices. The specific manipulation mechanisms of the crystallization of the perovskite films under the RMF were investigated in detail, as well as the film morphology and optical properties. This idea and the tools applied in this work suggest a promising new system for understanding, intrinsically controlling and modifying the growth of perovskite films, and this is definitely worth further in-depth research.
Results and discussion
As the active layer in PSCs, the perovskite film plays a very important role in improving the photovoltaic performance. Therefore, it is crucial to understand and manipulate the crystallization of perovskite films with the aim of feasibly producing a high-quality light absorber. It is well-accepted that a heterogeneous nucleation process occurs during the growth of perovskites.22 Generally, in the early stage of perovskite growth, a cluster or nucleus will be produced when the perovskite precursor solution becomes supersaturated. This process can be explained by eqn (1), which shows the relationship between the initial Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of the atomic group and the size parameter of a cluster (or nucleus) represented by r (for simplicity, the cluster (or nucleus) can be assumed to be a sphere and thus r is the radius of the cluster (or nucleus)):23 (1) (2)here, ΔGV is the bulk free energy change per unit volume, γ is the interfacial tension, and ΔGε is the strain energy change per unit volume, which is a function of strain ε and can be given by eqn (2) (where υ is Poisson’s ratio and μ is the shear modulus). If ΔG reaches the minimum value, the critical nucleation radius (r*) and the critical nucleation energy (ΔG*) can be achieved using eqn (3) and (4):23 (3) (4)
According to eqn (3) and (4), if the strain energy change occurs owing to the imposed strain (ΔGε > 0), which can be derived in various ways, such as the Lorentz force produced by a magnetic field, the growth behaviour of perovskite thin-films would intrinsically change from crystal dynamics: the critical nucleation energy (ΔG*) and critical nucleation radius (r*) would correspondingly decrease, which is believed to lower the threshold for nucleation and allow the formation of more crystal nuclei with reduced sizes.
According to the aforementioned protocol, here, MAPbI3, one of the commonly used perovskite materials, was used as an example case. As shown in Fig. 1a, a simple machine was designed and then assembled to generate a RMF with an intensity of 85 mT through a magnet (rubidium iron N53) at a fixed distance under a blade coater, which was equipped with a heating plate that keeps a constant temperature during the whole process. The fabrication procedure and crystallization process for perovskite films are illustrated in Fig. 1b with specific details outlined in the experimental section.

SEM images of the (c–e) RMF-induced perovskite layer, (f–h) conventionally produced perovskite layer, and (i–k) SMF-induced perovskite layer, at different magnifications. All of the cracks in (h) and (k) were caused by electronic beam scanning. 
As expected, and as seen from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. S1,† with a continuously increasing rotation rate of the magnetic field, the RMF-manipulated perovskite films underwent an obvious decrease in grain size with improved uniformity in the surface morphology. When an optimized rotating rate was adopted during blade coating under the RMF, a smooth surface morphology with homogeneous and closely packed grains in the perovskite film was successfully produced, as displayed in Fig. 1c–e. However, using the conventional process without RMF manipulation a rougher surface with larger and less compact crystal domains mosaicked by some small grains is presented in the film, as shown in Fig. 1f–h. In addition, perovskite films fabricated under a static magnetic field (SMF) were also prepared for comparison (Fig. 1i–k), exhibiting no obvious difference when compared to those fabricated using the conventional process. The improved surface morphology of the films prepared by the RMF was further verified by atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization, in which a smaller root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 19.85 nm was demonstrated in the RMF-induced perovskite film compared to 57.95 nm for that of the conventionally produced film, as displayed in Fig. 2a and b.

Obviously, the RMF plays a significant role during the nucleation and growth of perovskite films. According to Faraday’s law, the introduced sinusoidal alternating magnetic field (B) would correspondingly generate a varying electric field (E), and the relationship between their intensities is illustrated in Fig. 3a and b (a detailed derivation and discussion can be seen in the ESI, S2†). During the blade coating process, the charged cations (such as MA+) or clusters would be subsequently affected by the varying Lorentz force (F).24,25 According to Fleming’s rule (or the left-hand rule)26 the force on the clusters as well as the perovskite nuclei during the crystallization stage under a magnetic field can be described using the model, as illustrated in Fig. 3c and d. Understandably, the relative motion between the clusters and the rotating magnetic field intrinsically generates the Lorentz force which would definitely contribute to the strain induced critical nucleation energy (ΔG*) as mentioned above.

Consequently, smaller nuclei with a larger density would be produced due to the lowered nucleation threshold so that the smooth, pinhole-free and compact CH3NH3PbI3 film with stacking of uniform grains was fabricated as displayed in Fig. 1c–e. Further investigation indicated that the RMF-induced perovskite film still can realize full coverage with a smooth surface morphology even under the much lower crystallization temperature (120 °C), while branched perovskites with low surface coverage are presented in the perovskite film prepared with the conventional method (Fig. S3†). The results gave direct evidence for the reduced critical nucleation energy (ΔG*) due to the introduced Lorentz force. However, in the case of the static magnetic field (SMF), the absence of relative movement between the film and the magnetic field fails to generate a Lorentz force to regulate the crystallization process, which was well evidenced by the barely resolved changes in the perovskite grains when compared with those in the conventional case, as displayed in Fig. 1f–k.
Promisingly, with increasing the surrounding humidity to 80%, a similar film morphology can still be obtained by the RMF-induced process, while rather poor surface coverage in the perovskite was displayed when using the conventional method, as shown in Fig. 4a and b. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement gave further evidence for the similar environmental tolerance. As illustrated in Fig. 4c, both perovskite films induced by the RMF either at RH = 40% or RH = 80% show similar crystallinity in terms of the diffraction peaks at 14.1°, 20.2°and 40.4°, which are assigned to the (110), (112)/(200), and (224)/(400) planes of MAPbI3.27 In the conventionally processed films at RH = 80%, a much more noticeable diffraction peak at 12.8°, originating from PbI2, was resolved when compared to that of the film produced at RH = 40%.28 Here, it should be noted that different from the (110)-plane domination in common perovskite films fabricated by spin coating,29,30 the (112)/(200) planes are dominant in the blade coated films in this work. When introducing the RMF during the blade coating process, the (110) plane diffraction peak was relatively enhanced. These results well demonstrate the enhanced environmental tolerance of this strategy by employing a RMF to intrinsically modify the crystallization process of perovskite grains during the blade coating process in air.

Meanwhile, it has been widely accepted that the solvent has a significant influence during the growth of perovskite films.9,10,31 Here, in order to verify the versatility of RMF-based manipulation of the crystallization, several commonly used solvents, including dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), were employed to fabricate perovskite films by the blade coating method under a RMF. The compositions of the precursors consist of MAI/PbI2 in only DMSO or a mixture of NMP and DMF (4:1 volume ratio). Interestingly, similar surface morphologies of the as-produced perovskite films that either employed only DMSO or a mixture of NMP and DMF were visualized when compared to those in the above films prepared using a DMF/DMSO mixture solvent, as seen in Fig. S4 and S5† compared to Fig. 1. The similarity was also demonstrated in the XRD results as displayed in Fig. S6.† Therefore, in the RMF-assisted process, it is the magnetic field instead of the solvent that intrinsically affects the growth of perovskite films indicating the universal application of this strategy in a large variety of solvents.
The optical properties of the as-produced films with or without RMF manipulation were firstly characterized by steady-state photoluminescence (PL). For the RMF-induced film, it can be seen that the intrinsic fluorescence emission of CH3NH3PbI3 at a wavelength of 776 nm showed a continuous decrement as the rotation rate increased (Fig. 5a), suggesting more efficient electron extraction from the perovskite layer to the electron transfer layer (ETL) and less radiative loss when compared to that in the conventional perovskite.32 Meanwhile, the distinguishable dynamic charge transport behaviour of the films was characterized as illustrated in the TRPL spectra of Fig. 5b with their corresponding lifetimes fitted using a bi-exponential function, as summarized in Table 1. Compared with the conventional perovskite film, the carrier lifetime declined simultaneously (from 15.0 ns to 6.8 ns) along with the rising rotation rate for the RMF-manipulated films. In particular, for the film under a rotation frequency of 1500 rpm, a faster decay lifetime of 3.64 ns (vs. 12.8 ns) and an increased weight fraction of 51.36% (vs. 64.1%) were achieved. This once again demonstrates the efficient extraction and collection of free charge carriers at the interface of the RMF-induced perovskite,33 and this is suggested to originate from the improved electrical properties in the film with a smooth surface and satisfied crystallinity.9

To gain further insight into the effect on the electrical properties resulting from the use of a RMF, the time-dependent photoresponse at a bias of 0 V under illumination was characterized for the cells fabricated on perovskite films with and without RMF manipulation by switching the light ON and OFF. As shown in Fig. 5c, for the RMF-induced cells, a short rise time Δt1 (1.75 s) was obtained showing a fast current response, whereas a relatively slow current response with a longer rise time (Δt2 = 5.89 s) can be resolved in the cells based on the perovskite film without RMF manipulation, suggesting the favourable separation between electrons and holes and charge transfer in the RMF-manipulated perovskite layer. Definitely, the smooth surface morphology with homogeneous, closely packed grains and the increased grain boundaries (GBs), which have been reported to be beneficial for charge separation34 and are inert toward charge recombination,35 should be the main reasons for the rapid and effective charge transportation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were also employed to evaluate the interfacial charge transportation and recombination behaviour as shown in Fig. 5d. The obviously reduced charge transfer resistance (Rct) (Table S1†) in the devices fabricated with RMF manipulation well indicates the significantly improved charge transportation,36–38 and thus this would be helpful for enhancing Jsc and FF in the corresponding devices. Additionally, these results also indicate that the RMF-treated CH3NH3PbI3 films have a typical n-type electronic characteristic, including better conductivity and shorter carrier lifetime, showing a similar phenomenon as that reported in a previous study.39 First-principle calculations by Yan et al. have demonstrated some possible types of point defect in CH3NH3PbI3 films including A (I-rich/Pb-poor), B (moderate) and C (I-poor/Pb-rich) in the chemical range, which would correspondingly produce p-type, intrinsic and n-type electronic structures.40,41 Thus, it is reasonable to infer that the external magnetic field also affected the formation of defects during crystallization, resulting in Pb-rich/I-poor preferred defects in the perovskites after introducing RMF manipulation.
CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells were then fabricated by the blade coating process to verify whether the RMF-induced perovskite film would directly contribute to improving the photovoltaic performances of the PSCs. As shown in Fig. 6a and b, the sections of the active layers of CH3NH3PbI3 were distinguishably imaged for the two types of PSC, which demonstrate consistent morphologies with the above results. As expected, better performances of the PSCs fabricated with RMF manipulation were observed with a maximum PCE of 17.51% compared with that of 15.04% for the conventional ones under standard AM 1.5 solar illumination, as illustrated in Fig. 6c. Understandably, the improved film crystal quality, surface coverage and charge transportation of the perovskite film induced by a RMF during film growth are the intrinsic origins.42 Also, the formation of the dense, smooth, void-free perovskite film is helpful to reduce carrier recombination and current leakage,43 so improvements in Jsc (22.30 mA cm−2vs. 21.25 mA cm−2) and FF (0.74 vs. 0.67) were accomplished. Of course, the higher light absorption and efficient carrier transfer in the RMF-induced perovskite films should also contribute to the enhancement of Jsc benefiting from the effective collection of photoelectrons. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements gave further evidence for the efficient light harvesting and transport properties of the perovskite films produced under RMF manipulation, as seen in Fig. S7.† The integrated Jsc calculated from the IPCE data was also consistent with the increase of Jsc observed in the J–V curves, as displayed in Fig. 6c.

Moreover, a better reproducibility can be achieved in the RMF-manipulated PSCs as demonstrated in the PCE statistical histogram of Fig. 6d. A more concentrated distribution of PCEs with an average value of 13.77% and with an ∼15% increment was obtained in the RMF-modulated devices compared with that of 11.88% in the conventional ones. The corresponding average short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF) also follow the same tendency (ESI Fig. S8†). Furthermore, much lower hysteresis was achieved on the RMF-manipulated perovskite film, as seen in Fig. S9 and S10.† Undoubtedly, such a decreased hysteresis effect should be attributed to the improved electrical properties of the perovskites after introducing the external magnetic field. It has been well-accepted that the ferroelectric behaviour is the dominant reason for the hybrid perovskites exhibiting a hysteresis effect, and this also has been demonstrated to be highly relevant to the MA+ orientation.44 As discussed above, when introducing the magnetic fields during film crystallization, the electric polarization of cations, such as MA+, would be subsequently driven by the external alternating Lorentz force.24,25 As a result, much disorder arrangement of MA+ orientation would potentially occur, which would lead to the reduced hysteresis in the J–V curves for the RMF-manipulated perovskite films.45
The device stability was further evaluated without encapsulation under ambient conditions at ∼25 °C with a RH of 20–60%, as illustrated in Fig. 7a and b. Both kinds of device exhibit good stability up to ∼40 days, although a slightly lower efficiency loss of ∼10% can be characterized in the RMF-modulated devices in contrast to ∼15% loss in the conventional ones. After ∼40 days, there is negligible performance decay in the RMF-manipulated PSCs until ∼70 days, while the conventional devices experienced further reduction in both the current density and open circuit voltage as shown in Fig. S11.† This well demonstrates the better stability of the PSCs fabricated with RMF manipulation during the active film growth.

Conclusions
In summary, a physical strategy employing a rotating magnetic field (RMF) was proposed to manipulate the crystallization of organometal trihalide perovskites during film growth by the solution method. Home-made equipment with a RMF was assembled and applied to produce uniform and compact perovskite layers composed of closely-packed and size-reduced grains. It is further understood that high quality and dense films are intrinsically induced by the reduced critical nucleation energy (ΔG*) due to the introduced Lorentz force under a RMF. The universal application of this process among several commonly used solvents including NMP, DMSO and DMF/DMSO and the excellent environmental tolerance to the changing surrounding humidity from 40% to 80% were also well demonstrated. Correspondingly, a better performance of the PSCs with a maximum PCE of 17.5%, ∼15% increment in average efficiency and better stability was successfully observed based on these RMF-induced perovskite films. Overall, this work opens a new avenue to physically manipulate the crystallization of perovskites for fulfilling the controllable and low-cost fabrication of high performance perovskite devices.
Experimental
Device fabrication
Prior to fabrication, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates (2.0 cm × 2.0 cm in size, 15 Ω per square) were etched by a mixture of zinc powder and hydrochloric acid. After being washed with deionized water, the FTO substrates were further cleaned by a detergent, followed by 20 min ultrasonic cleaning with acetone and isopropanol, respectively. Then a compact TiO2 layer was spin-coated onto the cleaned FTO substrates with 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxidebis (acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in isopropanol, Alfa Aesar) in ethanol at 3000 rpm for 30 s. After that, the substrates were dried at 125 °C for 10 min and transferred to a heating plate for annealing at 550 °C for 30 min. Then a treatment in 0.04 M TiCl4 aqueous solution was performed at 70 °C for 30 min. After drying, a mesostructured TiO2 (m-TiO2) layer was deposited onto the substrates by spin coating the TiO2 paste (Dyesol DSL 18NR-T) dissolved in ethanol (1:6, mass ratio) at 5000 rpm for 30 s, followed by baking at 125 °C for 5 min and annealing at 550 °C for 30 min in air. For perovskite layer deposition, 461 mg PbI2 (99.9985%, Alfa Aesar) and 159 mg MAI (Xi’an Polymer Light Technology, 99.9%) were dissolved in the solvents, including a mixed solution of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99%, Alfa Aesar) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99%, Alfa Aesar) (where the volume ratio of DMF/DMSO is 4:1), bare DMSO, and a mixture of NMP and DMF (4:1 = v/v%), and then stirred for 30 min. The m-TiO2 substrates were transferred to the homemade blade coating machine, which was equipped with a rotating magnetic field and a thermal plate. During film blading, the 10–20 μL precursor was dropped onto a substrate followed by a coating process at a constant speed of 0.75 cm s−1. The same procedures were carried out when using different solution combinations. Then annealing for 10–15 min was performed to finalize the fabrication of RMF-induced perovskite thin-films. Afterwards, a hole transporting material (HTM) layer was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s onto the perovskite film using spiro-MeOTAD (72.3 mg, Lumtech) in chlorobenzene (1 mL) with additives of 4-tert-butylpyridine (28.8 μL) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide solution (17.5 μL, Li-TFSI, 520 mg Li-TSFI in 1 mL acetonitrile, Alfa Aesar). Finally, 100 nm-thick gold electrodes were evaporated under vacuum at 2 × 10−7 Torr to configure the devices with an active area of 0.11 cm2.
Characterizations
The top-view and cross-sectional morphology images of the samples were taken by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (S-4800, Hitachi) at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. The UV-vis absorption spectra were collected by a spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu). X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Ultima IV, Rigaku) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154178 nm) was employed to investigate the crystallinity of the perovskite films within a 2θ range of 5–50°. The IPCE data were collected using a power source (66920, Newport, 300 W xenon lamp) with a monochromator (Cornerstone 260, Newport) and an optical power meter (2936-R, Newport). The J–V curves were measured under irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G illumination) provided by a xenon-based solar simulator (94022A, Newport, Class ABA) integrated with a source meter (2400, Keithley) and calibrated by a standard Si reference cell (91150V) with the certification of the NREL. The PL spectra (both of steady-state and transient-state) were measured using an FLS980 (Edinburgh) steady state fluorescence spectrometer. The photocurrent response of the perovskite photovoltaic devices was recorded by an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660D) under simulated solar irradiation (AM 1.5) controlled by a digital shutter.

 	Fig. 1  (a) A schematic representation of the home-made equipment for the RMF-induced doctor-blading process and (b) the deposition, nucleation and grain growth mechanisms of perovskite thin-films. SEM images of the (c–e) RMF-induced perovskite layer, (f–h) conventionally produced perovskite layer, and (i–k) SMF-induced perovskite layer, at different magnifications. All of the cracks in (h) and (k) were caused by electronic beam scanning.	 

 	Fig. 2  AFM (size: 5 μm × 5 μm) images of the (a) RMF-induced perovskite film compared to (b) the conventional one, and their corresponding three dimensional topographies shown in (c) and (d), respectively.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) A schematic illustration of the coating region under a RMF (assuming the magnet rotation starts from the s-pole position at cycle 0); (b) the variation curve of the magnetic field intensity (MFI) and the electric field intensity (EFI) near the perovskite film within a rotation period of T (T = 2π/ω, ω is the angular frequency); (c) and (d) schematic illustrations of the magnetic field distribution and the Lorentz forces applied to the charged cations or clusters at cycles of 0.25T and 0.75T, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  SEM images of perovskite thin-films fabricated under a RH of 80% by (a) RMF manipulation and (b) the conventional method. (c) XRD patterns of FTO and the perovskite films produced at different humidities with and without RMF treatments.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Steady-state photoluminescence and (b) time-resolved photoluminescence characterization of the RMF-induced perovskite thin-film with different rotation rates: 350 rpm, 700 rpm, 1050 rpm and 1500 rpm, when compared with the conventional one. (c) The photoresponse performance of RMF-manipulated PSCs and conventional PSCs. (d) Nyquist plots of both kinds of PSCs measured under dark conditions. The equivalent circuit model adopted for the fitting of the impedance spectra is shown in the inset.
