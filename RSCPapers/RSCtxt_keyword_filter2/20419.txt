    , Accepted 8th February 2022First published on 8th February 2022AbstractCarbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) are recognized as low-cost stable photovoltaics. However, currently most highly efficient C-PSCs are optically opaque, which means that they can only utilize direct illumination but cannot efficiently utilize the reflected irradiance. Here we propose bifacial C-PSCs incorporating transparent carbon-nanotube (CNT) network films in the rear electrode to efficiently utilize the reflected irradiation. By systematically optimizing the type and size of representative CNTs (including MWCNTs and SWCNTs), we find that the SWCNT-PSCs show a monofacial-power-conversion-efficiency (monofacial-PCE) of up to 21.4%, whereas the SWCNT-PSCs reach a bifacial power output of 24.0 mW cm−2 in natural reflecting surroundings (20% of AM 1.5 G irradiance) and 34.1 mW cm−2 in artificial reflecting surroundings (100% of AM 1.5 G irradiance). The bifacial SWCNT-PSCs also show high operational stability with a loss of 5% under 1000 h full sun continuous illumination. Moreover, we achieved a PCE of 27.1% by using our bifacial device as a top cell together with a CIS bottom cell in a 4-T tandem. These findings point to a promising direction for improving the output power per unit area of PSCs.

Broader context
For solar cells, increasing the power output per unit active area is an eternal pursuit. However, currently almost all types of solar cells are optically opaque (namely monofacial solar cells), which means that they can only utilize direct illumination but cannot utilize the reflected irradiance (albedo) that is pervasive in real-world conditions. Furthermore, these monofacial solar cells are not applicable to fabricating four-terminal (4-T) tandem solar cells. Developing advanced bifacial photovoltaics has long been a goal to pursue high output per unit active area and to fabricate highly efficient 4-T solar cells. The key to obtaining efficient bifacial photovoltaics is to develop highly conductive transparent electrodes and to prepare high efficiency semi-transparent solar cells, which is of great importance but very challenging.

Introduction
Semiconducting perovskite materials have drawn tremendous attention in the past decade due to their excellent photovoltaic (PV) properties such as a large light absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion length, and robust defect tolerance.1–7 Monofacial perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have reached a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.5% based on direct AM 1.5 G irradiation, which is comparable to the efficiency of Si-based solar cells.1,8 The rapid development of PSCs, and their impact on the global renewable energy landscape, is driving a huge amount of effort worldwide in commercializing PSC technology.9,10 However, the PCE of a monofacial PSC panel relies mainly on ideal AM 1.5 G irradiance, and such direct irradiation is reduced due to azimuth and tilt angles in real-world conditions.11–15 Moreover, the additional reflected irradiation is typically more than 20% of AM 1.5 G irradiance in natural reflecting surroundings and could be increased to 100% of AM 1.5 G irradiance by introducing artificial reflecting surroundings, which is wasted in the prevailing monofacial PSCs.12,16–25 Thus, there is an urgent need to develop PSCs to take advantage of the albedo by efficiently utilizing the reflected irradiation.26,27 As a result, bifacial PSC panels have been proposed to convert both direct and reflected irradiation to electricity and increase the output power of modules with minimal additional cost.12,28
The main challenge for preparing high-performance bifacial PSCs lies in replacing the opaque metal rear electrode with a transparent and conductive charge collector using a simple and economical fabrication method. This would allow the transmission of the reflected light through the rear electrode to guarantee high bifacial light absorption.11,24 Recently, various strategies have been implemented to develop transparent and conductive rear electrodes.29,30 A significant amount of research has been devoted to developing ultra-thin metal electrodes that include, but are not limited to, silver (Ag), gold (Au), aluminum (Al), and copper (Cu). However, these ultra-thin metal electrodes suffered from visible light absorption due to their plasmonic effect, and relatively low stability in air.16,31 In order to replace the metal electrodes, transparent conductive oxides (TCOs), carbon-based materials and organic conductive polymers have been used.32–34 Fu et al. reported a sputtered hydrogenated indium oxide (In2O3:H) as a transparent rear electrode, and realized a 14.5%-PCE hysteresis-free planar PSC.35 Peng et al. reported the use of chemical vapor deposited (CVD) graphene as a transparent rear electrode, and realized a 12.4%-PCE semitransparent PSC.32 Park et al. reported PEDOT:PSS as a transparent rear electrode, and realized a 13.6%-PCE semitransparent PSC.36 Obviously, the PCEs of nonmetallic electrode devices are greatly reduced. This will inevitably lead to a lower bifacial power output, which may be even lower than the monofacial power output of the mainstream device and defeats the purpose of designing bifacial devices.
The key to increasing the PCEs of nonmetallic electrode devices is to improve the charge collection ability of the back electrode.39 To solve this problem, in our previous work, we designed a new type of stable and efficient modular carbon-based PSC.33 The PCE of the modular graphene-based PSC is greatly improved to 18.6% by combining a conductive substrate (i.e., FTO, Al foil et al.) and a carbon electrode. However, the poor bifaciality of the graphene-based PSC (∼30%, ratio of PCE when illuminated from the front- and rear-sides) has a limited ability to increase the bifacial output power. Therefore, the key to greatly improving the bifacial output power of the modular carbon-based PSCs is to achieve both efficient monofacial PCE and high bifaciality.
Herein we report a transparent electrode incorporating a carbon-nanotube (CNT) network on a TCO substrate (FTO or ITO) as a new type of transparent electrode, which demonstrates good extraction and transport of photo-induced holes due to its high electrical conductivity. By optimizing the type and size of the CNTs (including MWCNTs and SWCNTs), we enhance the monofacial-PCE of the bifacial PSCs to 21.4% under only direct irradiation. This corresponds to the highest PCE reported so far for bifacial PSCs prepared at low temperatures (<85 °C). The bifacial power output under the standard test (IEC TS 60904-1-2) is 24.0 mW cm−2 for naturally reflecting surroundings (20% of AM 1.5 G irradiance) and 34.1 mW cm−2 for the artificially reflecting surroundings (100% of AM 1.5 G irradiance). We further show that bifacial PSCs are operationally stable under one-sun illumination for over 1000 h. More importantly, when coupling our bifacial solar cell with a 1.0-eV CuInSe2 (CIS) solar cell, we achieve 27.1% efficient perovskite/CIS thin film tandem solar cells.
Results and discussion
To examine the extraction ability of photo-induced holes of the CNT-based transparent electrode, we employ the layered architecture glass/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/CNT (Fig. 1a). The representative multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) material is dispersed into isopropanol solution after ball-milling for 12 h and sprayed on the HTL. The optical image of the MWCNT network (Fig. 1d, denoted as MWCNT/1) shows that the radius of the prepared MWCNT is about 40–100 nm, and its wall number exceeds 50. The radius of the MWCNT/1 is further confirmed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) picture, shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). We sprayed a specific (double-circle-like) shape of the MWCNT/1 network on the HTL layer for the following model experiments. As illustrated in Fig. 1b and c, the photo-induced holes will be transported through the HTL and collected by the MWCNT/1 network. Thus, a severe photoluminescence (PL) quenching effect will be further strengthened at the interface between the MWCNT/1 network and the HTL position. When exposed to a short pulse light excitation, the PL quenching effect could be clearly monitored in the widened particular shape of the MWCNT/1 network (Fig. 1e). Meanwhile, we find that there are some inevitable nano-clasts which are removed from the CNTs in the CNT-based dispersion solution prepared by ball milling. These nano-clasts also possess good charge extraction ability and cause fluorescence attenuation. The enlarged PL quenching region compared with the primitive shape of the MWCNT/1 network could be explained by the wide active region due to the Ohmic contact between the MWCNT/1 network and the HTL. Fig. 1f shows the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the prepared MWCNT/1 network electrode used in bifacial PSCs. The decent coverage of the MWCNT/1 network with a wide active region guarantees effective hole-collection from the HTL by the MWCNT/1 network.

To utilize the transparent CNT network electrode at the device level, a semi-cell A was fabricated by sequentially depositing a SnO2 electron-transport layer (ETL), perovskite layer, hole-transport layer (HTL), and MWCNT/1 network, while another charge collector B was prepared by spraying the MWCNT/1 network on an FTO/glass substrate. The final cell illustrated in Fig. 2a was thus achieved by stacking the semi-cell A and charge collector B under a small pressure (0.0025 MPa). The thickness (8.7 μm) of the MWCNT/1 film obtained from depositing 500 μL of MWCNT/1 slurry (4 mg ml−1 isopropanol solution) was determined from the cross-sectional SEM image of the MWCNT/1 film as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Based on the linear relationship between the CNT layer thickness and the deposited volume of the MWCNT/1 slurry, we varied the thickness simply by changing the volume of the dispersion slurry of MWCNT/1. Fig. 2b shows that the monofacial-PCE obtained from the prepared cells is sharply increasing with the thickness of the MWCNT/1 films due to lower sheet resistance. More details of the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†). For MWCNT/1-PSCs with FTO, as the gap between two rigid surfaces (spiro-OMeTAD/FTO) is gradually filled with the MWCNT/1 film (thickness < 500 nm), the charge transfer paths are constructed. Therefore, the PCE of MWCNT/1-PSCs with FTO is improved rapidly. For MWCNT/1-PSCs without FTO, the PCEs increase slowly in a larger carbon layer thickness range (<4000 nm). The reason is that the conductivity of the carbon electrode is relatively lower as compared to FTO, and its charge collection capability depends heavily on the increase of carbon electrode thickness. The gradual decrease of PCE in thicker MWCNT/1 films may be rationalized by the elongation of the transportation path for the photo-induced holes and lowering of the shunt resistance at the device level, leading to the lower open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). Thus, the champion PCE obtained from the J–V curves (Fig. S3, ESI†) in the semi cell is 14.4% with a 4.0 μm MWCNT/1 film thickness. The monofacial-PCE value (Fig. S4, ESI†) is further improved to 18.7% in the final cell with a 0.4 μm MWCNT/1 film thickness. The higher monofacial-PCE with decreasing MWCNT/1 film thickness is due to a substantial contribution in the electrical conductivity from the incorporation of FTO in the hole collector electrode. The morphology of the 400 nm thick MWCNT/1 film is recorded in Fig. S5 (ESI†). A clear MWCNT/1 network is presented with uniform spatial distributions of the multijunction between the adjacent carbon nanotubes. We also subjected the monofacial-PCE to illumination from the rear side yielding a very low PCE value of 0.6% calculated from the J–V curves in Fig. 2c compared to a PCE of 18.7% for the front illumination. The inset in Fig. 2c shows the steady-state power output (SPObi) of the prepared solar cells, which is consistent with the monofacial-PCE. Moreover, the PCE of the coresponding Au-PSC is 23.4% (Fig. S6, ESI†), indicating that there is still a large space to improve the monofacial-PCE of CNT-PSCs. Fig. 2d shows that the poor transmittance of light across the visible light region by the 400 nm thick MWCNT/1 film is responsible for the poor performance. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) and intergrated current density of the MWCNT/1-based bifacial solar cell illuminated from the front side and rear side are illustrated in Fig. 2e, matching with the Jsc value. The specific photovoltaic metrics of the MWCNT/1-based PSCs illuminated separately from the front and rear sides are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†).

To enhance the transmittance of the sprayed carbon nanotube films, we further change the multiwall carbon nanotubes to a diameter of 10 nm (denoted as MWCNT/2) as illustrated in Fig. 3a and b, with a wall number of about 6. Meanwhile, the conductive substrate FTO was replaced by ITO with a higher transparency. The as-sprayed thin film also demonstrates a uniform network morphology as shown in Fig. S7a (ESI†). The network structure of the CNT electrode with a large interspace is beneficial to light transmittance. Moreover, single-wall carbon nanotubes with a radius of 2 nm (denoted as SWCNTs) are also utilized here to enhance the transmittance (Fig. 3d, e and Fig. S7b, ESI†). Both MWCNT/2 and SWCNTs show superior electrical conductivity (Fig. S8, ESI†) compared with MWCNT/1 in the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) experiment illustrated in Fig. S9 (ESI†). However, the optical transmittance (Fig. S10, ESI†) from SWCNTs is higher across the visible light region than that of the MWCNT/2 films with the same thickness, which explains the better bifacial PV performance realized by the SWCNT-PSC. In Fig. 3c and f, the monofacial-PCE from MWCNT/2-PSCs is 22.2% for front illumination and 10.8% for rear illumination while the respective values for the monofacial-PCE obtained with SWCNT-PSCs are 21.4% and 16.8%. These PCE values are also consistent with the EQE results and integrated current densities shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The PV performance parameter statistics of a bifacial CNT-PSC illuminated from the front side based on MWCNT/2 and SWCNT electrodes are summarized in Fig. 3g and the steady-state PCE of MWCNT/2-PSC and SWCNT-PSC is shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). Details of the photovoltaic metrics are summarized in Table 1. It should be noted that, while the monofacial-PCE from MWCNT/2-PSCs from front illumination is slightly higher than the monofacial-PCE from SWCNT-PSCs, the monofacial-PCE from SWCNT-PSCs from rear illumination is significantly higher than the monofacial-PCE from MWCNT/2-PSCs. Typical unencapsulated MWCNT/2-PSC and SWCNT-PSC were chosen for stability testing in a N2 atmosphere (25 °C) under continuous one sun illumination. The continuous MPP tracking of the PV performance (Fig. 3h and Fig. S13, ESI†) shows that the Au-PSC drops below 50% of its initial efficiency within 500 h. In contrast, both MWCNT/2-PSC and SWCNT-PSC maintained 95% of their initial PCE after 1000 h of continuous operation. This clearly demonstrates the high operational stability of MWCNT/2-PSC and SWCNT-PSC, which is consistent with the excellent inherently hydrophobic and chemically inert nature of the CNT network films that reduces the exposure of the PSCs to ambient moisture and the reaction with iodide ions diffused from the perovskite layer.

Both MWCNT/2-PSC and SWCNT-PSC exhibit great potential in the bifacial solar cell application. Thus, theoretical modeling is performed to predict the bifacial-PV performance of MWCNT/2-PSC and SWCNT-PSC. Fig. 4a and b present a schematic diagram of the bifacial solar cell used in the natural and artificial reflected surroundings. In the natural reflected surroundings, the cloud and the ground will offer additional diffuse reflected irradiance from the sunlight illumination. The total reflected irradiance to the rear side of bifacial solar cells could be approximately 20% of the AM 1.5 G to the front side of bifacial solar cells. However, in the artificial reflected surroundings, a simple mirror structure can be designed here to perform the specular reflection of AM 1.5 G to the rear side of bifacial solar cells. In this circumstance, 100% or more of the AM 1.5 G could be achieved. According to the following eqn (1)–(4), the simulation of the PV performance (Voc-bi, Isc-bi, FFbi, and PObi) based on the front side electrical parameter (Voc-f, Isc-f, FFf and ηf) rear side short circuit current (Isc-f) under standard test conditions and the rear side irradiance (x) is performed.15,37,38 Due to series resistance in PSCs, the open-circuit voltage of the bifacial solar cells (Voc-bi, Fig. S14a, ESI†) is gradually increasing and its fill factor (FFbi, Fig. S14c, ESI†eqn (3)) is decreasing with the enhancement of the rear side irradiance (x) based on eqn (1). The short-circuit current of the bifacial solar cells (Jsc-bi, Fig. S14b, ESI†) is dramatically increasing with the higher rear side irradiance (x) based on eqn (2). This could be attributed to the high photocurrent density proportional to the additional absorbed photon flux in the bifacial solar cells. In all, the theoretical equivalent bifacial power output (PObi, eqn (4)) is summarized in Fig. 4c and the SWCNT-PSCs show the highest theoretical PV performance in the bifacial solar cells under higher rear-side irradiance. It should be noted that the predicted bifacial power output per unit area (34.4 mW cm−2) of MWCNT/2-PSCs in the artificial reflected surroundings has the potential to be equivalent to the monofacial power output per unit area from monofacial-PSCs of up to 34.4%. (1) Isc–bi = RIscIsc–f = Isc–f + (Isc–r)x(2) (3) (4)

We measured the bifacial-PV performance of MWCNT/2-PSCs using PSC devices of the architecture shown in Fig. 2a. The cross-section of the semi-cell A in SWCNT-PSCs is presented in Fig. 4d. Due to the limitation of the experimental setup, the single light source method is used here to examine the bifacial power output of SWCNT-PSC. The equivalent indoor characterization standard method described in IEC TS 60904-1-2 is introduced as a single light source method (Fig. S15, ESI†) in the measurement of the bifacial PV performance.21,24,38 For the single light source method, an equivalent irradiance (total of standard test condition irradiance and rear-side irradiance Grear multiplied by bifacial factor φ = min (Irear/Ifront, Prear/Pfront)) is projected onto the front-side of the test module. The 20% and 100% of AM 1.5 G irradiance were chosen to represent the natural reflected surroundings and artificial reflected surroundings, respectively. In the natural reflected surroundings, the PObi from the J–V curves is 24.6 mW cm−2 (Fig. 4e, ESI†). Under the artificial albedo conditions, the reverse scan of the J–V curves shows a Voc of 1.136 V, a Jsc of 43.6 mA.cm−2, an FF of 0.694 and a PObi of 34.3 mW cm−2. Detailed performance parameters are summarized in Table S4 (ESI†). To further confirm the bifacial-PV performance, we also utilized the double light source method described in IEC TS 60904-1-2 to test the PCE values. Such standard test is illustrated in Fig. S16a, (ESI†) where the tested solar cell is under continuous AM.1.5 G illumination calibrated by a Si reference cell from the front and rear side simultaneously enabled by the mirror design.24,25 Under the standard test method, the SPObi obtained (Fig. S16b, S17 and Table S5, ESI†) is still 34.2 W m−2. The solid bifacial-PV performance clearly demonstrates the potential of bifacial PSCs to boost the equivalent bifacial-PCE performance by utilizing the additional reflected irradiance. The SWCNT-PSCs are further developed to construct perovskite/CIS tandem solar cells in a 4-terminal (4-T) configuration where the SWCNT-PSC acts as the top cell (Fig. 5a). A state-of-the-art CIS with a 1.0 eV band gap is used as the bottom cell. The J–V curves of the 4-T tandem devices are shown in Fig. 5b. The stand-alone CIS solar cell exhibits a PCE of 17.9% with a Voc of 0.584 V, a Jsc of 42.0 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.731. The filtered CIS cell yields of a PCE of 5.7% with a Voc of 0.549 V, a Jsc of 14.3 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.724. All of the Jsc values are consistent with the integrated values from EQE spectra shown in Fig. 5c. When paired with the 21.4% SWCNT-PSC top cell, the PCE of the SWCNT-PSC/CIS tandem solar cell reaches 27.1% in the 4-T tandem configuration. The specific PV parameters for the SWCNT-PSC/CIS 4-terminal tandem solar cell are summarized in Table 2.

Conclusions
We have shown that the CNT network films sprayed at low temperature are capable of extracting the photo-induced holes from the HTL. PSCs based on the CNT network films exhibit a PCE of 21.4% when illuminated only from the front side. The monofacial-PV performance was further improved by changing the type and radius of the CNT hole collector. Bifacial illumination in natural albedo (20% of AM 1.5 G irradiance) produces a power output of 24.0 W m−2, increasing to 34.1 W m−2 in artificial reflecting surroundings (100% of AM 1.5 G irradiance). The sprayed CNT network films also protected PSCs from environmental stress. The PCE degraded to only 95% of the initial PCE after 1000 h of continuous operation. More importantly, when coupling our bifacial solar cell with a 1.04 eV CIS solar cell, we achieve 27.1%-efficient perovskite/CIS thin film tandem solar cells. Based on all our results, we envision that the bifacial PSCs incorporating the CNT-network films point to a fruitful research direction for developing stable PSCs accommodating the complicated irradiation conditions and efficiently utilizing the reflected irradiation. These results also have implications on the development of the prevailing perovskite-based tandem photovoltaics.

Broader context
For solar cells, increasing the power output per unit active area is an eternal pursuit. However, currently almost all types of solar cells are optically opaque (namely monofacial solar cells), which means that they can only utilize direct illumination but cannot utilize the reflected irradiance (albedo) that is pervasive in real-world conditions. Furthermore, these monofacial solar cells are not applicable to fabricating four-terminal (4-T) tandem solar cells. Developing advanced bifacial photovoltaics has long been a goal to pursue high output per unit active area and to fabricate highly efficient 4-T solar cells. The key to obtaining efficient bifacial photovoltaics is to develop highly conductive transparent electrodes and to prepare high efficiency semi-transparent solar cells, which is of great importance but very challenging.
