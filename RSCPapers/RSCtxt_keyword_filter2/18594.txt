    , Accepted 19th May 2016First published on 19th May 2016AbstractThe real-life application of polymer solar cells (PSCs) requires both a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and a long enough lifetime. In order to avoid microstructure evolution and enhance device thermal stability, various different amounts of terminal vinyl moieties have been integrated into the side chains of poly(benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione), a previously reported high performance donor–acceptor photovoltaic polymer, to produce a series of crosslinkable polymers named PBDTTPD-Vx (where x is defined as the molar content of vinyl units). It has been found that the larger the vinyl content the polymer contains, the larger the amount of polymer remaining on the substrate after thermal crosslinking and solvent washing. However, the optimized PSC device based on such a polymer and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) displayed a decreased efficiency. These studies have discovered that a vinyl content as small as 2.5% is enough for this family of crosslinkable polymers to achieve effective crosslinking, while at the same time maintaining their high photovoltaic performance. The optimized PBDTTPD-V0.025/PC71BM device showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.06% after thermal crosslinking, which represents the highest recorded efficiency among PSC devices with crosslinked active layers. Furthermore, this crosslinked device successfully retained 91% of its initial PCE after thermal treatment at 150 °C for 40 h, which was much better than the non-crosslinkable PBDTTPD-V0/PC71BM cell.
Introduction
Solution-processable polymer solar cells (PSCs) possess the advantages of being lightweight, flexible, low-cost, and adaptable to high-throughput industrial manufacture methods, such as roll-to-roll printing.1–4 In the few past decades, numerous high performance donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymer photovoltaic materials have been invented and have substantially improved the record of light-to-electric power conversion efficiency (PCE) to over 10% for single junction devices5–9 and 11% for tandem cells.10–12 With this tremendous progress, PSCs have become more reliable as a green solar power generation technology and have excited both scientific and industrial communities. Although such efficiency levels need further improvement, a more challenging task in this field is to produce a device with both high efficiency and sufficient long-term stability. For the latter issue, it has been predicted that a lifetime at least 10 years is required for PSC to be of practical use.13,14
Since the active layer of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs is composed of a physical blend of electron donor and acceptor materials, its microstructure plays a vitally important role in both the device efficiency and stability. In order to ensure effective exciton collection and splitting into charge, while also providing both hole and electron transportation channels, the components of the donor and acceptor materials are required to form a bi-continuous phase-separated network with all domain widths within the magnitude of the exciton diffusion length (ca. 10–20 nm).1,2 Although most factors and principles that govern the formation of a blended film microstructure remain unclear to date, it has been well documented that the proper choice of a processing solvent system (which may include the main solvent, a co-solvent, and/or a solvent additive) and a specific annealing treatment at a desirable temperature and/or under a solvent vapour can aid the construction of a good microstructure in many BHJ devices, and thus endow them with high performance.3,15 However, since no specific interaction among these blending components has been engaged to fix them, such nanoscale phase-separated microstructures are thermodynamically metastable and tend to further evolve to yield large-scale phase separation. In fact, it has often been reported that annealing treatment greatly enhances device efficiency over a short time period, but this is followed by a sharp decline in efficiency when the annealing time is more prolonged.16 In most of these scenarios, macroscale phase separation and the presence of large aggregates were observed.16–19 Considering that thermal stress exists throughout the whole device lifetime, particularly under operating conditions, how to avoid phase evolution in the active layer has become one of the important keys to achieving long-term stability for PSC devices.
So far, the implementation of crosslinking between active layer components after the formation of an effective microstructure has been considered as a simple and powerful solution to the above issue.3 To realize the purpose of this crosslinking, several approaches have been investigated in the field, including the utilization of crosslinkable donor polymers,20,21 fullerene acceptors,22,23 and additives.24,25 Compared with the latter two approaches, the former approach may cause less perturbation of the active layer microstructure of the initial system since only a small number of crosslinkable moieties are required to be integrated into the polymer side chains. Thus, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), one of the benchmark photovoltaic polymers in the field, has been widely altered into different crosslinkable materials by integrating terminal vinyl,26 bromo,20 oxetane,27 or azide28 groups into its side chains. Devices based on the prepared polymers have all shown enhanced thermal stability. However, the best efficiency was reported to be 3.3%, which is much lower than the present record PSC efficiency level. Recently, a crosslinkable strategy has also been applied to D–A polymers. For example, Mynar, Fréchet, and co-workers synthesized bromoalkyl-functionalized poly(benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione) (PBDTTPD),29 which had been previously demonstrated to be a high-performance photovoltaic material with a best PCE of 8.5%.30 The device based on the crosslinkable PBDTTPD polymer displayed an initial PCE of 3.3% after UV-crosslinking, but this increased to 4.7% after thermal annealing at 150 °C for 72 h.29 In another work, Krebs et al. reported a series of poly(thiophene-alt-quinoxaline) polymers containing various crosslinkable functionalities, but with no discrete PCE data. More recently, poly(benzodithiophene-alt-thienothiophene) polymers, another family of high-performance polymers in the field, have been modified with different crosslinkable moieties.31–33 However, only two works achieved a PCE over 4% with the prepared crosslinked devices.29,32 Therefore, it is clear that the exploration of crosslinkable photovoltaic polymers that lead to both high device efficiency and long-term stability remains a challenge in this field.
In this work, we report a new series of crosslinkable polymers named PBDTTPD-Vx (Scheme 1, x = 0, 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.10), which each possess a different molar content (x) of terminal vinyl units in their side chains. It was found that a vinyl content as small as 2.5% is sufficient for the polymer to achieve effective crosslinking and also favor keeping its original high photovoltaic performance. The optimized PSC device prepared based on this polymer (PBDTTPD-V0.025) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) exhibited a PCE of 6.06% after thermal crosslinking. To the best of our knowledge, this PCE datum represents the highest achieved for a PSC device based on a crosslinkable polymer material. Furthermore, this crosslinked device retained 91% of its initial PCE upon thermal treatment of the active layer at 150 °C for 40 h, which was much higher than the 63% of the initial PCE obtained for a device based on the non-crosslinkable polymer, PBDTTPD-V0. This work exemplifies that the integration of the right crosslinkable unit in a controlled, small amount to currently known high performance D–A photovoltaic polymers can result in PSC devices with both high PCE and long-term stability.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis of PBDTTPD-Vx is outlined in Scheme 1. A vinyl-functionalized BDT (monomer a) was employed as the third monomer to construct the vinyl-functionalized PBDTTPD polymers. Its synthesis followed a method similar to that for monomer b and is described in detail in ESI.† Stille-coupling polymerization of these monomers in a molar ratio of a:b:c = x:y:1, in which x + y = 1, afforded the final polymers PBDTTPD-Vx (x = 0, 0.0125; 0.025; 0.05 and 0.10) in yields of 69–81%. All of the obtained polymers showed good solubility in common chlorinated solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB). However, in their 1H NMR spectra, only broad peaks were observed even when the spectra were recorded in o-dichlorobenzene-d4 at 110 °C (Fig. S3, S5, S7, S9 and S11†). This suggests the existence of strong interchain interactions in these polymers when in solution. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) revealed that the prepared polymers had number-average molecular weights (Mn) in the range of 12.0–16.2 kDa and polydispersity indices (PDIs) of 2.73–3.28 (Table 1, Fig. S4, S6, S8, S10 and S12†). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that all five polymers possess sufficient stability with 5%-weight-loss temperatures (Td) of over 335 °C (Table 1 and Fig. S13†). Furthermore, no thermal transition was found for any of these polymers in the range of 0–300 °C in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements (Fig. S14†).

Optical and electrochemical properties
The polymer UV-vis absorption spectra in dilute chlorobenzene solutions and thin films are shown in Fig. 1a and their data are summarized in Table 1. It is clear that all these polymers whether with terminal vinyl units in their side chains or not exhibit an intense light absorption in the region of 350–650 nm with several peaks at similar wavelengths. The absorption band around 449 nm is assignable to the π–π* transition of the conjugated backbones of the polymers, while that around 550 nm comes from the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition between electron-donating BDT and electron-accepting TPD units in the main chains. In the film state spectra, these two peaks are almost at the same position. Besides these two peaks, an absorption maximum around 600 nm could be clearly identified in both the solution and film spectra. Furthermore, a shoulder peak around 625 nm was observed in the solution spectra. All of these observations suggest the existence of strong interchain π–π stacking interactions in either the solution or film state for all of the synthesised polymers. As expected, the integration of vinyl units into a small part of the side chains did not alter materials’ light-absorption properties, as evidenced by the lack of a big change in the solution and film spectra. However, when these spectra are carefully compared, especially those of the solutions, there are subtle differences that exist in the relative peak intensity. The intensities of the absorption maxima around 600 and 625 nm relative to that at 550 nm decreased along with the increase in vinyl content in the polymer. This implies that changing the 2-ethylhexoxyl side chains in BDT units into slightly longer 10-undecenoxyl side chains would retard interchain π–π stacking interactions and may exert a disfavourable effect on regular chain-packing, charge transportation and photovoltaic application.

(b) Cyclic voltammetry of the PBDTTPD-Vx films deposited on glassy carbon electrodes in acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6 electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. 
Estimated from the absorption onsets of their film spectra, the optical energy bandgaps (Eg,opt) of the crosslinkable PBDTTPD-Vx polymers (x = 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.10) with terminal vinyl units were found to be in the range of 1.77–1.81 eV (Table 1), which are similar to that of the non-crosslinkable PBDTTPD-V0 polymer (1.75 eV). Furthermore, from cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. 1b, Table 1), these crosslinkable polymers exhibited onset oxidation potentials (Eox,onset) between 0.58–0.61 V in reference to a Ag/Ag+ standard electrode. Since the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple with a standard energy level of −4.8 eV appeared at 0.091 V under the same conditions, the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were calculated to be −5.33 to −5.29 eV and −3.55 to −3.48 eV, respectively. Again, all of these values are almost equal to those of PBDTTPD-V0 (Table 1), indicating that the integration of vinyl units into the side chains does not have a significant impact on the material’s HOMO and LUMO energy levels.
Thermal curing behaviour
It has been reported that terminal vinyl-appended polymers can be crosslinked upon heating at 150 °C.26 In order to assess the crosslinking ability of PBDTTPD-Vx and to know the effect of the vinyl content, polymer films were prepared by spin-coating chlorobenzene solutions onto glass plates and subjecting them to heat treatment at 150 °C for 30 min. Afterwards, all of the films were dipped into boiling chlorobenzene in order to remove any soluble fraction of the polymer. The remaining fraction was estimated by means of UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and using A/A0 at its absorption maximum (where A0 is the initial absorbance and A is the remaining absorbance after solvent washing) as an index (Fig. 2). As expected, all of the polymer chains in the PBDTTPD-V0 film were removed because it does not contain any vinyl content. In the case of PBDTTPD-V0.0125, a fraction of only 7.4% remained after thermal treatment and solvent washing. In contrast, when the vinyl content was raised to over 2.5%, the remaining fraction was greatly enhanced to 72.2% for PBDTTPD-V0.025, 80.0% for PBDTTPD-V0.05, and 81.5% for PBDTTPD-V0.10 (Fig. 2b). These results suggest that a vinyl content of 2.5% is sufficient to freeze most parts of the polymer chains in the film.

Photovoltaic performance
In order to evaluate photovoltaic performance of the PBDTTPD-Vx polymers, PSC devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al were fabricated and optimized. It was found that the optimized active layers for all of the PBDTTPD-Vx polymers could be obtained by spin-coating a chlorobenzene solution containing the relevant polymer and PC71BM in a weight ratio of 1:1.5 with 5% (v/v) 1-chloronaphthalene as a processing additive. Moreover, the active layer of the non-crosslinkable PBDTTPD-V0 polymer was thermal annealed at 120 °C for 10 min prior to deposition of the top electrode, while those based on the other PBDTTPD-Vx polymers bearing crosslinkable vinyl units were annealed at 150 °C for 30 min instead. Fig. 3a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized PSC devices and their parameters are summarized in Table 2. Obviously, the device based on the non-crosslinkable polymer, PBDTTPD-V0, displayed the best performance in the family. Its PCE reached 6.93% with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.96 V, a short-circuit current (JSC) of 11.29 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) value of 64.2%. When vinyl units were introduced into the polymer, all of the PSC device parameters showed a tendency to decrease. For example, VOC changed from 0.96 V (PBDTTPD-V0) to 0.91 V (PBDTTPD-V0.05) and then 0.92 V (PBDTTPD-V0.10), although it almost stayed the same in the case of PBDTTPD-V0.025. JSC slightly increased from 11.29 mA cm−2 (PBDTTPD-V0) to 11.92 mA cm−2 (PBDTTPD-V0.025), but then sharply dropped to 9.07 (PBDTTPD-V0.05) and 9.32 mA cm−2 (PBDTTPD-V0.10). Meanwhile, the FF value gradually decreased from 64.2% (PBDTTPD-V0) to 53.6% (PBDTTPD-V0.25) and 57.6% (PBDTTPD-V0.05), then to 46.8% (PBDTTPD-V0.10). Due to these parameter changes, the device efficiency decreased from 6.93% (PBDTTPD-V0) to 6.06% (PBDTTPD-V0.025), then 4.72% (PBDTTPD-V0.05) to 4.00% (PBDTTPD-V0.10). Although PBDTTPD-V0.0125 contains less vinyl content than PBDTTPD-V0.025, the former device exhibited inferior performance compared with the latter one. Therefore, the device based on PBDTTPD-V0.025 exhibited the best performance among the devices fabricated with crosslinkable polymers with a PCE of 6.06%. It is worth pointing out that the active layers of these devices were crosslinked because they were all subjected to thermal annealing at 150 °C for 30 min before the deposition of the top electrode. To the best of our knowledge, this PCE value (6.06%) is one of the best efficiencies reported for PSC devices with crosslinked active layers, although it is much smaller than the present record for single junction devices based on non-crosslinkable materials (>10%).

In order to further understand the device behaviour, external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectroscopy was performed on the optimized cells. As shown in Fig. 3b, all of the devices exhibited a photo-response within the similar wavelength region from 350 to 700 nm. Among them, the device based on PBDTTPD-V0.025 displayed the largest EQE value in the whole spectral range, which coincided with the largest JSC value in the J–V measurements. Furthermore, the hole mobility measured via a space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S15,†Table 2) gradually decreased from 6.44 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the PBDTTPD-V0/PC71BM active layer to 6.10 × 10−4, 3.64 × 10−4, 1.88 × 10−4 and 2.21 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the layers based on PBDTTPD-V0.0125, PBDTTPD-V0.025, PBDTTPD-V0.05, and PBDTTPD-V0.10, respectively. Disfavorable charge transportation after the integration of vinyl units into the polymer is one of the important reasons for the devices showing an inferior performance to the device based on the non-crosslinkable polymer, PBDTTPD-V0.
Device thermal stability
The toleration of thermal stress is an important assessment for long-term device stability. In this work, we have only focused on the device based on crosslinked PBDTTPD-V0.025 because: (1) it showed the best performance among the devices fabricated with crosslinkable polymers, and (2) the vinyl content of 2.5% has been demonstrated to be enough for the formation of an effective crosslinking structure. Meanwhile, the device based on non-crosslinkable PBDTTPD-V0 was used as a reference.
As shown in Fig. 4, upon thermal treatment at 150 °C, the device based on PBDTTPD-V0.025 initially increased its PCE to 1.15 fold after 30 min, mainly due to the enhancement in JSC. Since no clear differences were observed in the film morphology during this initial thermal treatment, we deduce that the performance improvement may originate from a change in the interfacial contact between the device layers. However, when the thermal treatment time was further prolonged, the PCE of the device decreased. After a time period of 40 h, the remaining PCE was about 91%, indicating that this device possesses a very good thermal stability. In contrast, the PBDTTPD-V0 device exhibited a sharp drop in its PCE under the same thermal treatment. Only 63% of the original PCE was retained after a time period of 40 h in this case. This result clearly demonstrated that crosslinking in the active layer undoubtedly enhanced the device thermal stability.
 Fig. 4  Thermal stability of the PSC devices based on PBDTTPD-V0 and PBDTTPD-V0.025 upon thermal annealing at 150 °C. The standard error bars are calculated based on 6 devices. 
In order to understand what happens to the active layer morphology during thermal treatment, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed. As shown in Fig. 5, both of the blended films based on PBDTTPD-V0 and PBDTTPD-V0.025 spin-coatings presented a morphology with a smooth surface and a well-organized interpenetrating network. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values were estimated to be 2.95 and 1.71 nm, respectively. After thermal treatment for 16 h, aggregation of PC71BM was clearly observed in the PBDTTPD-V0 blended film. Meanwhile, this film also became rougher with the RMS value changing to 5.75 nm. In comparison, the PBDTTPD-V0.025/PC71BM blended film remained smooth with only a small change in the RMS value (1.71 → 1.78 nm). Moreover, no large aggregated objects were observed in this blended film. These observations indicate that the crosslinking in the blended film may effectively lock the morphology and retard the diffusion of PC71BM, and thus avoid phase evolution into the macroscale. Eventually, devices with the crosslinked active layers could maintain a high PCE during thermal treatment over a long time period.

Conclusions
High efficiency and a long enough lifetime are two critical prerequisites for any solar cell technology to realize its practical application. In this work, we presented an example of a donor–acceptor polymer (PBDTTPD-V0.025) bearing the right amount of crosslinkable units in its side chains to afford polymer solar cells with both a high power conversion efficiency and long-term stability. The novel polymer was designed based on a known high performance D–A polymer, PBDTTPD, and the synthesis achieved by integrating a specific amount of terminal vinyl units into a small part of its side chains. It was found that the vinyl content in the polymer has great impact on the crosslinking effectiveness and device performance. A higher content of vinyl units is favorable for achieving effective crosslinking, but it greatly deteriorates the device efficiency. Our search for a trade-off finally found that the vinyl content of 2.5% in PBDTTPD-V0.025 was sufficient for crosslinking while also retaining high photovoltaic performance. The solar cell based on this polymer exhibited a PCE of 6.06%, the highest reported value for a PSC fabricated with a crosslinkable polymer. Furthermore, the device also displayed good thermal stability, as evidence by it maintaining a high 91% of its initial efficiency upon thermal treatment at 150 °C for 40 h. With these results, it has been demonstrated that the combination of a crosslinkable moieties and currently known high performance polymers would be a good approach for the exploration of new photovoltaic materials with both high efficiency and long-term stability.
