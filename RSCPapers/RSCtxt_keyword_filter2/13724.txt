    , Accepted 22nd August 2019First published on 2nd September 2019AbstractConjugated block copolymers containing donor (D) and acceptor (A) blocks have high potential for single component polymer solar cells (SC-PSCs), but still exhibit the complexity of polymer synthesis and low device efficiency. In this research, we successfully synthesized a new fully conjugated D–A block copolymer (CDABP) by performing the entire reaction in one-pot from start to completion. This polymerization method has the advantage of saving synthesis time and cost. The photoluminescence (PL) of the CDABP film was completely quenched due to photoinduced inter/intramolecular charge transfer. A single component polymer solar cell (SC-PSC) with a CDABP film annealed at 180 °C showed the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.28%, a high short circuit current of 10.77 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 62.86%, which is much higher than that (2.62%) of the device with the as-cast film. This performance can be attributed to its fine internal/surface morphology and high crystallinity of the CDABP film. In addition, transient absorption experiments on the CDABP films showed that charge carrier generation is faster and the lifetime of the generated charge carriers is longer in the annealed film than in the as-cast film. Our research explicitly provides a new structural design and simple synthesis strategy for D–A conjugate block copolymers for high-efficiency SC-PSCs.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have evolved through many improvements in recent years, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been reported to be 15% for a single photovoltaic (PV) cell and 18% for a tandem PV cell.1,2 This performance has improved sufficiently such that it is becoming comparable to that of silicon solar cells.3–9 Bulk heterojunction (BHJ)-type PSCs are typically prepared by mixing a donor polymer and a small molecular acceptor or a polymer acceptor.
In particular, all-PSCs show better film-forming properties and mechanical endurance, which make them suitable for use in future flexible devices.10–16 However, the polymer/polymer blend films used as the active layer may alter the properties of the blend film depending on the miscibility of the two polymers. Thus, major disadvantages such as immiscibility of the donor and acceptor polymers, difficulty in controlling individual crystallinity, nonuniform internal biphasic composition of the blend films, and large-scale phase separation negatively affect the PCE of PSC devices. In all-PSCs, solving the morphology stability problem of the active layer remains a challenging task because of demixing between the two polymers due to the reduced entropy contribution to the Gibbs free energy when the donor and acceptor polymers are physically blended. To overcome these disadvantages, a few researchers have proposed dual functional materials for the single component active layer of BHJ PSCs.17–45 The simplest way to prepare dual functional materials exhibiting both donor and acceptor characteristics is to chemically bond the donor and acceptor materials, e.g., by combining low-molecular donors and acceptors,18–22 tethering small molecular acceptors to the side chain of the donor polymer as double-cable type polymers,23–33 and combining the donor blocks (DBs) and acceptor blocks (ABs) as block copolymers.34–45 Studies on the preparation of PSC active layers using conjugated block copolymers (CBPs) bearing DBs and ABs have mainly focused on the synthesis of suitable donor and acceptor oligomeric (or polymeric) blocks. Most of the previous studies have used CBPs containing polythiophene (PT) blocks as the donor units, owing to small polydispersity index (PDI) and one reactive end-group.36–43 However, it is difficult to tune the energy levels and absorption spectra of PT-based CBPs with 3-alkylthiophene DBs consisting of only donor repeating units.
In our previous work, new kinds of CBPs that do not contain PT have been designed and synthesized.44,45 Among them, a new CBP (P3) with 3.87% PCE in a single component (SC)-PSC was synthesized by Stille polymerization using wide band gap DBs and narrow band gap ABs.45 In this case, we synthesized and purified the DB and AB monomers, respectively, and synthesized the final CBP by the condensation method.
The reported PCE of SC-PSCs prepared using CBPs is gradually increasing, but they still suffer from the complexity of the synthesis of various CBPs. We summarized the device efficiencies of SC-PSCs using CBPs without PT blocks, which have been published recently, as shown in Table S1 and Fig. S1.†
On the other hand, to improve the performance of SC-PSCs with CBPs containing DBs and ABs, many conditions should be met. The following characteristics must be considered in terms of materials design and synthesis. First, the DBs or ABs in the CBP must be self-organized with the same adjacent moiety. Thereby the individual crystallization between the DBs or the ABs occurs well. Second, when the DB (or AB) forms a face-on orientation by crystallization, the DB (or AB) located beside it should also have a face-on orientation that can facilitate the transport of exciton diffusion and dissociated charge carriers.
Traditionally, addition polymerization in one-pot has been the most used in the synthesis of commercial block copolymers to obtain favorable physical and mechanical properties.46 However, no examples of condensation polymerization for PT-free CBPs that can be used for SC-PSCs by the above method have been published to date. CBPs can be synthesized by adding monomers capable of forming a DB in the same reactor after synthesizing AB, and thus it can have a clear advantage compared to the conventional methods.
In this study, we performed “one-pot polymerization”, which is entirely distinct from the CBP synthesis method described in a previous study,45 and used this method to synthesize a new highly crystalline fully conjugated D–A block copolymer (CDABP). The CDABP contains a wide-band gap benzodithiophene–bithiophene carboxylate block (PBDT2T) and a narrow-band gap NDISe-based block (PNDISe). The maximum PCE of the CDABP-based SC-PSC device after thermal annealing at 180 °C was 5.28%. Annealed CDABP films showed that the copolymer chains were arranged in a face-on manner with crystallization of two blocks and had fine segregated domains on the film surface. In particular, the exciton and charge carrier dynamics in the CDABP films were studied by transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. The results showed that charge carrier formation is faster and that the lifetime of charge carriers is longer in the annealed film than in the as-cast film, which are beneficial for increasing the short circuit current and the resultant PCEs. From these unquestionable results, “one-pot polymerization” can be proposed as a promising synthesis method for fully conjugated D–A block copolymers applicable to high-efficiency SC-PSCs.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of the CDABP
In this study, the complexity of the synthesis method of condensing the DB monomer with the AB monomer was resolved by applying the easier polymerization method for D–A CBP synthesis. The expected general structure of the CDABP is shown in Fig. 1. We propose a method to synthesize the final CDABP by first synthesizing an AB (PNDISe) using M1 and M2, and then adding M3 and M4 to the PNDISe reaction solution to form a DB (PBDT2T). The detailed one-pot polymerization method is depicted in Fig. S2.† To determine the precise molecular weight of the AB, we investigated the relationship between the polymerization time of M1 and M2 and the molecular weight of the PNDISe block (Fig. 1b). Through the above information, we were able to select the molecular weight of the acceptor block we wanted. After determining the appropriate molecular weight of PNDISe obtained by reaction for 25 min, the crude CDABP was precipitated in methanol and the solid precipitates were purified via Soxhlet extraction.

The relatively low molecular weight polymers and residual catalysts were eliminated during this process. The Mn value of the intermediate PNDISe block and final CDABP was measured to be 12.6 and 30.4 kg mol−1, with PDIs of 2.01 and 3.09, respectively (Fig. 1b). From these results, it can be conjectured that the final product contains diblock and triblock copolymers, which are difficult to analyze quantitatively (Fig. S2†).
Each polymer shows good solubility at room temperature in common chlorinated solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene. In order to compare various properties of the CDABP with those of a physical blend of DBs and ABs, we also prepared PBDT2T and PNDISe although the number average molecular weights (Mns) of two polymers were not consistent with those of the DA and AB in the CDABP (Scheme S1†). To confirm the structural characteristics of the CDABP and to verify the molar ratio of the BDT2T and NDISe units in the block copolymer, 1H NMR and elemental analysis (EA) were performed. As shown in Fig. S4 and S5,† the presence of both PBDT2T and PNDISe blocks in the CDABP was confirmed by integrating the peaks for the BDT2T repeating unit (7.66, 7.43, 7.32, and 6.95 ppm for the aromatic peaks and 4.20–4.15, 2.94–2.88, and 1.78–1.71 ppm for the aliphatic peaks) and the NDISe repeating unit (9.00, 8.74, and 7.65 ppm for the aromatic peaks; 4.20–4.15 and 2.02 ppm for the aliphatic peaks).
The molar ratio of the repeating units of BDT2T and NDISe was determined by using elemental sulfur in the CDABP obtained from elemental analysis because the sulfur element only exists in the PBDT2T block as shown in Fig. 1a. The molar and weight ratios of the BDT2T and NDISe repeating units were determined to be 1:1 due to similar molecular weight of the repeating units in BDT2T and NDISe (Fig. S6†). Although a tiny amount of individual low-MW DBs or ABs may remain, the major polymer product was confirmed to be a copolymer composed of DBs and ABs.
UV-vis absorption, steady-state PL, and time-resolved PL properties of the CDABP
UV-vis absorption spectra of the newly synthesized CDABP, PBDT2T, and PNDISe were measured in toluene solutions and thin films (Fig. 2a and d). In Table 1, their spectral characteristics are all listed. The absorption spectrum of the CDABP in a very low concentration (∼10−5 M) solution is shown to include the characteristic absorption features of both PBDT2T and PNDISe moieties. The PL spectra of PBDT2T, PNDISe, and CDABP in toluene and films are shown in Fig. 2b and e. The PL experiments were conducted in toluene solution to eliminate the solvatochromic effect. As shown in Fig. 2b, PBDT2T solution in toluene exhibits a fluorescence peak at 625 nm but no fluorescence is observed for PNDISe in solution. For the CDABP in a very diluted solution, it exhibits an emission peak at 620 nm. To investigate the possible molecular charge transfer (CT) phenomenon in the CDABP more precisely, TRPL measurements were carried out with PBDT2T and CDABP in toluene. To avoid any intermolecular CT characteristics as much as possible, a significantly low concentration (∼10−5 M) of the CDABP in toluene was used for the PL experiments.

Fig. 2c displays TRPL signals measured with PBDT2T and CDABP in toluene. TRPL signals are fitted using a tri-exponential function, and the fitting results are summarized in Table S3.†
Our TRPL experimental results indicate that the average PL lifetime is shorter for the CDABP (τavg = 1.0 ns = 1/(k1 + kCT)) than for PBDT2T (τavg = 1.3 ns = 1/k1) by 300 ps. By using a kinetic model including intramolecular CT (kCT) from DBs to ABs, the intramolecular CT rate constant from DBs to ABs in the local binding region in the copolymer structure in toluene can be readily determined to be kCT = 1/τCT = 1/(4.3 ns), which is almost the same as the result reported previously (Fig. S7†).45 In contrast, the TRPL signal in the CDABP film decays much faster than that in the PBDT2T film as shown in Fig. 2f. In this case, the intermolecular CT between DBs and ABs in the CDABP film strongly contributes to the fluorescence quenching. The corresponding features are also well reflected in the steady-state PL spectra in Fig. 2b and e. The fluorescence quenching of the CDABP is more significant in the film than in the toluene solution. In short, the fluorescence quenching of the CDABP solution is caused by the intramolecular CT. However, CDABP polymer chains are densely packed in the film state so that DBs and ABs are very close, and thus, intermolecular CT is predominantly efficient in the film.
Electrochemical properties of the CDABP
The electrochemical properties of PBDT2T, PNDISe, and CDABP were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in film as shown in Fig. S8† and the corresponding data are tabulated in Table 1. The oxidation potentials of PBDT2T and CDABP were observed to be +0.9 and +1.02 V, respectively, and PNDISe and CDABP showed reduction potentials of −0.49 and −0.48 V, respectively. The optical band gap energies of PBDT2T and PNDISe were determined by using the cut-off edges of absorption in the film state to be 2.00 and 1.72 eV, respectively. In the case of the CDABP, both the oxidation and reduction potentials can be measured electrochemically due to the existing PBDT2T and PNDISe blocks. The corresponding highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were determined to be −5.33/−3.33 eV, −5.66/−3.94 eV, and −5.45/−3.95 eV for PBDT2T, PNDISe, and CDABP, respectively.
Performance of SC-PSCs fabricated with the CDABP
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of the CDABP synthesized via one-pot polymerization, inverted-type SC-PSCs were fabricated with the configuration ITO/ZnO (30 nm)/CDABP (70 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm), as shown in Fig. 3a. In this study, we fabricated the devices with the as-cast and annealed films using CDABP active layers without any solvent additives. Various annealing temperatures were adopted to investigate the effect of annealing on the PSC performance. The as-cast active layer was prepared via spin coating from a chlorobenzene solution. The detailed performance data for the open circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), PCE, series resistance (Rs), and shunt resistance (Rsh) values of the SC-PSCs are summarized in Tables 2 and S4.†

(c) PCE distribution of the optimized SC-PSC devices (e.g., active layer annealed at 180 °C for 10 min). (d) External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of SC-PSCs. 

Fig. 3b displays the current density–voltage (J–V) curve for the active layer at different annealing temperatures. The three devices with a SC active layer exhibit drastically different performances: the as-cast CDABP film exhibited a PCEmax of 2.62% with a Jsc of 8.15 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.78 V, and an FF of 40.98%. In the case of the device with a film annealed at 120 °C, the Jsc and FF were slightly improved. Eventually, when the active layer was annealed at 180 °C for 10 min, the Jsc increased to 10.77 mA cm−2 and the FF reached 62.86%, resulting in 5.28% PCE. The trend of the increasing FF value of the SC-PSC with the annealing temperature of the film can be well explained by the change of series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) of the device (Table 2, Fig. S9 and Table S4†). The SC-PSC with the annealed film clearly shows a decreasing tendency for Rs and an increasing tendency for Rsh as the annealing temperature increases. Particularly, the FF is influenced strongly by both Rs (8.57 Ω cm2) and Rsh, (1060 Ω cm2) and a larger value of the FF results in better performance of the PSC. The FF of the device with the as-cast film and annealed film was 40.98% and 62.86%, respectively. The enhancement in Jsc for the annealed CDABP-based SC-PSC device was confirmed with EQE measurements (Fig. 3d). The SC-PSC device with the CDABP film annealed at 180 °C showed a relatively higher EQE in the 400 to 700 nm wavelength range compared to the as-cast film-based PSC device, indicating enhanced light harvesting after annealing at 180 °C, supporting a relatively high Jsc and PCE. This might be attributed to the intriguing crystallization behavior of DBs and ABs in the annealed CDABP film, which will be discussed in greater detail through GIWAXD analysis.

Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GIWAXD) analysis of the CDABP film
We investigated the reason for the high efficiency of the SC-PSC device after thermal annealing of the CDABP film using the GIWAXD technique. To study the polymer chain orientation and change in crystallinity of the CDABP film states, GIWAXD measurements were taken on both the as-cast film and the thermally annealed film. The 2D GIWAXD patterns and 1D profiles of the as-cast polymer films of the CDABP are shown in Fig. 4. The as-cast CDABP film exhibited a high-intensity (010) diffraction peak (e.g. qz = 1.66 Å−1, d(010) = 3.78 Å) in the qz direction (i.e. out-of-plane profile), and the crystallized polymer chains had a face-on orientation as shown in Fig. 4a.

Out-of-plane and in-plane diffraction profiles: the (a) as-cast film, (b) film annealed at 120 °C, and (c) film annealed at 180 °C. Annealing time = 10 min. (d) Schematic representation of the crystalline DBs and ABs in the as-cast and annealed films of the CDABP. A more uniform crystalline–crystalline phase of DBs and ABs can be formed with a minor co-crystalline phase between DBs and ABs. 
The highest intensity (010) diffraction peak is likely assigned to the π–π stacking distance of PBDT2T, where the (010) peak of PNDISe (e.g. qz = 1.55 Å−1, d(010) = 4.05 Å) was hidden in the left slope of the peak as shown in Fig. S10 and Table S5.†
After thermal annealing at 180 °C for 10 min, the (100) and (200) diffraction peaks are significantly enhanced in the qz direction, and the (010) peak in the qxy direction showed incremental increases in intensity with a narrower full width at half maximum (FWHM). This indicates that the polymer chains exhibit face-on dominant bimodal packing behavior. The face-on orientation of the polymer chains is more favorable for efficient charge carrier transport in the SC-PSCs. Similarly, the (300) peak in the qxy direction (qxy = 0.84 Å−1) is also clearly visible, indicating that more crystallized morphologies can be expected in the annealed CDABP film as schematically depicted in Fig. 4d. On the other hand, the crystal coherence length (CCL) of the (100) and (010) diffraction peaks increased due to the decrease in the FWHM after annealing (Table S6†). This indicated that the crystallinity enhanced, and hence, the density of the crystalline domains was increased. Therefore, a more uniform crystalline–crystalline phase of DBs and ABs in the CDABP can be promoted by thermal annealing, which is believed to form effective percolation channels for exciton diffusion and charge carrier transport (Fig. 4d).
Effect of thermal annealing on the charge transport properties of CDABP films
In order to clarify the effect of charge carrier transport ability and hole and electron mobility balance for SC-PSC performance improvement, hole-only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layers/Au (70 nm)) and electron-only (ITO/ZnO (30 nm)/active layers/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm)) devices were constructed according to the corresponding SC-PSCs. To attain more helpful information on the difference of the charge transport ability of the active layers made with the as-cast and annealed CDABP films, the J–V characteristics of the hole-only and electron-only devices were obtained under dark conditions (Fig. S11†).
Apparently, the hole mobility (μh = 4.50 × 10−4 to 5.08 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is larger than the electron mobility (μe = 2.18 × 10−5 to 5.42 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) for both active layers (i.e., the as-cast film and film annealed at 180 °C), which are obtained by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. This indicated that the performance of the SC-PSCs could be restricted by the relatively weaker electron transport ability. Compared with the as-cast CDABP active layer, the electron mobility in the annealed CDABP active layer increased as shown in Table S7.† The crystallinity of PNDISe as the AB in CDABP is highly improved through thermal annealing as shown in Fig. 4. Therefore, the hole and electron transport balance in the annealed active layer is significantly improved compared with the corresponding devices made of the as-cast film-based active layers. The improved charge carrier transport ability and its balance helped to yield the highest PCE of 5.28% in the PSCs fabricated with the annealed CDABP film.
Morphology studies of the active layer in the SC-PSCs
In order to explore the relationship of the film morphology of the CDABP and photovoltaic performance, AFM, KPFM, and TEM experiments were conducted. The AFM topography images of the active layers of the as-cast and annealed CDABP films helped us observe their surface morphologies, which could indirectly be helpful information for predicting the internal morphology (Fig. 5a and b).
 Fig. 5  AFM topographic images (a and b), KPFM potential images (c and d) recorded in the dark, and TEM images (e and f). The as-cast CDABP film (a, c, and e); annealed CDABP film (b, d, and f). Annealing temperature = 180 °C for 10 min. 
On the surface of the as-cast CDABP film, there are rugged patterns with significant differences in height. As a result, the surface roughness was measured to be 5.12 nm for the as-cast film, which showed a very coarse surface morphology. However, after annealing at 180 °C for 10 min, the bulged patterns with large 3D wrinkles were disunited into very small domains, resulting in a very smooth surface morphology (Rq = 1.58 nm). Although the analysis of the topography images was insightful for supporting this argument, more direct evidence can be obtained from visualization of the electrostatic distribution at the D–A interface using KPFM. Recent studies have shown that pure donors and acceptors can often coexist as an intermixture at a molecular level or as crystalline phases in which the small donors or acceptor domains are closely mixed in a nano-/microscopic level.47 Therefore, there is a desperate need for an experimental technique capable of simultaneously studying nanometer-scale morphologies and electronic properties in the same area.
For the KPFM analysis in a dark state, contact potential difference (CPD) images are obtained to reveal permanent and static dipoles present on the surface. As shown in Fig. 5c and d, annealing led to highly continuous CPD bright/dark images with high contrast. This observation implies that more dispersive donor- and acceptor-rich domains were induced by the crystallization of the DB and AB after annealing. As shown in Fig. S12,† the annealed films had localized domains with significant differences in the CPD on the surface. Such a contrast in the KPFM image was not observed in the corresponding AFM topographic image. This implies that the contrast in the KPFM image is likely dominated by the electronic structural difference on the surface, rather than the difference in the domain height. In our KPFM images, bright and dark parts were defined as the acceptor-rich and donor-rich regions, respectively. Indeed, the image mean (μCPD) and standard deviation (σCPD) values corresponding to the CPD image of the as-cast film were +0.329 V and +0.00256 V, respectively, whereas those of the annealed film were −0.341 V and +0.00180 V. The inversion of the sign of the μCPD value upon annealing suggests that the surface potential was dramatically changed, and this supports our conclusion. Finally, the CPD mapping indicates that the DBs and ABs, which were highly dispersed in the as-cast film, underwent crystallization under thermal annealing. As a result, the DBs and ABs aggregated amongst themselves, such that their individual localized rich domains formed effective charge carrier transport channels.
Furthermore, TEM measurements were employed to investigate the internal morphologies of the active layer films in the SC-PSC as shown in Fig. 5e and f. Remarkably, the TEM images match the AFM images and show a similar trend. After annealing at 180 °C for 10 min, the active layer in the device has a uniform and homogeneous internal morphology, which is definitely positive for exciton diffusion and charge transport owing to the formation of extended charge migration channels, proper phase separation, and domain size to improve the PCE of the device.
Transient absorption (TA) study with the as-cast and annealed CDABP films
To examine the exciton and charge carrier dynamics in the active layer, we carried out transient absorption (TA) experiments with PBDT2T, PNDISe, and CDABP films.48 All films were excited with a pump pulse at λpu = 540 nm and subsequently probed by a white light continuum (λpr) as a function of delayed time (t). TA signals, STA(t,λpr), measured with PBDT2T, PNDISe, and CDABP films are shown in Fig. 6 and S14.† The negative signal is the ground-state bleach (GSB) and stimulated emission (SE) while the positive signal is the excited-state absorption (ESA). The exciton dynamics in PBDT2T and PNDISe films were analyzed by a tri-exponential fitting to the TA signals measured at λpr = 590 and 640 nm, respectively, and the fitting results are summarized in Table S8.†49
The exciton relaxation time constants (the longest time component in Table S8†) are found to be 9.7 ns for PBDT2T and 26 ns for PNDISe, respectively. In CDABP films, the excitons generated in PBDT2T domains migrate to the interfaces between PBDT2T and PNDISe domains forming CT states, and then the CT states will be dissociated to yield charge carriers (e.g., holes and electrons) at the interfaces with holes remaining in the PBDT2T domains and electrons in PNDISe domains. The TA spectra, STA(t = 1.0 ns,λpr), of PBDT2T and the as-cast CDABP films measured at t = 1.0 ns are shown in Fig. 6c. At t = 1.0 ns, the TA spectrum of PBDT2T film results purely from the generated excitons while the TA spectrum of the as-cast CDABP film results from both the charge carriers generated by exciton dissociation and the undissociated excitons. By comparing the two TA spectra in Fig. 5c, it can be readily concluded that the peak at ∼710 nm in the TA spectrum of the as-cast CDABP film results from the charge carriers generated by exciton dissociation in the as-cast CDABP film. Therefore, we further analyzed the TA signals at ∼710 nm to investigate the charge carrier dynamics in the CDABP films. The TA signals, STA(t,λpr = 710 nm), measured at 710 nm with the as-cast and annealed CDABP films are shown in Fig. 6d and analyzed using a multi-exponential function, and the fitting results are summarized in Table S9.†
 Fig. 6  TA spectra, STA(t,λpr) = ΔA/A, measured with (a) the as-cast CDABP and (b) thermally annealed CDABP films as a function of time following excitation at λpu = 540 nm. TA spectra, STA(t = 1.0 ns,λpr), measured with (c) PBDT2T and the as-cast CDABP film at t = 1.0 ns. The peak at 710 nm results from the charge carriers. (d) TA signals of the as-cast CDABP and annealed CDABP films at 710 nm are fitted using a multi-exponential function, . The rising temporal component with a negative amplitude corresponds to the generation of charge carriers. Annealing temperature = 180 °C and annealing time = 10 min. 
A couple of interesting features were observed in our TA experiments. First, the charge carrier generation in the CDABP films occurs on tens of picosecond timescales and is faster by a factor of two in the annealed film (τ1 = 6.5 ps) than the as-cast film (τ1 = 13 ps). Second, the lifetime of the generated charge carriers is on the order of tens of nanoseconds and is much longer in the annealed CDABP film (τ4 = 53 ns) than in the as-cast film (τ4 = 39 ns). The experimental results from the TA measurements indicated that the charge carriers are generated more efficiently, and the generated charge carriers recombine more slowly in the annealed film than in the as-cast film. It can support the fact that the SC-PSC device using the annealed CDABP film exhibits a higher EQE value than that using the as-cast film.
Conclusions
We demonstrated the preparation of a novel fully conjugated D–A block copolymer (CDABP) via one-pot polymerization for application to an SC-PSC device. The donor (BDT2T) and acceptor (NDISe) blocks present in the CDABP were highly crystallized, and the face-on orientation of DBs and ABs was promoted by thermal annealing. KPFM measurement revealed that upon annealing, dense nanoscale structures of donor- and acceptor-rich domains are formed in the film and that the surface electronic structure is largely changed. TA spectroscopy reveals that charge carrier generation by exciton dissociation at the interfaces was faster and the lifetime of the generated charge carriers was longer in the annealed CDABP film than in the as-cast film. The optimized SC-PSC exhibited a high PCE of 5.28%. Ultimately, the one-pot polymerization method introduced in this study provides an advantageous strategy for preparing D–A CBPs for achieving high-efficiency SC-PSCs.
Experimental
One-pot polymerization of the fully conjugated D–A block copolymer
To prepare the PNDISe monomers, M1 (1 equiv.) and M2 (1 equiv.), Pd2(dba)3, and P(o-tolyl)3 were dissolved in toluene (9 mL) and anhydrous DMF (1 mL) and the reaction mixture was degassed. The temperature was gradually increased to 110 °C while stirring the reaction mixture. After 25 min, the mixed toluene solution (3 mL) of M3 (1 equiv.) and M4 (1 equiv.) was added to the reactor in which PNDISe was prepared. Then, the reaction mixture was stirred at 110 °C for 48 h. After cooling the mixture to RT, the resulting solution was precipitated with methanol (300 mL). The byproducts and the residual PNDISe and PBDT2T oligomers were removed via Soxhlet extraction with acetone, hexane, methyl chloride, and chloroform. The chloroform fraction was then poured into methanol (300 mL) and the precipitates were dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h (CDABP: Mn = 30.4 kDa, PDI = 3.09). Elemental analysis calculated for (C50H70N2O4Se)m–(C51H60O2S6)n determined the following: C, 69.16; H, 7.61; N, 1.30; S, 10.50.
Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy
Time-resolved PL signals, S(t), of the samples were collected by using a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique.50,51 The solution and film samples were excited with a 520 nm pulse (LDH-P-C-520, PicoQuant). The fluorescence emission of the solution and film samples was measured at 625 nm and 650 nm, respectively, by using a photomultiplier tube (PMA 182, PicoQuant). The TRPL signal was fitted using a tri-exponential function, . The average fluorescence lifetime (τavg) was determined by using the following equation: .
Transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy
A femtosecond titanium sapphire oscillator and amplifier system from Spectra-Physics (Mai Tai SP and Spitfire Ace) was used for TA experiments.52 The TA signals were measured using a commercially available TA experimental system (Ultrafast Systems, Helios). An optical parametric amplifier (OPA, Spectra-Physics, TOPAS prime) was used to generate the pump pulse at 540 nm. A white light continuum, which was achieved by focusing a small fraction of 800 nm pulses onto a 2 mm thick sapphire disk, was used as a probe beam. The transmission of the probe following the excitation of the samples was measured with a CCD camera. The pump pulse was chopped at 500 Hz by using a mechanical chopper. The TA signal was obtained by measuring the difference between the transmitted probe beams with and without the pump pulse and dividing the difference by the probe beam. Thus, a fractional change in the absorbance of the probe beam was measured as the TA signal, (i.e., STA(t,λpr) = ΔA/A, where A is the absorbance).53
