    , Accepted 3rd June 2019First published on 4th June 2019AbstractRecently organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices comprising the small-molecule liquid-crystalline donor, benzodithiophene-quaterthiophene-rhodanine (BQR), and fullerene acceptor, [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), were demonstrated to achieve high performance when thermally processed, avoiding the need for slow-drying solvent additives or complex solvent-vapor annealing post-processing. In this investigation we explore the impact of thermal processing on thin film blends of BQR and PC71BM using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), in situ grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GISAXS, GIWAXS), and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) to correlate thermal behavior with morphological changes and photoactivity. We develop a phase diagram of the crystalline and liquid crystalline transitions in BQR and the related high performing electron donor material, benzodithiophene-terthiophene-rhodanine (BTR), and are able to predict phase transitions using Flory-Huggins theory, including suppression of liquid crystalline phase formation in the presence of PC71BM. Further DSC measurements demonstrate the superior thermal stability of PC71BM blends with BQR over blends with BTR. OPV devices with the BQR:PC71BM active layer were prepared using the blade-coating deposition technique and exhibit optimal device performance when annealed at 120 °C for 5 min. The characteristic acceptor/donor domain size in an as-cast BQR:PC71BM film, estimated from GISAXS, was about 60 nm which is sufficient for exciton separation. Domain purity was enhanced by annealing at temperatures above ≈80 °C. Annealing at temperatures above ≈120 °C resulted in over-coarsening of the acceptor/donor-rich phases to domain sizes beyond 80 nm and reduced performance.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) remain an attractive option for harvesting solar power to generate electricity. Compared to conventional solid-state photovoltaics, organic solar cells promise low-cost, scalable production with earth abundant, nontoxic starting materials. The most likely route towards commercial viability is through solution processing of OPV devices via roll-to-roll printing.1–3 One of the primary challenges in printing OPVs is the need for thick (>200 nm) active layer films to be produced free of pinhole defects with good reproducibility at high printing speeds. Unfortunately, the majority of successful OPV blends optimize at thicknesses of roughly 100 nm; few have achieved high photovoltaic performance with active layers over 200 nm.4–8 Another general challenge for OPVs is batch-to-batch variability exhibited by functional materials of the device. Traditionally, polymers have been used as the electron donor material in OPVs; however, polymer production at scale often lacks the necessary control over purity and dispersity of molar masses to reliably reproduce performance. Small molecule donors, which historically have been outperformed by polymer donors, do not suffer the same reproducibility issues as they can be produced with high purity and discrete control over the molecular architecture. Recent advances in molecular engineering have pushed small-molecule based OPVs towards competitive performance with polymer based devices.9 The BXR series, shown in Fig. 1, is a particularly promising series of small molecule donors for OPV devices exhibiting high performance in thick active layers. Spun-cast blends of BTR, BQR (benzodithiophene-quaterthiophene-rhodanine), or BPR (benzodithiophene-quinquethiophene-rhodanine) with PC71BM can be post-processed via solvent vapor annealing (SVA) to achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCE) >8.5% with film thicknesses >200 nm.10

For successful high throughput production, photoactive thin films must withstand elevated temperatures that accompany the device manufacturing process, including rapid film drying at temperatures >80 °C and selective thermal annealing of the layers which make up the final OPV device. The typical active layer morphology, however, comprises a non-equilibrium mixture of materials forming a co-continuous percolating network. This bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphology maximizes interfacial area between donor- and acceptor-rich phases resulting in efficient charge generation. Elevated temperatures can drastically modify the metastable active layer morphology, either improving device performance or yielding catastrophic changes. Polymer:fullerene based bulk heterojunction blends are particularly susceptible to rapid coarsening of domains due to fullerene aggregation and subsequent crystal growth if annealed above the blend's glass transition temperature, Tg.11 By engineering materials with a higher Tg, one can prevent structural rearrangement at elevated temperatures as was shown with MDMO-PPV:PC61BM solar cells.12,13 Annealing at 110 °C resulted in rapid loss of performance for devices containing a low Tg MDMO-PPV polymer (Tg ≈ 50 °C), but strongly reduced rates of fullerene crystal formation and performance loss were obtained using a high Tg variant (Tg ≈ 138 °C) of the MDMO-PPV polymer. Blends containing a crystallizable donor polymer and a fullerene are more robust to thermal annealing due to the presence of immobile crystallites that inhibit fullerene mobility. Such is the case for P3HT:PC61BM blends which exhibit stable OPV performance when annealed for ≈10 min at 150 °C,14 well above the reported glass transition temperature for P3HT, Tg ≈ 12 °C.15 Annealing actually improves performance in the P3HT:PC61BM system due to beneficial ordering of the P3HT domains. The robustness to thermal processing is a consequence of polymer chain topology and molecular entanglements that limit the growth of polymer crystallites. Conversely, OPV devices with crystallizable small molecules are more sensitive to thermal processing because the molecules lack strong diffusion barriers. Thermal annealing can result in overgrowth of crystalline donor regions that degrades device performance. Donor materials among the BXR series exhibit significant variability in performance when thermally annealed. Only BQR:PC71BM devices achieve parity in performance (PCE > 8.5%) via thermal annealing (TA) compared to post-treatment with SVA.10 The thermal behavior within the BXR series was explored using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and UV-Vis spectroscopy by Geraghty et al.10 It was found that, like BTR,4 BQR exhibited multiple liquid crystalline transitions upon cooling. However, device annealing temperatures did not reach above the melting temperature for the reported liquid crystalline transitions in either blend so the unique thermal stability of BQR was not fully understood.
Here we report in situ characterization of the BQR:PC71BM system to investigate its unique thermal stability. Using DSC, we examine the thermal behavior of BQR and BTR in the presence of increasing amounts of PC71BM. We find that the robustness of BQR devices to thermal annealing compared to BTR devices is governed by differences in PC71BM mobility in the blended systems. In situ grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements of the BQR:PC71BM system subjected to the same thermal processing scheme from DSC were taken to correlate morphological changes with their signatures from calorimetry. Similarly, in situ grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) was used to track nanometer scale morphological changes during thermal annealing. In situ photo-luminescence spectroscopy of the device relevant BQR:PC71BM films corroborates nanoscale segregation of donor- and acceptor-rich domains at elevated temperatures. Finally, we report the performance of blade-coated BQR:PC71BM devices as a function of thermal annealing, allowing identification of the optimal morphology.
Experimental section
The small molecule donors benzodithiophene-terthiophene-rhodanine (BTR) and benzodithiophene-quaterthiophene-rhodanine (BQR) were synthesized as reported in Geraghty et al.10 PC71BM was purchased from nano-C and used as received.‡
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
DSC was performed on a TA Instruments Q1000 heat flux DSC. Sample masses between 2 mg to 3 mg were prepared in ultra-light PerkinElmer HyperDSC aluminum pans by drop casting relevant solutions directly into the pan. Pristine BQR, BTR and PC71BM stock solutions, each with a concentration of 20 mg mL−1 in chloroform, were prepared for samples among the BQR:PC71BM loading series and BTR:PC71BM loading series. Solutions with the specified donor:acceptor ratio were prepared by blending appropriate volumes of stock solution. Samples were prepared under inert atmosphere atop a hot plate at 50 °C and left to dry for 1 h. Sample pans for the BQR and BTR thermal annealing series were prepared from a 40 mg mL−1 solution of 50:50 BQR:PC71BM in toluene and a 40 mg mL−1 solution of 50:50 BTR:PC71BM in chloroform, respectively. Measurements were performed under a dry nitrogen purge of 50 mL min−1. Samples among the loading series were heated at 10 °C min−1 to 215 °C and subsequently cooled to 0 °C at three different cooling rates (10 °C min−1, 5 °C min−1 and 1 °C min−1) with a 10 °C min−1 heating ramp back up to 215 °C following each ramp down. The end of each temperature ramp was followed by a 1 min isothermal hold before proceeding to the next ramp. A duplicate set of samples for the BQR:PC71BM and BTR:PC71BM loading series was prepared to measure PC71BM melting point depression. These samples were heated at 10 °C min−1 to 350 °C. Sample pans for the BQR and BTR annealing series were held at the specified annealing temperature on a hot plate under inert atmosphere for 5 min. DSC measurements were performed on the annealed samples using a 10 °C min−1 heat ramp up to 350 °C.

In situ X-ray scattering
Thin film samples for X-ray measurements were prepared on silicon substrates with a native oxide using a low-angle blade-coater.16 Solutions for blade-coating were prepared from pristine stock solutions of BQR and PC71BM containing 20 mg of solids per mL toluene. Solutions with the specified mass ratio of BQR and PC71BM were blended in appropriate volumetric amounts. Approximately 20 μL of solution was dispensed under the edge of a glass blade held 300 μm above the silicon substrate. The blade was immediately translated over the length of the substrate at a speed of 40 mm s−1 to generate a film with an approximate thickness of 100 nm. Film thickness was determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry.
X-ray scattering measurements were performed at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) on the D1 beamline with a beam energy of 10.7 keV and beam width of 300 μm. A 2D image detector (Pilatus 2K) was located at a distance of 173 mm from the sample center for GIWAXS measurements and 1850 mm from the sample center for GISAXS measurements. The measurements were performed in ambient air. A flight tube filled with helium gas was used for GISAXS measurements to minimize air scatter. The sample stage temperature was controlled to collect in situ thermal annealing measurements. The temperature program was specified to heat the stage, initially at 30 °C, to 215 °C, cool down to 50 °C, and finally re-heat to 215 °C using a heating/cooling rate of 10 °C min−1. The stage was cooled by ambient air thus the temperature on cooling deviated from the programmed 10 °C min−1 cooling rate over the course of the experiment. The stage temperature was recorded over the course of the experiment for direct analysis. X-ray scattering measurements were collected every 30 s with 3 s of beam exposure on the sample. The sample stage and thus the sample were translated by 0.05 mm normal to the beam path after each integration period to minimize potential beam damage to the film over the course of the measurement. Both GIWAXS and GISAXS data were reduced with the Nika software package.17
Solar cell devices
Patterned ITO (≈140 nm, 20 Ω sq−1) on glass substrates were purchased from Thin Film Devices. Substrates were scrubbed clean with laboratory detergent and DI water and subsequently sonicated in DI water, acetone and isopropanol, each for 15 minutes. Just before depositing the layers of the device, the substrates were UV-ozone treated for 10 min. A 30 nm thick layer of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios® P VP Al 4083) was spin-coated at 4000 × 2π/60 rad s−1 (4000 RPM) for 60 s and dried at 130 °C for 20 min in air. Devices were quickly moved from the hot plate to a nitrogen glove box where the active layer was blade-coated. The active layer solution (40 mg mL−1 solution of 50:50 BQR:PC71BM in toluene) was blade-coated as described for thin film X-ray samples. The stage temperature was held at 30 °C during film deposition. For thermally annealed devices, the substrate was placed on a hot plate at the specified annealing temperature for 5 min. The top electrode was thermally evaporated through a shadow mask over the active layer. 15 nm of Ca was deposited followed by 80 nm of Al. The pressure during the evaporation was below 1 × 10−4 Pa. The active area of the finished device, defined by the overlap of the prepatterned ITO and metal top electrode, was 0.04 cm2. Current density–voltage measurements were made under simulated AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination using a Keithley 2600 SMU under argon atmosphere without exposure to air. The OPV device performance was referenced to a KG5 filtered silicon photodiode calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy
Thin film samples for photoluminescence spectroscopy were prepared on glass microscope slides using the blade-coating technique. Films were prepared identically to the active layer in the solar cell devices as described above. The films were transferred from the nitrogen environment in which they were prepared to ambient air. In situ PL measurements were collected while thermal annealing the substrate. The stage temperature was ramped at 10 °C min−1 from 30 °C to 180 °C during the measurements. A detailed description of the PL setup and measurement methods are reported elsewhere.18 In brief, a 488 nm solid state diode laser (OBIS Coherent) set at 4 mW served as the excitation source. The PL intensity was measured using a long working distance microscope objective (Mitutoyo M Plan Apo 20X, NA = 0.42, W.D. = 20 mm), band pass filtered with a 500 nm cutoff and fiber coupling into a monochromator (Princeton Instruments Acton SP2150), CCD detector (Princeton Instruments PIXIS 256) unit. The integration time was fixed at 500 ms and spectra were collected continuously over the course of the temperature ramp.
Results
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)

Fig. 2 illustrates DSC traces for pristine BQR subject to successive cooling and heating cycles. The first heating trace is a signature of the as-cast morphology of BQR, which was drop-cast into the sample pan from chloroform at an elevated temperature (50 °C). The observable melting peak for the first heating trace is sharper and shifted to higher T than all subsequent melting peaks suggesting the solution-cast BQR has fewer, larger crystals than melt-crystallized BQR. In general, the thermal behavior matches previous DSC results for BQR, which showed three distinct transitions on cooling and a single melting peak.10 The exotherms initiating at 191 °C and 182 °C were previously established as liquid crystalline transitions using polarized optical microscopy (POM), respectively referred to as LC1 and LC2. The absence of cooling rate dependence for LC1 and LC2 (Fig. 2) corroborates the original assumption of liquid crystallinity; liquid crystal transitions are not kinetic and exhibit little to no superheating or supercooling.19,20 The last exotherm upon cooling shows a strong cooling rate dependence with an onset temperature of 171 °C, 172 °C, and 175 °C for the transition when cooled at 10 °C min−1, 5 °C min−1, and 1 °C min−1, respectively. This kinetic effect is a signature of crystallization, thus the third transition is to a three-dimensional ordered crystal referred to as C3D. In each subsequent heating scan the melting behavior appears unaffected by the cooling rate.
 Fig. 2  DSC traces of BQR melting and re-crystallization. The first heating scan is from the melting of the initial drop-cast BQR. After a 1 min isothermal hold at 215 °C, the BQR is cycled at progressively slower cooling rates (10 °C min−1, 5 °C min−1, 1 °C min−1). Each cooling scan is followed by a heating scan, cycling between 0 °C and 215 °C. All heating scans are performed at 10 °C min−1. Inset: heating scans in the region of melting. Cooling curves are displaced for clarity. Heat flow is normalized by sample mass m and cooling/heating rate β. Exotherm direction is down. 
PC71BM loading series

Fig. 3a illustrates the effect of PC71BM loading in BQR. In striking contrast to the neat material, the DSC cooling traces for BQR:PC71BM blends exhibit a single transition when PC71BM loading is greater than 10% by mass. The exotherm shifts to higher temperatures at progressively slower cooling rates (data not shown) implying the transition is kinetic and thus a transition to C3D. The fullerene does not, however, modify the extent of crystallization in the BQR fraction; the aggregate enthalpy change scales linearly with PC71BM loading through the entire range. The exothermic signature for LC2 is present only in the limit of low PC71BM loading. LC2 formation is gradually depressed with increasing PC71BM loading, appears as a high temperature shoulder of the crystallization transition for the 90:10 BQR:PC71BM DSC trace and is absent at all higher loadings. The signature for LC1 is undetected at all PC71BM loadings.
 Fig. 3  Typical DSC cooling traces for (a) BQR:PC71BM and (b) BTR:PC71BM blends. Heat flow is normalized by sample mass m and cooling rate β = 10 °C min−1. Exotherm direction is down. 
The onset crystallization temperature for C3D of BQR is shifted lower by up to 10 °C with increasing PC71BM loading. The effect is likely a consequence of freezing point depression for a miscible mixture of two components. Melting point depression has the same physical origin and can be observed for the BQR melting peak on both 1st and 2nd heat (Fig. 4). Note that there are two observable melting peaks in the 1st heat DSC scans for BQR:PC71BM blends. The high temperature peak is attributed to C3D melting. The low temperature peak, between 175 °C and 180 °C, is close to the onset temperature for LC2 on cooling (182 °C) suggesting the presence of LC2 in the drop-cast sample. An additional feature of the 1st heat DSC traces is an exothermic transition that immediately precedes the final BQR melting transition and grows more pronounced at higher PC71BM loadings. Scattering measurements (shown later) indicate the transition is a signature of PC71BM crystallization. A set of 1st heat DSC scans of the 50:50 BQR:PC71BM blend at progressively slower heating rates demonstrates that the transition is strongly kinetic and also suggest PC71BM cold crystallization (Fig. S1†); the peak transition temperature shifts from 186 °C when heated at 10 °C min−1 to 181 °C and 168 °C when heated at 5 °C min−1 and 1 °C min−1, respectively. PC71BM is typically trapped in an amorphous, glassy state when deposited from solution in an OPV blend.21,22 While crystallization is possible below the glass transition temperature, it does not proceed at appreciable rates until the temperature is raised above Tg that has been estimated to be ≈168 °C for PC71BM.23 Fullerene cold crystallization at T < Tg of pure PC71BM is only possible if the blend Tg is reduced.
 Fig. 4  Typical DSC heating traces for BQR:PC71BM (a) on 1st heat (as-cast morphology) and (b) on 2nd heat. Heat flow is normalized by sample mass m and heating rate β = 10 °C min−1. Exotherm direction is down. 
Like BQR, pristine BTR shows three transitions on cooling,4,10 the first two of which are liquid crystalline (LC1 onset at 198 °C, LC2 onset at 187 °C) and the third is crystalline (C3D onset at 142 °C). Fig. 3b illustrates the effect of PC71BM on BTR crystallization. Similar to BQR, the addition of PC71BM in BTR eliminates the exotherm for LC1. LC2 is observed in the BTR:PC71BM blends for the entirety of the loading series, but the onset temperature is significantly depressed from that in the pristine state. Similarly, the onset temperature for C3D shifts lower with increasing PC71BM loading. As with BQR, the temperature shift can be assumed to arise from freezing point depression on cooling. The heating curves for BTR:PC71BM blends also exhibit temperature depression of the BTR phase transitions (Fig. S2†). Unlike in BQR, the LC melting transitions are observed in neat BTR on heating,10 however they are suppressed or lost entirely in the presence of PC71BM. The suppression of the melting transitions and temperature shifts imply that BTR also forms a homogeneous mixture with PC71BM above the melting temperature for BTR. PC71BM cold crystallization is indicated by a broad exotherm above 180 °C in the 1st heat DSC traces for BTR:PC71BM blends for all fullerene loadings.
Flory-Huggins model
The bulk heterojunction morphology in OPV blends is a consequence of the thermodynamic driving force for phase separation between the acceptor and donor materials. Segregation of donor- and acceptor-rich phases occurs at some time during the drying process and is halted by the time the film has dried. Long term stability of the metastable, nano-phase segregated state – especially at elevated temperatures – is largely a function of the chemical miscibility between the donor and acceptor materials. The Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, χ, is a classic metric for chemical miscibility and can be estimated from melting point depression of the crystallizable component in blended systems. For blends of BQR or BTR with PC71BM, the necessary assumptions for Flory-Huggins theory24 are most applicable for melting depression of the PC71BM crystal phase, where the BQR or BTR is molten, Tm,PCBM ≫ Tm,BQR > Tm,BTR. Melting point depression of BXR can also be modeled, but one must consider that PC71BM is partially crystalline and the relative amount of crystalline and amorphous PC71BM material must be determined a priori. Fig. 5 shows the PC71BM peak melting temperature in blends with (a) BQR or (b) BTR estimated by DSC (peak melting temperature obtained from DSC melting curves in Fig. S3†). To model melting point depression with the Flory-Huggins approximation,24 it is assumed that PC71BM acts as a monomeric solvent (1), i.e., the molar volume of a PC71BM molecule, v1, is equivalent to the size of a lattice site, v0. BQR/BTR is modeled as a polymeric solute (2) with total molar volume, v2, but comprised of m subunits each with molar volume v0 or v1. The melting point for PC71BM, Tm,1, is expressed as: (1)where  and ΔH1 are the melting temperature and enthalpy of formation for pure PC71BM, φ1 is the volume fraction of PC71BM and R is the gas constant. To apply the model to the melting point data, the mass fraction of PC71BM, xm,1, was converted to volume fraction using the relation: (2)where ρ1 and ρ2 are the respective densities of PC71BM and BQR/BTR. The crystal densities of PC71BM,23 BTR4 and BQR were used in the conversion: ρPCBM = 1.58 g cm−3, ρBTR = ρBQR = 1.217 g cm−3 (the crystal density of BQR has not been reported, but should be similar to the density of BTR). The melting temperature and enthalpy of formation for PC71BM were estimated from DSC:  and ΔH1 = (11 ± 1) kJ mol−1 (reported error is one standard deviation from the mean of replicate samples). The model was fit to the data using the remaining adjustable parameters, m and χ. The best fit to the data and associated parameter set is shown in Fig. 5. Unsurprisingly, χ is almost identical for the binary mixtures of BQR/PC71BM and BTR/PC71BM. BTR and BQR are from the same family of materials and should presumably have a similar chemical miscibility with PC71BM. The predicted number of subunits m is also consistent with the relative lengths of BQR and BTR; m scales with the length of the BXR oligomer. An alternative estimate for m can be made if the species molar volumes are known using the relationship associated with the lattice model, mv0 = v2. Simply estimating the molar volumes from the molecular weights (MBQR = 2360 g mol−1, MBTR = 2030 g mol−1, MPCBM = 1080 g mol−1) and the crystal densities using the relationship, v = M/ρ, then m = 2.8 for BQR and m = 2.4 for BTR. Again, m scales with the length of the BXR oligomer, but more significantly, the absolute values are reasonably close to the prediction from the model fit.
 Fig. 5  Crystalline melting temperature of PC71BM in (a) BQR and (b) BTR on 1st heat as function of mass fraction of PC71BM. Curves are best fits to Flory's melting point depression model (see text). Error bars for melting temperature estimates (one standard deviation from the mean of replicate samples) are smaller than the size of the symbol. 
Using the parameters of the Flory-Huggins model for PC71BM melting point depression in a blend with BXR, one can extend the model to predict a theoretical phase diagram for the crystal transitions in BXR as a function of PC71BM loading. The transition temperature for the oligomeric species (BQR or BTR), denoted by Tx,2 is expressed through the following relationship: (3)where  and ΔHx,2 are the peak temperature and enthalpy for a given phase transition in pure BXR. BXR transition temperatures as a function of PC71BM loading are modeled using the values of m and χ determined previously in addition to the pure material transitions temperatures and enthalpies from DSC. For BQR, {Tm,C3D, Tc,LC1, Tc,LC2, Tc,C3D} = {202 °C, 190 °C, 181 °C, 167 °C} and {ΔHm,C3D, ΔHc,LC1, ΔHc,LC2, ΔHc,C3D} = {88 kJ mol−1, 1.2 kJ mol−1, 18 kJ mol−1, 56 kJ mol−1} and for BTR, {Tm,C3D, Tc,LC1, Tc,LC2, Tc,C3D} = {175 °C, 198 °C, 186 °C, 138 °C} and {ΔHm,C3D, ΔHc,LC1, ΔHc,LC2, ΔHc,C3D} = {33 kJ mol−1, 0.6 kJ mol−1, 16 kJ mol−1, 33 kJ mol−1}. The experimental phase diagram, constructed from the transition temperatures measured by DSC (Fig. 6a and b), is well predicted by the Flory-Huggins model; theoretical phase diagrams for BQR and BTR are reproduced in Fig. 6c and d. Most significantly, the depression of the transition temperature is weaker for higher transition enthalpies, and by extension higher entropies. This explains the complete suppression of LC1 at any investigated loading of PC71BM (>5% by mass) in both BQR and BTR; the transition enthalpy is very weak, on the order of only 1 kJ mol−1. The direct relationship between ΔHx and transition temperature depression also explains the suppression of LC2 in BQR. The transition enthalpy for C3D is significantly greater than that for the LC2 phase and therefore the ordering of the transitions on cooling switch with minimal PC71BM loading. Conversely, the difference in enthalpies between C3D and LC2 of BTR is smaller than for BQR. Suppression of LC2 in BTR is predicted at much higher loadings of PC71BM. LC2 suppression in BTR, however, was not observed in DSC. Rather, transition temperatures in BTR plateau for xm,PCBM > 0.4. Here, we recall that some fraction of PC71BM crystallizes on heating and remains crystalline when the DSC sample is cooled back down. This effectively traps our DSC measurements in a region of low PC71BM loading. Only the uncrystallized, amorphous fraction of PC71BM contributes to the transition temperature depression. The same effect likely holds for BQR since the transition temperatures also plateau above xm,PCBM = 0.3.

Device annealing
Given the strong difference in device performance between BQR and BTR with thermal annealing (TA),10 one might expect a difference in the DSC traces on heating in the range of standard TA conditions (80 °C to 140 °C). Simply taking the DSC traces for device relevant blends (50:50 mass ratio), there do not appear to be any thermal transitions in the annealing regime for either blended system; the melting transitions begin >140 °C. To assess if the differences arise because of prolonged thermal annealing (typically 5 min to 10 min), DSC samples were annealed at a fixed temperature for 5 min before taking a DSC heating scan. As demonstrated by Fig. 7, the most striking feature in the DSC traces for samples annealed at higher temperatures (T > 140 °C for BQR and T > 90 °C for BTR) is the absence of the exothermic peak at 185 °C attributed to PC71BM cold crystallization. Its absence suggests PC71BM crystallizes during the prolonged hot stage anneal and that the annealing temperature is greater than the film's Tg. The Tg of pristine PC71BM is 168 °C, well above the select annealing temperatures studied, but its Tg is likely reduced in a blend with a small molecule like BQR and BTR. One can therefore attribute the difference in thermal behavior with annealing to a shift in the Tg of the blended system. Specifically, we infer that the Tg of PC71BM is greater than the Tg for BQR and BTR and also that BQR has a higher Tg than BTR, which is expected given the difference in chain length (BQR has an extended chromophore around the benzodithiophene core and higher melting temperature). The DSC results presented in Fig. 7 provide strong evidence for the difference in device performance between thermally annealed BQR:PC71BM devices and BTR:PC71BM devices annealed at 120 °C for 10 min.10 Specifically, PC71BM crystallization does not occur at any appreciable rate at this annealing condition in BQR blends, but does occur in BTR blends.

Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS)

In situ GIWAXS measurements provide a prospective on the development of nanoscale, crystallographic order in thin films and have proven especially valuable in understanding the effects of processing in organic electronic materials25–27 and BHJ blends.21,28–36 Here we use GIWAXS to probe thin films of pristine BQR and BQR:PC71BM blends while continuously changing temperature to directly observe the morphological features that accompany calorimetric signatures in DSC. Fig. 8 summarizes the GIWAXS measurements for BQR crystallizing in a thin film from a molten state. The 2D X-ray scattering pattern for the crystalline ordered phase of BQR (C3D) is presented in Fig. 8a. The crystal structure of BQR has not been reported, but if we assume BQR adopts a unit cell similar to BTR (supported by analysis in the ESI†), then the aromatic groups of the backbone are coplanar, molecular backbones are π-stacked with adjacent molecules and the alkyl side-chains are stacked end-to-end.4 Following this assumption, the peak at 0.37 Å−1 along qz = 0 and the peak at −1.6 Å along qxy = 0 collectively imply that side-chains are presented at the substrate interface in an “edge-on” crystallite orientation, the alkyl side-chain stacking distance is 17 Å and the π-stacking distance is 3.9 Å. Scattering from mixed index crystal planes is clearly observed in the 2D scattering pattern, most strongly along qxy = −0.37 Å−1 and qxy = −0.56 Å.
 Fig. 8  (a) GIWAXS detector image of pristine BQR that has been crystallized from a molten state and cooled to 50 °C. Vertical line profiles from in situ GIWAXS near qxy ≈ 0 are provided for pristine BQR continuously cooled from (b) the melt state at 215 °C to 155 °C and (c) 155 °C to 50 °C. (d) Corresponding vertical line profiles along qxy = −0.37 Å−1 are also provided in the annealing regime from 155 °C to 50 °C. 

Fig. 8b illustrates the progression of ordering in BQR as it cools continuously from an amorphous, molten state. The material is completely isotropic with no detectable diffraction above 195 °C but once cooled to 185 °C a weak scattering feature along qxy ≈ 0 appears at a corresponding d-spacing of approximately 20 Å. The peak is attributed to the formation of LC1 (Tonset = 191 °C), which is presumed to be a locally-ordered, positionally-disordered arrangement of BQR molecules. The larger d-spacing compared to the primary scattering peak in C3D is a consequence of thermal expansion and/or greater thermal disorder in a liquid crystalline phase. Cooling to 175 °C significantly increases the intensity of the peak and shifts the peak position to roughly 19 Å. From the DSC results, there is a transition from LC1 to LC2 (Tonset = 182 °C) over this temperature interval. Assuming that diffraction at 175 °C is a signature of LC2 one can infer LC2 is a denser, more ordered phase than LC1. Upon further cooling to 170 °C the primary scattering peak continues to intensify and shift to higher qz. By 155 °C the peak maximum is at qz = 0.34 Å−1 corresponding in real space to roughly 18 Å. Two secondary features also appear in the 1D line cut along qxy ≈ 0 starting at 170 °C: a high qz shoulder alongside the primary peak and a smaller peak centered at qz = 0.68 Å−1. From DSC, cooling at 10 °C min−1 initiates crystallization into the three-dimensional ordered crystal phase at 171 °C, thus we can attribute these secondary features as defining characteristics of C3D. The smaller, secondary peak at qz = 0.68 Å−1 is attributed to the second order diffraction of the primary peak.

Fig. 8c illustrates the 1D scattering profile along qxy ≈ 0 associated with cooling the three-dimensional crystal phase of BQR to ambient temperature. There is a continuous shift in the primary peak position to larger qz as the temperature is reduced indicating further densification of the crystal. The high qz shoulder alongside the primary peak is maintained throughout, however the secondary peak associated with the reflection of the primary peak disappears upon cooling to 80 °C. Given the lack of any calorimetric signature from DSC, we assume the sudden loss of the peak is a consequence of signal loss from unsampled reciprocal space along the qxy = 0 axis. Specifically, we postulate that enhanced alignment of the crystallite orientation with the substrate sharpens the diffracted signal. Much of the signal is unavailable along qxy = 0 axis due to the missing wedge;27 only the breadth of the peaks along the qxy = 0 axis is captured. An analysis of the polar distribution of crystallite orientations around the primary peak (Fig. S4a†), indicates that sharpening proceeds after cooling to 100 °C. Simultaneously, the secondary peak sharpens until it is no longer observable; the breadth of the peak completely disappears behind the missing wedge (Fig. S4b†). Further evidence of enhanced alignment is indicated by the appearance of the mixed index reflections at temperatures well below the onset of C3D crystallization (line cuts along qxy = −0.37 Å−1 are provided in Fig. 8d). Reflections first start to appear around 110 °C. No polymorphic transition is indicated in the DSC results when cooling to temperatures below 150 °C. Rather, the change is an indication of a macroscopic shift in the crystal population. A quantitative treatment of crystallinity via integration of the diffracted signal is not possible as much of the signal is lost in the missing wedge.
Diffraction from pristine BQR cast from toluene (Fig. S5†) suggests the crystal structure is similar to melt-crystallized BQR (Fig. 8). Mixed index reflections are present in the as-cast sample (Fig. S5a†), but diffraction is much weaker and the spots appear blurred. The diffraction peaks sharpen as the crystal is annealed. The mixed index reflections persist up to 195 °C (Fig. S5b†). As clear signatures of a three-dimensional ordered phase, the scattering results confirm the peculiar stability of C3D of BQR indicated by DSC; the liquid crystal transitions (LC2 onset at 182 °C and LC1 onset at 191 °C on cooling) are bypassed entirely on heating.

Fig. 9 summarizes GIWAXS measurements from a thin film of 50:50 BQR:PC71BM. There is a mixture of edge-on and face-on BQR crystals in the as-cast film as evidenced by the inhomogeneous arc of scattering at q = 0.37 Å−1. Both populations of crystals remain after thermal annealing to 120 °C. Mixed index reflections in the blended film start to appear after annealing to 160 °C and disappear just before the melting temperature indicated by DSC, peak Tm = 193 °C for 50:50 BQR:PC71BM (Fig. 9d). The area under the primary scattering peak along qxy ≈ 0 in the as-cast film is smaller compared to an annealed state (90 °C to 140 °C) implying some degree of crystallization upon annealing. Moderate thermal annealing (T ≤ 90 °C) appears sufficient to induce crystallization of any amorphous BQR in the as-cast film since the scattered intensity effectively plateaus at higher annealing temperatures. The exact distribution of BQR phases in the blended film is unclear from GIWAXS measurements since the signatures of C3D and LC2 are relatively convolved. The high qz shoulder in the 1D scattering profile suggests the presence of C3D in the annealed film, but the lack of a shoulder does not preclude its presence in the as-cast film.

PC71BM crystallization in the 50:50 BQR:PC71BM film is indicated by a distinct scattering peak at qz = 0.58 Å−1 which develops after heating above 185 °C and persists after BQR melts (Fig. 9c). The peak position is consistent with scattering from pristine PC71BM annealed for 10 min at 180 °C.23 The onset temperature for the scattering peak in the BQR:PC71BM blend matches the temperature of the exothermic signal we attributed to PC71BM crystallization in the 1st heat DSC scans. The melting point of PC71BM is above 300 °C so one does not expect the scattering peak to disappear during in situ thermal cycling once it has crystallized (Tmax = 215 °C). For all subsequent cooling and heating scans the peak at qz = 0.58 Å−1 remains.
Grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS)

In situ GISAXS measurements enable one to track the evolution of characteristic domain sizes and phase purity in BHJ films as a function of annealing temperature. The total scattering intensity (TSI) directly reflects the material purity of the donor/acceptor phases in the BHJ blends. Assuming a spatially isotropic two-phase blend, TSI is related to the domain composition φi,j and the difference in scattering length density between the two phases Δρi,j, TSI ∝ Δρi,j2φiφj.32 Estimating TSI from GISAXS measurements is confounded by a limited q range and reflectivity effects along qz. Following procedures reported elsewhere,30,32,37,38 we evaluated the total internal reflection enhanced qxy data along the Yoneda axis (exact qz range indicated in Fig. 10a) hereby referred to as integrated scattering intensity (ISI) where . ISI differs from TSI in that ISI is the integral over a finite q-range while the TSI is the integral over all q. Fig. 10c shows the ISI for a BHJ blend of 50:50 BQR:PC71BM as it is annealed from 30 °C to 150 °C. The ISI is relatively constant in the low temperature regime (T < 80 °C) but increases linearly as the temperature increases. Beyond 150 °C, the ISI sharply decays to zero which is interpreted as a rapid increase in feature size outside of the detectable q range. The characteristic length scale or domain size reported in Fig. 10b is estimated by fitting a Teubner–Strey model including a Porod background to I(q).39 The extracted long period (often interpreted as the BHJ domain size) for the as-cast film is roughly 60 nm and remains constant upon annealing up to ≈120 °C. The peak subsequently moves towards lower absolute qxy values, or larger domain sizes. The trend in ISI and the extracted domain size collectively suggest a nano-scale segregated morphology forms when the blend is cast from solution and that thermal annealing begins to purify the domains at temperatures above 80 °C. Domain coarsening is delayed until the temperature is increased beyond 120 °C. These GISAXS measurements directly guided annealing conditions in an analysis of OPV performance for the BQR:PC71BM system.

(b) Teubner–Strey fit including a Porod background to I(q) at 120 °C. (c) Domain size and integrated scattering intensity (ISI) as a function of temperature. GISAXS measurements collected in situ while annealing the as-cast film at 10 °C min−1 from 30 °C to 215 °C. 
Photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL)
PL spectroscopy is capable of probing exciton separation for bulk heterojunction films.18 In a standard OPV device, excitons created upon absorption quickly travel to a donor/acceptor interface where exciton quenching by charge separation takes place. Excitons which cannot find an interface decay and may re-emit, thus, the degree of PL quenching provides a qualitative indication of the mesoscopic morphology. Morphologies characterized by finely mixed phases quench more strongly than coarser blends. For in situ thermal annealing studies, PL is particularly powerful as one can track the degree of quenching in a given film over a range of annealing conditions. Fig. 11 demonstrates PL quenching for a 50:50 BQR:PC71BM film as it is heated at 10 °C min−1 from 30 °C to 180 °C. The peak PL signal from the as-cast film is at 750 nm and does not shift as a function of annealing temperature. The peak intensity (Fig. 10c), however, linearly decayed between 30 °C to 80 °C, then abruptly decreased to a minimum around 100 °C before exponentially increasing as the temperature continued to ramp to 180 °C.

The initial decay in PL signal is not matched by any signature in GIWAXS nor GISAXS. The reduction in PL intensity thus is not attributed to significant morphology changes in the BHJ, but may arise from residual solvent being driven off at the elevated temperatures. Solvent molecules in the film introduce dielectric disorder and can act as trap states, hindering charge transfer. Modest improvement in device performance has been observed in P3HT:PC61BM blends annealed at low temperatures (50 °C) where solvent removal is the only plausible mechanism for device improvement.40 A sharp increase in the average domain size is indicated in both GISAXS and PL when the 50:50 BQR:PC71BM film was annealed above 120 °C. In GISAXS, this “domain ripening” is interpreted from a shift in feature size to lower q. The in situ PL response corroborates this interpretation; a strong increase in PL intensity at annealing temperatures >120 °C indicates a longer path length for exciton diffusion to a donor/acceptor boundary. We can interpret the domain ripening as a catastrophic change in the optimal device morphology which is often termed “over-coarsening”.
OPV performance
OPV devices comprising an active layer of BQR:PC71BM in a 50:50 mass ratio were prepared by blade coating from toluene solution with 40 mg mL−1 total solids content in solution. The active layer film thicknesses were ≈120 nm. OPV performance is summarized in Table 1. The as-cast devices yielded an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) around 4.7%. Device performance peaked when annealed at 120 °C for 5 min, PCE = 7.3%. These efficiencies are slightly lower than the performance of spun-cast devices reported by Geraghty et al.: PCE = 5.3% for the as-cast device and PCE = 8.9% after annealing at 120 °C for 10 min.10 In devices annealed at temperatures greater than 120 °C the short circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCE decrease monotonically with increasing temperature. The good performance of annealed, blade-coated BQR devices, relative to spun-coated, bodes well for production of small-molecule based solar cells at scale, as blade-coating has been established as a good model for continuous, slot-die deposition.

The strong improvement in device performance at moderate annealing temperatures (90 °C to 120 °C) is likely due to domain purification. Recent studies of other BHJ systems have demonstrated a strong relationship between domain purity and the device fill factor specifically.41,42 Here, we also see a significant increase in fill factor after annealing at 120 °C (FF = 62%) compared to the as-cast device (FF = 46%). GISAXS measurements of the 50:50 BQR/PC71BM film demonstrate an increase in ISI above 80 °C, which is interpreted as an increase in acceptor-/donor-rich phase purity. The domain size, however, remains fixed in this regime. Taken together, this implies molecular mobility is sufficient within domains to begin excluding impurities, but insufficient to induce large-scale morphological changes such as domain growth. Much of the improvement in domain purity may arise from changes to a mixed amorphous phase that is present in the blend in addition to BQR-rich and PC71BM-rich domains. If present, this mixed phase of un-crystallized BQR and PC71BM would contribute strongly to changes on annealing, assuming the BQR crystallizes and excludes PC71BM from the domains. An increase in the integrated scattering intensity from GIWAXS of the 50:50 blend upon thermal annealing supports the assumption that some amount of un-crystallized BQR is present in the as-cast film.
Domain coarsening is not apparent in the blend until the film is annealed above 120 °C, as demonstrated by both GISAXS and PL spectroscopy. This correlates with a drastic drop in device performance, fill factor and short-circuit current. Based on GIWAXS and DSC measurements, coarsening is related to BQR mobility rather than PC71BM mobility. BQR crystals align and appear to grow when heated above 140 °C at 10 °C min−1. In this regime, however, PC71BM remains in a glassy state; cold crystallization does not occur until 185 °C.
Conclusions
The small molecule donor benzodithiophene-quaterthiophene-rhodanine (BQR) is an excellent candidate for large-scale OPV production using roll-to-roll printing based on its unique thermal stability and good performance (PCE > 8%) in thick active layers (>200 nm).10 In this investigation we have confirmed that BQR device performance remains high when transitioning to continuous manufacture by demonstrating a blade-coated device with PCE > 7%. Using a range of characterization techniques, we have thoroughly investigated the thermal properties of BQR in its pristine state and in blends with the fullerene acceptor PC71BM. GISAXS and PL measurements independently suggest catastrophic changes to the mesoscopic morphology of the photoactive BQR:PC71BM blend when annealed above 120 °C. Device performance measurements confirm that 120 °C is the optimal annealing temperature. At this annealing condition donor/acceptor domain purification was active but the average domain size was unchanged. We attribute the superior thermal stability of BQR relative to BTR to the two additional thiophenes group in the BQR backbone. DSC results suggest that PC71BM mobility is suppressed more strongly in blends with BQR than in BTR, presumably resulting from a higher Tg in the BQR/PC71BM blend.
DSC measurements and theoretical modeling of the phase transitions in the BQR/PC71BM blend revealed that the liquid crystalline phases of BQR are suppressed when blended with PC71BM. Specifically, in any device-relevant blend of BQR and PC71BM, there is a strong preference to form the three-dimensional ordered crystal phase of BQR. The underlying mechanism for the suppression is the interruption of the liquid crystal phase by PC71BM; the weak association in the liquid crystal phase, quantified by the enthalpic change of the transition, is broken by the presence of PC71BM in the blend. Therefore, it stands to reason that most OPV materials exhibiting a liquid crystal transition in the pristine state, likely do not exhibit liquid crystallinity in a BHJ blend. Ultimately, the results of this work challenge our understanding of the role of liquid crystallinity in BHJ films for OPV applications.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Chemical structures of materials among the BXR series.	 

 	Fig. 2  DSC traces of BQR melting and re-crystallization. The first heating scan is from the melting of the initial drop-cast BQR. After a 1 min isothermal hold at 215 °C, the BQR is cycled at progressively slower cooling rates (10 °C min−1, 5 °C min−1, 1 °C min−1). Each cooling scan is followed by a heating scan, cycling between 0 °C and 215 °C. All heating scans are performed at 10 °C min−1. Inset: heating scans in the region of melting. Cooling curves are displaced for clarity. Heat flow is normalized by sample mass m and cooling/heating rate β. Exotherm direction is down.	 

 	Fig. 3  Typical DSC cooling traces for (a) BQR:PC71BM and (b) BTR:PC71BM blends. Heat flow is normalized by sample mass m and cooling rate β = 10 °C min−1. Exotherm direction is down.	 

 	Fig. 4  Typical DSC heating traces for BQR:PC71BM (a) on 1st heat (as-cast morphology) and (b) on 2nd heat. Heat flow is normalized by sample mass m and heating rate β = 10 °C min−1. Exotherm direction is down.	 
	(1)
	(2)

 	Fig. 5  Crystalline melting temperature of PC71BM in (a) BQR and (b) BTR on 1st heat as function of mass fraction of PC71BM. Curves are best fits to Flory's melting point depression model (see text). Error bars for melting temperature estimates (one standard deviation from the mean of replicate samples) are smaller than the size of the symbol.	 
	(3)

 	Fig. 6  Phase transition temperatures in (a) BQR and (b) BTR from DSC on cooling at 10 °C min−1. Theoretical phase diagrams for (c) BQR and (d) BTR as a function of PC71BM loading.	 

 	Fig. 7  1st heat DSC traces for as-cast and annealed 50:50 blends of (a) BQR:PC71BM and (b) BTR:PC71BM. Curves are shifted to match the baseline heat flow in the melted state. Heat flow is normalized by sample mass m and heating rate β = 10 °C min−1. The PC71BM cold crystallization transition is indicated. Exotherm direction is down.	 

 	Fig. 8  (a) GIWAXS detector image of pristine BQR that has been crystallized from a molten state and cooled to 50 °C. Vertical line profiles from in situ GIWAXS near qxy ≈ 0 are provided for pristine BQR continuously cooled from (b) the melt state at 215 °C to 155 °C and (c) 155 °C to 50 °C. (d) Corresponding vertical line profiles along qxy = −0.37 Å−1 are also provided in the annealing regime from 155 °C to 50 °C.	 

 	Fig. 9  (a) GIWAXS detector images of a 50:50 BQR:PC71BM thin film blade-coated from toluene solution and (b) annealed to 120 °C. The images were collected while heating at 10 °C min−1. Vertical line profiles near (c) qxy ≈ 0 and (d) qxy = −0.35 Å−1 are also provided.	 

 	Fig. 10  (a) GISAXS detector image of a 50:50 BQR:PC71BM blend including a representative horizontal cut at qz ≈ 0 from which the I(q) data are extracted. (b) Teubner–Strey fit including a Porod background to I(q) at 120 °C. (c) Domain size and integrated scattering intensity (ISI) as a function of temperature. GISAXS measurements collected in situ while annealing the as-cast film at 10 °C min−1 from 30 °C to 215 °C.	 

 	Fig. 11  (a) In situ photoluminescence spectroscopy of a 50:50 BQR:PC71BM film heated at 10 °C min−1. (b) Isolated PL spectra of an as-cast and annealed film. (c) In situ PL intensity at 750 nm as a function of stage temperature.
