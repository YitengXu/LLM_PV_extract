    , Accepted 8th September 2015First published on 10th September 2015AbstractMonofluorinated small molecules have been proved to be promising donors for high performance small molecular solar cells (SMSCs). Herein, two solution-processable acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type small molecules (SMs) with 4,8-bis(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTT) as the donor core and benzothiadiazole (BT) or difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DFBT) as the acceptor unit, namely BDT(TBTTT6)2 and BDT(TffBTTT6)2 respectively, have been designed and synthesized to extensively investigate the effect of fluorination on the optoelectronic properties, molecular organization, and photovoltaic performance of SMSCs. The fluorinated BDT(TffBTTT6)2 shows a relatively broader and stronger absorbance, more favorable molecular packing and deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level than nonfluorinated BDT(TBTTT6)2, leading to a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc), circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and hole mobility in SMSCs. Additionally, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is significantly improved from 1.76% to 4.17% for BDT(TffBTTT6)2 and from 1.3% to 3.17% for BDT(TBTTT6)2 based inverted devices after optimization by 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and thermal annealing (TA). It should be noted that the PCE of 4.17% is the highest reported value for the solution-processed inverted SMSCs based on BDT and BT units. Grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) demonstrate that the fluorinated small molecule optimization by DIO and thermal annealing promote a more well-intermixed microphase morphology as well as a better donor/acceptor interpenetrating network in an active film for more efficient charge transfer and transportation than the nonfluorinated one, leading to a dramatic improvement in the device performance. These results unambiguously demonstrate that the introduction of F atoms into the molecular backbone as well as optimization by the solvent additive process can be an effective strategy for the development of electron-donating materials for stabilized inverted-based SMSCs.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted great attention recently due to their promising applications as a competitive technology for environmentally friendly renewable energy and for their advantages of low cost, light weight, and flexibility.1–5 Currently, the electron donor materials in the active layer for OSCs have been divided into two types, polymer donor and small molecule donor. In the past few decades, though the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the polymer-based solar cells (PSCs) have been achieved over 10%,6–9 solution-processed small molecular solar cells (SMSCs) have still drawn more and more attention in recent years due to their promising advantages of easy structural design, a well-defined structure and thus less batch-to-batch variation and easy refinement, and their PCEs almost reached an equal value to those of the PSCs.10–12
Recently, the planar linear A–D–A structured small molecules based on thiophene,13,14 benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT),15–19 or dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTS).20,21 as donor cores, benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT),22 diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),23 thienopyrroledione (TPD),24 or dye building blocks13–18 as acceptor units have been intensively researched. Among these donor cores, benzo-[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) has been successfully developed as an electron-donating unit for its large planar structure, low deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, high hole mobility, and good photovoltaic performance both in SMSCs and PSCs.25–27 For the acceptor units, BT has been very popular for constructing low-band-gap conjugated polymers owing to its strong electron accepting ability and commercial availability.28,29 Otherwise, these two N atoms in the thiadiazole ring could possibly form hydrogen bonding with adjacent units leading to a more planar backbone. Many polymers with a BT acceptor unit have shown low band gaps and good photovoltaic properties.25,26
Usually, to obtain a better performance, the small molecules’ (SMs) donor structure needs to be optimized. The strategies used for the design of high performance conjugated polymers could also be applied to the molecular design of SMs. The method of introduction of fluorine (F) atoms onto the conjugated polymer backbone has been proven to be an effective way to improve the performance of BHJ solar cells.30–38 Owing to the electron-withdrawing character of the F atom, conjugated polymers with F atoms usually exhibit lower HOMO energy levels, thus leading to an increased open circuit voltage (Voc) of the corresponding device.32 Moreover, fluorination can increase other photovoltaic properties, such as the short circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF),35 and hole mobility.39 Therefore, it is reported that the monofluorinated small molecule has also been proved to be a promising donor for high performance SMSCs,21 but the effect of fluorination on the optoelectronic properties, molecular organization, and photovoltaic performance of small molecular devices has not been investigated extensively.
In addition, the device structure is another vital factor to achieve a better performance of SMSCs. A conventional BHJ PSC and SMSC with an active layer sandwiched by a low work-function aluminum cathode and a hole-conducting poly(3,4-ethylenedioxylenethiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) layer on top of an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate is the most widely used and researched device configuration. Compared to a conventional device, inverted solar cell architectures are becoming increasingly attractive by allowing more air stable, higher work function metal electrodes (e.g., Ag) to be used, resulting in a longer-living device. However, the present small molecular donor materials have been rarely applied for SMSCs with an inverted device. So it is necessary to design and synthesize new small molecules for high performance inverted SMSCs.
Inspired by the advantages of fluorinated molecules and the inverted device structure, in this work, we design and synthesize fluorinated acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type small molecules BDT(TffBTTT6)2 based on the 4,8-bis(5-hexylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTT) donor core and the difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DFBT) acceptor unit for inverted SMSCs (Scheme 1). The nonfluorinated analogue BDT(TBTTT6)2 is also prepared for comparison. A hexylbithiophene end-capping unit is incorporated to finely control the optical and electronic properties of the two molecules.40 The effect of fluorination on the properties of SMs and their corresponding device performance have been systematically investigated. As expected, both SMs exhibit broad absorption in the visible region and high thermal stability. Fluorinated BDT(TffBTTT6)2 shows a better performance than nonfluorinated BDT(TBTTT6)2, resulting from the broader absorbance, higher hole mobility, and deeper HOMO energy level. However, when blended with the acceptor [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), SMSCs only deliver very low PCE, due to the poor morphology of the blend film in BHJ solar cells. After being treated with 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive and annealed at 70 °C, the PCEs are significantly improved from 1.76% to 4.17% for BDT(TffBTTT6)2/PC61BM and from 1.3% to 3.17% for BDT(TBTTT6)2/PC71BM based SMSCs. It should be noted that the PCE of 4.17% is the highest reported value for the solution-processed inverted SMSCs based on BDT and BT units. Grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) demonstrate that for BDT(TffBTTT6)2 and BDT(TBTTT6)2, optimization by DIO and thermal annealing promote favorable morphology evolution of the active layer, especially for the fluorinated BDT(TffBTTT6)2, and contribute to the dramatic improvement of device performance.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis
The synthetic route of two small molecules, BDT(TffBTTT6)2 and BDT(TBTTT6)2 are presented in Scheme 1, and the detailed synthesis of the molecules is provided in the Experimental section. 2-Hexyl-5-(tributylstannyl)thiophene (compound 1) prepared according to the reported literature41 was reacted with 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophene-2-yl)-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (compound 2) and 4,7-bis(2-bromo-5-thien)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (compound 3) to afford compound 4 and compound 5, respectively. Through the Still cross-coupling reaction, the fluorinated BDT(TffBTTT6)2 and non-fluorinated BDT(TBTTT6)2 were obtained by compound 4 and compound 5 reacting with 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexy)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (compound 6), respectively. The final products are soluble in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, chlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The structures of the compounds have been fully confirmed by structural analysis, as shown in Fig. S1–6 (ESI†).
2.2. Thermal properties
The thermal stability of the small molecules was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, as shown in Fig. S7.† Two small molecules exhibit excellent thermal stability for long-term photovoltaic application with 5% weight loss temperature (Td) over 400 °C. In addition, the similar Td of two small molecules indicates that the introduction of two fluorine atoms in the 5,6-positions of BT does not affect the thermal stability. The thermal behavior of the two small molecules has been further studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). As shown in Fig. S8 in the ESI,† BDT(TffBTTT6)2 and BDT(TBTTT6)2 exhibit endothermic peaks at 225.3 °C and 205 °C upon heating, respectively, corresponding to the melting temperature (Tm) caused by the melting of the compound backbone. The crystallization peaks at 155.1 °C for BDT(TffBTTT6)2 and at 164.3 °C for BDT(TBTTT6)2 while cooling from their melting states.
2.3. Absorption spectra
The absorption spectra of the SM solution and films are presented in Fig. 1 and the correlated optical parameters are summarized in Table 1. Benefiting from their appropriate conjugation length (9 conjugated units) and D–A molecular structures with BDT and BT, the absorption spectra of the compounds in chloroform solutions show a broad absorption in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 650 nm (see Fig. 1). The absorption bands have a high and a low energy band, which is attributed to localized π–π* transitions and internal charge transfer transitions, respectively. In the solid state, a distinct bathochromic shift by ca. 100 nm for both SMs compared to their absorption in solution. A new vibronic peak in the low energy transition region emerged, revealing the strong π–π stacking interaction existing in the solid films. Relative to the BDT(TBTTT6)2, the fluorinated BDT(TffBTTT6)2 shows a broader absorption band with enhanced intensity, even extending to 800 nm. The enhanced absorption in the visible region results from the improved intra-molecular chain interaction by incorporation of two fluorine (F) atoms onto the conjugated SM backbone, which would increase the short circuit current (Jsc) in the devices. As shown in Table 1, the optical band gaps (Eoptg) can be calculated to be 1.61 and 1.74 eV from the absorption edges of BDT(TffBTTT6)2 and films BDT(TBTTT6) (ca. 769 and 714 nm), respectively.

2.4. Electrochemical properties
The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of SMs were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV measurements were conducted in a 0.1 M Bu4PF6/CH3CN solution. The platinum disc working electrode was coated with the SM thin film by using chloroform solution. The cyclic voltammograms of the two small molecule films are shown in Fig. 2a. The onset oxidation potentials (Eox) and onset reduction potentials (Ered) are 1.02 V and −0.61 V vs. Ag/AgCl for BDT(TffBTTT6)2, and 0.92 V and −0.78 V vs. Ag/AgCl for BDT(TBTTT6)2. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the SM films are estimated from the Eox and Ered values according to the following equations: HOMO = −e(Eox + 4.4) (eV), and LUMO = −e(Ered + 4.4) (eV), where the potential values of Eox and Ered are against Ag/AgCl. Therefore, the HOMO for BDT(TffBTTT6)2 and BDT(TBTTT6)2 is calculated to be −5.42 and −5.32 eV, and the LUMO for BDT(TffBTTT6)2 and BDT(TBTTT6)2 is calculated to be −3.79 and −3.62 eV, respectively (see Table 1). The electrochemical band gaps are found to be 1.63 eV for BDT(TffBTTT6)2 and 1.70 eV for BDT(TBTTT6)2, which are well consistent with the values from absorption measurements. From the data we can see that introduction of fluorine atoms can effectively reduce both the HOMO and the bandgap of BDT(TffBTTT6)2, therefore, an improved Voc in BHJ solar cells can be anticipated. The energy levels of BDT(TffBTTT6)2 and BDT(TBTTT6)2 in BHJ solar cells are illustrated in Fig. 2b.

2.5. Computational calculation
In order to deeply understand the minimum-energy conformations and molecular orbital distributions by the introduction of F atoms, the structures of the SMs were computed by using density functional theory (DFT) calculation at the B3LYP/6-31G level with the Gaussian 09 package. DFT calculations are useful for predicting optimized structures, confirming molecular geometry, verifying complete delocalization across the conjugated backbones, and predicting electronic energy levels.42 The alkyl groups are replaced by methyl groups for simplicity, but the electronic properties and equilibrium geometries will not be influenced significantly.43 The energetically stable molecular geometry with the lowest total energy in each single basic unit is shown in Fig. 3a and c. The dihedral angles between the dithienylbenzothiadiazole (DTBT) unit and the BDT units in BDT(TBTTT6)2 are calculated to be 7.0° (outward direction) and −6.9° (inward direction), while the dihedral angles between the dithienyl-difluorobenzothiadiazole (DT2FBT) unit and the BDT units in BDT(TffBTTT6)2 are 7.4° (outward direction) and −6.8° (inward direction). Thus both of the interfacial angles in BDT(TffBTTT6)2 and BDT(TBTTT6)2 are ∼14°, contributing to the formation of a high molecular planarity. The molecular orbital distributions of HOMO and LUMO isosurfaces for each model are shown in Fig. 3b and d. HOMO for both the models is well-delocalized over the whole conjugated backbone, while LUMO is mainly distributed on the electron accepting BT blocks. Moreover, the calculated HOMO and LUMO levels of fluorinated-based small molecule BDT(TffBTTT6)2 are lower than those of BDT(TBTTT6)2, which is in agreement with the results of the cyclic voltammetry instrument.

From the DFT calculation, the impact of F atoms on the molecular packing cannot be clearly detected. To obtain deeper insight into the molecular stacking of the small molecule films, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the SM thin films was thus performed (see Fig. 4). Both SMs show one strong diffraction peak at a small angle region and one broad diffraction peak at a wide angle region. The diffraction peaks of BDT(TffBTTT6)2 and BDT(TBTTT6)2 at the small angle region are located at 2θ = 4.68° and 3.96°, corresponding to the d-spacing between the molecular layers of 2.10 and 2.48 nm, respectively. The smaller d-spacing of the fluorinated BDT(TffBTTT6)2 than BDT(TBTTT6)2 is related to the increased inter- or intra-molecular interactions from F–H, F–F interactions.

2.6. Bulk-heterojunction solar cell performance
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the SMs, bulk-heterojunction SMSCs were fabricated with the organic molecules as donors (D) and PC61BM or PC71BM as acceptors (A) in the inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The active layers were spin-coated from their chloroform solutions with a thickness of ∼110 nm. The optimized J–V curves are shown in Fig. 5 and the corresponding photovoltaic performance is summarized in Table 2. We first performed the optimization of photovoltaic performance of the SMSCs based on BDT(TffBTTT6)2 as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor by changing D/A weight ratios from 1:1.5 to 1.5:1. As shown in Fig. S9 and Table S1,† the device with a D/A weight ratio of 1:0.8 shows the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.3% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.73 V, a low short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 2.97 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 59.8%. By replacing PC71BM with PC61BM, the PCE of the device increases to 1.76% due to the higher Voc and Jsc. Further device optimization can be realized by thermal annealing on the devices at temperatures from 70 to 160 °C for 10 min, and the highest PCE values of 2.59% are obtained when the annealing temperature is 160 °C (Fig. S10a and Table S2†). The enhanced performance upon thermal annealing can be attributed to the improvement in Jsc which is correlated to the improved morphology of the active layer for the absorption enhancement (see Fig. S11†). Moreover, the SMSCs based on BDT(TBTTT6)2 as the donor and PC61BM or PC71BM as the acceptor at a D/A weight ratio of 1:0.8 were also tested. Different from the BDT(TffBTTT6)2 based devices, blending BDT(TBTTT6)2 with PC71BM as the active layer in the device shows a better PCE than the BDT(TBTTT6)2/PC61BM-based one (1.3% vs. 1.06%). The contrasting impact caused by the acceptors is due to the different morphologies (discussed later). Similarly, thermal annealing has a positive effect on the devices based on BDT(TBTTT6)2/PC71BM, and an optimized PCE of 1.8% is achieved after annealing at 100 °C for 10 min (see Fig. S10b and Table S2†).

Although progress has been made in the device performance upon thermal treatment, the PCEs are still very low relative to those of most reported SMSCs. It has been reported that the addition of the process additives to the blend solution before spin-casting into the films significantly affects the efficiency of the resulting organic solar cells. As a solvent additive, diiodooctane (DIO) has been used during the film-casting step for further optimization of the photovoltaic performance. At present, there is no reported literature about the application of DIO in inverted devices though it plays a good role in many conventional small molecule devices. Here, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 v/v% of DIO concentrations in chloroform were used to optimize the devices. The photovoltaic performance data of the OSCs are provided in Fig. S12 and Table S3.† As the concentration of DIO is increased, the Voc tends to decrease. While this phenomenon remains unexplained, it is consistent with previous reports.44–46 With the addition of 0.5 v/v% DIO into the active layer, the devices with the two SMs show a significant improvement in the photovoltaic performance. The PCE is improved to 3.11% for BDT(TffBTTT6)2/PC61BM and to 2.82% for BDT(TBTTT6)2/PC71BM with remarkably enhanced Jsc and FF. The significantly improved efficiency originates from the favorable morphological evolution in the active layer induced by DIO additive. Delightfully, the photovoltaic performance is found to be further improved with the addition of 0.5 v/v% DIO, followed by thermal annealing within a temperature range of 70 to 170 °C for 10 min. As shown in Fig. S13 and Table S4,† the SMSC based on the fluorinated molecule BDT(TffBTTT6)2 demonstrates the best PCE of 4.17%, which is the highest reported value for the solution-processed inverted SMSCs based on BDT and BT units. The nonfluorinated BDT(TBTTT6)2 also shows an improved PCE of 3.17%. In addition, compared to the BDT(TBTTT6)2-based devices, the BDT(TffBTTT6)2-based ones achieve higher device parameters including Voc, Jsc and FF. The improved Voc comes from the lower HOMO levels by incorporation of F atoms, and the broader response range and more favorable morphology should be responsible for the Jsc and FF enhancement.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra according to the J–V curves are shown in Fig. 5b. The EQE peak of both BDT(TffBTTT6)2 and BDT(TBTTT6)2 was significantly enhanced after optimization by the addition of DIO and thermal annealing, contributing to Jsc enhancement. All Jsc values calculated by EQE are quite consistent with the values obtained from J–V curves. Moreover, with respect to that of BDT(TBTTT6)2, the EQE spectrum of BDT(TffBTTT6)2 shows a broader response and red-shift, which is in agreement with their UV absorption. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 5c, the stability of the optimized devices of BDT(TffBTTT6)/PC61BM was tested. The devices without encapsulations were placed in a glovebox for several days before measurement. The devices with an inverted structure only show a 35% decrease in the PCE value after being constantly preserved in a glovebox for a long time of 49 days, which exhibits a good stability compared to the most reported small molecules in conventional devices. The decrease of PCE mainly results from Jsc and FF slowly decaying. The J–V characteristics of this long-term stable device as a function of time can be seen in Fig. S14.†
2.7. Grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD)
To further investigate the reason behind the significant improvement in the photovoltaic performance after optimizing the device by the addition of DIO and thermal annealing, grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) was applied to probe the structure order/molecular packing in these BHJ films. Comparing diffraction patterns in an out-of-plane cut (Fig. 6) with the in-plane cut (Fig. S15†), both of the blend films only exhibit diffraction peaks located at low angles in the out-of-plane cut, implying an edge-on orientation of donor materials. As shown in Fig. 6, the pristine BDT(TBTTT6)2/PC71BM blend film displays a weak (100) diffraction peak located at 3.71° in the out-of-plane cut, corresponding to the d-spacing of 2.64 nm between the molecular layers. After optimization with 0.5% DIO and thermal annealing, the (100) peak shifts to 4.04° and becomes much stronger, indicating an improved layer packing of the molecules existing in the BHJ film. The enhanced degree of crystallization can improve the phase purity and intermix the phase area of the materials, which has positive effects on the device performance. The change in the morphology of the BDT(TffBTTT6)2/PC61BM film is similar to that in the BDT(TBTTT6)2/PC71BM film, as shown in Fig. 6. Compared with the BDT(TBTTT6)2/PC71BM pristine film, the BDT(TffBTTT6)2/PC61BM pristine film shows a (100) diffraction peak at 4.23°, corresponding to a shorter d-spacing of 2.32 nm. This suggests that the fluorinated BDT(TffBTTT6)2 forms a denser molecular packing than the nonfluorinated counterpart, in accordance with the XRD and UV observation. Similar to the BDT(TBTTT6)2/PC71BM film, the addition of DIO and thermal annealing improve the degree of crystallization of the BDT(TffBTTT6)2/PC61BM film to form a well-intermixed phase, as revealed by the upshift of the (100) diffraction peak from 4.23° to 4.87° with a strongly increased intensity. It can be inferred that the dense molecular packing of BDT(TffBTTT6)2 may induce a macrophase separation between the donor and the acceptor in the pristine blend films, at the same time, the combination of addition of DIO and thermal annealing promotes a well-intermixed microphase morphology in the active film for more efficient charge transfer and transportation.
 Fig. 6  Out-of-plane grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurement of the BDT(TffBTTT6)2/PC61BM and BDT(TBTTT6)2/PC71BM films with or without 0.5 v/v% DIO and annealing at 70 °C (TA). 
2.8. Morphologies of the active layers
The morphological change can be clearly detected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 7 shows the morphology of BDT(TffBTTT6)2/PC61BM and BDT(TBTTT6)2/PC71BM films with or without optimization, and the bright and dark regions correspond to donors and PC61BM or PC71BM-rich domains, respectively.47–49 Owing to the good miscibility of BDT(TffBTTT6)2 and PC61BM, BDT(TBTTT6)2 and PC71BM, two very uniform and homogeneous morphologies of the corresponding pristine films are observed in Fig. 7a and c. However, the BDT(TffBTTT6)2 and PC61BM, BDT(TBTTT6)2 and PC71BM are mixed so well that a desirable nanostructure with separated donor and acceptor domains is not obtained. Upon optimization of 0.5 v/v% DIO and 70 °C annealing, the domain size of each component becomes bigger and a nano-scale phase separation is developed in Fig. 7b and d, and the BDT(TffBTTT6)2-based film exhibits a better nano-scale phase separation as well as a better donor/acceptor interpenetrating network due to the existence of fluorine atoms, consequently leading to a dramatically improved device performance. These results are well consistent with the GIXRD measurement. Furthermore, from Fig. S16,† we can also see that BDT(TffBTTT6)2 has better miscibility with PC61BM than PC71BM, while BDT(TBTTT6)2 presents the opposite behavior. Therefore, BDT(TffBTTT6)2/PC61BM and BDT(TBTTT6)2/PC71BM films show better performance than their counterparts.
 Fig. 7  TEM images of the active layers with (a) BDT(TffBTTT6)2/PC61BM, (b) BDT(TffBTTT6)2:PC61BM with 0.5 v/v% DIO and annealing at 70 °C, (c) BDT(TBTTT6)2/PC71BM, (d) BDT(TBTTT6)2/PC71BM with 0.5 v/v% DIO and annealing at 70 °C annealing. The scale bar is 100 nm. 
The tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to study the surface morphology of the active layers. The AFM height and phase images of the blend films in Fig. 8 demonstrate the morphological evolution in the active layer induced by DIO additive and thermal annealing. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the BDT(TffBTTT6)2/PC61BM and BDT(TBTTT6)2/PC71BM films without any processing is 4.49 nm and 0.36 nm, respectively. When the BHJ blend films are processed with 0.5% DIO and annealed at 70 °C, the AFM images show that the RMS of BDT(TffBTTT6)2/PC61BM and BDT(TBTTT6)2/PC71BM films increased to 12.0 nm and 4.50 nm, respectively. The relative coarse surface morphology in the processed film could be attributed to the rearrangement of the SMs in the BHJ blend, as frequently reported for DIO processed polymer/fullerene films.50,51 Similar to the observation from TEM and GIXRD, the DIO additive and thermal annealing can induce the self-organized ordering of the crystalline domain of the BDT(TffBTTT6)2/PC61BM and BDT(TBTTT6)2/PC71BM. The phase images in Fig. 8 illustrate that the donor/acceptor interpenetrating network of the blend film of BDT(TffBTTT6)2/PC61BM is better than that of BDT(TBTTT6)2/PC71BM, which could be due to the existence of F atoms. Therefore, the better photovoltaic performance of the BDT(TffBTTT6)2/PC61BM active layer should be also related to the suitable morphology of the active layer.

2.9. Hole mobility
The hole mobilities of the with and without optimized blend of BDT(TffBTTT6)2/PC61BM and BDT(TBTTT6)2/PC71BM were measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method52 with a hole-only device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag, as shown in Fig. 9. Without optimizing, the mobilities are 4.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the BDT(TffBTTT6)2 device that are higher than 2.59 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the BDT(TBTTT6)2 device, due to the introduction of two F atoms. After optimization with 0.5 v/v% DIO and annealing at 70 °C, the mobilities increase to 8.71 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for BDT(TffBTTT6)2 and to 4.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the BDT(TBTTT6)2 device. The difference in the hole mobilities of BDT(TffBTTT6)2 and BDT(TBTTT6)2 devices also can partly explain the variation in the device performance.

3. Conclusions
In summary, two small molecules BDT(TffBTTT6)2 and BDT(TBTTT6)2 with an A–D–A structure and BDT as the donor unit and BT as the acceptor unit have been designed and synthesized. After introducing two F atoms on the benzothiadiazole unit, the molecular energy level, packing and charge-carrier transport capability of the BDT(TffBTTT6)2 have been finely tuned, resulting in a higher Voc, Jsc, FF of BDT(TffBTTT6)2-based device compared to that of the nonfluorinated molecule. On further optimization by DIO and thermal annealing, the fluorinated small molecule-based devices show a dramatically improved device performance due to the promotion of the more favorable morphology evolution of the active layer and the BDT(TffBTTT6)2-based inverted device achieves a notable PCE of 4.17%. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 4.17% is the highest value of solution processed SMSCs fabricated from BDT-BT-based SMs. Moreover, fluorinated small molecules show a more favorable morphology after the solvent additive process, so this strategy can be an effective way for the development of fluorinated small molecules in stabilized inverted-based SMSCs.
4. Experimental section
4.1. Synthesis of 4-(5-bromo-thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-7-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′]bithiophenyl-5-yl)benzo[1,2,5]thiadiazole (4)
A solution of compound 1 (1.11 g, 2.43 mmol) and compound 2 (1.20 g, 2.43 mmol) in dry toluene (20 mL) was degassed thrice with nitrogen followed by the addition of Pd(PPh3)4 (150 mg, 0.13 mmol). After being stirred at 85 °C for 12 h under nitrogen, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and then dissolved in CH2Cl2, washed with water and dried by anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After evaporation of the solvent, the crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using a mixture of dichloromethane and petroleum ether (1:8) as the eluant to afford compound 4 (0.78 g, 55%) as a red solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 8.18 (d, 1H), 8.0 (d, 1H), 7.20 (m, 2H), 7.13 (d, 1H), 6.72 (d, 1H), 2.81 (m, 2H), 1.70 (m, 2H), 1.56 (m, 2H), 1.25–1.34 (m, 4H), 0.90 (t, 3H). 13C NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 148.43, 146.64, 141.31, 134.09, 131.97, 130.18, 125.17, 124.07, 122.97, 116.54, 109.72, 31.47, 30.05, 28.65, 22.56, 17.13, 13.92.

4.5. Fabrication and characterization of OSCs
Organic solar cells (OSCs) were fabricated in the configuration of the traditional sandwich structure of ITO/ZnO/photoactive layer/MoO3/Ag. ITO-coated glass was cleaned by ultrasonic agitation in acetone, detergent, deionized water and isopropanol sequentially followed by UV treatment for 20 min. Then the ZnO precursor solution was spin-cast on the ITO glass at 4000 rpm for 1 min and annealed at 205 °C for 1 h in air to yield an approximately 30 nm film thickness. The devices were transferred into a glovebox filled with N2. The active layer was prepared by spin-casting the solution of the organic compound donor (D) and PC61BM or PC71BM acceptor (A) with different D/A ratios on the top of the ZnO layer. The concentration of the solution was 18 mg mL−1 in chloroform (CF) (or with a different volume of DIO). Then the device was annealed at different temperatures for 10 min. Finally, MoO3 (7 nm)/Ag (90 nm) was vacuum evaporated on the active layer under a shadow mask in a vacuum of ca. 10−4 pa. The active layer area of the device is 4 mm2. The light source was calibrated by using silicon reference cells with an AM 1.5 Global solar simulator with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter (Abet Solar Simulator Sun 200). All the measurements were performed under an ambient atmosphere at room temperature. The EQE was measured under monochromatic illumination (Oriel Cornerstone 260 1/4 monochromator equipped with Oriel 70613NS QTH lamp), and the calibration of the incident light was performed with a monocrystalline silicon diode.
