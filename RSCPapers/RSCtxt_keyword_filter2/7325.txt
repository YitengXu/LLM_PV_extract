    , Accepted 28th July 2014First published on 29th July 2014AbstractPolyaniline (PANI)–zinc sulphide (ZnS) nanocomposites (PAZs) are synthesized by polymerizing aniline in the presence of acetic acid with different concentrations of ZnS nanoparticles (NPs). FESEM and TEM images indicate the nanotube morphology of PANI and ZnS NPs remain adhered to the nanotube surface, but at higher ZnS concentration the nanotube morphology is lost. UV-vis spectra indicate PANI is in the doped state and the doping increases with an increase in ZnS concentration. Fluorescence intensity passes through a minimum with ZnS content and the dc-conductivity of the composites gradually increases with an increase in ZnS NP concentration. The I–V plot of PAZ composites indicates that the photocurrent is higher than that of the dark current at each voltage, and the device exhibits reversible turning “on” and “off” by switching the white light illumination “on” and “off”. Dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated with PAZ composites display a reasonably higher power conversion efficiency (η = 3.38%) than pure ZnS NPs. An attempt is made to shed light on the operating mechanism of the DSSC from the impedance data using a Cole–Cole plot by drawing an equivalent circuit illustrating the different electronic and ionic transport processes within the cell.
Introduction
Recently, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have turned up as the most promising systems to accomplish efficient solar-energy conversion, because they are inexpensive, flexible and easier to fabricate than silicon solar cells.1–3 TiO2 nanostructures1,4–6 have been studied extensively as the photoelectrode material in DSSCs, and the record of high power conversion efficiency of DSSC has continued for nearly two decades.7 A further increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been restricted by energy loss due to recombination between electrons and either the oxidized dye molecules or electron-accepting materials in the electrolyte during the charge transfer course.1,8–10 In TiO2 based DSSCs, the TiO2 layers are the key parameters through which the generated photoelectrons at the dye molecules are transported to the anode. During this process, a reverse charge transfer from TiO2 to the I3−/I− redox couple or to the dye may occur, causing a reduction in the PCE. Such a recombination problem is more prominent for TiO2 nanocrystals due to the deficiency of a depletion layer on the TiO2 nanocrystallite surface and becomes more severe when the photoelectrode film thickness is increased.1 Therefore, alternative materials are necessary in place of TiO2 to obtain a maximum PCE. Different 1D nanostructures such as nanotubes,1,11 nanowires,1,2,12,13 nanosheets,14,15 and nanobelts16 have been employed as functional nanostructured photoelectrodes to enhance the electron diffusion length in the photoelectrode films as they provide a direct conduction pathway for the rapid collection of photogenerated electrons. Nanostructures with a different semiconductor other than TiO2 are particularly desirable to further increase the potential of DSSCs by improving the PCE.
Conducting polymers have attracted considerable attention because of their unique properties, such as reversible convertibility between redox states, metallic conductivity, fast charge–discharge capacities, high charge transport rates and short diffusion distances for ion transport.17 Similarly, different shape and size controlled inorganic semiconductor synthesis has also occupied a vital part of materials research18–21 as these materials have potential applications in different areas.21–24 The fabrication of hybrid nanocomposites via the assembly of organic and inorganic precursors at the molecular level by controlling the morphology, interfaces and structure is a challenging task. Such hybrid materials look promising and are gaining attention because the synergism between the components often gives rise to properties that are superior to the sum of the properties of the individual constituents. Harnessing the benefits of both constituents requires excellent tuning of the spatial assembly of individual domains and their interfaces.25,26
In search of the alternative to TiO2, these types of organic–inorganic hybrids mentioned above may be useful. Already different semiconductor oxides, such as ZnO, SnO2, or Nb2O5 are employed as the photoelectrode to fabricate DSSCs.27,28 However, studies of a sulphide based metal semiconductor as a photoelectrode, as an alternative to TiO2 in DSSCs, are scarce in the literature. A reverse charge transfer in the DSSCs (recombination reaction) from TiO2 to the dye or to the redox couple may be reduced by incorporating a conductive network into the semiconductors.29–31 Hence, we have used a newly in situ synthesized nanotube morphology of a polyaniline (PANI)–zinc sulphide (ZnS) hybrid to fabricate a DSSC, because the ZnS is attached to a highly conductive PANI polymer network.
Usually, AC impedance spectroscopy is used as a non-destructive testing tool for the study of electrolytic materials,32–35 and the impedance diagrams are generally interpreted from equivalent circuit models, which can give insight into the microstructural features of a material. Presently, the mechanism of solar cell operation is understood by Cole–Cole plots of impedance values, measured at the open circuit voltage of the cell.36–39 In the impedance analysis, a small AC voltage amplitude exerts a very small perturbation, shedding light on the salient ionic and electronic processes inside the DSSC.
Here, we report the synthesis of a PANI–ZnS composite with nanotube morphology by the in situ polymerization of aniline in the presence of ZnS NPs. The new type of nanotubular PANI–ZnS composites are used to fabricate a DSSC with N719 dye [cis-di(thiocyanate)bis-(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate)-ruthenium(II) (bis tetrabutylammonium)] as a photosensitizer. A drastic enhancement in the PCE is observed with different content of ZnS in the composite. The highest PCE up to 3.38% is obtained from the composites. To our knowledge, this is the highest PCE obtained using a ZnS polymer composite to date. The probable mechanism for the nanotube morphology of the composite and the higher power conversion efficiencies of the systems are discussed accordingly. An attempt has been made to elucidate the conduction mechanism of photoelectrons in the DSSC from a Cole–Cole (Nyquist) plot of the cell obtained via impedance spectroscopy.
Experimental
Materials
Acetic acid, zinc acetate, sodium sulphide, ammonium persulphate (APS), and aniline were purchased from E. Merck, Mumbai and used as received except aniline. The middle fraction of distilled aniline was used for polymerization in this work.
Synthesis of PANI–ZnS nanocomposites
ZnS nanoparticles are synthesized by a wet chemical method using zinc acetate (Zn(Ac)2·2H2O) and sodium sulphide (Na2S) precursors (details in ESI†). The PANI–ZnS composites are synthesized by polymerization of aniline (182 μL) in the presence of different concentrations of dispersed ZnS (25, 50, 100, 250, 400 and 500 mg), and the composites produced are designated as PAZ1, PAZ2, PAZ3, PAZ4, PAZ5 and PAZ6, respectively. In a typical procedure, ZnS nanoparticles are added to 5 mL of 0.2 (M) acetic acid solution, and the mixture is ultrasonicated until the ZnS nanoparticles are fully dispersed (1 h). Then, 182 μL aniline is added to the above solution and stirred for 30 min at 20 °C to form a uniform mixture. Then 11.42 g APS is dissolved in 100 mL 0.2 (M) acetic acid solution and cooled at 20 °C. The polymerization is performed by rapid addition of 5 mL APS solution to the above monomer solution at 5 °C, and the mixture is aged for self assembly for 24 h at 5 °C. The product is dried at 60 °C for 24 h under vacuum. The yields of pure PANI, PAZ1 and PAZ4 composites are found to be 81.5%, 81.1% and 79% (w/w), respectively.
Characterization
The powder samples are spread on carbon tape and are platinum coated for evaluation of surface morphology, and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images are recorded using a JEOL, JSM-6700F FE-SEM instrument. The morphology of the samples is also studied under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEOL, 2010 EX instrument operated at a voltage of 200 kV. A dilute aqueous dispersion of the sample is dropped on a carbon coated copper grid, and after drying, it is directly observed through TEM. The tube diameters are measured at 30 places in the TEM micrographs, and average values with standard deviations are presented. The FTIR spectra of the samples are taken from the KBr pellets of the samples using a Shimadzu FTIR instrument (model 8400S). UV-vis spectra of the samples are taken in water solution (0.2 mg mL−1) using a UV-vis spectrometer (model 8453, Hewlett-Packard). The solutions are prepared by sonicating the samples in water, and the spectra are recorded by taking them in a quartz cell with a 1 mm path length. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra are recorded from aqueous dispersions of the pure and composite materials in a 1 cm quartz cell using a FluoroMax-3 (Horiba-Jobin Yvon) instrument. Wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) patterns of dried samples are recorded using a Bruker AXS diffractometer (model D8 Advance) fitted with a Lynx Eye detector. The instrument is operated at 40 kV voltage and 40 mA current. The samples are scanned from 2θ = 15–60° at a scan rate of 0.5 s per step with a step width of 0.02°. The dc-conductivity is measured by a two-probe method by sandwiching the sample between two indium–titanium oxide (ITO) conducting strips of 1 mm width placed perpendicularly. The area of the samples was 0.01 cm2, and the thickness of the samples is measured using a digital slide calipers. The dc-conductivity of the sandwiched samples is measured by an electrometer (Keithley, model 617) at 30 °C using the equation:  where ‘l’ is the thickness, ‘a’ is the area and ‘R’ is the resistance of the sample. The I–V characteristics curves of the samples are studied at 25 °C using the same samples by applying voltage from −5 to +5 V, and the current is measured at each applied voltage. Electrochemical impedance measurements are performed with a Solartron SI1260 impedance analyzer. The impedance spectra are recorded at a frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz with an oscillation voltage of 100 mV at an applied DC voltage of 0.78 V, i.e., at the open circuit voltage of the cell.
Dye-sensitized solar cell fabrication
The substrates (pure ZnS and PANI–ZnS composites) are sensitized by immersing them into a 0.5 mM ethanolic solution of the N719 dye for approximately 20 min. The sensitization time is firmly controlled to avoid the dissolution of surface Zn atoms and the formation of Zn2+–dye complexes, which may block the electron transport from the dye to the active material. The samples are then carefully rinsed with ethanol to remove the additional dye. The photoelectrodes are fabricated on low resistance ITO glass (2 × 2 cm2, 8–12 Ω) by a drop-casting method. A thin layer of graphite is coated on the ITO using a pencil tip, which acts as the counter electrode. A iodide–triiodide based electrolyte solution, consisting of 0.5 M KI and 0.05 M I2 in γ-butyrolactone, is placed on the active electrode area. The average active electrode area is around 0.68 cm2. The electrodes are separated by a 60 μm parafilm strip and are sandwiched together with clips. A small space of bare ITO glass is uncovered for wire connection on the anode. Platinum is typically used to catalyze the triiodide reduction reaction, but due to the high cost and lack of availability, it is not compatible with an inexpensive sustainable technology. Thus, the use of a low cost graphite counter electrode to get a reasonable PCE is an advantage of our system. The configuration of the solar cell is achieved by putting the samples opposite to the ITO substrate on the top of the counter electrode in a face-to-face fashion, and DSSCs are prepared with pure ZnS and PANI–ZnS composites. The cell current between the two electrodes is measured using a Keithley source meter (model 2401) by illuminating under AM 1.5G light at 100 mW cm−2 from a 150 W xenon lamp source (Newport Corp. USA; model no. 67005).
Results and discussion
Morphology
In Fig. 1 and in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the FESEM images of the ZnS NPs, pure PANI, and the four PANI–ZnS nanocomposites (PAZ1, PAZ2, PAZ3 and PAZ4) are presented. Pure ZnS has a nanosphere morphology, and the pure PANI formed in the acetic acid medium exhibits a nanotube morphology. After in situ polymerization in the presence of ZnS NPs, the composites retain the nanotube morphology of the PANI along with adherence of the ZnS NPs to the surface. However, at a higher concentration of ZnS NPs, some clusters of ZnS NPs are also noticed on the surface PANI nanotubes. The TEM images in Fig. 2 and in Fig. S2 (ESI†) also exhibit the nanotubular morphology of the PAZ1–PAZ4 composites, distinctly. The average nanotube diameters of the composites are measured to be 127 ± 2, 134 ± 2, 150 ± 3, 171 ± 2 and 199 ± 5 nm for PANI, PAZ1, PAZ2, PAZ3 and PAZ4, respectively, and the increase may be attributed to the adherence of more ZnS NPs on the surface of PANI nanotubes. The EDAX spectra of PAZ3 and PAZ4 samples (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†) demonstrate the presence of zinc, carbon, nitrogen and sulphur atoms, suggesting the presence of both ZnS and PANI in the sample.

The mechanism of the formation of PANI nanotubes in the acetic acid medium has been explained by Stejskal et al.40 The aniline oligomers (phenazine) are produced in solution during the initial stage of aniline oxidation and act as a template for the adsorption of the N-phenylphenazines produced during the induction period. The vesicle template for the growth of nanotubes is thus produced by the stacking of the short N-phenylphenazines around the phenazine nanocrystallites.29 Subsequently, the stacked N-phenylphenazines initiation centers facilitate the PANI chain growth, producing the supramolecular vesicles and thus producing the walls of nanotubes. The ZnS NPs then become adhered to the surface of PANI nanotubes through supramolecular interaction, the nature of which will be delineated through FTIR spectroscopy. In PAZ5 and PAZ6, the nanotube morphology is lost possibly due to the hindrance of vesicle template formation required for the formation of the PANI nanotubes by a large concentration of ZnS NPs. It might be also possible that for higher ZnS concentration, a large portion of APS is consumed in the reaction of ZnS forming ZnSO4 even in the mild acidic condition. This may result in a deficiency in the APS concentration to polymerise aniline into a sufficient amount of PANI, changing its tubular morphology.
Spectroscopy

FTIR spectra. 

Fig. 3 presents the FTIR spectra of the pure PANI, ZnS NPs, and PANI–ZnS nanocomposites (PAZ1, PAZ2, PAZ3 and PAZ4) to verify the formation of PANI and its interaction with ZnS in the composites. The presence of stretching bands at 1579, 1493, 1297, 1139 and 799 cm−1 reveal the formation of PANI. The characteristic stretching vibrations at 1579–1586 cm−1 arise mainly from both CN and CC stretching of the quinonoid (Q) structure, and the vibration band at 1493–1498 cm−1 is attributed to the aromatic ring stretching of the benzenoid (B) structure of doped PANI. The peak at 1297–1299 cm−1 represents the stretching band for C–N vibration of the secondary aromatic amine, and the band at ∼1139–1144 cm−1 arises due to polaron formation upon doping of PANI (Q = N+H–B or B–N+H–B).41 In ZnS the peak at 1624 cm−1 is due to adsorbed CO2 on ZnS surface.42 The C–H aromatic in-plane bending vibration occurs at the region 1040–1043 cm−1, and the out of plane deformation occurs at 799–818 cm−1, supporting the formation of PANI–ZnS composites.43,44 These characteristic bands confirm that the PANI remains in a conducting emeraldine salt (ES) phase.

The spectra for the PANI–ZnS nanocomposites show some shifts in the vibrational bands compared to those of pure PANI. As examples, both the benzenoid and quinonoid ring vibrations are shifted to a higher energy, indicating some interaction between ZnS and the electron clouds of the PANI rings. The shifting to higher energy indicates the localization of electron clouds of both the benzenoid and quinonoid rings probably due to the partial transfer of nonbonding electrons from sulphur of ZnS to the PANI chain that acts as an acceptor. This causes electron clouds of the benzenoid and quinonoid rings to become somewhat more localized, causing difficulty in the ring vibration and shifting the vibration to a higher frequency. This may be reasonable to consider that sulphur atom in ZnS is electron rich as Zn has filled d-orbitals. Therefore, partial transfer of nonbonding electrons of sulphur to the PANI chain may occur. Thus, a donor acceptor type non-bonding interaction exists in PANI–ZnS nanocomposites, and it increases with an increase in ZnS Np concentration in the composite. It is to be noted here that the –C–H out of plane vibration of the benzene ring shows a substantial shift from 799 to 818 cm−1 with an increase in the ZnS concentration and may be attributed to the closely packed ZnS nanoparticles on the PANI chains prohibiting the out of plane deformation vibration significantly. The –C–H in plane stretching vibration of the aromatic ring, however, shifts to a lower extent (1040–1043 cm−1), also indicating some hindrance experienced from the ZnS adherence on PANI nanotubes.


UV-vis spectra. 
In Fig. 4 the UV-vis spectra of PANI, ZnS NPs and all the composites are presented. In pure PANI, the absorption peaks at 357, 438 and 873 nm correspond to π–π*, polaron band to π* band and π band to localized polaron band transitions of PANI (ES), respectively.45,46 The absorption peak at 321 nm corresponds to the ZnS NPs,47 but in the case of the composites, the peak due to ZnS is not prominent for the formation of the composite. The tail of the localised polaron band of PANI is broad, and it becomes broader with increasing ZnS concentration in the composite, suggesting better delocalization of the polarons with increasing ZnS concentration.
 Fig. 4  UV-Vis spectra of (a) pure ZnS NPs, (b) PAZ6, (c) PAZ3, (d) PAZ1, and (e) pure PANI. 
A quantitative analysis of the UV-vis spectra indicate that both the polaron band to π* band and π band to localized polaron band transitions of PANI (ES) exhibit red shifts of 8–9 nm, and the π–π* absorption peak exhibits a somewhat lower red shift of 3 nm. The red shifts suggest a decrease in the respective band gap energy (Scheme 1), and the reduction of π–π* transition band may be attributed to the increase in electron density in the benzenoid and quinonoid ring due to partial transfer from a sulphur atom of ZnS. The red shift in polaron band transitions may be understood from the schematic band diagram (Scheme 1), where the shift of π- and π* bands to the localized polaron band causes the red shifts of both the transitions. The reason for the lowering of the π* band with the addition of ZnS is unknown and may be attributed to the cluster formation of the charge carriers at its excited state.

Photoluminescence (PL) spectra. 
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of PANI and PANI–ZnS nanocomposites (PAZ1, PAZ2, PAZ3, PAZ4, PAZ5 and PAZ6) are compared in Fig. 5. The emission peak of ZnS NPs is centred at 397 nm with a hump at 461 nm (inset of Fig. 5) with excitation by a radiation of λ = 320 nm. The above mentioned emission bands may be assigned to the stoichiometric vacancies or interstitial impurities in the ZnS NPs.48,49 The PL-spectrum of acetic acid doped PANI nanotubes with excitation at 320 nm shows a peak at 457 nm with negligibly small intensity compared with that of the composites, and it may be neglected for discussion in the PANI–ZnS composites. It is observed from the spectrum that the PL-intensity decreases with an increase in ZnS NP content, and the PL intensity shows an interesting variation with ZnS content, showing a minimum for the PAZ4 sample. A possible reason for the initial PL-quenching may be that the excitons of ZnS have an alternative path for decay through the PANI chains of the nanotubes, and as soon as the nanotube structure breaks at PAZ5 and PAZ6, the quenching begins to be reduced. The nanotubes have a regular arrangement of PANI chains through which the decay of excitons occurs very rapidly, but on breaking of the nanotube morphology at PAZ5 and PAZ6, the irregular arrangement of PANI chains perturb the decay paths. Therefore, the emission intensity begins to increase. The light filtering effect of PANI for quenching of PL-emission of PANI–ZnS nanocomposites may also be another cause for the apparent PL-quenching for the PAZ1 to PAZ4 samples. It is interesting to note that a red shift of the emission peak is obtained, possibly due to a decrease in the band gap. Anyway, the PL-quenching is a good indicator that the PAZ composites exhibit photovoltaic properties, and PAZ4 is expected to show better photovoltaic properties.

WAXS study. 
The powder XRD spectra of pure PANI, pure ZnS and their composites are shown in Fig. 6. The XRD spectrum of pure PANI exhibits a broad reflection at a Bragg angle (2θ) value of 23.8° corresponding to the (200) diffraction plane of the PANI ES structure of acetic acid doped PANI.50 The ZnS NPs show diffraction peaks at 2θ = 26.9°, 28.3°, 30.3°, 39.7°, 47.6°, 53.0°, and 56.7°, which are in good agreement with the standard values for ZnS reported by the JCPDS (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards, Card no. 36-1450) and can be indexed as the hexagonal Wurtzite structure with lattice constants a = 3.816 Å and c = 6.253 Å.51 However, in the XRD spectra of the composites, we observe that at 25 mg concentration of ZnS in PANI (PAZ1), the intensity of the XRD peak due to PANI has been reduced significantly and the XRD pattern of ZnS starts dominating. It is interesting to note that upon further increasing the concentration of ZnS to 250 mg (PAZ4), only the diffraction peaks due to ZnS are observed, even though the composite contains the same amount of PANI. This may be attributed to the stronger scattering power of ZnS crystals compared to that of PANI. All other samples (PAZ2 and PAZ3) with higher concentrations of ZnS also show XRD patterns due to ZnS only, and the peak positions of the composites become also shifted towards a higher Bragg angle (Table 1). In Table 1, the dhkl values of all the PAZ composites are listed, and it is apparent from the table that the dhkl values have decreased in the PAZ composites with the increase in ZnS concentration compared to that of pure ZnS. This may be attributed to the squeezing of ZnS unit cells in the presence of PANI in the PAZ composites. No definite reason for this quenching of a unit cell is known, but one probable reason may be the interaction of ZnS NPs with the acceptor PANI via partial electron transfer from the nonbonding electrons of ZnS. This transfer causes the electron clouds of filled d-shells of Zn to be quenched through a dπ–pπ type interaction, squeezing the unit cell. The XRD study thus suggests that during the formation of PAZ composites, PANI undergoes interfacial non-bonding interactions with the ZnS nanocrystallites.

DC-conductivity measurement. 
The dc-conductivities of the samples are presented in Table 2, and the conductivity of ZnS (2.0 × 10−8 S cm−1) is three orders lower than that of pure PANI nanotubes (1.63 × 10−5 S cm−1). The conductivity of the composites is also similar to that of pure PANI nanotubes, but its value gradually increases with an increase in ZnS NP concentration, even though the latter is more nonconducting than PANI. It may be reasonable to think that the small increase in conductivity may be attributed to the secondary doping of PANI by ZnS NPs40 due to the electronic interaction between the PANI and ZnS NPs as discussed above. This secondary doping gradually increases with an increase in ZnS NPs in the composites, and in the case of PAZ4, it appears to be a maximum, resulting in the highest conductivity amongst all the samples. The PAZ5 and PAZ6 samples however exhibit lower conductivity probably due to the loss of the ordered nanotube morphology.

Photoelectrochemical properties. 
The photoresponse of PANI–ZnS nanocomposites with a gold electrode has been examined from the I–V plot under dark and illuminated conditions with 1.5 AM irradiation (Fig. S5, ESI†). The I–V plot indicates that at each voltage the photocurrent is higher than that of the dark current particularly for PAZ2–PAZ4 samples. In both conditions, the semiconducting nature of the I–V curves is observed. On white light irradiation at a bias of 5 V, the photocurrent growth (for 100 s) and decay (for 100 s) are recorded at a time gap of 1 ms. Fig. 7 exhibits several such photocurrent cycles, indicating that for the sample PAZ4, the device can be reversibly turned ‘‘on’’ and ‘‘off’’ by switching the white light illumination on and off, respectively. The increase in the current after white light irradiation is 0.15 mA, and the data are quite reproducible as observed from the different cycles. From the different cycles of the photocurrent, it is clear that after forming a composite with ZnS, PAZ4 produces a stable photocurrent in a reproducible way, whereas for PAZ1, PAZ2 and PAZ3, the data are not quite reproducible (Fig. S6, ESI†). After illumination with white light, there may be some photo-degradation at lower ZnS concentrations in the composites, i.e., PAZ1, PAZ2 and PAZ3, creating hindrance in charge flow and causing a small decrease in the current with every cycle. A probable reason may be the degree of coating on the outer surface of PANI nanotubes by ZnS; at a lower concentration of ZnS, the vacant surface of PANI nanotubes where light interacts to degrade the PANI chains is greater.

Dye-sensitized solar cell. 
We have fabricated dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with the composites using N719 dye as a photosensitizer. A counter electrode was made by coating the ITO glass with a thin layer of graphite. After absorbance of the white light by the N-719 dye, the photo excited electron enters into the conduction band of the composite, and then it flows to the external circuit, from which it is re-injected into the counter-electrode. A reference DSSC with pure ZnS NPs is also constructed for comparison. The J–V characteristic curves for all the DSSCs are compared in Fig. 8. Important parameters including power conversion efficiency (PCE), open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) are summarized in Table 3. The results show that the PCE of DSSCs increases with an increase in the ZnS concentration up to 250 mg, and then it decreases with further ZnS incorporation. From the figure, it is clear that the PAZ4 composite based DSSC shows the highest short circuit current (Jsc = 7.78 mA cm−2) and highest open circuit voltage (Voc = 0.78 V) with reasonably higher power conversion efficiency (η = 3.38%) compared to those of the pure ZnS NP and other PAZ composite based DSSCs. The cell characteristics of the pure ZnS based DSSC are: Voc = 0.73 V, Jsc = 5.15 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) = 0.42 and η = 1.59%, and those of the PANI based DSSC are: Voc = 0.43 V, Jsc = 0.22 mA cm−2, FF = 0.31, and η = 0.029% (Fig. S7, ESI†). Therefore, there is a considerable increase in PCE with increasing ZnS concentration (Table 3) in the PAZ composites, and the better Jsc with the PAZ4 composite is due to the small internal resistance as evidenced by the dc conductivity measurements for PAZ samples (Table 2).52 In the PAZ composites, increasing the ZnS concentration could increase the charge recombination at the photoelectrode because of the slower reduction rate on the counter electrode,53 and breakage of the PANI network with the higher nanoparticle concentrations causes a decrease in the PCE. These results indicate that a proper amount of ZnS nanoparticle incorporation in the PANI network can significantly improve the performance of PANI–ZnS composite based DSSCs, and here it is observed that PAZ4 is the sample showing optimum photovoltaic properties. We have studied the durability of PAZ4 sample by aging at 40 °C, and we observed an unchanged value of PCE until 18 h of aging. After then, a 20% decrease in PCE occurs after 48 h of aging (Fig. S8 and Table S1, ESI†).

A schematic diagram (Scheme 2) shows the operational principle of the PANI–ZnS composite based DSSC under 1.5 AM illumination. The relative energy levels of p-type PANI and n-type ZnS (conduction band, CB, and valence band, VB) are shown. The LUMO of PANI (−2.14 eV)54 receives electrons from the photo excited dye, and the excited electrons can pass through the PANI tube to the conduction band of ZnS (−1.75 eV)55 without any obstruction. Because the ZnS is adhered to the conducting PANI tube, the collected electrons can, therefore, transport from PANI to ZnS to ITO quickly (Scheme 2). The presence of the conductive PANI nanotube against the ZnS NPs may decrease the probability of a recombination reaction. This is the probable reason why the composite-based DSSCs yield a reasonably higher short circuit current (Jsc = 7.78 mA cm−2) than that of ZnS NP-based DSSC (Jsc = 5.15 mA cm−2), as a reverse charge transfer in the DSSCs (recombination reaction) from ZnS to the dye or to the redox couple (I3−/I−) may severely reduce the cell efficiency.56 Thus, the Jsc as well as the overall power conversion efficiency (η) are increased.56 Also, in all of the PAZ1–4 samples, the nanotube morphology provides a high surface area, which also helps the dye to be adsorbed more efficiently than on the PAZ5 and PAZ6 samples, causing a better power conversion efficiency.

Impedance spectroscopy. 
To understand the mechanism of photoelectron conduction within the photovoltaic cell, we have recorded the impedance spectra upon the application of open circuit voltage (0.78 V) for the PAZ4 sample. Fig. 9 shows a Cole–Cole plot for the PAZ4 based DSSC device. Three semicircles are observed in the measured frequency range of 1–106 Hz. In our analysis, the three semicircles in the frequency regions of 105–106, 102–105, and 1–102 Hz may be attributed to three different charge transfer processes in the cell. In the high-frequency region, the first semicircular shape (Z1) may be assigned to impedances related to charge transport at the graphite counter electrode. In the middle-frequency region, the second semicircle (Z2) may correspond to that of the PAZ/dye/electrolyte interface, and in the low frequency region, the semicircular shape (Z3) corresponds to the iodine ion diffusion within the electrolyte. Each of the semicircles is analyzed using the Z-view software to obtain different resistance and capacitance values for the different parts of the DSSC. From the Z1, Z2, and Z3 semicircles, the respective resistance of the PAZ/electrolyte interface (Rrc), the graphite/electrolyte interfacial resistance (Rg) and the iodine ion diffusion resistance (Rd) have been evaluated. The resistance elements Rrc, Rg, and Rd are estimated to be 1 kΩ cm−2, 0.2 kΩ cm−2 and 0.5 kΩ cm−2, respectively. The electron transport resistance of the working electrode to the counter electrode (Rs), which occurs in the very high frequency region (>106), could not be measured due to the limitations of the instrument. The capacitance of the elements Z1 (defined as capacitance of counter electrode/electrolyte interface, Cg), Z2 (defined as chemical capacitance, Cμ), and Z3 (iodine ion diffusion capacitance, CD) are estimated to be 20 nF, 5 μF and 0.3 nF, respectively. The lifetime (τ) of photoelectrons can be measured using the formulaτ = Rrc × Cμand the photoelectron lifetime is calculated to be 5 ms. This lifetime value is 40–50 times lower than that of an organic silane modified TiO2 solar cell.57 This indicates that photoelectrons undergo back reaction and recombination to a greater extent, decreasing the cell efficiency.
 Fig. 9  Electrochemical impedance spectra of PAZ4 based DSSC. 
From the above results, we have drawn an equivalent circuit for the entire solar cell, including resistance and capacitance values for each process in Fig. 10. The proposed equivalent circuit is nearly similar to that of a conventional solar cell with the exception of having large values of capacitance. Since the solar cell works under direct current conditions, the effect of capacitance can be neglected during solar cell operation. Thus, this equivalent circuit may offer insight into the operating mechanism of DSSCs.

Conclusion
The PAZ1, PAZ2, PAZ3, and PAZ4 composites retain the nano-tubular morphology of PANI where ZnS NPs remain adhered to the nanotube surface of PANI, but in the PAZ5 and PAZ6 samples, the nanotube morphology is lost possibly due to the hindrance of vesicle template formation required for the formation of nanotubes by the large concentration of ZnS NPs. An interfacial non-bonding interaction exists between PANI and ZnS NPs in the nanocomposites through the sulphur atom of ZnS and doped PANI chains through a donor–acceptor type interaction, and it increases with an increase in ZnS NP concentration in the composite. The squeezing of ZnS unit cells in the PAZ composites is possibly due to the partial electron transfer from the nonbonding electrons of ZnS to PANI, and it causes the electron clouds of filled d-shells of Zn to be quenched through a dπ–pπ type interaction. In the PAZ4 sample, the PL-intensity is at a minimum with a red shift of the emission peak, suggesting the composite may exhibit good photovoltaic properties. The doping of PANI increases with the increase of ZnS concentration, and the dc-conductivity of the composites gradually increases with the increase in ZnS NP concentration due to secondary doping. At each voltage, the PAZ composites exhibit a higher photocurrent than dark current, and the PAZ4 device exhibits a reversible turning ‘‘on’’ and ‘‘off’’ by switching the white light illumination “on” and “off”, respectively, with an increase in the current of 0.15 mA after white light irradiation. Among the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) fabricated with the composites using N719 dye as a photosensitizer, the PAZ4-based DSSC shows the highest short circuit current (Jsc = 7.78 mA cm−2) and highest fill factor (FF = 0.55) with a reasonably higher power conversion efficiency (η = 3.38%) compared to those of pure ZnS NPs and other PAZ composites. The operation of the DSSC has been understood from the Cole–Cole plot and an equivalent circuit model characterizing the different electronic and ionic transport processes within the cell.
