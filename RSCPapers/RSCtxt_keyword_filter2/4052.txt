    , Accepted 1st June 2016First published on 2nd June 2016AbstractIn this study, a lithium (Li) doped aqueous solution processed zinc oxide (ZnO) layer was employed as the electron buffer layer for inverted organic solar cells (OSCs). It was found that compared with the pure ZnO buffer layer, application of the 5% Li-doped ZnO buffer layer enhanced the open circuit voltage (Voc) from 0.57 V to 0.62 V and the fill factor (FF) from 0.61 to 0.67, resulting in a better device performance. The increased Voc resulted from the increased built-in field and decreased work function of the cathode, and the improved Jsc and FF were due to the significantly increased charge carrier mobility, enhanced charge carrier collection efficiency and reduced charge carrier recombination. Based on the poly(3-hexylthiophene):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM) system, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 3.9% was obtained for the device with the 5% Li-doped ZnO buffer layer, which is much higher than that obtained with the pure ZnO buffer layer (3.2%). When using the poly(4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl):[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PTB-7:PC71BM) system as the active layer, the PCE was enhanced to 8.4% for the Li–ZnO (5%) layer compared to pristine ZnO with a PCE of 7.5%. These results suggest that the Li-doped ZnO layer can act as a good electron buffer layer for inverted organic solar cells.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted much attention due to their potential for a low-cost and large-area fabrication process, light weight physical feature, and compatibility with roll-to-roll fabrication.1–7 Recently reported OSCs with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) of donor–accepter blend have achieved a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of above 10%.8–11 Generally, there are two structures mainly used in OSCs, i.e. inverted and conventional structures. Compared with the conventional structure, inverted organic solar cells, which use indium-tin-oxide (ITO) as the cathode and a high-work-function metal such as silver (Ag) or gold (Au) as the top anode, have been considered as an advantageous approach for improving the cell stability and the roll-to-roll fabrication process.12–15 In most conventional structures, holes are collected by a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxithiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole transport layer, and electrons are collected by a low-work-function metal top cathode such as aluminum (Al) or calcium (Ca). However, the acidic PEDOT:PSS layer can cause interface instability through indium diffusion into the active layer due to the etching of the ITO anode, and the top low work-function metal can be easily oxidized in the air, resulting in poor stability.16–19 In the inverted OSC, the active layer is usually sandwiched between two metal oxide transport layers and a high-work-function metal acts as the top anode, so that the commonly used hole transport layer PEDOT:PSS and the low-work-function metal top cathode in the conventional structure can both be avoided, resulting in good stability.15–19
In inverted OSCs, an electron selective layer is introduced to form an ohmic contact to decrease or eliminate the electron-extraction barrier between the ITO cathode and the active layer (usually the blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM)). Metal oxides such as zinc oxide (ZnO), titanium oxide (TiOx) and aluminium oxide (Al2O3) have been widely studied to work as the electron selective layer in inverted OSCs.20–25 In particular, ZnO has been considered as a good candidate because of its beneficial properties such as high electron mobility and high transparency in the visible wavelength range, as well as compatibility with roll-to-roll fabrication onto the flexible substrate due to the low temperature, low-cost and simple solution process.26–28 Several solution processed ZnO fabrication techniques have been studied, such as the sol–gel, nanocrystalline ZnO particle and aqueous solution routes.15,26,29 Since high temperature processed sol–gel based ZnO (usually ≥300 °C) is not compatible with flexible substrates, and the colloidal processed nc-ZnO possesses environmentally sensitive electrical performance in an ambient atmosphere, the aqueous solution of an ammine–zinc complex has been reported to be a promising technique which could avoid these problems to afford low temperature conversion to dense ZnO thin films.29–34
Inverted OSCs based on ZnO electron selective layers deposited by aqueous solutions of an zinc–ammine complex have been investigated and have shown efficient performance.26,31 Kim et al. has reported the effects of the aqueous solution processed ZnO electron selective layer at different annealing temperatures on the inverted OSC device performance, showing that the annealing temperature for the ZnO layer could be as low as 80 °C.35 Meantime, aluminum doped ZnO, alkaline earth metals (such as Mg, Sr, and Ba) doped ZnO, and other doped ZnO layers have been reported in organic light-emitting diodes and solar cell devices.36–38 It was found that doped ZnO have a higher charge carrier mobility and preferable energy level alignment, which facilitated the electron injection and transport, hence, the photovoltaic efficiency was enhanced. Compared to ZnO and alkaline earth metal doped ZnO, the Li doped ZnO exhibited much higher charge carrier mobility, it may be expected that the charge carrier transport and extraction would also be further enhanced, leading to higher photovoltaic performance.
In this paper, we employed a lithium (Li) doped aqueous solution-processed ZnO layer as the electron selective layer in inverted OSCs based on P3HT:PC61BM and Poly(4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl):[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PTB-7:PC71BM) blends. The effects of the ZnO selective layer with different Li doping ratios on film properties and OSC device performance have been studied. It was found that with an appropriate Li-doped ZnO electron selective layer, both open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) are improved, resulting in a better device performance compared with the pure ZnO electron selective layer. The increased Voc resulted from the decreased surface work function of the cathode and increased built-in field, and the improved short circuit current (Jsc) and FF were due to the decreased charge carrier recombination because of the significantly increased charge carrier mobility of the suitable Li-doped ZnO buffer layer and enhanced charge collection efficiency. These results suggest that the Li-doped ZnO layer can be a promising electron selective layer for inverted OSCs.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a and b illustrate the schematic device structure and the band diagram of the inverted OSCs, respectively. The OPV cells were fabricated with the inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO(Li-ZnO)/P3HT:PC61BM/MoO3/Ag. The ZnO interlayer reduces the electron extraction barrier from PCBM to the ITO electrode, which is beneficial for high-performance inverted OSCs. The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the P3HT:PC61BM devices incorporating ZnO buffer layers without and with different ratios of Li-doping are shown in Fig. 2, and extracted device parameters are summarized in Table 1. Compared with the device based on the pure ZnO buffer layer, Voc increases from 0.57 V to 0.62 V with the increased Li-doping ratio from 1% to 10%. The increased Voc is ascribed from decreased work-function and increased built-in field.24 As Voc is related to the photon energy loss (defined as Eg − qVoc), the higher Voc means smaller photon energy loss occurred in the Li–ZnO device, which may be caused by the reduced interface related recombination or energy loss. The Jsc increases from 9.35 mA cm−2 to 9.76 mA cm−2 with the increased Li-doping ratio from 1% to 3%. Upon further increasing the Li-doping ratio, Jsc, however, decreases to 9.46 mA cm−2 and 9.28 mA cm−2 for 5% and 10% Li-doping ratios, respectively. Since the Jsc value is critically related to the ZnO thin film mobility, however, at a higher doping ratio of Li, the excess Li becomes the scattering center which will decrease the charge carrier mobility. Meanwhile, this is also consistent with the change in series resistance (Rs). Rs decreases when the Li doping ratio increased to 3%, and increases and becomes larger upon further increasing the doping ratio. FF has a similar trend to Voc. FF increases from 0.61 to 0.67 with the increased Li-doping ratio from 1% to 5%. The increased FF is related to the reduced charge recombination and increased shunt resistance (Rsh). A device power conversion efficiency of 3.9% was obtained when the Li-doping ratio was 5%, which is much higher than the device with a pure ZnO buffer layer (3.2%). Meanwhile, this result is comparable or is even better than other doped ZnO based solar cell devices,38 and can be further enhanced through combination of inorganic solar cells like GaAs based solar cells.39 To understand the mechanism of the improvement in the photovoltaic efficiency of devices with Li–ZnO, the dark J–V curves of devices were recorded. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the 5% Li–ZnO based device improves the current injection under the forward bias and suppresses the leakage current under reverse bias, leading to the Li–ZnO based device showing a better diode behaviour and larger rectification ratio compared to the ZnO based device. In order to gain additional insights into the improved FF and PCE for the Li–ZnO device, the photocurrent (Jph) as a function of effective voltage (Veff) is plotted. Jph is obtained by subtracting the current density in the dark from the current density under illumination. The Veff which reflects the internal field in the device, is defined as Veff = Vo − Va, where Vo is the compensation voltage defined as the voltage where Jph = 0 and Va is the applied bias.40,41 As shown in Fig. 2d, Jph becomes saturated at higher voltage (Veff > 1.2 V). However, at lower Veff, the device based on Li–ZnO showed a much higher Jph from the open-circuit condition to the short-circuit condition. Because the charge collection probability (PC) could be calculated by normalizing Jph with Jph,sat (Jph/Jph,sat), then larger PC could be obtained for the Li–ZnO based device since the Jph,sat values are similar. These results indicate that higher charge collection efficiency and lower field-dependent recombination loss were achieved by Li–ZnO based devices, which is responsible for the higher FF and PCE for Li–ZnO devices. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of these devices are shown in Fig. 2e. For devices with the pure ZnO layer and with the 3% Li-doped ZnO buffer layer, the maximum IPCE is 64% and 68% at the wavelength of 550 nm, respectively. The integrated IPCE values are all in good agreement with the measured Jsc.

The stability of P3HT:PC61BM solar cells using Li–ZnO as interfacial layers has also been investigated. The stability of the inverted solar cells was checked by storing the device under the dry ambient air conditions. The normalized PCEs as a function of the storage time of the unencapsulated cells under the dry air conditions are shown in Fig. 2f. The PCE of ZnO-based cell had a faster degradation, with only 82% remaining after 30 days. The PCEs of Li–ZnO based cells had a slower degrading trend, indicating much improved stability. The PCEs remained at approximately 91% of the original values after 30 days. The improved stability is also related to the good stability of Li doped ZnO films.42
The Li doped ZnO system was also applied to PTB-7:PC71BM based inverted OSCs to test its feasibility in other material systems. Table 1 contains the summary of the cell performances of inverted solar cells based on PTB-7:PC71BM incorporated with ZnO without/with Li doping as the cathode interfacial layers, and the J–V characteristics of these devices are presented in Fig. 3a. A high PCE of 8.4% for the Li–ZnO (5%) based device was obtained with Voc of 0.75 V, Jsc of 16.54 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.68, which is much higher than that of the cells based on ZnO (PCE = 7.5%, Voc = 0.73 V, Jsc = 16.10 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.64). The PCE enhancement is mainly due to the increase in Voc and FF. The IPCE spectrum is shown in Fig. 3b. The integrated IPCE value is in good agreement with the measured Jsc.

In order to illustrate the above device performance, the ZnO thin films without and with Li doping were investigated in detail. Firstly, the microstructure of the thin films produced was checked by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and did not exhibit obvious crystallization peaks by XRD measurements, indicating the amorphous nature of the ZnO thin films (Fig. S2, ESI†). It has been reported that the conversion temperature of aqueous solution processed ZnO could be as low as 80 °C.35 In order to check the ZnO formation, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out and good quality ZnO and Li-doped ZnO layers were found by a large amount of O–Zn bonds formed according to the O1s binding energy in the XPS spectra (Fig. S3, ESI†). The Li doping in ZnO was further confirmed by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) measurements. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the Li ion could be well observed homogeneously throughout the film, showing good evidence that Li was incorporated into the ZnO thin film.
The surface morphologies of the ZnO films (on ITO coated glass substrates) without and with different Li-doping ratios were measured by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) as shown in Fig. 4. The roughness mean square (RMS) values were 2.08 nm, 2.26 nm, 2.17 nm, 2.46 nm, and 2.92 nm for the ZnO films without and with 1%, 3%, 5% and 10% Li-doping ratios, respectively. As can be seen, the surface roughness increases with the increased Li-doping ratio. The RMS increases as the increase in Li-doping due to the increase in the surface undulation and the crystal size, which was consistent with previous reports.43,44 It has been reported that an appropriate increase in surface roughness enhances Jsc due to the improvement in the contact between the ZnO buffer layer and the photoactive layer.45 However, the ZnO surface traps also increase with the increased surface roughness due to increased scattering centers, causing decreased charge carrier mobilities and increased charge recombination, hence, decreased Jsc.26 The surface properties after Li doping were further checked by water contact angle measurements, and a slightly more hydrophobic surface (contact angle of 44° compared to 38°) was achieved by Li doping, which could induce a more favourable contact between the organic active layer and the ZnO interlayer.36

The transmittance of the ZnO electron selective layer was investigated by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Fig. 5a shows the UV-visible wavelength optical transmittance spectra of the bare ITO film and ITO coated with ZnO films without and with different Li-doping ratios. As can be seen, all ZnO/ITO films have good transmittance in the visible wavelength range. These results indicate that the ZnO interlayer has a minimal effect on the light absorption of the active layer. The optical band gap of each ZnO selective layer was determined from the absorption coefficient of ZnO selective layers coated on quartz substrates, as shown in Fig. 5b. From the transmittance spectra, the absorption coefficient as a function of photon energy has been plotted in Fig. 5c, and the optical band gap of each ZnO film can be read from it. It can be seen that compared with a pure ZnO film, a broadening of the optical band gap for Li-doped ZnO was obviously observed. The band gap of the ZnO film increased from 3.378 eV to 3.388 eV, 3.396 eV, 3.413 eV and 3.419 eV for 1% Li-doped ZnO, 3% Li-doped ZnO, 5% Li-doped ZnO, and 10% Li-doped ZnO film, respectively. The widening of the optical band gap could be explained by Burstein–Moss effects.46 In the Li doped ZnO films, the Li ions located at interstitial sites in the ZnO matrix cause an increase in the donor electrons, and the excess donor electrons cause the widening of optical band gap.43 The increased band gap after Li-doping can result in an upward shift of the conduction band to the vacuum level, which could be a possible reason for enhanced Voc in the Li–ZnO based devices.

In order to further confirm these results, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were carried out to study the Fermi energy level of the ZnO interlayer before and after Li doping. As can be seen from Fig. 6, the Fermi level relative to the vacuum level decreased from 4.00 eV to 3.85 eV for ZnO without and with a 5% Li doping ratio. The valence band maximum (VBM) for ZnO without and with the 5% Li doping ratio is 3.28 eV and 3.40 eV, respectively. According to the optical band gap, the conduction band minimum (CBM) could be calculated as 3.90 eV and 3.84 eV, respectively. The upshifted Fermi level indicates a high carrier concentration in the Li-doped ZnO films. The decreased work function of the Li-doped ZnO interlayer could further enhance the built-in field in the OSCs, which is responsible for the Voc enhancement.

Since the solar cell performance especially Jsc is largely dependent on the electrical properties of ZnO films, it was essential to investigate the charge carrier mobility versus Li doping. Studies on field-effect transistors were conducted to evaluate the electrical properties of different ZnO films without/with the Li dopant. As shown in Fig. 7 and Table 1, all the films without/with Li doping showed good transistor operation. The pristine ZnO exhibited a charge carrier mobility (μe) of 0.4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a threshold voltage (Vth) of 28 V. The charge carrier mobility was significantly enhanced by Li doping treatment. The ZnO film with a 3% ratio of Li resulted in the best device performance with a μe of 1.4 cm2 V−1 s−1, on/off ratio of 107, and Vth of 24 V. The enhanced mobility could be explained by the doping mechanism in which the Li occupies the interstitial site and produces one free electron (Li → Lii+ + e−).47 Hence, the carrier concentration and electron mobility increased. The good electron mobility ensures the Li–ZnO as an effective electron buffer layer for electron-transportation/extraction in inverted OSCs. This result is in accordance with the solar cell results, which gives a highest Jsc value of 9.76 mA cm−2. High charge carrier mobility and small threshold voltage corresponding to the low surface traps both contribute to a high short circuit current. Following that, the samples with Li-doped ZnO films all give better performance compared to the as-prepared samples.

Experimental
Inverted solar cell fabrication and characterization
The cells were fabricated on ITO-coated glass substrates supplied by Xin Yan Technology Ltd. with a surface roughness (RMS) of 2–3 nm, and were cleaned via a routine solvent ultrasonic cleaning, sequentially with detergent, de-ionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in an ultrasonic bath for 15 minutes each. For the ZnO layer preparation, firstly, ZnO nanopowders (Sigma Aldrich) were directly dissolved in ammonia solution (0.1 M). For Li doped ZnO, lithium hydroxide (LiOH) with different volume ratios in DI water (10 mg mL−1) were added to the ZnO solution. The solution was stirred overnight to yield a homogenous, clear, and transparent solution. After ZnO particles were totally dissolved, the ZnO solution was spin-coated on the top of ITO substrates which were first treated by 10 min Ar plasma at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and thermally annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. Following that, an active layer was deposited on top of the ZnO layer by spin-coating a solution of the P3HT (1-material) and PC61BM (Nano-C) blend with a weight ratio of 1:1 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (20 mg ml−1) at 500 rpm for 130 s in a nitrogen (N2) glovebox (∼180 nm thickness), and the active layer was dried for 2 hours and then pre-annealed at 140 °C for 10 minutes. Another active layer was deposited on the top of the ZnO layer by spin-coating a solution of PTB-7 (1-material) and PC71BM (Nano-C) blend with a weight ratio of 1:1.5 in chlorobenzene (10 mg ml−1) at 1200 rpm for 60s in N2 glove box, and the active layer was slowly dried for 4 hours. Finally, a MoO3 layer (6 nm) and a Ag layer (100 nm) were deposited on top of the active layer by using vacuum thermal evaporation. The device area is defined as 9 mm2 by using a shadow mask. The current density versus voltage characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 parameter analyzer in the dark and under a simulated light (AM 1.5G) with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 which is calibrated by silicon reference cell. Incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed under short-circuit conditions with a lock-in amplifier (SR510, Stanford Research System) at a chopping frequency of 280 Hz during illumination with a monochromatic light from an arc lamp.
Electrical characterization of ZnO films
To evaluate the charge transport properties of Li doped ZnO, ZnO thin film transistors with a bottom-gate top-contact structure were employed. A heavily doped p-type Si wafer (purchased from Silicon Quest International, Inc.) served as the gate electrode and 200 nm thermally grown SiO2 was used as the dielectric layer. Prior to spin coating ZnO precursors, the Si/SiO2 substrates were first cleaned with acetone, IPA, and de-ionized water, and then treated with Ar plasma to facilitate the thin film formation. After that, ZnO precursors with different Li doping ratios were spin coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s to obtain ZnO thin films around 10–15 nm. Following that, the substrates were pre-annealed at 150 °C for 20 min. Finally, Al layers, as the source and drain electrodes (W = 4000 μm, L = 100 μm), were deposited on the ZnO thin film with a shadow mask. The transistors were characterized using a Keithley 4200 parameter analyzer in the N2-filled glovebox. The field-effect mobility of the fabricated transistor was extracted using the following equation in the saturation region from the gate sweep: ID = W/(2L)Ciμ(VG − VT)2, where ID is the drain current in the saturation region, μ is the field-effect mobility, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer (SiO2, 200 nm, Ci = 17 nF cm−2), VG and VT are gate voltage and threshold voltage, and W and L are channel width and length, respectively.
Surface characterization of ZnO thin films
Surface work functions of the ITO cathode with ZnO films were characterized by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) conducted on an Escalab 220i system in ultrahigh vacuum and He I (21.2 eV) as the excitation source. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were carried out using the Escalab 220i, with monochromatic Al-Ka (1486.6 eV) as the radiation source. The ZnO film microstructure was characterized by the two-dimensional X-ray diffraction (2D XRD) on the Bruker-AXS D8 DISCOVER GADDS. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) analysis was performed using a TOF-SIMS IV (ION-TOF). The transmittance spectra of the ZnO films deposited onto glass substrates were characterized using an UV-3600 Shimadzu UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer. The surface morphology and roughness of the ZnO films deposited on the ITO substrate were measured by tapping-mode Atomic Force Microscopy (TM-AFM) which was performed on a Bruker ICON-PKG atomic force microscope (AFM).
Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and fabricated high performance inverted OSCs by employing low temperature aqueous solution processed Li–ZnO film with high transparency, good electron transporting properties, and optimized energy levels as the electron buffer layer. By incorporating Li–ZnO thin film as the buffer layer, combined with PTB-7:PC71BM as the active layer, a PCE up to 8.4% has been achieved, which is much better than that of the control device with a pure ZnO buffer layer under same conditions. This study indicates that the Li–ZnO interlayer significantly enhanced charge collection efficiency and reduced charge carrier recombination, which is beneficial for high performance inverted organic solar cells.
