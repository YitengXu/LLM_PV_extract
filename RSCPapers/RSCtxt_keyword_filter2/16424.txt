    , Accepted 7th October 2020First published on 8th October 2020AbstractA ternary strategy has been demonstrated as a promising method to further boost the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, an efficient polymer donor S3 was synthesized and incorporated into a PM6:Y6 system to fabricate ternary OSCs. S3 possesses complementary absorption spectra and good compatibility with PM6, which is beneficial to fine-tune the photon harvesting and morphology of the ternary blend films, resulting in simultaneous enhancement of the short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF). In addition, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of S3 is slightly lower than that of PM6, which enables lower nonradiative energy loss in ternary OSCs compared with that of PM6-based binary OSCs, leading to higher open-circuit voltage (VOC). The optimized ternary OSCs with 20 wt% S3 in the donors achieve a PCE of 17.53%, which should be among the highest values of ternary OSCs. This work provides an effective approach to fabricate high-performance ternary OSCs by synergizing two well-matched polymer donors.

Broader context
In recent years, the ternary strategy has attracted tremendous interest due to its versatile advantages for improving the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). The ternary OSCs based on two non-fullerene acceptors have achieved remarkable progress with power conversion efficiency (PCE) above 17%. However, efficient ternary OSCs with two polymer donors are rarely reported due to the inferior compatibility of polymers and shortage of efficient polymer donors to match with non-fullerene acceptors. In this work, an efficient polymer donor S3 was synthesized and incorporated into the PM6:Y6 system to fabricate ternary OSCs. The optimized ternary OSCs achieve a PCE of 17.53%, which should be among the highest reported values for ternary OSCs. This work further demonstrates the ternary strategy as a universal method to improve the performance of OSCs, also keeping the simple fabrication technology. The ternary strategy should be an efficient solution for the industrialization of OSCs with high efficiency and low cost.

Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) with a single bulk-heterojunction structure have achieved significant progress thanks to the continuous development of materials and device engineering, especially for the evolution of small molecular non-fullerene acceptors.1–9 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs has exceeded 17% by choosing matched donor and acceptor materials in the active layer.10–17 The ternary strategy is a promising method to further boost OSC performance via synchronously utilizing the advantages of active layer materials.18–22 Recently, a series of efficient ternary OSCs were presented with small molecule Y6 or its derivatives as an acceptor, polymer PM6 or PM7 as a donor and a small molecular acceptor as the third component.12,23–30 It should be noted that incorporating the third component with the host system causes a much more complicated blend morphology. The incompatible materials will result in severe molecular disorder and strong phase separation, harming the performance of OSCs.31–33 Two polymers generally exhibit inferior compatibility due to the larger repulsive intermolecular interaction in comparison to two small molecules, which is the main reason why ternary OSCs with two polymer donors show infrequent success relative to the OSCs with two small molecular acceptors. As summarized in Table 1, the ternary OSCs based on two small molecular acceptors have achieved remarkable results, while the ternary OSCs based on two polymer donors with over 17% PCE are rarely reported. Besides good compatibility of active layer materials, the bandgap and energy level of the third component should also be synthetically deliberated to optimize the photon harvesting of the active layer and avoid forming deep charge traps.34–38 The few numbers of efficient polymer donors for matching non-fullerene acceptors make the third component selection more difficult to design high-performance ternary OSCs with two polymer donors. There is ample room to improve the performance of OSCs by employing a ternary strategy with two polymer donors.

This work




In this work, a polymer donor named as S3 was synthesized and incorporated into the PM6:Y6 system for fabricating high-performance ternary OSCs.45,46 Employing S3 as the third component was motivated by the good compatibility and complementary absorption spectra of the two donors, as well as the slightly lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of S3 relative to PM6. The two donors prefer to form an alloy-like state with well-developed film morphology in ternary blend films due to their good compatibility, resulting in enhanced charge generation and extraction. Furthermore, the complementary absorption spectra of the two donors are beneficial for achieving enhanced photon harvesting of ternary OSCs relative to binary OSCs. The slightly lower HOMO energy level of S3 helps the ternary OSCs to realize smaller nonradiative energy loss (Eloss) than that of PM6-based binary OSCs. The optimized ternary OSCs with 20 wt% S3 in the donors achieve a PCE of 17.53%, benefiting from the simultaneously enhanced short-circuit current density (JSC) of 25.86 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 79.17% and open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.856 V in comparison to PM6-based binary OSCs. The PCE of 17.53% and FF of 79.17% should be among the highest values of ternary OSCs. This work provides an effective strategy to further improve the performance of OSCs by employing two well-matched polymer donors.
Results and discussion
The chemical structures of PM6, S3 and Y6 are shown in Fig. 1a. Polymer donor S3 was synthesized by random polymerization based on Moon's pioneer work47 and our previous work.48,49 Here, the content of chlorinated thiophene units in S3 is 20% rather than 80%, which is different with the polymer donor synthesized by Moon and co-workers. Two polymer donors PM6 and S3 should possess good compatibility because of their very similar chemical structures, leading to an alloy-like state of the two donors in ternary blend films. The alloy-like state of the two donors is beneficial for optimizing film morphology and donor energy level.23,34 To confirm the good compatibility of the two donors, contact angle measurements of neat films were performed based on liquid drops of water and ethylene glycol (EG), as exhibited in Fig. S1 (ESI†). According to Wu's model,50 the surface tension (γ) was calculated to be 29.2 mN m−1, 28.8 mN m−1 and 30.6 mN m−1 for PM6, S3 and Y6, respectively (Table S1, ESI†). The compatibility between two different materials can be evaluated by employing the equation: (1)where γA–B represents interfacial tension between material A and B. γA and γB are the surface tension of A and B, respectively. The superscript d and p represent the dispersion and polar components calculated using the contact angle with water and EG. The interfacial tension γPM6–S3 ≈ 0.05 mN m−1 is much smaller than γPM6–Y6 ≈ 2.03 mN m−1 and γS3–Y6 ≈ 1.78 mN m−1, suggesting the good compatibility between PM6 and S3.26,51Fig. 1b exhibits the absorption spectra of the used materials. The small molecular acceptor Y6 shows strong absorption in the range from 600 nm to 900 nm, which well complements the absorption spectra of the two donors. The absorption spectrum of S3 is blue shift about 10 nm in comparison to PM6, which should be beneficial for enhancing the photon harvesting of the ternary blend films by adjusting the content of S3 in the donors. The HOMO level of S3 is marginally lower than that of PM6 (Fig. 1c and Fig. S2, ESI†), which helps the ternary OSCs to achieve higher VOCs in comparison to PM6-based binary OSCs. To investigate the effect of S3 on the performance of ternary OSCs, a series of binary and ternary OSCs were fabricated in a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDIN/Al (Fig. 1d). The S3 content in the donors was adjusted from 10 wt% to 50 wt% and the weight ratio of donor to acceptor is kept constant as 1:1.2 in all binary and ternary OSCs. The detailed fabrication and characterization of OSCs are described in the ESI.†

The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of OSCs were measured under AM 1.5G illumination with 100 mW cm−2 light intensity. Fig. S3 (ESI†) displays the detailed J–V curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of all binary and ternary OSCs. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The JSCs are gradually increased to 25.86 mA cm−2 by incorporating 20 wt% S3 in the donors and then decreased with more S3 incorporation. The increase of JSC should be attributed to the optimized photon harvesting and morphology of ternary blend films by adjusting the S3 content. The FF exhibits a similar variation tendency in comparison to that of JSC. Ternary OSCs with 20 wt% S3 in the donors achieve a FF of 79.17%, which is one of the highest values for ternary OSCs, suggesting the well-developed morphology of the ternary blend films. As expected, the VOC is monotonously increased along with the increase of S3 content, which should be benefited from the lower HOMO level of S3 and the good compatibility of the two donors. The tunable VOC of the ternary OSCs suggests that the two donors prefer to form an alloy-like state with varied HOMO levels depending on the S3 content in the ternary blend films. Since the total Eloss is determined by the difference between the optical gap (Eg) and the VOC (Eloss = Eg − qVOC), the higher VOCs indicate lower Eloss in the ternary OSCs due to the similar Eg of the binary and ternary blend films. Detailed studies about the Eloss of OSCs will be discussed below. A PCE of 17.53% is achieved from the optimized ternary OSCs with 20 wt% S3 in the donors, which should be among the highest PCE values of ternary OSCs. It should be highlighted that the PCE of 16.67% and FF of 75.46% still can be achieved in ternary OSCs with 50 wt% S3, illustrating the excellent tolerance of PM6 and S3 for fabricating efficient ternary OSCs. Detailed discussions about the effect of S3 on performance are carried out based on three typical OSCs, including the optimized ternary OSCs and two binary OSCs.

The J–V curves of the typical OSCs are displayed in Fig. 2a. The PM6-based binary OSCs achieve a PCE of 16.08% with a JSC of 25.13 mA cm−2, a FF of 75.85% and a VOC of 0.844 V. A similar PCE of 16.12% is obtained from S3-based binary OSCs with a JSC of 25.26 mA cm−2, a FF of 71.69% and a VOC of 0.890 V. Compared with the two binary OSCs, the optimized ternary OSCs achieve a higher JSC of 25.86 mA cm−2 and FF of 79.17%, as well as a middle VOC of 0.856 V, resulting in an increased PCE of 17.53%. The average PCE of the optimized ternary OSCs is 17.38% according to 30 individual OSCs (Table S2, ESI†), confirming the positive effect of S3 on performance improvement of OSCs. The performance improvement should be mainly attributed to the enhanced photon harvesting, exciton dissociation, charge transport and collection, as well as the decreased Eloss in the ternary OSCs relative to the PM6-based binary OSCs. The corresponding EQE spectra are shown in Fig. 2b. The optimized ternary OSCs exhibit slightly higher EQE values in the short wavelength range from 400 nm to 600 nm than those of PM6-based binary OSCs. The slightly increased EQE values of the optimized ternary OSCs should be partly attributed to enhanced photon harvesting from S3, which can be confirmed from the EQE values of S3-based binary OSCs in the short wavelength range. Obviously, higher EQE values can be observed from the optimized ternary OSCs in the long wavelength range from 600 nm to 800 nm in comparison to those of two binary OSCs. The increased EQE values of the optimized ternary OSCs in the long wavelength range indicate the efficient exciton dissociation, charge transport and collection, which are supported by the higher JSC of 25.86 mA cm−2 and FF of 79.17% in the optimized ternary OSCs. The charge generation and extraction of the ternary OSCs can be simultaneously optimized by incorporating 20 wt% S3 in the donors, leading to performance improvement of the ternary OSCs.

To gain more insight into the effect of S3 on charge generation and extraction in ternary OSCs, the photocurrent density versus effective voltage (Jph–Veff) curves of typical OSCs were investigated and are exhibited in Fig. 2c. Here, Jph is defined as JL–JD, where JL and JD are the current density under standard illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is determined by V0–Va, V0 is the voltage where Jph = 0, and Va is the applied voltage. The optimized ternary OSCs exhibit a higher saturated current density (Jsat) of 26.75 mA cm−2 than those of two binary OSCs (Table S3, ESI†). Assuming that the exciton dissociation, charge transport and collection efficiency arrive at 100% under high Veff, the relatively large Jsat of the optimized ternary OSCs should be mainly attributed to slightly enhanced photon harvesting. Apart from the enhanced photon harvesting, the increase of JSC should be attributed to the more efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency in the ternary OSCs, which can be confirmed by the rapidly saturated Jph of the optimized ternary OSCs under relatively low Veff. Exciton dissociation efficiency (ηd) or charge collection efficiency (ηc) can be estimated by the Jph/Jsat values under short circuit conditions and maximum power output conditions, respectively.52–58 As displayed in Table S3 (ESI†), the ηd of the optimized ternary OSCs is 96.67% and slightly larger than those of the two binary OSCs, suggesting that phase separation can be well optimized by incorporating appropriate S3 for efficient exciton dissociation. The optimized ternary OSCs exhibit a higher ηc value of 90.76% in comparison to those of the two binary OSCs, indicating the efficient charge transport and collection in the optimized ternary OSCs. The higher ηd and ηc values can well explain the simultaneously increased JSC of 25.86 mA cm−2 and FF of 79.17% in the optimized ternary OSCs. Hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) were investigated in active layers with different S3 content (Fig. S4, ESI†). The μh and μe values depending on S3 content are exhibited in Fig. 2d and Table S4 (ESI†). Both the μe and μh are gradually increased for S3 content up to 20 wt% and then decreased for more S3 incorporation, suggesting that the electron and hole transport channels can be finely optimized by incorporating appropriate S3. Simultaneous enhancement of μe and μh values is achieved in the optimized ternary OSCs, which can well support the higher ηc and FF values in the corresponding ternary OSCs.10,59
It is well known that charge transfer or energy transfer between two donors (acceptors) in ternary OSCs can provide additional pathways for promoting exciton dissociation and charge transport. To study the exciton dynamic processes of two donors, photoluminescence (PL) spectra of neat and blend films were measured under 600 nm light excitation. It is generally recognized that if charge transfer (exciton dissociation) occurs between PM6 and S3, the PL emission of the two donors will be quenched in their blend films. On the other hand, if the energy can be transferred from S3 to PM6. The PL emission of S3 will be quenched and the PL emission of PM6 will be increased with unchanged emission peaks in the blend films. As displayed in Fig. 3a, both PM6 and S3 neat films exhibit strong PL emission intensity with different emission peaks (666 nm and 682 nm). The PL emission intensity and emission peak of the PM6:S3 blend film are between those of PM6 and S3 neat films, indicating negligible charge transfer and energy transfer between the two donors.60,61 A similar phenomenon can be observed from the electroluminescence (EL) spectra of the corresponding films (Fig. 3b). The EL emission peak of the PM6:S3 blend film is located between those of PM6 and S3 neat films. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the corresponding films were measured to further study the exciton dynamic processes of the two donors. As shown in Fig. 3c, the emission lifetime of the blend films is between those of PM6 and S3 neat films, which further confirms the negligible charge transfer and energy transfer between the two donors. Fig. 3d exhibits the J–V curves of cells with PM6, S3 or PM6:S3 as an active layer. The JSC of cells based on PM6:S3 is slightly less than that of PM6-based cells and larger than those of S3-based cells, demonstrating the negligible charge transfer or exciton dissociation at PM6/S3 interfaces. According to the above discussion, the contribution from charge transfer or energy transfer for the exciton dissociation and charge transport can be excluded in the optimized ternary OSCs. The optimized exciton dissociation and charge transport in ternary OSCs should be mainly attributed to the well-developed morphology by incorporating 20 wt% S3 in the donors.

The bulk and surface morphology of the binary and ternary blend films were characterized by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively. The TEM images and AFM phase images of the typical blend films are shown in Fig. 4, and the corresponding AFM height images are displayed in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The molecular aggregation at different degrees can be observed from the TEM images of the two binary blend films. The optimized ternary blend films with 20 wt% S3 in the donors show relatively weak molecular aggregation and more homogeneous morphology in comparison to the two binary blend films. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of the optimized ternary blend films is about 0.83 nm, which is smaller than 0.89 nm for the PM6-based and 1.01 nm for the S3-based binary blend films. The smaller RMS roughness value further confirms the homogeneous morphology of the optimized ternary blend films. The well-developed fiber-like structure and phase separation can be clearly seen from both the TEM images and AFM phase images of the optimized ternary blend films, which are conducive to exciton dissociation, charge transport and collection. Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed to further investigate the influence of S3 content on molecular arrangement in ternary blend films. Fig. S6 (ESI†) exhibits the out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) line-cut profiles of neat PM6, S3 and Y6 films. Both PM6 and S3 show mixed face-on/edge-on orientation with respect to the substrate, which is supported by the quite strong (100) and (010) diffraction peaks in the OOP and IP direction in the corresponding line-cut profiles. Y6 films adopt a preferential face-on orientation, showing more prominent (010) diffraction peaks in the OOP direction. Line-cut profiles of the typical blend films are described in Fig. 4g. The profiles of all blend films present strong (100) diffraction peaks at ∼0.31 Å−1 in the IP direction and (010) diffraction peak at ∼1.81 Å−1 in the OOP direction, suggesting that PM6, S3 and Y6 prefer to adopt face-on molecular orientation in the blend films. It is obvious that the IP (100) diffraction peaks in the blend films mainly derive from the donors (Fig. S6, ESI†). In the profiles of the optimized ternary blend films, the IP (100) diffraction peak intensity is slightly stronger than those in binary blend films, suggesting the more ordered molecular packing of the donors, which can well support the increased μh in the optimized ternary blend films. The optimized donor molecular packing further demonstrates the synergy effect of PM6 and S3 in ternary blend films.

Apart from the optimized photon harvesting and well-developed morphology of the ternary blend films, the effect of S3 on VOC improvement plays a key role in boosting the performance of ternary OSCs. To get deeper cognition about the positive effect of S3 on VOC improvement of ternary OSCs, the detailed Eloss of the binary and ternary OSCs was investigated. The total Eloss can be divided into three parts by applying the detailed balance theory, as follows: Eloss = Eg − VOC = (Eg − qVSQOC) + (qVSQOC − qVradOC) + (qVradOC − qVOC) = ΔE1 + ΔE2 + ΔE3(2)where the Eg can be estimated according to the cross point between the highly sensitive EQE (S-EQE) and EL curves of the OSCs, as shown in Fig. 5a–c. The ternary blend film exhibits similar Eg in comparison to the PM6-based binary blend film, achieving lower Eloss of 0.579 eV in the optimized ternary OSCs (Table 3). In eqn (2), the first term ΔE1 = Eg − qVSQOC represents the unavoidable radiative loss originating from absorption above the bandgap. The VSQOC is the maximum voltage based on the Shockley-Queisser (SQ) limit. The second term ΔE2 = qVSQOC − qVradOC can be regarded as radiative loss caused by absorption below the bandgap, where the VradOC is the open circuit voltage when there is only radiative recombination. The third term ΔE3 = qVradOC − qVOC represents the nonradiative loss, which is linearly related to the natural logarithm of EL quantum efficiency (EQEEL) of OSCs. Therefore, the ΔE3 can also be calculated through the equation of −kTln(EQLEL).62 The detailed Eloss values are summarized in Table 3. It is apparent that the incorporation of S3 has weak impacts on ΔE1 and ΔE2 values in the optimized ternary OSCs. The differences in Eloss between the PM6-based binary and optimized ternary OSCs mainly originate from the changes in nonradiative losses. According to the equation of qVradOC − qVOC, the ΔE3 of the optimized ternary OSCs is 0.226 eV, which is smaller than that of PM6-based OSCs. As displayed in Fig. 5d, the optimized ternary OSCs exhibit higher EQEEL of 1.9 × 10−4 in comparison to the PM6-based binary OSCs, corresponding to a smaller ΔE3 of 0.223 eV. The ΔE3 values calculated from two different methods show similar variation tendency for the binary and ternary OSCs, confirming the lower nonradiative loss in the optimized ternary OSCs relative to the PM6-based binary OSCs. The suppressed nonradiative loss should be the major contribution for the VOC improvement of ternary OSCs, which demonstrates that the ternary strategy with two donors is an efficient means to realize low Eloss and high performance of OSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, efficient ternary OSCs were designed and fabricated with two polymers PM6 and S3 as a donor, and one small molecule Y6 as an acceptor. The optimized ternary OSCs with 20 wt% S3 in the donors achieve a PCE of 17.53% with a JSC of 25.86 mA cm−2, FF of 79.17% and VOC of 0.856 V. The PCE of 17.53% and FF of 79.17% should be among the highest values of ternary OSCs. Compared with two binary OSCs, synchronous improvement of JSC and FF can be achieved in the optimized ternary OSCs, attributed to the complementary absorption spectra and good compatibility of PM6 and S3 for enhanced photon harvesting and well-developed morphology of ternary blend films. Furthermore, the lower HOMO energy level of S3 helps the ternary OSCs to achieve higher VOC in comparison to that of PM6-based binary OSCs, benefiting from the lower nonradiative Eloss in ternary OSCs. This work suggests that two well-matched polymer donors can work synergistically to further enhance the performance of OSCs.

Broader context
In recent years, the ternary strategy has attracted tremendous interest due to its versatile advantages for improving the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). The ternary OSCs based on two non-fullerene acceptors have achieved remarkable progress with power conversion efficiency (PCE) above 17%. However, efficient ternary OSCs with two polymer donors are rarely reported due to the inferior compatibility of polymers and shortage of efficient polymer donors to match with non-fullerene acceptors. In this work, an efficient polymer donor S3 was synthesized and incorporated into the PM6:Y6 system to fabricate ternary OSCs. The optimized ternary OSCs achieve a PCE of 17.53%, which should be among the highest reported values for ternary OSCs. This work further demonstrates the ternary strategy as a universal method to improve the performance of OSCs, also keeping the simple fabrication technology. The ternary strategy should be an efficient solution for the industrialization of OSCs with high efficiency and low cost.
