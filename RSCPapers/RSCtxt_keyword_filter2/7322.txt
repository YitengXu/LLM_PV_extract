    , Accepted 3rd October 2019First published on 5th October 2019AbstractTo fine-tune the morphology and miscibility of the active layer of organic solar cells (OSCs), the molecular backbone design and sidechain control are necessary but complex and challenging for acceptor–donor–acceptor type nonfullerene acceptors. In this work, both fluorination on accepting ends and sidechain modification on the central donating core were optimized for the design of fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs). The sidechain-locked conformation finely modulates the molecular energy levels and improves the miscibility with weakened structural order. Fluorination effectively enhances the crystallinity to afford an enlarged phase separation and higher domain purity. Benefiting from their synergistic effects, the as-designed ITC6-4F when blended with the PM7 polymer donor enables an impressive power conversion efficiency of 14.47% with a high VOC of 0.90 V and improved FF of 74.31%, which is much higher than those of the devices based on reference FREAs without fluorination (8.21%) or conformation lock (12.48%). Our results demonstrate that enhancing phase separation with a conformation-locked nonfullerene acceptor could be an effective way for further improving the related performance of OSCs.
1. Introduction
Over the past few years, nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) have become mainstream materials owing to their advantages in easily-tailorable absorption and frontier energy levels.1–4 Fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs)4–15 as the nucleus of NFAs have pushed the solution-processed bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) into a new era. Besides, benefiting from rapid advances in material design, device fabrication and interface engineering, OSCs have come into a period of rapid development. Encouragingly, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 13% have been frequently reported in single-junction devices by using different combinations of polymer donors and FREAs,15–21 suggesting that OSCs are showing great application and development prospects.
The FREAs adopting an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) backbone architecture, such as ITIC,4 INIC9 and INPIC,19 have been an important driving force for realizing high performance OSCs. Typically, ITIC as one of the most widely used FREAs contains three parts, i.e., a fused-ring electron-donating core,6,9,15,19 four non-conjugated side-chains,22–24 and two electron-withdrawing end groups.25–29 Molecular engineering by modifying the three components independently can easily realize absorption regulation, molecular orbital energetics strategies, and crystal engineering, which can effectively promote the performance of OSCs.
In our previous work, molecular engineering mainly focused on the fused-ring electron-donating core. And new cores (ITC630 and INP19) have been designed for several FREAs such as ITC6-IC,30 INPIC-4F,19 INPIC-4Cl,18 INPIC-BO,31 INPIC-EH,31p-INPOIC,32 and m-INPOIC.32 For the INP series, excellent performance was achieved by fabricating devices based on INPIC-4F. However, it should be mentioned that the repeatability of device efficiency is challenging due to strong aggregation of INPIC-4F and unmanageable phase separation of blend films. Great efforts on post-treatments such as casting the film on hot substrates33 and varying casting solvents34 were made to tune the molecular organization and regulate the phase separation. Therefore, crystal engineering by rational molecular design seems to be a crucial and fundamental way to avoid cumbersome post-processing and realize well-defined phase separation for further improved performance. For example, the replacement of p-hexyl on the phenyl moiety with m-hexyloxy for the INP-cored FREA effectively modulates the crystallinity and molecular packing orientation of the resultant m-INPOIC, which was endowed with a moderate crystallinity and highly ordered face-on packing orientation.32 The as-cast blend film of m-INPOIC with PBDB-T achieved a proper phase separation and finely tuned molecular packing, resulting in a high efficiency of 12.1% for the binary OSCs. The efficiency was further pushed over 14% after adding PC71BM as the third component in the blends. Importantly, all as-cast devices show outstanding tolerance to film thickness and stability.
Keeping this in mind, our ITC6-cored FREAs are also worth reconsidering for easier device processing. ITC6-IC was studied and synthesized by introducing an alkyl chain into the terminal fused-ring core. The steric hindrance in limiting the rotation of single bonds between D and A units results in a locked conformation for ITC6-IC. Meanwhile, the introduction of alkyl chains endows ITC6-IC with an excellent solubility, a strong absorption, and higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels compared with those without the alkyl-modified counterpart. Based on such a design concept, several FREAs with a conformation lock (such as ITC6-IC,30 Y6,15 3TT-OCIC,35 PTIC,36 and PTICO36) were also reported. Nevertheless, the alkyl chains extending outside the plane skeleton could effectively reduce the crystallinity, which may lead to a lower structural order and thus restrain the further improvement of PCEs. Therefore, the strategies to enhance crystallinity and enlarge the phase separation should be key to improving the performance of ITC6 based devices. Normally, halogen (e.g. F, Cl) substitution on accepting ends should be a simple and effective way to address such problems. It can modulate the π-electron behaviors at intra- and/or inter-molecular levels and enhance crystallinity by utilizing non-covalent inter-molecular interactions (e.g., F⋯H, F⋯S).14,17,27,37 Moreover, optical absorption can also be broadened, but the molecular energy levels (especially LUMOs) can be seriously decreased due to their large electronegativity (3.98 for F, 3.16 for Cl),14,27,38 which may lead to a significantly reduced open circuit voltage (VOC) in OSCs.
In this work, a new FREA called ITC6-4F (Fig. 1) with moderate crystallinity and excellent solubility has been designed. Alkyl modification on the fused-ring core can finely tune energy level alignment and endow the FREA with good solubility and miscibility. Fluorination of end-groups enables the FREA to gain a broadened absorption range and enhanced crystallinity. When selecting PM7 as polymer donor with matched energy levels, PM7/ITC6-IC blend films exhibit a long d-spacing distance, small value of crystal coherence length (CCL) and poor phase separation due to the decreased crystallinity of ITC6-IC. However, the optimized PM7/ITC6-4F blend films show an enlarged phase separation, more ordered face-on molecular packing and moderate crystallinity compared with PM7/ITC6-IC films. Meanwhile, benefiting from the upshifted LUMO energy levels compared with that of IT-4F, the disadvantages of VOC could be made up. As a result, the as-cast ITC6-4F based device exhibits a promising PCE of 12.10% with a high VOC of 0.96 V, a short-circuit current (JSC) of 19.70 mA cm−2, and an extremely small energy loss of 0.56 eV. After additional treatment, a maximum PCE of 14.47% with a VOC of 0.90 V, a JSC of 19.70 mA cm−2, and a high fill factor of 74.31% for the ITC6-4F based device was achieved, whereas ITC6-IC and IT-4F based devices achieved PCEs of only 8.21% and 12.48%, respectively.

2. Results and discussion
The synthetic route for ITC6-4F is shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†). ITC6-CHO and ITC6-IC were synthesized according to our previous report.30 The targeted ITC6-4F was obtained by a Knoevenagel condensation of ITC6-CHO with (2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene))malononitrile in a good yield of 76%. ITC6-4F was fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 19F NMR, and mass spectra (Fig. S1–S4, ESI†). ITC6-4F exhibits good solubility in common solvents, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, chlorobenzene and tetrahydrofuran, which ensures the film fabrication through a solution process. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in a N2 atmosphere was employed to investigate the thermal stability of ITC6-4F. A decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of 363 °C was observed, indicating its good thermal stability (Fig. S5, ESI†).
The optical absorption properties of ITC6-IC, IT-4F and ITC6-4F were measured by using ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy both in chloroform solution (Fig. 2a) and film state (Fig. 2b). In dilute chloroform solutions, the three FREAs exhibit strong absorption in the 600–730 nm region with a maximum peak (λmax) at 686 nm for ITC6-IC, 684 nm for IT-4F, and 698 nm for ITC6-4F, respectively (Table 1). Furthermore, ITC6-4F exhibits the highest molar absorption coefficient of 2.68 × 105 M−1 cm−1 compared with ITC6-IC (2.34 × 105 M−1 cm−1) and IT-4F (2.04 × 105 M−1 cm−1). It should be mentioned that ITC6-4F shows the highest molar absorption coefficient and the widest absorption, which mainly result from the synergistic effect of fluorination and hyperconjugation induced by a long alkyl chain on the conjugated backbone. In addition, the evidence of conformation lock on the structure could also be found by analyzing the absorption of ITC6-4F. If the introduction of the long alkyl chain on the backbone destroys the coplanar structure, the degree of conjugation will be reduced, which may result in a weak and blueshifted absorption in comparison to that of IT-4F. However, a redshifted absorption of ITC6-4F in solution relative to that of IT-4F was observed, indicating that the alkyl chain on the backbone can effectively unify the conformation without destroying the coplanar structure. The redshift from solution to film is 23 nm for ITC6-IC, 51 nm for ITC6-4F and 63 nm for IT-4F. The absorption onset (λonset) values of the three FREA films are 776 nm (ITC6-IC), 820 nm (IT-4F), and 815 nm (ITC6-4F). Correspondingly, Eoptg can be calculated as 1.60 eV for ITC6-IC, 1.51 eV for IT-4F, and 1.52 eV for ITC6-4F (Table 1). The results indicate that introducing an additional hexyl moiety into the electron-donating core may reduce the structural packing, while fluorination on the accepting end could enhance the intermolecular interaction effect to ensure the effective molecular packing. The morphology of the three NFA-based neat films was investigated by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) characterization (Fig. S6 in ESI†). All neat films exhibit similar diffraction peaks located from 0.35 to 1.75 Å−1 in both in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) directions. The diffraction rings located at ∼0.38 and ∼1.32 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction are indexed, respectively, as the (001) and (002) diffraction peaks of flat-on lamellar crystallinity of the FREA backbone.37 The intensities of (001) and (002) diffraction peaks for IT-4F film are slightly stronger than those of ITC6-4F and ITC6-IC films, suggesting that alkyl chain modification on the fused-ring core could reduce the structural order. The weak crystallinity of ITC6-4F related to that of IT-4F may lead to a poor molecular self-assembly process, inducing a blueshifted absorption of ITC6-4F compared with that of IT-4F. By fitting the π–π (010) stacking peaks of the three films at q ≈ 1.74 Å−1, the values of d-spacing distance for the three neat films are quite close (∼3.62 Å). However, ITC6-4F film shows a relatively large CCL of 1.50 nm compared to IT-4F film (1.36 nm) and ITC6-IC film (1.30 nm), which can promote the enhancement of charge transport. Fluorination on accepting ends gave an opportunity to regulate crystallinity. Consequently, ITC6-4F presents a moderate crystallinity and an excellent solubility.

Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were employed to investigate the electrochemical properties of ITC6-IC, IT-4F and ITC6-4F (Fig. 2c). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels are calculated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, and calibrated by ferrocene/ferrocenium (Table 1). The EHOMO/ELUMO values of ITC6-IC, IT-4F and ITC6-4F were thus calculated as −5.73 eV/−3.92 eV, −5.75 eV/−4.17 eV, and −5.77 eV/−4.03 eV (Fig. S7, ESI†), respectively. It should be noted that ITC6-4F exhibits a deep HOMO and upshifted LUMO with a wide electrochemical band gap of 1.74 eV in comparison to IT-4F, which is beneficial to elevate the VOC and ensure sufficient driving force for charge dissociation on the interface of acceptor/donor.12 In order to evaluate the influence of F atom and hexyl modification on intramolecular interaction, the intramolecular dipole moments of the three FREAs were also evaluated using the density functional theory (DFT) method with the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) basis set based on the half molecular models, and the side-chains were replaced by H atoms for simplicity (Fig. S8, ESI†). The dipole moment values of ITC6-IC, IT-4F, and ITC6-4F are 7.48, 8.84 and 8.90 Debye, respectively. ITC6-4F has the highest dipole moment value among the three molecules, suggesting the end fluorination and hexylation on IT core synchronously enhanced the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect on the ITC6-4F molecule. Normally, a strong ICT effect is beneficial for charge transport. To verify this prediction, the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method was employed to measure the electron mobilities of the neat films of the three FREAs, as shown in Table S4 (ESI†). In comparison to ITC6-IC, ITC6-4F exhibits a high electron mobility of 4.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 comparable to that of IT-4F (3.52 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), which is well in accordance with the results of dipole moment and GIWAXS.
ITC6-IC, IT-4F, and ITC6-4F were used as acceptors, independently, to fabricate OSC devices with an inverted configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. PM7 (Fig. 2d) was selected as the polymer donor due to its good photoelectric properties and complementary absorption. The device processing parameters including donor/acceptor weight ratio, additive volume ratio, and thermal annealing (TA) temperature were systematically optimized. Detailed device optimization parameters are illustrated in Tables S1–S3 and Fig. S9–S12 (ESI†). The as-cast PM7/ITC6-4F devices exhibit significantly high PCEs of 12.10% with a high VOC of 0.96 V, and a small energy loss of 0.56 eV. 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO) and chloronaphthalene (CN) were further chosen as additives in the PM7/ITC6-4F system. The PM7/ITC6-4F devices afforded an improved PCE of 13.21% with a promoted fill factor (FF) of 70.51% after adding 1.0% DIO, while the devices processed with 1% CN gave an enhanced PCE of 12.96%. When taking a binary additive CN&DIO (VCN:VDIO = 1:1) into consideration, the PM7/ITC6-4F devices processed with 0.5% CN&DIO exhibited a greatly increased PCE of 13.76%. After further thermal annealing at 150 °C for 5 min, the optimized devices achieved the best PCE of 14.47%, with an extremely high JSC of 21.64 mA cm−2 and a VOC of 0.90 V. For the sake of comparison, the photovoltaic parameters of the OSCs based on PM7/ITC6-IC, PM7/IT-4F, and PM7/ITC6-4F are summarized in Table 2, with the corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves shown in Fig. 3a. Compared with PM7/ITC6-IC-based devices, an enhanced JSC for the PM7/ITC6-4F based device was obtained. The increment in JSC is ascribed to the fluorination on the end-capped groups, which could effectively narrow Eoptg and enhance the ICT effect and crystallinity. Benefiting from an upshifted LUMO caused by the long alkyl modification on the fused-ring core, an increased VOC with a minimized energy loss (Eloss) of 0.62 eV was achieved for the PM7/ITC6-4F based device relative to that of the PM7/IT-4F based device (Eloss = 0.65 eV).

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 3b. In accordance with the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the three FREAs, the PM7/IT-4F and PM7/ITC6-4F based OSCs exhibit broader photon responses extending from 300 to 820 nm with very high EQE values (over 70%) in the region of 550 nm to 800 nm relative to the PM7/ITC6-IC based ones, leading to higher JSCs. By integrating the EQE spectra with the AM 1.5G reference spectrum, the highest JSC (20.59 mA cm−2) was achieved for PM7/ITC6-4F OSCs compared with that of PM7/ITC6-IC (JSC = 13.28 mA cm−2) and PM7/IT-4F (JSC = 19.65 mA cm−2) devices. All JSC values are within 5% mismatch of those obtained from the corresponding J–V curves.
The charge carrier mobilities of the blend films based on the three FREAs and PM7 were measured using SCLC (Table S4, ESI†). The as-cast PM7/ITC6-4F film shows a high hole mobility (μh) of 4.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an unmatched electron mobility (μe) of 2.51 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, with a μh/μe of 1.80. By means of device optimization, PM7/ITC6-4F blend film exhibits increased μh (5.67 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and μe (5.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) with a balanced μh/μe of 1.13. Moreover, the hole mobility for PM7/ITC6-IC and PM7/IT-4F blend films is 2.43 × 10−4 and 4.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, while the electron mobility is 9.89 × 10−5 and 3.11 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. PM7/ITC6-4F blend films exhibit higher and more balanced hole and electron mobilities than PM7/ITC6-IC and PM7/IT-4F ones. The relatively higher and more balanced charge carrier mobilities of PM7/ITC6-4F blend films reflected well the enhancement of JSC and FF.
The charge recombination behavior of the three FREA-based OSCs was investigated by measuring VOC and JSC with different incident light intensity (P) (Fig. 3c and d). The relationship between JSC and P can be described by the formula JSC ∝ Pα. In principle, if all free carriers are swept out and collected by electrodes prior to recombination, the fitted slope (α) should be equal to 1. The α values of the optimized devices based on PM7/ITC6-IC, PM7/IT-4F, and PM7/ITC6-4F blend films are pretty close and approach 1, indicating very weak bimolecular recombination and effective carrier extraction in these devices. The trap-assisted recombination losses were further studied. The variations of VOC as a function of P were modeled with the equation VOC ∝ lnP (Fig. 3d). Theoretically, the slope (β) close to 2 kT/q (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, and q is the elementary charge) indicates the severe trap-assisted recombination caused by defects or impurities in active layers. β close to 1 kT/q suggests negligible trap-assisted recombination in active layers. The β values for the optimized devices based on PM7/ITC6-IC, PM7/IT-4F, and PM7/ITC6-4F blend films are 1.569 kT/q, 1.372 kT/q, and 1.19 kT/q, respectively. The PM7/ITC6-IC device exhibits the highest β value, implying a strong trap-assisted recombination and existence of defects or impurities in active layers. However, both the fluorination counterpart IT-4F and ITC6-4F based devices show a relatively low β value, implying suppressed defects or impurities in active layers via fluorination on end groups.
To clarify the influence of morphology on device performance, absorption spectra of the blend films were measured and are shown in Fig. 4a–d. It is obvious that blend films show two peaks located at ca. 600 nm and ca. 740 nm, assigned to PM7 and the corresponding FREA, respectively. After the optimized treatment, a significant redshift with enhanced intensity for the absorption peak at 740 nm relative to the peak at 600 nm occurred both for PM7/ITC6-4F and PM7/IT-4F blend films due to the improved intermolecular arrangement and enhanced molecular packing induced by fluorination, which is beneficial for the improvement of JSC and FF. Moreover, the absorption spectra of these optimized blend films are shown in Fig. 4d, where the absorption of the three optimized blend films in the 700–850 nm region is in good accordance with that of the corresponding neat FREA films.

Molecular stacking in the blend films was also investigated by using GIWAXS. As seen from Fig. S6 (ESI†), the π–π stacking (010) diffraction peak of PM7 in the OOP direction (qz = 1.72 Å−1) is more pronounced than those in the IP direction, indicating a preferential face-on orientation. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 5, all optimized blend films exhibit strong and sharp (010) diffraction peaks in the OOP direction, which is advantageous for charge transport in the direction relative to charge collection. Several diffraction peaks both in the OOP and IP direction can be observed in GIWAXS patterns of PM7/ITC6-IC blend films, indicative of disordered molecular packing and poor phase separation. In contrast, the PM7/IT-4F blend film shows a strong π–π stacking (010) diffraction peak at qz = 1.74 Å−1, which corresponds to a d-spacing distance of 3.61 Å and a CCL of 12.9 Å. In comparison to the PM7/IT-4F blend film, the PM7/ITC6-4F blend film shows a more preferred face-on orientation with similar values of d-spacing distance and CCL but relatively weak π–π stacking (010) diffraction intensity. Comprehensively, fluorination could ensure the formation of π–π stacking and enhance the molecular packing, while the conformation lock would reduce the structural order and affect the molecular packing, which is well in accordance with the result of absorption spectra of blend films. Moreover, the PM7/ITC6-IC blend film also shows a strong π–π stacking (010) diffraction peak at qz = 1.61 Å−1 with the corresponding d-spacing distance of 3.9 Å and CCL of 11.8 Å. The longer d-spacing distance and smaller value of CCL compared with those of PM7/IT-4F and PM7/ITC6-4F blend films result in insufficient charge transport ability, leading to a low PCE of ITC6-IC based devices.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode was used to study the morphology of these blend films (Fig. 6). The root mean square roughness (RMS) of PM7/ITC6-4F blend film (RMS = 3.21) is much larger than that of PM7/ITC6-IC (RMS = 1.88) and PM7/IT-4F (RMS = 1.87) blend films. A larger RMS could facilitate ohmic contact and charge extraction at the interface of the device, which is beneficial for the improvement of JSC.12,38,39 The surface texture of the PM7/ITC6-4F blend film is similar to that of the PM7/ITC6-IC blend film, while PM7/IT-4F blend films behave totally differently. The similar molecular stacking behaviors of PM7/ITC6-4F and PM7/ITC6-IC blend films infer that the conformation lock can drastically affect the surface morphology. Furthermore, compared with PM7/ITC6-IC blend film, PM7/ITC6-4F film showed slightly larger aggregation due to fluorination-induced stronger intermolecular π–π interactions. The significant flaky feature and proper phase separation can also be observed in the height image and corresponding phase image of PM7/ITC6-4F blend film, which are beneficial to the charge separation. However, PM7/ITC6-IC blend film displayed poor phase separation and relatively weak aggregation, which limited the enhancement of JSC and FF. The resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) with 285 eV photon energy is used to estimate the length scale of phase separation (Fig. S13, ESI†). PM7/ITC6-IC blend shows a quite quick decay in intensity, and not much structure could be observed, suggesting a quite good mixture in blends with a poor phase separation. The RSoXS signal for PM7/ITC6-4F blend film is much weaker, where a broad and weak scattering hump centered at ∼0.0134 Å−1 was observed corresponding to a length scale phase separation at ∼46.9 nm. Moreover, the PM7/IT-4F blend also shows a broad but weak scattering hump centered at 0.0047 Å−1, giving a large distance of 133.6 nm. These results reveal that PM7/ITC6-4F blend films exhibit an enlarged phase separation and higher domain purity compared with those of PM7/ITC6-IC film. Meanwhile, the more balanced relationship between phase separation size and purity compared with that of PM7/IT-4F film is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport, leading to improved FF and JSC.

3. Conclusion
In conclusion, fluorination was utilized simultaneously to regulate the crystallinity of conformation-locked FREAs and the film morphology. The novel FREA named ITC6-4F with moderate crystallinity was designed and synthesized. ITC6-4F exhibits a high electron mobility of 4.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a medium Eoptg of 1.52 eV and finely tuned energy level alignments. Indeed, the optimized PM7/ITC6-4F blend film shows an enlarged phase separation and moderate aggregation compared with those of PM7/ITC6-IC blend film. The device based on PM7/ITC6-4F shows an impressive PCE of 14.47% with a JSC of 21.64 mA cm−2, a FF of 74.31%, and a VOC of 0.90 V, which is much higher than those of the devices based on PM7/ITC6-IC and PM7/IT-4F. Our results demonstrate that fluorination is an effective way for tuning the morphology of ITC6 based devices, and the strategies for balancing the phase separation and domain purity should be key to enhancing the performance of conformation-locked nonfullerene OSCs.
