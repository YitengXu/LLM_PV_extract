    , Accepted 6th November 2015First published on 23rd November 2015AbstractA hysteresis-less inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell with 14.42% power conversion efficiency (PCE) was successfully fabricated by employing a solution-derived NiOx film as the hole selective contact. Here, the non-stoichiometric transparent NiOx film is composed of a lot of small NiOx nanocrystals with a cubic crystal structure. Inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells based on the as-prepared NiOx hole selective contacts show a much higher PCE and air storage stability than the control device fabricated from the PEDOT:PSS film as the hole selective contact, since NiOx has a better electron blocking property due to its high conduction band edge position. The thickness of the NiOx contact strongly influences the performance of the NiOx-based perovskite solar cells, which include the PCE, hysteresis behaviors and air storage stability due to the thickness-dependent morphology of the NiOx contact.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have achieved a rapid development during the past three years, and the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) has recently exceeded 20% due to their excellent light harvesting, high charge carrier mobility and long carrier lifetime.1–4 The reported perovskite solar cells can be mainly divided into two classes based on their structures. The first class evolves from solid state dye sensitized solar cells and contains a mesoporous film as the support layer of perovskite, for example, TiO2 and Al2O3 mesoporous films,5–7 while the other class is known as planar heterojunction solar cells which have a similar structure to p-i-n silicon solar cells.8,9
In a typical planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell, a perovskite absorption layer is sandwiched between a hole contact layer and an electron contact layer. Compact TiO2 and ZnO films usually work as the electron contacts in n-i-p type devices, and their efficient electron extraction ability has been demonstrated by many studies,8–10 while, 2,2′,7,7-tetrakis(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is most frequently used as the hole contact in these devices. However, spiro-OMeTAD has an extremely high price and poor stability against temperature and moisture.11 Besides, poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methylester (PCBM) are frequently employed as the hole contact and electron contact in p-i-n type devices, respectively.12–16 Such kinds of devices are known as inverted planar heterojunction solar cells, and a PCE as high as 18.1% has been reported for them recently.17 Unfortunately, the research in organic photovoltaic and light emitting diode (LED) devices has already proved that PEDOT:PSS is not good for the long term stability of the device due to its high acidity and hygroscopicity.18 Hence, many inorganic semiconductors, which include MoOx, NiOx, V2O3, WO3, and so on,18–20 have been employed to replace PEDOT:PSS. In particular, NiO is a low price material with superior thermal and chemical stability which has also been demonstrated to be a good hole selective contact for perovskite solar cells due to its suitable work function and high conduction band edge position that can transport holes and block electrons efficiently.21 For example, the NiOx film and NiOx nanoparticles were combined together to fabricate mesoscopic NiOx/CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells, thus, resulting in a PCE of 11.6%.22,23 Xiaobao Xu et al. reported a PCE as high as 14.9% for the perovskite device by using mesoporous TiO2 and NiOx layers as the electron selective contact and hole selective contact, respectively.24 Inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells based on NiOx hole selective contacts had also been studied by many groups, and the PCE of the NiOx-based perovskite solar cell has been improved dramatically to 17.3% recently.25 However, NiOx films were deposited by the costly pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method, which is not suitable for large scale fabrication. Actually, the PCE of perovskite solar cells based on most solution derived NiOx films fell into a wide range from 7.6% to 15.4%.26–29
Although the research of NiOx-based perovskite solar cells has achieved adequate progress over the past two years, several important issues are still left to be solved. Firstly, the PCE of perovskite solar cells based on solution derived NiOx films should be further improved since it is still much lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD-based devices. Secondly, the hysteresis behaviors, which have been observed in almost all kinds of perovskite solar cells, can dramatically affect the accurate measurement of the PCE. Therefore, many steps have been taken to eliminate the hysteresis behaviors in perovskite solar cells with different hole contact layers,17,30–33 however, there have been no detailed hysteresis studies reported on NiOx-based perovskite solar cells so far. Thirdly, the stability of the solar cells has always been one of the most important issues for the research of perovskite solar cells since they were first reported in 2009.34 Although there are several studies on stability for some kinds of perovskite solar cells, the stability study of NiOx-based perovskite solar cells is really rare.35 Here we report a solution-derived NiOx film with a high transmission which was employed as the hole selective contact for inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. The results indicate that the thickness of the NiOx hole selective contact has an important influence on the device performance, including the PCE, hysteresis behaviors and air storage stability. Finally, a hysteresis-less device with a PCE of 14.42% was achieved on the as-prepared and un-doped NiOx hole selective contact, which was as high as those for the best-in-class NiOx-based perovskite solar cells.
2. Experimental
2.1 NiOx nanoparticle solution preparation
3.084 g nickel(II) acetylacetonate and 1.262 g diethanolamine were added into 30 ml ethanol and the mixture was continuously stirred at 60 °C for 12 h to make a clear green solution. Then, the green solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave of 50 ml capacity and kept in an oven which was previously set to 150 °C for 10 h. The autoclave was cooled to room temperature after the reaction and the resulting dark green solution was filtered and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 3 min successively. Following this, the upper clear green solution was collected and mixed with about 400 ml cyclohexane, which was then stirred for tens of minutes until a turbid solution was obtained. Finally, the turbid solution was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 6 min and the precipitation was collected and dispersed again in some ethanol to make NiOx nanoparticles solutions with different concentrations.
2.2 NiOx film deposition
The NiOx film was deposited by a spin-coating process using the obtained NiOx nanoparticle solution as a precursor. The whole spin-coating process was conducted in air at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The thickness of the NiOx films was adjusted by varying the concentration of the NiOx precursor. Thus, the wet film was baked at 150 °C for 10 min and then further annealed at 500 °C in air for 1 h again.
2.3 PEDOT:PSS film deposition
PEDOT:PSS (Clevios, Al4083) was mixed with isopropanol by volume ratio of 1:2. The mixture was ultrasonicated for 10 min and filtered through a polytetrafluoroethylene (TPFE) filter (0.45 μm) before use. The PEDOT:PSS film was also deposited by the spin-coating process at 3000 rpm for 60 s and then dried at 130 °C for 20 min.
2.4 Device fabrication
To prepare the perovskite precursor solution, 2.3 g PbI2 (Weihua-Solar) and 0.8 g CH3NH3I (Weihua-Solar) were dissolved in 1.5 ml dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO, Alfa-Aesar) and 3.5 ml N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Alfa-Aesar) solution at 70 °C with vigorous stirring for 12 h, and the resulting solution was then filtered through the TPFE filter (0.45 μm) to make a clear yellow precursor. Patterned FTO substrates were fabricated by etching the FTO glass with the help of zinc powder and HCl. Following this, the patterned substrates were cleaned by sonication in hot Hellmanex solution, acetone, ethanol, and deionized water, successively. The NiOx or PEDOT:PSS coated substrates were transferred into a glovebox and the perovskite film layer was deposited on the top of the NiOx or PEDOT:PSS films by the spin-coating process, which includes a low speed of 1000 rpm for 5 s to spread the solution, and a high speed of 3000 rpm for 35 s to evaporate the solvent. At the end of the spin-coating, 0.13 ml chlorobenzene was dripped onto the film while spinning. Then the films were baked at 100 °C for 30 min. The PCBM (American Dye Sources) layer was deposited onto the perovskite film from a 20 mg ml−1 chlorobenzene solution at 1500 rpm for 45 s. Finally, an Ag film with a thickness of about 100 nm was deposited onto the PCBM layer by thermal evaporation to finish the device fabrication.
2.5 Characterization
Microstructural properties of the NiOx nanoparticles were observed by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2010, JEOL Inc., Japan). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted in air with a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 using a thermal analyzer (NETZSCH STA 449C, Germany). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was employed to characterize the crystalline properties of the films from a D/max 2400 X Series X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6390, JEOL Inc., Japan) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Cypher S, Asylum Research) were used to observe the morphological properties of the films and devices. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS Ultrabld, Kratos) was used to analyze the elemental composition of the NiOx film. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the films were recorded by using a JASCO V-570 UV/VIS/NIR Spectrometer. The J–V curves of the as-fabricated devices were measured in air using a PVIV-201V I-V Station (Newport Oriel). The illumination source was calibrated by using a Newport 91150V reference cell system. The dwell time for each scan point was changed from 10 ms (scanning rate 1000 mV s−1) to 500 ms (scanning rate 20 mV s−1) to investigate the hysteresis effects of the devices. All the device performance parameters were acquired with a scanning rate of 100 mV s−1 unless otherwise stated. The steady state power conversion efficiency was measured by keeping the device at the maximum power point for 100 s. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices were recorded in air without bias light by using a Qtest Station 1000ADX system (Growntech. Inc). The chopper frequency was 180 and the step for the monochromator was 5 nm.
3. Results and discussion
Many solution-derived methods have been successfully used to deposit NiOx films and the optical-electronic properties of the resulting NiOx films heavily depend on the employed methods. Here, we employed a hydrothermal method to prepare a NiOx nanoparticle precursor. Fig. 1 shows the TEM images of the NiOx precursor. It can be observed from Fig. 1 that the contrast is very low in the low magnification TEM image due to the small size and weak crystallinity of the NiOx nanoparticles, but the NiOx nanoparticles with a size of ∼5 nm can be still seen from the HRTEM image as shown in the inset of Fig. 1. Actually, these NiOx nanoparticles are buried in a lot of organic components, which can be destroyed by the electron beams after TEM characterization (as seen in Fig. S1†). The existence of abundant organic components can also be proved by the TGA of the NiOx powder obtained by drying the precursor at 150 °C for 20 min. As can be seen in Fig. S2,† the powder lost about 10% of its original weight at around 100 °C which can be attributed to the water uptake of the powder. As the temperature increased, the powder weight experienced a dramatic loss due to the decomposition and combustion of the organic components, especially in the region from 200 °C to 500 °C (more than 50% of its original weight).

Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of the FTO substrate and NiOx film after being annealed at 500 °C in air for 1 h. As compared to the XRD pattern of the FTO substrate, several additional peaks can be clearly observed at 37.2°, 43.3° and 62.9° for the NiOx coated substrate, which can be assigned to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of the cubic NiOx crystal phase, indicating the good crystallinity of the NiOx film. To determine the optical band gap of the as-prepared NiOx, we measured the absorption spectrum of the NiOx film deposited on a quartz substrate and the result is shown in Fig. 2b, where (ABS × hν)2 is plotted as a function of hν. The calculated band gap of the NiOx film is 3.7 eV, which is in accordance with a previous report.36 The elemental composition of the NiOx film was characterized by XPS analysis, and Fig. 2c shows the XPS spectra of the Ni 2p core level. The peak at 860.8 eV is ascribed to the shake up process of the NiO structure, while the peak at 853.6 eV should be ascribed to Ni2+, indicating the existence of NiO. It should be mentioned here that a satisfactory fit obtained by adding only two peaks for Ni3+ at 855.0 eV and 856.2 eV on top of a Shirley back ground indicates the existence of Ni2O3 and NiOOH components.20 Hence, the as-obtained film should be noted as NiOx rather than NiO.

NiOx films with different thicknesses were deposited on FTO substrates by changing the concentration of the NiO nanoparticle precursors, and the morphological properties of the resulting films were characterized by SEM and AFM. As shown in Fig. 3a, the surface morphology of bare FTO is like hills with a root mean square (RMS) roughness as high as 16.992 nm, which can be effectively decreased through depositing the NiOx film. As the thickness of the NiOx film increases from 5 nm, in Fig. 3b, to 190 nm, in Fig. 3f, the RMS roughness decreases from 10.400 nm to 2.025 nm. However, if the NiOx film is too thin (Fig. 3b), it may be discontinuous, and thus the crystal morphology of FTO can be still seen clearly. As the thickness of the NiOx film increases to 20 nm, the NiOx film can complete a full coverage of the surface of FTO except for many cracks along the boundaries of FTO as seen in Fig. 3c. Actually, these cracks can be partially avoided by increasing the NiOx film thickness to 55 nm as seen in Fig. 3d. When the thickness of the NiOx film further increases up to 90 nm and 190 nm as shown in Fig. 3e and f, all the cracks disappear completely, and the FTO surface becomes very smooth and homogenous. It is interesting to note that all the NiOx films shown in Fig. 3 are composed of small nanoparticles with a size of 10–30 nm, which might be aggregated from the NiOx nanoparticle precursor during the annealing.

To fabricate the perovskite solar cells, we deposited CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films on the NiOx coated substrate, and the top-view SEM image of the as-prepared perovskite film is shown in Fig. 4a. It can be seen that the perovskite film shows a full coverage on the NiOx film and the perovskite film crystal sizes are in the range from 100 nm to 500 nm. The as-prepared perovskite film also has a good crystallinity (Fig. S3a†) and efficient absorption in the visible region (Fig. S3b†). Fig. 4b shows a false color cross-sectional-view SEM image of a typical device with a structure of glass/FTO/NiOx/CH3NH3PbI3 film/PCBM/Ag. In this device structure, the thickness of the NiOx film, which is composed of small nanoparticles, is about 90 nm. The perovskite film is pinhole free and has a thickness of 330 nm. A PCBM layer with about 80 nm was deposited on the top of the perovskite film, followed by a layer of the Ag film with a thickness of 100 nm as the cathode. Here, the NiOx layer and PCBM layer work as the hole selective contact and electron selective contact, respectively, as shown in the schematic band diagram (Fig. 4c).

Fig. 4d shows the J–V curves of the perovskite solar cells with different hole selective contacts, where the J–V curve of the device without any hole selective contact is also presented for comparison. Both the open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current density (Jsc) are very low if the perovskite film is directly deposited on the FTO substrate, thus, resulting in a very poor device performance with a PCE of only 1.15%. However, even if a 5 nm thick NiOx film is deposited between the perovskite layer and FTO substrate, the PCE of the device increases to 8.39% rapidly due to a great improvement of Voc, Jsc and fill factor (FF). As the thickness of the NiOx film is further increased, the FF increases steadily to around 75.2%, while the Jsc reaches the highest value of 18.68 mA cm−2 for the device with the NiOx film thickness of 20 nm and then decreases gradually for the devices with thicker NiOx film. The Voc is able to maintain a high value of 1.09 V when the thickness of the NiOx film is in the range between 55 nm and 90 nm. However, if the thickness of the NiOx film is doubled to 190 nm, both the Voc and Jsc decrease dramatically, and thus leading to a deterioration of device performance. Hence, the best device performance can be obtained when the thickness of the NiOx film is 90 nm. Together with a Voc of 1.09 V, a Jsc of 17.93 mA cm−2, and a FF of 73.8%, a highest PCE of 14.42% is thus achieved, which is as high as those for the best-in-class NiOx-based perovskite solar cells as presented in Table S1.† The steady state power conversion efficiency was also tested by keeping the device at the maximum power point to ensure a reliable result. For a device with a J–V scanning PCE of 14.33%, the steady state power conversion efficiency was 14.18%, indicating a good consistency. The details about the steady state power conversion efficiency can be found in the ESI.† As a comparison, the optimized PEDOT:PSS control device only outputs a Voc of 0.93 V and a PCE of 11.63%, which are much lower than those of our best NiOx devices. The great improvement of the NiOx-based devices should be ascribed to their superior electron blocking ability due to the high conduction band edge position of the NiOx (see Fig. 4c), which can be demonstrated by the better diode property as shown in Fig. S5.† A detailed summary of the device performance parameters is presented in Table 1.

Fig. 4e compares the EQE spectra of different devices. The Jsc for each device can be calculated by integrating the overlap of EQE and the AM 1.5G solar photon flux, and the obtained results are also listed in Table 1. Obviously, the Jsc values calculated from the EQE spectra are roughly in accordance with those obtained from J–V curves. Fig. 4f shows the transmission spectra of the PEDOT:PSS or the NiOx film coated FTO substrates. Several interesting phenomena can be observed when we compare the EQE spectra and the transmission spectra. Firstly, although the PEDOT:PSS film has a similar or even higher transparence as compared with the NiOx film (20 nm and 55 nm), the PEDOT:PSS-based device shows a much lower EQE. Secondly, the transparence of the NiOx film with 190 nm is only slightly smaller than that of the NiOx film with 90 nm, however, the EQE of the device with a 190 nm NiOx film is much lower than that of the device with a 90 nm NiOx film. The above phenomena can be explained as follows: for one thing, the NiOx film has a better electron blocking property due to its high conduction band edge position as shown in Fig. 3c, thus, leading to less electron recombination at the interface between the NiOx film and the perovskite film. For another, since the NiOx film is composed of many small NiOx nanoparticles, thus, the thicker NiOx film (190 nm) introduces much more crystal boundaries, which can act as traps for the carriers, leading to more recombination in the NiOx film and a decrease of Jsc.
Hysteresis behavior is an important issue for the perovskite solar cells, which has been observed and reported in many kinds of perovskite solar cells. Devices with hysteresis behaviors show a great discrepancy between the forward and reverse J–V scan, leading to an over estimation or under estimation of the real PCE. Therefore, more and more researchers have paid their attention to this issue. Here, we investigated the hysteresis behaviors of our devices by changing the scanning rate and direction. Fig. 5a and b show the J–V curves of the devices with different NiOx film thicknesses, in which the subscript “reverse” means scanning from Voc to Jsc, while the subscript “forward” means scanning from Jsc to Voc. As shown in Fig. 5a, no matter how fast the scanning rate is, the device with the NiOx film thickness of 20 nm shows a great discrepancy between the forward scanning and the reverse scanning. Although all these curves show a similar Jsc, the Voc and FF values obtained from the forward scanning are much larger than those obtained from the reverse scanning, thus, resulting in an increase of PCE. Meanwhile, it is also noted that even if the scanning is in the same direction, the J–V curves still mismatch each other slightly as the scanning rate is changed, especially for the reverse scanning. However, when the thickness of the NiOx film is increased to 90 nm, all the J–V curves overlap each other as shown in Fig. 5b, suggesting that little hysteresis behavior can be observed. These results indicate that the hysteresis behavior of the as-fabricated devices depends on the thickness of the NiOx film badly. In order to make this point clear, we compared the performances of the devices fabricated from the NiOx films with different thicknesses, and the results are shown in Fig. 6. The x axis in each panel of Fig. 6 represents the devices with different hole selective contacts (including the PEDOT:PSS control device), while the y axis represents the difference of the performance parameters between the forward scanning and the reverse scanning. The scanning rate for both directions is 100 mV s−1. The bigger the absolute value of the y axis is, the worse the hysteresis phenomenon is. Clearly, it can be seen that when the NiOx film is thin (5 nm and 20 nm), the difference for Voc between two scans is more than 100 mV, and the difference for FF is between 4% and 10%. Together with a slight difference for Jsc, thus, the PCE shows a big difference in the range of 1.8–3.1%. However, as the thickness of the NiOx film increases to above 55 nm, the Voc values obtained from the two scans converge, and the differences for Jsc and FF between two scans decrease to around 0.05 mA cm−2 and 1%, respectively. Therefore, the hysteresis-less J–V curves can be obtained for these NiOx-based devices fabricated from the thicker NiOx films, which are even better than the PEDOT:PSS control device.

The origin of the hysteresis behaviors of the perovskite solar cells has been investigated in many different device structures, and several possible reasons were proposed to explain this phenomenon, such as the defects in the perovskite crystal surface and boundaries,12 ion migration in the perovskite layer,37,38 ferroelectricity,39,40 unbalanced electron flux and hole flux in carrier contacts,17 and so on. However, it is too far to make a conclusion for this issue at present, and primary reason for a certain device is also different from sample to sample, which should be determined by their structures and materials. In our case, the efficient hole extraction ability of the NiOx selective contact and the high quality of the perovskite film should be the most important two reasons for the reduced hysteresis behaviors of our devices due to the thick NiOx contact, while the serious hysteresis behaviors of the devices with a thinner NiOx contact should result from the direct contact between the perovskite film and FTO substrate due to the incomplete coverage or cracks of the NiOx films as seen in Fig. 3b–d. A more in-depth investigation of the hysteresis behaviors is still underway in our lab.
Furthermore, we studied the air storage stability of our devices by measuring the J–V curves of the devices after being exposed to ambient air for different durations. Fig. 7 shows the changes of Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE with the exposure time, respectively. It can be seen that the PCE of the PEDOT:PSS-based device quickly deteriorates to ∼20% of its original value in the first 24 h, which should be mainly attributed to the decrease of FF and Jsc. It is also interesting to note that the thickness of the NiOx selective contact has a great influence on the device air storage stability. When the NiOx contact layer is very thin (5 nm, 20 nm), both the Voc and Jsc decrease slightly as the exposure time increases, but the FF decreases quickly in the first 48 h, resulting in a dramatic deterioration of the PCE. However, when the NiOx contact layer is thick enough (55 nm and 90 nm), both the Voc and Jsc can almost keep constant. Together with the gradually declined FF, the PEC still maintains more than 80% of its original value even after 150 h exposure. It should be mentioned here that the humidity of ambient air was between 45 and 56% during the entire measurement, and a detailed record of the humidity is presented in Fig. S6.† These results suggest that our NiOx-based perovskite solar cells show a much better air storage stability than the PEDOT:PSS control device.

4. Conclusions
NiOx films with different thicknesses have been successfully deposited on FTO substrates by spin-coating the hydrothermal-derived NiOx nanoparticle precursor. The as-prepared NiOx films, which are composed of small nanoparticles with a size of 10–30 nm, have high transmission in the visible region with a band gap of 3.7 eV. Inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells with the NiOx film as the hole contact shows a highest PCE of 14.42%, which is much higher than that of the PEDOT:PSS control device. The results indicate that the thickness of the NiOx contact has a great effect on the PCE, hysteresis behavior, and air storage stability of the as-fabricated devices. A planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell with a hysteresis-less, high performance, and adequate air storage stability has been achieved from the NiOx contact with 90 nm thickness. The excellent performance of our NiOx-based devices should be ascribed to the efficient hole extraction and electron blocking ability of the NiOx contact as well as the high quality of the perovskite film, while the thickness dependent performance of our NiOx-based device should be attributed to the different morphologies of the corresponding NiOx films.
