    , Accepted 30th January 2014First published on 3rd February 2014AbstractLigand-free AgInS2 nanocrystals display significant defect-related sub-band gap photo-absorption in addition to the excitonic absorption. The post-synthesis annealing of the nanocrystal dispersion at 150 °C reduces the intrinsic defect density, and also increases the nanocrystal size (5.8 nm) thereby reducing surface related defects. The AgInS2 nanocrystals exhibit a broad emission spectra, with a large Stokes shift compared to the excitonic absorption, which is attributed to two radiative electron–hole recombination processes: the first one involves the localized defect-state and the delocalized valence/conduction band with a lifetime of ~20 ns, and the second one involves two localized donor and acceptor states with a lifetime >250 ns. The faster decay dominates the higher energy end of the emission spectrum. Quantum dot sensitized solar cells using these ligand-free AgInS2 nanocrystals exhibit a maximum energy conversion efficiency of 0.8% and an open circuit voltage of 0.45 V. The device performance is better compared to previous AgInS2 nanocrystal based solar cells, due to both the use of the ligand-free nanocrystals that improve the charge transport and the post-synthesis annealing which partially removes the mid-gap defect states.
Introduction
Semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) exhibit size-dependent band gap tuning, an enhanced electron–hole binding energy and also solution processibility.1–5 CdE (E = S, Se, Te) based NCs have mainly dominated the optoelectronics and luminescence based applications of semiconductor NCs in the visible region of light. AgInS2 is a I–III–VI2 semiconductor which can crystallize in both the chalcopyrite and orthorhombic phases exhibiting direct band gaps of 1.87 and 1.98 eV, respectively, at room temperature.6 The band gap is suitable for the absorption and emission of visible light, and thus AgInS2 is an interesting alternative for both solar cell and light emitting applications. Importantly, AgInS2 is non-toxic as opposed to the cadmium chalcogenides.
The synthesis of colloidal AgInS2 NCs has been reported rather recently using both the thermolysis of single molecular metal–sulfur complex precursors and the reaction of metal cations and sulfur.7–16 So far, the main emphasis has been on the luminescence property of the AgInS2 NCs for biological applications,15,17–20 along with two reports on photovoltaic cells14,21 and a report on their nonlinear optical properties.7 Very recently, the AgInS2 NCs22 and Cu-doped AgInS2 NCs23 have been incorporated in organic–inorganic hybrid optoelectronic devices. The surface of these AgInS2 NCs is coated with insulating organic ligands, which are required for controlling the size, solubility and surface passivation of the AgInS2 NCs. The insulating organic ligands inhibit electron injection (extraction) to (from) the semiconductor core NCs and therefore are not suitable for optoelectronic applications like photovoltaics or electroluminescence based light emitting diodes (LEDs). For example, very poor (0.06%) total power conversion efficiency (η) is obtained for solar cells made using organic (oleylamine and dodecylthiol) capped AgInS2 NCs. The efficiency was increased by an order of magnitude by removing the organic ligands after heating the NC film at 450 °C.14 However, then high temperature annealing leads to the sintering of the NCs yielding larger crystals and loses the quantum confinement effect.
Various post-synthesis surface modification procedures have been reported previously for other (not for AgInS2) semiconductor NCs in order to replace the insulating organic ligands with an electronically transparent ligand.24–34 Talapin et al. demonstrated very high charge carrier mobilities from a semiconductor NC film by using inorganic ligands like molecular metal chalcogenides and chalcogenides.35,36 There are reports of a single-step synthesis for all-inorganic colloidal NCs, for example, oxide NCs with OH−/H2O on the surface.37,38 Recently, we have reported a generic protocol for the synthesis of binary and ternary ligand-free metal sulfide NCs.39 However, optoelectronic applications of these single-step synthesized all-inorganic NCs have not been tested yet.
Here we prepared ligand-free AgInS2 NCs similar to ref. 39, followed by a post-synthesis annealing of NC dispersion that modifies the size and defect density of the NCs. Such a modification of the defect states plays a crucial role in determining the optical absorption, emission and solar cell performance of these NCs. The luminescence in the AgInS2 NCs arises from both a localized defect based donor–acceptor transition and transitions involving a localized defect state and the delocalized valence/conduction band. Solution processed ligand-free AgInS2 NCs were used to form the photo-anode of the quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSC) exhibiting a 0.8% power conversion efficiency with 0.45 V open circuit voltage (VOC) and 4.62 mA cm−2 short circuit current (JSC), which are best parameters for any AgInS2 QDSSC. The VOC, JSC and efficiency increases systematically with a decrease in the mid-gap defect states of the AgInS2 NCs, which hinders the further improvement of the solar cell performance.
Experimental section
The details of the synthesis, post-synthesis annealing and characterization are given in the ESI.† Ligand-free AgInS2 NCs were synthesized by reacting a mixed solution of AgNO3 (0.1 mmol, 0.0169 g) and In(NO3)3·H2O (0.1 mmol, 0.0300 g) in 10 mL formamide (FA) with an (NH4)2S solution (100 μL 40–48 wt% in water was diluted by adding 1 mL FA) following ref. 39. The reaction mixture was then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes, and the supernatant liquid was collected after discarding the precipitate. Acetonitrile was added to the supernatant liquid leading to a second precipitation, followed by centrifugation. The obtained second precipitate is the final AgInS2 NC product discussed in this paper. The supernatant liquid obtained after the first precipitation as discussed above was further diluted by two times by adding fresh FA. The diluted AgInS2 NC dispersion was put into a three-neck round bottom flask maintaining an inert atmosphere and was subsequently annealed to a desired temperature (up to 150 °C) for 15 minutes at each step.
The UV-visible absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the AgInS2 NCs dispersed in FA were recorded using a Perkin Elmer, Lambda-45 UV/Vis spectrometer and a FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer (HORIBA scientific), respectively. The PL decay dynamics were measured using time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) set-up from IBH Horiba Jobin Yvon (USA) at an excitation energy of 2.7 eV (459 nm). The fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were measured in the transmission mode using a NICOLET 6700 FTIR spectrometer from Thermo scientific. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data were measured using ~4 mg of the dried AgInS2 NCs in an N2 atmosphere using a Perkin Elmer STA 6000, simultaneous thermal analyser. The ζ-potential was obtained using a Zetasizer Nano series, Nano-ZS90 (Malvern Instruments, U.K.) employing Henry's equation in the Smoluchowski limit.40 The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data were obtained using a JEOL JEM 2100F microscope operated at 200 kV. The solar cells were illuminated using a Newport Solar Simulator with an AM1.5G filter at one sun intensity (100 mW cm−2). The current–voltage (I–V) characterization was done using a Keithley 2611 Source-Meter. A software from Sciencetech was used to extract some solar cell parameters, namely, the fill factor (FF), series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (RSh). The cell areas were kept constant at 0.16 cm2. The Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was done using a PARSTAT 2273 potentiostat. The EIS measurements were carried out by applying a DC bias at VOC = 0.25 V. The EIS is measured with a sinusoidal voltage having an rms amplitude of 10 mV in a frequency range from 10−2 Hz to 105 Hz.
AgInS2 QDSSC were fabricated. FTO coated glass was washed sequentially with a diluted soap solution, water and ethanol using an ultrasonicator. Finally clean FTO coated glass was heated at 450 °C for 10 minutes in order to remove organics or contaminants. The mesoporous TiO2 film was then prepared by a doctor blading method. This thin layer of TiO2 paste used in this method was prepared following ref. 41 on FTO glass. The film was then sintered at 450 °C for 30 minutes. After that this sintered TiO2 film was treated with aqueous TiCl4 (0.04 M) and finally sintered again at 450 °C for 30 minutes in order to remove pin holes and cracks from the TiO2 film. The thickness of TiO2 was optimized to ~5 microns by checking the cross-sectional width using scanning electron microscopy. Subsequently, the AgInS2 NCs dispersed in DMF (~30 mg mL−1) were pipetted onto the mesoporous TiO2 film and allowed to stay for 2 h at room temperature.42 Exposure of the AgInS2 NC dispersion or film to air did not cause any noticeable change in the device performance. The final photoanode was made by washing the resulting film with ethanol and annealing it at 100 °C inside an N2 filled glove box for 1 h. The cell was prepared by assembling an NC sensitized electrode and Au (deposited on cleaned FTO glasses by dc sputtering) as the counter electrode using a 50 micron thick scotch tape spacer along with a 10 micro-liter polysulfide electrolyte. The polysulfide electrolyte consists of Na2S (0.5 M), sulfur powder (2 M) and KCl (0.2 M) in a mixed solvent containing methanol:water (in a 7:3 volume fraction).43 The methanol-free polysulfide electrolyte also exhibit similar results but with somewhat lower JSC values (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†).
Results and discussion
Synthesis and light absorption
Ligand-free AgInS2 NCs were prepared when a solution of Ag+ and In3+ precursors react with an excess of S2− in a polar solvent like FA at 70 °C. The details of the synthesis are given in the ESI.† An excess of the S2− ion on the NC surface provides a negative charge on the NC surface as evident by a negative ζ-potential of −39 mV (Fig. 1). Negatively charged NCs repel each other providing colloidal stability to these NCs in a polar solvent. The FTIR data in Fig. S2 of the ESI† show that the NCs are largely organic-free, with negligible contributions from CH2 stretching bands around 2853 and 2920 cm−1, however, the signature of the FA solvent molecules is present. The TGA data in Fig. S3 of the ESI† show a ~4% weight loss upon heating the ligand-free AgInS2 NC powder up to 500 °C, and the weight loss is mainly due to the evaporation of the residual FA solvents. This weight loss is significantly small compared to the ~25% weight loss that typically arises from the organic capped NCs of a similar size.39
 Fig. 1  The ζ-potential of the AgInS2 NCs synthesized at 70 °C and dispersed in FA. 
After the synthesis, the NCs dispersed in FA were annealed at 125 °C and 150 °C for 15 minutes each. The UV-visible absorption spectra of the AgInS2 NCs treated at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 2a. The spectrum obtained after synthesis at 70 °C is a broad featureless one. The broad absorption feature can typically arise from NCs with a very broad size distribution. However, in the present case, a significant absorption is observed at energies even below the band gap of the bulk AgInS2, which cannot be explained by the broader size distribution of the NCs. Also, the NCs form a stable colloidal solution even after centrifuging at 7000 rpm for 10 minutes, suggesting that the lower energy absorption tail is not arising from the scattering of light by agglomerated NCs. Interestingly, when we anneal the colloidal NCs at a higher temperature, the absorbance of the tail below the bulk band gap decreases, appearing to be a blue-shift in the absorption onset. The AgInS2 NCs annealed at 150 °C show the appearance of an excitonic absorption feature at around 2.1 eV, which is higher than the band gaps of both orthorhombic and chalcopyrite AgInS2, suggesting that the confinement of the charge carries in our NCs. The TEM images of the AgInS2 NCs in Fig. S4 of the ESI† show an increase in the NC size from 2.5 nm to 5.8 nm after heating the NC dispersion from 70 to 150 °C. Therefore the blue-shift in the absorption onset (Fig. 2a) is not because of a decrease in the NC size with the increasing annealing temperature, in contrast, the NC size increased with temperature. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns in Fig. 2b and c show that the crystal structures of the NCs remain in the same orthorhombic phase during the annealing process. Therefore, there is no possibility of a different crystal structure modifying the band gap after annealing the NC dispersion.
 Fig. 2  (a) The UV-visible absorption spectra of the colloidal AgInS2 NCs annealed at different temperatures. The NCs were dispersed in a formamide solvent. The inset shows the same absorption spectra but the Y-axis is plotted in a logarithmic scale. (b) and (c) show the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the AgInS2 NCs annealed at 70 °C and 150 °C, respectively. 
The absorption tail at energies lower than the band gap has been observed previously in doped/disordered semiconductors, and is often termed as the Urbach tail.44,45 The absorption coefficient α(hν) ~ exp(hν/Eu) over some energy ranges below the band gap, where Eu has been termed as the Urbach energy. Plots (inset to Fig. 2a) of the absorbance in the logarithmic scale vs. photon energy show somewhat linear regions below the bulk band gap suggesting the possibility of Urbach tails in our AgInS2 NCs. However, a conclusive assignment is not possible from these data since the typical UV-visible absorption spectrometer cannot measure the absorbance over several orders of magnitude, which is required to study the Urbach tail. Such a tail arises from light absorption involving localized states in the mid gap region. The Ag–S and In–S bonds have different strengths, and are known to generate various defects like interstitial Ag, Ag vacancy, S vacancy and interstitial S in the bulk AgInS2 crystal.46 These defect states are the localized states with a poor overlap of the electronic wave-functions and typically have a poor absorption coefficient. However, for the 2.5 nm AgInS2 NCs, a larger part of the crystal is constituted by the surface and sub-surface region having a higher defect density. The high defect density, and consequently, the closer proximity of the defects, both owing to the small NC size, lead to a measurable defect-state related absorption in the NCs.45 An increase in the annealing temperature reduces the lower energy absorption tail by (i) improving the crystallinity which reduces the intrinsic defects, and (ii) increasing the NC size which reduces the surface related defects. Also, larger NCs with lesser defects can increase the spatial separation between the defect sites, which in turn reduces the absorption coefficient.
We note here that unlike the II–VI semiconductor NCs, the majority of the previous reports on the organic capped AgInS2 NCs show featureless absorption spectra, and there is also an inconsistency among the different reports in the measured values of the band gap with the respective TEM size of the NCs. For example, ref. 47, ref. 13 and ref. 12 reported band gaps of 2.08, 2.22 and 2.03 eV for orthorhombic AgInS2 NCs of diameters 3.1, 5.6 and 6 nm, respectively, instead of a systematic increase in band gap with decreasing NC size. The inconsistency might arise from complications in assigning the band gap/excitonic absorption peak because of the contributions from the mid gap state absorptions, and not merely because of the broader size distribution.
Luminescence

Fig. 3 shows the corresponding PL spectra of the AgInS2 NCs after annealing at different temperatures. Interestingly, the PL peaks shift towards a lower energy with an increasing annealing temperature which also increases the NC size. This enables the tunability of the emission color from the yellow–green to deep red region as shown by the CIE diagram in Fig. S5 of the ESI.† The PL spectra are broad with a large Stokes shift (>200 meV) between the emission and the corresponding excitonic absorption as shown in the inset of Fig. 3 for a 150 °C annealing temperature, suggesting a defect-related emission. Fig. S6 in the ESI† shows the same PL spectra as in Fig. 3, but the difference is two spectra for 70 and 150 °C were shifted with respect to the x-axis in order to overlap with the spectrum for the NCs annealed at 125 °C. The full width at half maxima (FWHM) of the PL spectra are 409, 358 and 333 meV for the NCs processed at 70, 125 and 150 °C, respectively. The broad nature of the emission spectra from the AgInS2 NCs has already been attributed to electron–phonon coupling.47
 Fig. 3  The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the colloidal AgInS2 NCs annealed at different temperatures. The NCs were dispersed in formamide and excited with 2.76 eV (450 nm) light. The inset shows the absorption and PL spectra for NCs annealed at 150 °C, indicating the Stokes shift between the excitonic absorption and the luminescence maximum. 
Fig. S7a in the ESI† shows that the PL intensity of the AgInS2 NCs annealed at 150 °C is significantly higher compared to the NCs annealed at 70 °C. The PL decay dynamics with the emission energy fixed at the peak maxima of 2.16 eV and 1.82 eV for NCs processed at 70 and 150 °C, respectively, are shown in Fig. S7b in the ESI.† Clearly, the NCs annealed at 70 °C show distinct faster (sub-nanosecond) decay channels, which typically arise from non-radiative decays via defect states with energies in between those of the excited state and the ground states responsible for luminescence. Importantly, the contribution of this faster non-radiative decay decreases dramatically after annealing the sample at 150 °C, thereby increasing the luminescence intensity. It is to be noted that the decrease in the defect density with the annealing of the NCs observed in our PL study (Fig. S7 of the ESI†) corroborates our analysis of the UV-visible spectroscopy data in Fig. 2a.

Fig. 4a compares the absorption spectrum and PL excitation (PLE) spectra of the AgInS2 NCs annealed at 150 °C. The PLE spectrum with an emission energy fixed at 1.68 eV shows that emission also arises from an excitation energy lower than the band gap of the bulk AgInS2. Similar to the absorption spectrum, a broad shoulder is observed in the PLE spectrum (emission at 1.68 eV) at around 2.1 eV, which can arise from the lowest energy excitonic transition. A similar but blue-shifted shoulder is also observed in the PLE spectrum with an emission energy at 1.82 eV, compared to that for the emission at 1.68 eV. This blue-shift suggests that defect-related emissions arising from smaller NCs have higher energies compared to those arising from larger NCs within the same sample of the NC ensemble. Whereas the 1.99 eV emission energy is too high to distinctly see the shoulder in the PLE spectrum. We note here that the control experiments with solvents, ligands, precursors, Ag2S NCs, or possible In–S based NCs do not show any emission in this region, which suggest that the PLE and the absorption energy lower than the band gap of the bulk AgInS2 indeed arise from the defect-states of the AgInS2 NCs and not from any unwanted impurity.

The NCs were dispersed in formamide. (b) A schematic diagram showing the possible light absorption and emission pathways. The dotted upward arrow indicates the defect-induced mid gap light absorption in addition to the solid upward arrow showing the transition from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB). (c) The photoluminescence decay dynamics of the colloidal AgInS2 NCs annealed at 150 °C after excitation at 2.7 eV (459 nm). The emission wavelengths were fixed at three different energies of the same emission spectrum, shown by arrows in the inset of Fig. 4c. 
The schematic in Fig. 4b shows that the defect state can contribute in the light emission process via two different paths. Path-1 describes an emission involving transitions from (to) localized defect states to (from) the delocalized valence (conduction) band. Since previous transient absorption studies47,48 on I–III–VI2 semiconductor NCs showed that the band edge bleaching is mainly due to electrons, our simplified schematic (Fig. 4b) shows only the transition from the defect states near the conduction band to the valence band for path-1. Path-2 describes an emission involving two dip and localized defect states, and termed as donor–acceptor (D–A) transition. The luminescence from the increase in the annealing temperature increases the NC size, and exhibits a red-shift in the PL spectra. Path-1 exhibit a red-shift with an increase in the NC size by shifting the valence band up, and even path-2 can contribute to the red-shift to a smaller extent by reducing the Coulomb interaction between the D–A pairs.47,49 The PL peak shifts by 0.34 eV (Fig. 3), for 2.5 nm (70 °C) compared to 5.8 nm (150 °C) AgInS2 NCs. The Coulomb energies of the D–A pair with average D–A distances of 2.5 and 5.8 nm are 0.06 and 0.03 eV respectively.49 Therefore, the PL shift of 0.34 eV is too high to be explained by a change in the Coulomb energy of the D–A pairs for different sizes of NC. This observation, suggest that as the NC size decreases, the contribution from the higher energy path-1 increases, tuning the PL towards higher energies.
The PL decay dynamics of the AgInS2 NCs annealed at 150 °C with emission energies fixed at 1.68, 1.82 and 1.99 eV are shown in Fig. 4c. The inset to Fig. 4c shows the corresponding steady state spectrum indicating three emission energies with colored arrows. Clearly, the decay is faster for higher emission energies. The decay profiles can be fitted with bi-exponential decay, and the best fit parameters are shown in Table 1. A shorter lifetime of ~20 ns is common at all three emission energies, however another longer lifetime (>250 ns) increases systematically with a decrease in the emission energy. The shorter lifetime has more contribution for the higher emission energies, and the longer lifetime contributes more towards the lower emission energies. The shorter 20 ns lifetime can be assigned to path-1 in Fig. 4b, which involves one localized and one delocalized state. However, the longer (>250 ns) lifetime is due to the D–A pair transition (path-2) where both states are localized with a poor overlap of the electronic wave-functions. This D–A pair lifetime increases (Table 1) with a decreasing emission energy because the lower energy signifies a larger D–A distance which also reduces their wave-function overlap. While explaining the luminescence from the AgInS2 NCs, ref. 13 and ref. 50 suggested a D–A pair transition, with different contributions from the surface and intrinsic defects. Ref. 47 and 49 suggested a contribution from another emission channel in addition to an intrinsic D–A pair emission. Our model (Fig. 4b) is somewhat similar to that of ref. 47 and 49. We suggest that both path-1 and path-2 can have contributions from both the intrinsic and surface defects. One unique aspect about our model (Fig. 4b) is the defect-induced mid gap absorption, which consequently can lead to defect-related emissions as well. In fact, we cannot also completely rule out the possibility of shallow delocalized defects near the valence band participating in path-1 of Fig. 4b.
Table 1 The best fit parameters of the photoluminescence decay profiles in Fig. 4c, using bi-exponential decay: I(t) = a1 exp(−t/τ1) + a2 exp(−t/τ2). We note that the accuracy of obtaining larger lifetimes (>300 ns) becomes restricted by the measurement window, however, the obtained trend in increasing the τ2 with decreasing emission energy should be reliable

Quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs)
The broad band absorption of sun light, the large absorption coefficient and the non-toxic nature of the material has motivated researchers to develop QDSSCs using these I–III–V2 semiconductors as a photosensitizer.51–54 We fabricated QDSSC using the FTO/TiO2/ligand-free AgInS2 NCs as the anode and a gold electrode as the cathode along with a polysulfide electrolyte in between the electrodes. Fig. 5a and b show schematic descriptions of the working principle of a QDSSC and its charge transfer mechanism, respectively. The AgInS2 NCs absorb photons and generate electron–hole pairs. These photo-generated electrons can be efficiently transferred from the ligand-free AgInS2 NCs to the mesoporous TiO2 layer (through process A in Fig. 5b) where they are finally collected by the FTO contact. At the same time, the photo-generated holes are scavenged by the polysulfide based redox electrolyte which thereby regenerates the NCs.
 Fig. 5  (a) A schematic diagram representing the working principle of a QDSSC. (b) A schematic diagram showing the charge transfer mechanism for sensitized solar cells. CB is the conduction band for TiO2 and RP is the redox potential for the electrolyte. The arrows demonstrate the direction of the electron transfer. Channel A represents the electron transfer from the NCs to TiO2 and channel B represents the non-radial recombination electron and hole via the defect state. (c) The J–V characteristics for QDSSCs fabricated using two differently processed ligand-free AgInS2 NCs: colloidal NCs annealed at 70 °C and 150 °C. The effective cell area is 0.16 cm2 for both cells. 

Fig. 5c shows the current density (J) vs. voltage (V) plot for QDSSCs fabricated using ligand-free AgInS2 NCs prepared after the post-synthesis annealing of colloidal NCs at 70 °C and 150 °C. The essential solar cell parameters have been extracted from the plots and are provided in Table 2. The band gap of the photo absorber (i.e. sensitizing material) is the maximum attainable VOC.55 The main hurdle in attaining a higher VOC comes from a mismatch of energy levels in the photoabsorber and the electrical contacts as well as from the non-radiative recombination rates of the electron–hole pair through the defect states of the NC. The presence of defect levels in the NCs below the conduction band edge of TiO2 provides significant non-radiative trapping sites for the photogenerated charge carriers shown as channel B in Fig. 5b. This certainly reduces the amount of photogenerated charge carriers collected via channel A. On the other hand, the absence of these defect sites reduces the trapping of the photogenerated charge carriers via channel B, which in-turn increase the amount of charge collection via channel A and JSc. The measured VOC is proportional to the logarithm of this JSc. Therefore, any defect mediated reduction in JSC also reduces the VOC and vice versa. From Table 2, we notice that the AgInS2 NC dispersion annealed at 150 °C with a sharper mid-gap absorption tail (Fig. 2a) exhibit a higher VOC compared to the NCs annealed at 70 °C. This can be explained also by using Fig. S7b in the ESI.† Annealing the NCs at 150 °C drastically reduces faster defect-related nonradiative decay channels, and the longer lifetime of the excited electron is expected56–58 to enhance VOC. Therefore, the observed increase in VOC for the AgInS2 NCs with an increasing annealing temperature can be attributed to the selective removal of the mid-gap states as clearly shown by the sharper mid-gap absorption in Fig. 2a and longer PL lifetime in Fig. S7b.† The photocurrent study was also done for samples processed at 150 °C which qualitatively resembles with UV-visible spectrum of the corresponding AgInS2 nanocrystals.

Any impediment to the transport and collection of the photogenerated charge carriers also affects the overall efficiency of the solar cell as it directly reflects in the JSC and FF. Here, RSh quantifies that the contribution from the leakage current are nearly similar (~6 kΩ) for both the devices suggesting a qualitatively similar coverage of the TiO2 films with the AgInS2 NCs for both devices. On the other hand, RS comes from the contact resistance of the junction and also from the contribution of the defects which limits the transport and collection of the photogenerated electron and holes. We found lower RS values for the AgInS2 NC dispersion annealed at 150 °C (RS ~ 270 Ω) compared to the NCs processed at 70 °C (RS ~ 416 Ω). The EIS measurement done for nanocrystals processed at 150 °C also agrees well with these RS values (see Fig. S8 in the ESI†). The observed decrease in the RS subsequently increases the FF and JSC values for the AgInS2 NCs annealed at higher temperatures. This can be attributed to the removal of defects from larger NCs obtained at higher annealing temperatures. A further reduction in the defect density is required to improve the FF. The observed improvements in JSC, VOC and FF with the AgInS2 NCs having lesser mid-gap defects are evident from the final efficiency of these QDSSCs. Cells with NCs annealed at 150 °C give an overall maximum efficiency of 0.8% which is ~4 times higher compared to the cells with NCs annealed at low temperatures.
We note that ref. 14 which discusses organic capped AgInS2 NC based QDSSCs shows a lower value of JSC = 0.91 mA cm−2 because of the presence of the insulating organic ligands on the NC surface, however, our best QDSSC with ligand-free AgInS2 NCs exhibit JSC = 4.62 mA cm−2. The higher JSC of our QDSSCs can be attributed to the easy extraction/transport of the charge carries from the ligand-free AgInS2 that does not have any insulating organic layer on the NC surface. However, the obtained efficiency (0.8%) is still low compared to that (~5%) of the best QDSSCs based on other semiconductor NCs. Apart from the optimization of the device fabrication, one intrinsic hurdle for high efficiency AgInS2 NC based QDSSCs appears to be the high density of the intrinsic defects in the synthesized NCs. This high defect density is not unique to our synthesis, and rather common in most organic capped AgInS2 NCs synthesized so far.
Conclusions
Ligand-free AgInS2 NCs were prepared using a simple single step synthesis at 70 °C. A post-synthesis annealing of the colloidal AgInS2 NCs was carried out at three different temperatures 70, 125 and 150 °C. All of these samples show significant defect-related photoabsorption at energies below the bulk band gap, probably leading to an Urbach tail. Defects in the AgInS2 NCs can arise from both surface termination and intrinsic defect within the crystal because of the difference in the Ag–S and In–S bonds. The low-energy absorption tail decreases systematically as the annealing temperature is increased from 70 to 150 °C, which is also accompanied by an increase in the NC size from 2.5 nm to 5.8 nm. A higher annealing temperature reduces the intrinsic defects, and at the same time the formation of larger NCs reduces the surface defect contribution. The steady state and excited state PL data show that the radiative recombination of the excited electron–hole follows two paths: (i) involving a transition between a localized defect state and a delocalized valence/conduction band state with a lifetime of ~20 ns, and (ii) involving two localized defect-states (donor–acceptor) with a lifetime >250 ns. QDSSCs prepared using a AgInS2 NC dispersion after annealing at 150 °C show higher values of power conversion efficiency (0.8%), VOC (0.45 V) and JSC (4.62 mA cm−2) as a consequence of the partial removal of the defect states compared to NCs annealed at 70 °C (0.2%, 0.26 V and 2.3 mA cm−2). The obtained solar cell parameters are superior than the previous reports of AgInS2 NC based solar cells, owing to the ligand-free nature of our NCs facilitating charge transport, and the partial removal of defect states following post-synthesis annealing. However, further improvement of device performance is essential for practical use, and the major step would be synthesizing intrinsic defect-free AgInS2 NCs.
