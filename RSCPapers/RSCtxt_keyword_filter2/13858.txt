    , Accepted 4th June 2018First published on 4th June 2018AbstractThe transfer from poly-3hexylthiophene (P3HT) based fullerene free organic photovoltaic (OPV) lab cells with IDTBR (rhodanine-benzothiadiazole-coupled indacenodithiophene) as acceptor material to fully solution processed roll-to-roll (R2R) compatible modules is reported. The developed R2R process is fully compatible with industrial requirements as it uses exclusively non-hazardous solvents. The combination of optimized ink formulation, module layout, and processing affords efficiencies of 5% on 60 cm2 total module area.

Broader context
Organic photovoltaics are penetrating the market of building integrated photovoltaics. The technology features an excellent carbon footprint and the possibility of being manufactured by roll-to-roll printing lines. The immense potential of low cost energy generation by printed photovoltaics on rigid or flexible substrates continues to be a main driver for researchers to further improve the fundamental understanding and applicability of this technology. Important challenges towards a successful commercialization are the stability, efficiency and large-area processing of organic solar modules. The latter needs to be compatible with prevailing industrial and environmental standards. The freedom of design of the modules, a key advantage over mainstream silicon photovoltaics, plays an equally important role. Laser patterning of modules and the use of semi-transparent electrodes increase the visual appeal of organic solar modules, but on the way from small spin coated laboratory solar cells to roll-to-roll printable life size modules, a series of technological obstacles need to be overcome. Here, we present important progress in terms of manufacture, efficiency and stability of organic solar modules based on an emerging class of a small molecule semiconductor and innovative processing methods.

1. Introduction
Among different sources of renewable energy, the potential provided by the energy of the sun surpasses all others, given that only one hour of sunlight could potentially cover the earth's combined energy needs for a full year. This continuously encourages researchers worldwide to find appropriate materials and techniques to make use of this immense potential. Organic photovoltaics (OPV) has gained a lot of interest within the last years and has already made its way to the market.1–4 Solution processed organic solar cells, also referred to as bulk heterojunction solar cells, comprise a photoactive layer, which consists of a partially phase separated blend of an electron donor, usually an organic polymer, and an electron acceptor, usually a fullerene derivative. OPV has matured to a level where their actual use as a relevant renewable energy source is considered technologically viable and economically attractive, e.g. in building integrated photovoltaics.5 In the past few years, polymer:fullerene solar cells with operational lifetimes of thousands of hours6,7 and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) above 11% in single junction architecture have been achieved on laboratory scale,7–11 on par with amorphous silicon. The ability to manufacture OPV, using industrial scale roll-to-roll (R2R) methods has been demonstrated and outdoor stability studies show encouraging results.12 This progress was enabled mainly by the development of chemically tailored, highly absorbing donor polymers with improved optoelectronic properties, whereas fullerenes have remained the only choice as electron acceptor over decades, mainly due to their unique combination of electron affinity, electron mobility and morphology formation. However, some significant drawbacks of fullerenes like high costs of synthesis, weak and rather narrow absorption of the solar spectrum, intrinsically low open circuit voltage due to large non-radiative losses, as well as chemical and morphological instabilities, led into the search for novel materials as acceptors. Recently, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have been developed, which for the first time combine the advantages of fullerenes with enhanced light absorption, easier synthesis and purification, improved processability from environmentally friendly solvents, enhanced variability in energy level alignment and high stability.13 Recently, PCEs as high as 13.1% have been reported for NFA-based OPVs.11 One of the most promising NFA candidates is IDTBR an indacenodithiophene core, flanked with benzothiadiazole and rhodanine groups. Using this acceptor, Holliday et al. demonstrated cells of 0.1 cm2 active area with a stable efficiency of 6.3% in combination with poly-3hexylthiophene (P3HT) as donor material.5 Besides their impressive efficiencies, P3HT:IDTBR based devices also show negligible burn-in losses, as reported by Gasparini et al.14 To further increase the efficiency of P3HT devices, ternary blends of P3HT:IDTBR with either FBR, the fluorene-core analogue of IDTBR, or IDFBr, an indenofluorene analogue of IDTBR, were analysed by Baran et al.7 The addition of the strongly absorbing small molecules FBR or IDFBR to the binary P3HT:IDTBR blend increased the device efficiency up to 6.0% and 7.7%, respectively. Ternary blends of the low-bandgap donor polymer PBDTTT-EFT with the NFAs IDTBR and IDFBR lead to solar cells with 11.0% PCE.7 The combination with another low-bandgap donor polymer Pff4TBT-2DT leads to efficiencies approaching 10% (9.95%) with a VOC of 1.12 V15 and of 11.1% in a work using the processing solvent mesitylene.16 The large VOC is a result of the reduced voltage losses, a property that is shared among other non-fullerene acceptors. Also highly efficient, stable and burn-in free solar cells based on the similar polymer PffBT4T-2OD in combination with IDTBR have been reported.17 Obviously, NFAs show a great potential for highly efficient, stable and cheap OPV devices.
Although these advances are impressive, the main obstacle to the commercialization of non-fullerene OPVs is the difficulty of transferring the lab produced hero devices into reliable industrial-scale products without significant losses in performance and in accordance with environmental regulations.18 Therefore, we describe in this work the necessary steps from lab cells to an environmentally friendly up-scaled R2R module production, along the general guidelines recently presented by our group.18 These steps include: (i) the elimination of deposition processes which are incompatible with R2R production and of materials which need high temperatures for conversion (ii) the development of inks based on non-hazardous solvent systems and (iii) the optimization of the module layout by maximizing the geometrical fill factor and minimizing electrical and optical losses. The successful establishment of a robust, fully R2R compatible production process for NFA based OPV modules has not been established before and will be demonstrated here through the fabrication of semi-transparent P3HT:IDTBR modules with photoactive areas of 60 cm2. The power conversion efficiency amounts to 5% and 4.7% for photoactive layers coated from halogenated and green solvents, respectively.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. OPV devices
Inverted structure OPV devices were processed on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass with the layer sequence ZnO nanoparticles/P3HT:IDTBR or P3HT: [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/evaporated silver (Ag) or solution processed silver nanowires (AgNWs). For single cells a size of 0.104 cm2 active area was used. ZnO nanoparticles dispersed in isopropyl alcohol were purchased from Avantama AG (formerly Nanograde AG), P3HT and PCBM were supplied by OPVIUS GmbH, o-IDTBR (with linear octyl-side chains) was synthesized in accordance with earlier reports.6,7 PEDOT:PSS (Clevios FHC and Clevios Al 4083) was purchased from Heraeus Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG and silver nanowires were obtained from Cambrios Advanced Materials Corp. The AgNWs were diluted 1:1 with a water/additive (Clear Ohm®) mixture also delivered from Cambrios Advanced Materials Corp. before coating. The layout of the modules features 12 individual cells, forming a total area of 64 cm2. A more detailed description and a picture of the module are given later on. With the exception of the modules which were fully printed using a slot die (SD), all printed layers described in this work were processed by doctor blading (DB) in ambient atmosphere. The doctor blade (Model ZAA2300) and applicator (Model ZUA 2000) are from Zehntner GmbH. The slot die (SD) coatings were made with a sheet to sheet coater from FMP Technology GmbH, equipped with a homemade 100 mm width SD. Current–voltage (IV) characteristics were measured with a source measurement unit from Keysight with a ReRa tracer software (Netherlands) in 4-wire configuration. As solar simulator we used an LOT quantum device solar simulator Class A with an AM1.5G spectrum and 1000 W m−2, as verified using a calibrated silicon photodiode from Fraunhofer. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured using an integrated system from EnliTech, Taiwan.
2.2. Hansen solubility parameters (HSP)
The Hansen solubility parameters (HSP) of IDTBR were determined via the binary gradient method developed by Machui et al.19 According to this method, first, the solubility of IDTBR is tested in binary solvent mixtures consisting of a good solvent (chlorobenzene) and a non-solvent (1-butanol, propylene carbonate, cyclohexane, pyrimidine and diiodomethane) (Fig. S4, ESI†). Then a solubility limit of 10 mg mL−1 is used to separate the solubility values into “good” (Score = 1) and “bad” (Score = 0). This concentration was chosen to fulfil the ink criteria for a minimum ink viscosity and to achieve a sufficient active layer thickness with the chosen processing parameters. Finally, the scores are fed into the software HSPiP (v.5.0.03), which uses a quality-of-fit function to generate a solubility sphere (Fig. S3, ESI†). The centre of the sphere then represents the HSP of the material.
2.3. Laser patterning
Laser patterning was carried out with an LS-6KP4P520 setup from LS Laser Systems GmbH (München, Germany) with a Spirit 1040-8-SHG from Spectra Physics (Rankweil, Austria) emitting at 1040 nm (fundamental wavelength) and 520 nm (first harmonic wavelength) with a pulse duration of <350 fs at repetition rates up to 960 kHz. Maximum pulse energies of 16 μJ (1040 nm) or 6.4 μJ (520 nm) are reached at 500 kHz. A galvanometer-mounted mirror deflects the beam over the sample surface with a speed of up to 4 m s−1. The objective of the scanner has a focal length of 508 mm and a focused spot diameter of 40 ± 1 μm (at 1/e2 intensity). The power of the laser was measured with the VEGA DISPLAY and sensor 30A-BB-SH-18 ROHS from Ophir Optronics (Jerusalem, Israel).
2.4. Dark lock-in thermography (DLIT)
For dark lock-in thermography (DLIT) imaging a Taurus Infrared (IR)-camera, (IRCAM GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) controlled by a computer for real-time lock-in calculations was used. The IR camera is equipped with a cooled indium-antimonite (InSb) and focal plane array detector (640 × 512 pixels) with a noise equivalent temperature difference of less than 20 mK. The IR detector is highly responsive in the spectral range between 1.5–5 mm and provides a frame rate of 100 Hz. The camera was equipped with a 25 mm focal lens imaging system featuring a spectral transparency >90% (IRCAM GmbH, Erlangen, Germany). For all measurements, the lock-in frequency was set to 1 Hz in order to minimize implications due to the heat diffusion length. As power supply for the pulsed excitation a source measure from Agilent (B2900) was used.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Roll-to-roll compatible small-scale devices
The P3HT:IDTBR based devices initially reported by Holliday et al.5 were manufactured by spin-coating and comprised ZnO layers as electron transport layer, which require annealing above 150 °C, active layers deposited from chlorobenzene, as well as vacuum deposited MoO3 hole transport layers and evaporated silver electrodes. Neither the processing methods nor the device architecture are compatible with solution-based roll to roll production. Therefore, as starting point for the transfer of the lab produced hero devices into reliable industrial-scale products, we prepared lab cells of 0.104 cm2 with a R2R compatible architecture, moving from spin coating to doctor blading for the deposition of all layers. For this purpose, the precursor based ZnO material used for the electron transport layer (ETL) by Holliday et al. was replaced by ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO(NP)), which can be easily printed from isopropanol based dispersions under ambient conditions and dried at a temperature of 80 °C in less than five min. The high vacuum deposited MoO3 hole transport layer (HTL) was replaced by solution processed PEDOT:PSS (Al 4083). For the deposition of the P3HT:IDTBR bulk heterojunction layer, neat chlorobenzene (CB) was used as the solvent initially, following the recipe for the spin coated record devices described in ref. 6. The JV-curves of the resulting solar cells are shown in Fig. 1 and the corresponding photovoltaic (PV) key parameters are listed in Table 1. The devices processed from neat CB show a maximum PCE of only 2.55 ± 0.32%, which is significantly lower than the PCE reported in ref. 6, mainly due to a strongly reduced fill factor (FF), which in turn causes a lack of short circuit current density (JSC). The shape of the JV-curve clearly indicates poor charge carrier extraction from the active layer due to low charge carrier mobility (mobility values of only μ = 0.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 are obtained by fitting the JV-curve with a one-diode model that considers 2nd order charge carrier recombination, see Fig. S1, ESI†), caused by an unfavourable morphology of the bulk heterojunction (bhj).20 For the material combination P3HT:PCBM, several studies report improved device performance through the promotion of P3HT aggregation by additives, resulting in enhanced phase separation and crystallinity, and thus, higher mobility of the charge carriers.21–24 As reported in ref. 25, the addition of p-bromoanisole (BrA) to CB for the material system P3HT:PCBM shows a beneficial impact on device performance, due to enhanced solubility of the acceptor material in this additive, leading to enhanced phase separation between donor and acceptor materials. Table 2 shows the solubility of P3HT, PCBM and IDTBR in different solvents and at different temperatures. Both, PCBM and IDTBR, show good solubility in BrA, whereas the solubility of P3HT in BrA is substantially lower, even at elevated temperatures. The similarity of PCBM and IDTBR with respect to solubility in BrA suggests that this additive may also be beneficial for the morphology of the P3HT:IDTBR system. As can be seen in Fig. 1 and Table 1, the addition of 5 vol% BrA to CB leads to substantially increased current density (values confirmed by the integration of external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, see Fig. 1b) and fill factor also in the case of the non-fullerene acceptor, resulting in an efficiency of doctor-bladed cells of 5.61 ± 0.28%. This is in accordance with simulations of the JV-curves based on the one diode model (Fig. S1, ESI†), using the value μ = 3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for charge carrier mobility. The active layer thickness of the best performing doctor bladed devices was found to be 200 nm. With increasing thicknesses of up to 300 nm, no significant performance losses are observed (Fig. S2a, ESI†). This is due to almost thickness-independent FF values, which are in line with the exceptionally low recombination rates of P3HT:IDTBR solar cells as shown by Gasparini et al.25 Simulations of the JV-curves with the one-diode-model (Fig. S2b, ESI†) yield 2nd order recombination constants in the range of γ = 0.9–0.5 × 10−12 cm3 s−1, using a charge carrier mobility of μ = 3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was reported for optimized P3HT:IDTBR devices with similar efficiencies in ref. 26. In order to complete the transfer to a fully solution processed R2R compatible cell stack, the evaporated Ag top electrode was replaced by a R2R compatible silver nanowire formulation. Silver nanowires (AgNWs) have been identified as a suitable candidate for the manufacturing of high quality, highly transparent electrodes using R2R compatible methods.27,28 Therefore, the top electrode was deposited by doctor blading AgNWs from water based solution on top of the stack. The whole stack was then dried on a hot plate at 120 °C. For semi-transparent devices, we used the water based PEDOT:PSS formulation FHC, as it features higher conductivity compared to Al 4083 and is strongly crosslinked after annealing. This prevents that PEDOT:PSS is dissolved during coating of the AgNWs solution. The fully solution processed doctor bladed P3HT:IDTBR based solar cells with a AgNWs top electrode delivered power conversion efficiencies of 5.25 ± 0.09% (Table 1), which is only 6% less than in the case of an evaporated Ag top electrode and thus in good agreement with the expected losses due to the reduced reflection at the back electrode.29

3.2. Development of green ink formulations
For industrial processing of organic electronics, toxic solvents are not a viable option and need to be replaced. Therefore, the transfer of P3HT:IDTBR solar cell production requires the replacement of halogenated solvents by “greener” alternatives. Typically, for large area fabrication of organic photovoltaics via roll-to-roll techniques, polymer concentrations of at least 10 mg mL−1 are needed in order to achieve viscosity values that are suitable for attaining homogenous coatings. However, at room temperature, non-halogenated solvents are usually not able to dissolve sufficiently large amounts of organic semiconductors (Table 2). As such, suitable non-halogenated solvents and solvent systems for the processing of P3HT:IDTBR blends at elevated temperatures have to be identified. In order to narrow down the number of experiments and thus speed up the selection process, a method based on the HSP concept was developed for this purpose. Since IDTBR is expected to dissolve well in various solvents (Table 2 and Fig. S3, ESI†), the prediction method (described in the ESI†) is focused on P3HT. The solubility requirement of >10 mg P3HT per mL at 90 °C is predicted to be met for all solvents that display a Hansen P3HT-solvent distance of Ra < 3.8 MPa0.5 (Fig. S4, ESI†). However, in order to prepare well-working P3HT:IDTBR devices by the deposition of active layers from the liquid phase, good blend solubility in green solvents at T = 90 °C is just the first of three basic boundary conditions:
1. P3HT solubility >10 mg mL−1 at 90 °C.
2. P3HT solubility <10 mg mL−1 at 75 °C.
3. Solvent boiling point <190 °C.
Boundary conditions (2) and (3) need to be met in order to allow sufficient phase separation of donor and acceptor to form highly ordered polymer phases, which enables efficient charge extraction. For active layer fabrication at 60–75 °C via doctor blading, and in accordance with boundary condition (2), it is necessary to identify solvents in which P3HT precipitates much earlier than IDTBR. Boundary condition (3) refers to the solvent drying time and is a key parameter when it comes to film formation. The overall solvent prediction for P3HT, based on an in-house database of solvents with reduced environmental impact, is given in Fig. 2. The green rectangle defines the range of suitable solvents and contains 2-propylpyridine, o-methylanisole, benzylmethylether, p-cymene and m-diethylbenzene. For comparison, the standard processing solvents chlorobenzene and o-xylene as well as the green solvent anisole are included. The solvent prediction and the market price (Fig. S6, ESI†) imply that o-methylanisole (oMA) and p-cymene (pC) are promising solvents for an environmentally friendly and low-cost processing of P3HT:IDTBR blend films, and were therefore used for further experimental tests in our standard device stack (ZnO(NP)/P3HT:IDTBR/PEDOT:PSS/Ag), along with the non-halogenated solvent o-xylene. The latter was tested in order to verify whether it yields better performing devices than neat CB. This is, in fact, the case and supports the idea that solvents which are located closer to the green box in Fig. 2 lead to higher performance. In addition, the arrows in Fig. 2 visualize limitations that may arise if the solvents are not chosen from the green rectangle. For high Ra values, the solubility will be too low, whereas if Ra is too low, the phase separation will be insufficient. In the case of highly volatile solvents, condensation at the coating head may influence the coating quality, whereas solvents with a high boiling point lead to a slow drying process and are likely to not be completely removed during a heating process of reasonable duration.
 Fig. 2  P3HT-solvent solubility distance as a function of the solvent's boiling point. The upper horizontal gray line represents boundary condition (1), the lower gray line boundary condition (2) and the vertical dashed line boundary condition (3). Solvents in the green box are defined as “suitable for processing”. SD: slot-die. 
The active layers deposited from neat o-xylene and p-cymene lead to reasonable, although not fully satisfactory device performance. The bottleneck resides in relatively low FF and JSC for o-xylene and low JSC for p-cymene. The addition of 1-methylnaphthalene (1MN) or tetraline (THN) to o-xylene improves the efficiencies, but does not quite yield those achieved with CB:BrA. In the case of neat oMA, the resulting device efficiencies are 5.41 ± 0.14% (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The addition of BrA to oMA results in only slightly better performance, whereas the addition to p-cymene shows a greater improvement. Given that oMA has been shown to be a promising “green” alternative for the processing of OPV devices,30 meeting the criteria with respect to combustibility and health regulations, it was used for the production of modules, as described in the following section of the paper. An overview of all the steps described so far towards an optimized, fully solution processed device stack is given in Table 1 and the box plot diagram (Fig. S7, ESI†), illustrating the effect of the type of electron acceptor in the bulk heterojunction, the solvent system used for depositing the photoactive layer and the metal top electrode.

3.3. Roll-to-roll process compatible modules
In the following section, the upscaling procedure from lab cells towards highly efficient modules will be described based on the optimized stack identified for small scale single cells. The module layout used for this purpose comprises 12 individual cells that are monolithically connected in series on a total area of 64 cm2 (8 × 8 cm), see Fig. 4. A schematic diagram and the module layout are given in Fig. S9 (ESI†). One individual cell, including interconnect, has a length of 0.67 cm (8 cm/12 cells) and an area of 5.33 cm2 (64 cm2/12 cells). According to the electrical simulations reported by Lucera et al., efficiency losses due to the serial resistance of the electrodes are minimized for this particular cell length, considering the expected JSC of around 12 mA cm−2.18 The module stacks ZnO(NP)/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/AgNW and ZnO(NP)/P3HT:IDTBR/PEDOT:PSS/AgNW were initially deposited by doctor blading, applying the same coating parameters as for the optimized single cells. The active layer ink is composed of P3HT with either PCBM or IDTBR in a ratio of 1:1 at a total concentration of 25 mg mL−1 in CB:BrA (95:5) and also oMA in the P3HT:IDTBR case. The photograph of the finished P3HT:IDTBR module in Fig. 4 demonstrates the homogeneity of the resulting films and the absence of obvious thickness gradients due to doctor blading. The combination of semi-transparency, the absence of circuitry and the small interconnect areas lead to visually attractive modules. Narrow interconnect areas were achieved by monolithic interconnection of the individual cells via a combination of full area coating and laser patterning, which has been demonstrated to provide geometric fill factors (GFF) above 90%.29,31 For the layer stack presented in this work, the processing window of laser patterning is conveniently wide, as the laser ablation thresholds of the layers are decreasing significantly in the order P1 (separation of the bottom electrode) > P2 (ablation of the active layer) > P3 (separation of the top electrode; for the definition of P1–P3, see also Fig. S9, ESI†). A detailed description of the patterning process and the monolithic interconnection of cells by laser patterning can be found in ref. 31 and 32. Dark Lock-In Thermography (DLIT) images of the modules (Fig. S10, ESI†) show that shunts are located in the photoactive cell area rather than at the interconnects, thus demonstrating that laser patterning itself does not introduce shunts. Fig. 4 shows a confocal microscope image of the interconnect region of a final module. The distance between the patterning lines P1 and P3, i.e., the total width of the interconnect area, is only 466 μm, which corresponds to a GFF of 93% and an active area of 59.52 cm2 for this specific module. The GFF values of all manufactured modules lie between 92.6% and 93.2%, underscoring the high precision and good reproducibility that can be achieved with laser patterning, a prerequisite for a stable production process. Table 3 and Fig. 5 show the device parameters and the corresponding IV-curves of the resulting modules. The PCE of 2.4% of the P3HT:PCBM module processed from CB:BrA is comparable to the values measured for the corresponding single cell devices (Table 1) and represents a typical value for a semi-transparent module with a transparency between 2.5% and 5.2% (Fig. S11 (ESI†) shows the maximal and minimal transmittance of the manufactured modules) based on this active layer material combination. By replacing PCBM with IDTBR in CB:BrA the power output is more than doubled and reaches 5.0%, which is only 4% less than the PCE value of 5.25% obtained for single cells with the same architecture. The upscaling of oMA based P3HT:IDTBR modules still yields conversion efficiencies of η = 4.7%. As both, IDTBR and P3HT, have strong absorption bands in the visible region of the spectrum, but at different spectral positions, the appearance of the modules is extremely sensitive to spatial inhomogeneities of the ratio of P3HT and IDTBR in the dry film. Fig. 6 compares two modules which have been coated using two different temperatures for drying the wet film. While the module dried at 60 °C presents a nicely homogeneous appearance, the module dried at 75 °C displays serious flow marks, which reflect the inhomogeneous distribution of IDTBR in the film. Absorption spectra taken at different locations of these modules are shown in Fig. 6, pointing out the local variations in the P3HT/IDTBR ratio in the dried film. Surprisingly, both modules deliver the same PCE of η = 4.7%, suggesting that the drying affects the optical appearance of the module but not its electrical performance. Due to slightly different active layer thicknesses of these modules, different values for JSC, VOC and FF are obtained, which are in line with the active layer thickness behaviour shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) for small scale devices.

 Fig. 5  Illuminated IV curves of doctor-bladed (DB) and slot-die coated (SD) semi-transparent modules (59.52 cm2 active areas) on glass/ITO substrates with solution processed AgNW electrodes and a GFF of 93%. The solvent system for all modules beside the oMA marked one is CB:BrA. The temperature values correspond to the drying temperature of the active layer wet film in the oMA case. 
 Fig. 6  Normalised absorbance spectra taken at different positions from P3HT:IDTBR modules doctor bladed from oMA based ink. The wet film from these modules was dried at (a) 75 °C and (b) 60 °C. The colour of the spectra curve is measured at the respective same coloured position of the modules photograph, shown as inset. 
While doctor blading serves as a good model technique for large area coating, slot die coating is much more appropriate for high throughput production. We therefore tested, as a proof of concept, the applicability of slot die coating to the CB:BrA based active layer inks, applying the same module architecture, materials and post-treatment of the modules as used for doctor blading. The IV-curve of the best resulting P3HT:IDTBR module is given in Fig. 5 with a FF of 64.9% and a PCE of 4.4% (Table 3). The short circuit current is somewhat smaller than for the doctor bladed counterpart. This is due to small shunts in the active layer, which limits the performance of this specific module, as can be seen in the DLIT image (Fig. S10, ESI†). We assume that the slot-die coating process, typically encompassing a wide parameter space, is not optimized to its full extent. The P3HT:PCBM module processed with slot die coating shows the same trend reaching an efficiency of 2.3%. A further advantage of slot die coating over doctor blading is the homogeneity of the deposited layers, as demonstrated by spatially resolved transmission spectra (Fig. S11, ESI†). Fig. S11 (ESI†) compares the transmission spectra of modules processed by slot die coating and doctor blading, respectively, at opposite ends of the module. As can be seen, there is a substantial gradient of transmission for the doctor bladed module, increasing from T = 1.5% to 6.2% (for the P3HT:IDTBR module processed from CB:BrA), whereas the slot die coated module exhibits a homogeneous transparency of 6.2% over the whole module. The excellent homogeneity of the modules is also demonstrated by the DLIT images provided in Fig. S10 (ESI†). Overall, we have demonstrated that highly efficient and visually attractive P3HT:IDTBR modules can be manufactured by high throughput processes such as slot die coating using environmentally acceptable solvents.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have developed an efficient and robust process for the roll-to-roll (R2R) production of OPV modules based on P3HT:IDTBR blends. The successful transfer from small spin coated hero cells to fully printed, semi-transparent devices with R2R compatible layer stacks was achieved by employing transport layers and a top electrode which can be printed from solution and which do not need any high temperature post treatment. Halogenated solvents for the deposition of the active layer were replaced by green formulations without causing significant losses in efficiency. For the selection of suitable green solvents, a new method based on the Hansen solubility parameter concept was employed, by using temperature dependent Hansen spheres. This method allows us to replace solvent/additive mixtures by single solvents whose donor/acceptor selectivity is controlled by the processing temperature. Based on the developed efficient and robust layer stacks, modules of 600 times the size of the lab cells were manufactured by the combination of R2R compatible coating techniques and laser patterning, losing only 7% in efficiency upon this transition. As a result, P3HT:IDTBR based modules deliver 5.0% power conversion efficiency. For modules processed from green solvent formulations efficiencies of 4.7% were achieved. The semi-transparent modules produced in this work possess a highly attractive layout without any visible circuitry, achieving a geometric fill factor of 93%.

Broader context
Organic photovoltaics are penetrating the market of building integrated photovoltaics. The technology features an excellent carbon footprint and the possibility of being manufactured by roll-to-roll printing lines. The immense potential of low cost energy generation by printed photovoltaics on rigid or flexible substrates continues to be a main driver for researchers to further improve the fundamental understanding and applicability of this technology. Important challenges towards a successful commercialization are the stability, efficiency and large-area processing of organic solar modules. The latter needs to be compatible with prevailing industrial and environmental standards. The freedom of design of the modules, a key advantage over mainstream silicon photovoltaics, plays an equally important role. Laser patterning of modules and the use of semi-transparent electrodes increase the visual appeal of organic solar modules, but on the way from small spin coated laboratory solar cells to roll-to-roll printable life size modules, a series of technological obstacles need to be overcome. Here, we present important progress in terms of manufacture, efficiency and stability of organic solar modules based on an emerging class of a small molecule semiconductor and innovative processing methods.

The solvent system for all modules beside the oMA marked one is CB:BrA. The temperature values correspond to the drying temperature of the active layer wet film in the oMA case.	 

 	Fig. 6  Normalised absorbance spectra taken at different positions from P3HT:IDTBR modules doctor bladed from oMA based ink. The wet film from these modules was dried at (a) 75 °C and (b) 60 °C. The colour of the spectra curve is measured at the respective same coloured position of the modules photograph, shown as inset.
