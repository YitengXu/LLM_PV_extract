Compared to standard CBZ washing, the CBZ + PCBM hybrid washing technique endows perovskite films with a pinhole-free and compact surface morphology. Surface topography combined with phase imaging using atomic force microscopy showed that PCBM could fill up the voids and pinholes on the perovskite surfaces. Inverted planar perovskite solar cells processed using this new approach exhibited an impressive increase in the average fill factor from 0.583 to 0.747 for 40 tested devices by reducing charge recombination through the pinholes, which also contributed to an enhancement of the power conversion efficiency of the best performing cells of about 16.1% (from 9.48 to 11.01%). Furthermore, the fabricated devices showed negligible hysteresis phenomena. The presented results suggest a new and simple approach that reinforces the feasibility of low-temperature-processed inverted planar perovskite photovoltaics with enhanced performances.
Introduction
Organic/inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskite solar cells using methyl ammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3, MAPbI3) have received considerable attention due to significant advantages, such as high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 20%,1–4 simple solution processing, and low fabrication cost.5–7 These benefits offer perovskite photovoltaic (PV) technology that can compete with standard silicon (Si)-based PV PCEs (20–25%)8 even though there are still some issues with long-term reliability,9 Pb-reduction,10–12 and large-area coating.1,13 Research to resolve these remaining problems is underway, which may create new solutions for the industrialization of perovskite solar cells.
In contrast to Si PV cells using Si wafers (typically ∼200 μm thick), perovskite has strong absorption capacity, so only a thin film of 200–400 nm is required to absorb most incident sunlight. For efficient carrier generation and collection, the thin perovskite absorber should be formed with a uniform dense morphology.14–17 When the perovskite absorber is spin-coated on a titanium dioxide (TiO2) mesoporous layer, the perovskite precursor solution infiltrates into the underlying mesoporous structure, and it has been reported that a uniform surface can be formed, compared to the planar construction of perovskite devices.18–20 However, the typical annealing temperature of the TiO2 mesoporous layer has been reported to be as high as 500 °C, and thus a planar structure using poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) as the hole transport layer (HTL) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the electron transport layer (ETL) has been developed for a low temperature and cost effective process.21–23 Also, other fullerene and/or fullerene derivative based materials have also been utilized as interlayers or ETLs.24–27 On the other hand, it has been reported that solvents in the perovskite precursor evaporate rapidly during spin-coating and often create a non-uniform, rough surface morphology, which causes the formation of vacancies and/or pinholes on the perovskite surface.16,17,28 These can promote undesirable recombination and low shunt resistance due to direct contact of the ETL (i.e., PCBM) with the underlying HTL (i.e., PEDOT:PSS) through the perovskite layer. Both one-29–31 and two-step32,33 coating techniques have been suggested for obtaining a uniform and planar surface for the perovskite coating. In addition, an anti-solvent dripping process during perovskite spin-coating has been developed, which could provide a more uniform surface topography.14,16,34,35 Post-annealing with a multi-step slow annealing process after perovskite spin-coating has been shown to improve the uniformity of the perovskite surface.36 However, both the two-step process and the multi-step annealing process may be complex to prepare and control for commercialization of perovskite solar cells. Hence, a very simple process offering enhanced uniformity of the perovskite layer is required.
In this study, we focus on a simple one-step process with a non-polar solvent washing process during perovskite spin-coating. Above all, the effect of addition of 6,6-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) to chlorobenzene (CBZ) washing solution on the surface topography of the perovskite absorber was studied. The CBZ + PCBM mixed solution was expected to perform two functions: (1) the CBZ can quench out the perovskite precursor solvent (i.e. dimethylformamide, DMF) to avoid uncontrolled evaporation of DMF and formation of a rough surface, and (2) PCBM may be incorporated into some pinholes and/or vacancies in the perovskite films. Thus, the hybrid washing solutions containing various PCBM concentrations were used for washing during perovskite spin-coating, and structural, optical, and morphological analyses were performed on the perovskite films obtained. On the basis of our experimental results, this unique CBZ + PCBM hybrid solution could be used to fabricate pinhole-free, dense and planar perovskite surfaces without changing the principal crystalline structure of the mixed halide perovskite (i.e., MAPbI3−xClx). Furthermore, hybrid washing did not deteriorate the absorption properties of perovskite films compared with controlled washing using only CBZ without PCBM. These advances affected the achievement of a substantial improvement in the fill factor (FF), which contributed to the enhancement of the PCEs (9.48% → 11.01%) of the fabricated perovskite solar cells with planar-type structures.
Experimental procedure
To prepare the perovskite precursor, commercial material powders, such as methylammonium iodide (MAI; Lumtec 99.99%, LT-S9126), lead(II) iodide (PbI2; Alfa Aesar 99.9985%), and lead(II) chloride (PbCl2; Alfa Aesar 99.999%, metals basis), were used without any further processing. Dimethylformamide (99.5%) and γ-butyrolactone (GBL; 99.5%) were used as main solvents, PCBM (Nano-C, 99.5%) was used as the ETL, and PEDOT:PSS (Clevious PVP AI 4083) was used as the HTL.
For the preparation of the perovskite precursor, mixed halide perovskite (MAPbI3−xClx) with a material composition of MAI:PbCl2:PbI2 = 2:1:1 was used based on mixed solvents of composition DMF:GBL = 97:3 (v/v). Hydroiodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in H2O, distilled, stabilized, 99.95%; Sigma-Aldrich) of about 10 vol% of the main solvents was added to the perovskite precursor after overnight stirring at 65 °C. CBZ was used in the washing treatment for the perovskite absorber layer. In addition, various PCBM solutions were made by mixing 1 μL, 5 μL, 10 μL, 40 μL, and 80 μL of PCBM (2 wt% in CBZ) with 4 mL of CBZ, to create additional CBZ + PCBM solutions for the washing treatment. The CBZ + PCBM solutions were prepared as shown in Fig. 1(a). The PEDOT:PSS solution was used as is, and spin-coated after filtering through 0.45 μm hydrophilic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) for HTL coating. The PCBM ETL was made by preparing a solution of 20 mg of PCBM in 1 mL of CBZ.

(b) Solvent dripping process using CBZ only or CBZ + PCBM hybrid solutions for perovskite coating. 
For the device fabrication process, Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO) glass substrates (15 Ω sq−1) were ultrasonically cleaned with acetone (10 min), methyl alcohol (10 min), and IPA (10 min). After UV-ozone treatment (20 min), the PEDOT:PSS HTL was spin-casted on the ITO substrates at a spin-speed of 4000 rpm for 50 s, and the substrates were then annealed at 140 °C for 20 min in atmospheric air. Then, MAPbI3−xClx perovskite films (∼400 nm) were spin-coated at 5000 rpm as the absorber layer of the solar cells. Non-polar solvent washing with CBZ was carried out during spin-coating. The mixed CBZ + PCBM solutions were also used to quench the main solvent, DMF, in the perovskite films. The perovskite films were then annealed at 75 °C for 60 min to further remove residual solvents. Next, PCBM ETL was spin-casted at 1500 rpm for 35 s, and device fabrication was completed by making aluminum (Al) electrodes using a thermal-evaporation system.
The perovskite films treated with the CBZ + PCBM solutions were characterized using ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry (UV-2700; Shimadzu) to check the variation in the absorbance of the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite films. Structural properties of the perovskite films were measured and analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) (R&D-100; Rigaku SmartLab). The surface morphologies of the films were investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (Ultra Plus; Zeiss) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (SA-AFM; Proves Inc.). Also, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping and phase imaging techniques were also carried out to elucidate the PCBM location more directly. The film thicknesses were checked using a surface profiler (D-100; KLA Tencor). Additionally, we performed measurement of time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of the perovskite films made with and without various PCBM contents (from 10 μL to 80 μL). Carrier lifetimes of the perovskite light harvesters were obtained by measuring high sensitivity spectrophotofluorometry with time correlated single photon counting (HORIBA SCIENTIFIC; Fluorolog3 with TCSPC) at room temperature. For excitation of carriers, a NanoLED (wavelength: 260 ± 10 nm, pulse width: <1.2 ns) with a typical power of 1–2 pJ pulse−1 was applied with a repetition rate of 1 MHz. A detector consisting of a single photon counting photomultiplier was employed for this TRPL measurement. The fabricated perovskite solar cells were characterized using a solar simulator (Polaronix K201; McScience) under AM 1.5 solar spectrum under standard conditions (100 mW cm−2, 25 °C) to evaluate current–voltage (J–V) properties.
Results and discussion
The mixed halide perovskite (MAPbI3−xClx) absorbers were made using CBZ only or CBZ + PCBM hybrid washing solutions (Fig. 1(a)) and these solutions were dripped onto the substrate for 6 s after perovskite spin-coating at 5000 rpm to quickly quench the solvents in the perovskite precursor solution, as shown in Fig. 1(b). In addition, a perovskite coating without any washing was also attempted; however, this sample had a very rough surface and a gray color, in contrast to the other well-fabricated perovskite films that were dark brown in color and had mirror-like surfaces after post-annealing. It has been reported previously that rough perovskite films can create many shunt paths in devices and degrade the overall performance.17,27 Hence, the perovskite film washed with CBZ was used as the reference sample.
The XRD measurements were carried out to characterize the structural characteristics of the perovskite films made using the novel washing process, as shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the MAPbI3−xClx perovskite made with the CBZ washing solution exhibited typical principal peaks of (110) and (220), indicative of the tetragonal crystalline phase of perovskite. The perovskite films made using the CBZ + PCBM washing technique (1–80 μL) also showed diffraction patterns similar to the standard perovskite film made using only CBZ. Fig. 2(b) shows the full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of the principal (110) diffraction peak for various perovskite films, and a slightly increasing trend of FWHM values was found when the CBZ + PCBM hybrid treatment was performed. During spin-coating of the perovskite with the dripping CBZ + PCBM hybrid solution, the CBZ quenches most of the main DMF solvent in the perovskite precursor solution. After spin-coating, the post thermal-annealing process converts MAI + PbI2 + PbCl2 into the mixed halide perovskite (MAPbI3−xClx) light harvester by completely evaporating residual solvents in the coated film. During this film formation, we found out that the blended PCBM was not crystallized in the annealing process because there was no PCBM diffraction peak at around 19° in the diffraction pattern.37 Thus, during perovskite film formation, the introduced PCBM would hinder and retard the crystalline growth of MAPbI3−xClx perovskite. And the non-crystalline (amorphous) PCBM might be partly extruded and segregated to vacancies or grain boundaries in the formation of polycrystalline perovskite (MAPbI3−xClx) structures. This will be discussed in detail by analyzing the surface morphologies, as shown in Fig. 3 and 4. A further finding was that there was no peak related to MACl, PbI2, and PbCl2, which suggests that the precursors (MAI + PbI2 + PbCl2) were almost completely converted into the mixed halide perovskite (MAPbI3−xClx) without forming undesirable chlorine or iodine based by-products (MACl, PbI2, PbCl2).38

Fig. 3(a)–(f) shows the surface morphologies of the prepared perovskite films measured using FE-SEM. Also, cross-sectional images of them were also included in Fig. S1 of the ESI.†Fig. 3(a) shows the perovskite film made using the CBZ-only treatment, which shows a clear crystallite domain with large grain sizes (200–600 nm), indicating the formation of polycrystalline structures of the perovskite film. However, several pinholes (marked with red circles) located at grain boundaries were observed on the surface. This can lead to undesirable recombination losses by causing contact points between the ETL and the HTL through the pinholes. For the perovskite film made using the CBZ + PCBM hybrid solution of increased PCBM concentration from 1 to 10 μL, (Fig. 3(b–d)), however, the density of the pinholes near the grain boundaries was significantly reduced. Upon further increasing the PCBM concentration in the washing solution (40–80 μL), furthermore, no pinholes were observed. Formation of crystalline MAPbI3−xClx perovskite occurred as the residual solvents were evaporated during the post thermal-annealing process; at this stage, the PCBM might be extruded and aggregated into the vacancies and/or pinholes as perovskite crystallization proceeded, which could fill up the vacancies and pinholes near the grain boundaries. It can be possible for the PCBM to be segregated from the perovskite crystallites without its crystallization, supported by the XRD analysis in Fig. 2(a). As shown in Fig. 3(e) and (f), irregular stains were observed on the surfaces (marked with yellow circles) and this phenomenon was much more severe for the case of washing with an increased PCBM concentration (80 μL). Upon increasing the PCBM concentration in the washing solution, excess PCBM might not be fully incorporated into the perovskite crystalline structures and could be segregated on the surfaces. This suggested that the addition of excess PCBM could deteriorate the surface morphology, and thus addition of excess PCBM to the washing treatment is undesirable.
The surface morphologies of the perovskite films were further investigated with AFM measurements, as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4(a) shows the surface of the perovskite films made using CBZ washing only, which was found to have a RMS roughness of about 17.8 nm. Because the perovskite film made without any washing showed a roughness of more than 40.0 nm, we can say that the standard CBZ washing treatment worked effectively for planarization of the surface morphology by suppressing uncontrolled crystallization. This result is consistent with the previous study.14 In addition, the RMS roughness decreased to 12.3 nm for the case of the perovskite film processed with an additive solution of 10 μL of PCBM, and the surface was smoother (roughness of 10.5 nm) with the treatment of 40 μL. As shown in Fig. 4(f), the washing technique using an excess of 80 μL of the solution shows a very planar surface (the roughness decreased down to only 8.6 nm), which suggests that a more planar surface topography was obtained by employing the CBZ + PCBM hybrid washing treatment compared to control CBZ washing. It was confirmed that addition of a suitable amount of PCBM during the washing process can lead to the formation of planar and uniform perovskite films, consistent with the above FE-SEM results.
From here, we would like to discuss and support the mechanism of hybrid anti-solvent washing that allows for enhanced morphological results. As found above, a very planar topography of the MAPbI3−xClx perovskite was made by performing secondary washing using CBZ + PCBM hybrid solution. The CBZ itself quenches DMF as described, and PCBM is expected to contribute to constructing a planar surface. As studied in previous work,14 the reported mechanism is that the CBZ as a non-polar solvent can selectively wash DMF out without damaging the perovskite, and thus fast nucleation and crystallization could proceed. Here, we need to elucidate the location and function of added PCBM in the washing treatment for the perovskite film formation.
The introduced PCBM during perovskite spin coating should (1) be mixed into the MAPbI3−xClx perovskite or (2) be separated from the perovskite crystallites. If it is involved in the perovskite matrix, it will have an influence on the perovskite crystalline structure. In this case, as checked in Fig. 2, we found that the tetragonal phase of MAPbI3−xClx perovskite did not change when PCBM was gradually introduced (from 10 μL to 80 μL). Moreover, any crystallization peak regarding PCBM was not observed. From these clues, the introduced PCBM is not involved in the MAPbI3−xClx perovskite crystalline matrix, and it is also not crystallized in the perovskite film.
Hence, there is a substantial possibility that the added PCBM could be extruded and isolated from the perovskite crystallites during nucleation and crystallization of the perovskite. In this case, the PCBM would not give strong impacts on crystalline characteristics and charge-carrier transport dynamics. As confirmed in Fig. 2, there were no changes in principal crystalline structures and only a slight increase in FWHM values with the introduction of increased PCBM (from 1 μL to 80 μL) was found. During nucleation and crystallization of the perovskite, the added PCBM would be extruded into grain boundaries, and thus it might partially cause a spatial limit on the expansion of perovskite crystallites during crystalline growth, which allows for a slight decrease in grain sizes. However, the differences in FWHM and grain sizes by introduction of the PCBM are very small in the experimental results, so it is believed that charge-carrier transport in the perovskite will not be varied much.
In order to experimentally demonstrate the above explanation, we have performed additional measurement of time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of the perovskite films made with and without various introduction of PCBM contents (from 10 μL to 80 μL) as shown in Fig. S2 of the ESI.† The carrier lifetime was estimated by fitting the PL with a double exponential decay model,  where I(t) is the PL intensity, A1 and A2 are coefficients, t is the time after excitation, and τ1 and τ2 are the fast and slow decay lifetimes, respectively. From these measurements we could find that all perovskite films made with only CBZ washing (control) and various CBZ + PCBM hybrid washing amounts (PCBM solution added from 10 μL to 80 μL) showed average charge-carrier lifetimes of about 1.7–2.0 ns, as included in Fig. S2 of the ESI.† Even though PCBM of various concentrations was added during perovskite film formation, almost similar levels in charge carrier lifetimes for the perovskites were observed. This experimental result suggests that the introduced PCBM is not mixed or involved in the perovskite crystalline matrix. Then, it would be separated from the perovskite crystallites and located in vacancies and/or grain boundaries. To elucidate the PCBM location more directly, we have measured energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping and phase imaging modes by AFM to confirm PCBM distribution in the perovskite films.
PCBM is a fullerene derivative material (C72H14O2) consisting of organic components. So, it is rather difficult to detect it easily compared with inorganic materials. However, we tried to check the atomic concentration of carbon in-grain or out of the grain (grain boundaries) since it is based on carbon-chains. Finally, in this point of view, we could find interesting clues from various EDS maps for perovskites made with different washing solutions as shown in Fig. S3(a)–(d) of the ESI.† We observed the difference in carbon content between in-grain and grain boundary areas. As for the perovskites made with CBZ only (Fig. S3(a), ESI†), there was a small difference (0.3 at%) in the carbon content in grain (51.1 at%) and in the grain boundary (51.4 at%). Upon additional PCBM (10 μL)-added solution treatment (Fig. S3(b), ESI†), however, the difference (∼0.8 at%) was increased due to increased carbon concentration near the grain boundary. Moreover, the carbon contents near grain boundaries were observed to have a much higher concentration than those in grain, which showed a remarkable difference (about 3–4 at%) for the perovskite films made using increasing concentrations of PCBM (40–80 μL) additives, as described in Fig. S3(c) and (d) (ESI†). On the basis of the experimental results, we could confirm that the introduced PCBM in our hybrid washing process tends to be segregated near grain boundaries and/or vacancies between grains in perovskites.
Furthermore, efforts to find additional clues have been made to support further our conclusion. As investigated by the above EDS mapping approach, it is strongly thought that the introduced PCBM could locate near the grain boundaries and/or pinholes, which can fill them up and allow for planarization of the surfaces. Here, we focused on cross-checking material information in a different way besides the EDS mapping. Because the gradual evolution of the perovskite films toward planar and void-free surfaces was found by increasing the concentration of the PCBM additive as shown in Fig. 3 and 4, it can be generally thought that some materials are filling up the vacancies and pinholes on the perovskite surfaces. We have carefully measured the phase imaging mode as well as the general topography technique in AFM as shown in Fig. 5 for getting high resolution phase images and finding the materials that contribute to these desirable planar-surfaces. From Fig. 5(a), the perovskite made with CBZ washing showed surface topography with obvious crystallites including grain boundaries. In Fig. 5(f), we could also check the phase imaging of the perovskite (Fig. 5(a)) which showed a black-colored single phase on surfaces. On the other hand, when the PCBM solutions were gradually added from 10 μL to 80 μL, we could clearly find the increased density of the sky-blue phase near grain boundaries in addition to the black phase shown above. When the dominant sky-blue phase observed in the PCBM single layer as references (Fig. 5(e) and (j)) is considered, we found that the sky-blue phase observed near grain boundaries in the perovskites is coincident with the PCBM phase. On the basis of the above investigation, we could confirm that the CBZ + PCBM hybrid washing treatment has little impact on the crystalline structure and photo-physical properties of the perovskite films. More interestingly, however, it contributes to the surface planarization of the perovskite films by the introduction of PCBM into grain boundaries and pinholes.
 Fig. 5  AFM topography images (a–e) and phase images (f–j) of the perovskite films made using the washing solution with various PCBM additive concentrations (1, 5, 10, 40, and 80 μL) and a reference PCBM layer (e and j). 
In order to find the optical characteristics of those perovskite light harvesters made using the hybrid solution, UV-Vis spectrophotometry was used to measure optical absorption. As shown in Fig. S4 of the ESI,† the perovskite films processed with the CBZ + PCBM hybrid treatment exhibited absorption very similar to the film with only CBZ washing. Even though PCBM was added, light harvesting properties were almost not degraded. This can be interpreted as practical light absorption happening in the crystallite domain of perovskite, and excess PCBM filling up the voids and covering the perovskite surfaces would not give a visible impact on light absorption.
In contrast to the hybrid washing, we also considered performing the CBZ/PCBM sequential washing process during perovskite spin coating. Upon suitable analysis of sequential washing, one can figure out the effect of the hybrid washing on materials and device properties very clearly.
Firstly, the crystalline structure of the perovskite made with the sequential washing was measured, and also compared with the films with hybrid washing as below. As described in Fig. S5 (ESI†), identical diffraction peaks suggested that its crystal structure is basically the same as the perovskite films made with the hybrid washing. And the diffraction peaks with relatively less intensity were found for the films made using sequential washing. As for the light harvesting ability, absorption spectra of the perovskite films showed similar levels between sequential washing and hybrid washing. In addition to the structural and optical properties, phase imaging and morphological analysis were also carried out to find the PCBM distribution as above. As revealed in Fig. S6 (ESI†), most of the perovskite surface area was covered with the sky-blue phase which corresponds to the PCBM phase that is included in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Furthermore, CBZ/PCBM sequential washing produced a very rough surface topography for various scales (1 μm × 1 μm, 5 μm × 5 μm, and 10 μm × 10 μm) compared with hybrid washing as illustrated in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Based on these experimental clues, we could elucidate the effect of sequential washing on perovskite film formation. When the first CBZ washing is made during spin coating of perovskite, fast deposition and crystallization proceed by the quenching DMF solvent as reported.14 Then, the subsequent PCBM washing will be performed. Here, penetration of PCBM into grain boundaries would be difficult since fast nucleation and crystallization already proceeded in the first washing step with CBZ. Thus, the dripped PCBM from secondary washing could be mainly deposited on the perovskite surface during spin coating, which could cause an increase in surface roughness, and lead to the detection of the PCBM phase in a large area on the surface. With little impact on structural and optical properties, the perovskite/PCBM multi-layer structure could be formed by the sequential washing. In contrast to this sequential washing, surface topography with various scales for all perovskite films was investigated and is included in Fig. S8 (ESI†). Those films made with hybrid washing could offer a very planar surface that is beneficial for efficient devices.

Fig. 6 depicts the planar-type device structure of the perovskite (400 nm) sandwiched with PEDOT:PSS HTL (30 nm) and PCBM ETL (40 nm), and the output characteristics of the samples prepared here are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 7. Compared to the device with the perovskite made with only CBZ washing, the PCBM + CBZ hybrid treatment contributed to the achievement of an impressive improvement in the fill factor (FF) from 0.583 to 0.747 (average values for 40 devices), which resulted in a PCE increase for all devices. The PCE of the best-performing cells was improved from 9.48 to 11.01% with the suggested hybrid approach (10 μL), and their J–V curves are depicted in Fig. S9 of the ESI.† As described in Table 1, we observed that the average shunt resistance of standard devices was significantly increased (2141 → 4913 Ω cm2) upon treating a hybrid solution of PCBM (80 μL). This advance can be ascribed to the planar and compact surface topography produced by reducing the density of pinholes and vacancies. This can suppress undesirable local current drain and thus increase the FF. In addition, it was also observed that series resistance was also gradually reduced with this suggested treatment, and this may be related to the incorporation of the PCBM into the perovskite absorber because PCBM is more conductive compared to the perovskite light harvester.22 As for the Voc and Jsc values, they revealed much less variation with the different PCBM solution treatment compared to the FF exhibiting remarkable improvements, as expected. The slight decrease in Voc with the introduction of excess PCBM (40–80 μL) might be attributed to inferior surface morphology with irregular distribution of PCBM (stains on surfaces in FE-SEM, Fig. 3(e) and (f)). The above systematic investigations suggested that the hybrid washing solution with a small amount of PCBM is enough to achieve better PV performance due to the advanced properties of void-free planar and clear morphology without PCBM stains on the surface (Fig. 3–5). In addition to these analyses, the hysteresis phenomena of our fabricated perovskite solar cells were also investigated as shown in Fig. 8. The forward and reverse scans (0.01 V s−1) were applied and negligible hysteresis was observed in the devices overall. This can be attributed to the critical quality control of the electronic transport layers (HTL, ETL) and their interfaces with perovskite light harvesters in our device fabrication process.

On the basis of the experimental demonstration, we can conclude that the presented one-step perovskite coating with the PCBM + CBZ hybrid washing technique is essential to obtain perovskite absorbers and thus PV characteristics suitable for planar-type solution processed perovskite solar cells. In addition, this proposed concept is very simple compared to previously reported two-step processes and/or multi-step thermal annealing, in terms of precursor preparation and process steps. Just adding a small amount of PCBM to the typical washing solution could simply enhance the device PCE by 16.1% (from 9.48 to 11.01%) which can be widely used for low-temperature and solution-processed planar perovskite photovoltaic technology.
Conclusions
In this work, a CBZ anti-solvent with a range of concentrations of PCBM was prepared and used for a washing treatment to quickly quench DMF solvent in the perovskite precursor during perovskite spin-coating. This CBZ + PCBM hybrid washing technique offered a more planar surface topography with significantly reduced pinhole density for spin-coated perovskite films. Furthermore, this void-free and dense polycrystalline perovskite film mainly helped in attaining impressive increase in the FF from 0.583 to 0.747 for an average of 40 devices. The improved planar morphology also enhanced the shunt properties of the planar device, which contributed to a PCE enhancement of 16.1% (from 9.48 to 11.01%) in the best performing devices. The presented novel hybrid washing technique with a PCBM additive can simply boost the feasibility of low-temperature-processed inverted planar perovskite devices with enhanced PV performances.
