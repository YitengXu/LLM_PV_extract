    , Accepted 24th May 2016First published on 24th May 2016AbstractThrough the conjunction of tetraphenylethylene and diketopyrrolopyrrole functionalities, a novel four-directional non-fullerene electron acceptor (denoted as 4D) was designed, synthesized and characterized. The new chromophore is highly soluble (for instance >30 mg mL−1 in o-dichlorobenzene), thermally stable, and exhibits energy levels matching those of the conventional and routinely used donor polymer poly(3-hexyl thiophene). A power conversion efficiency of 3.86% was obtained in solution-processable bulk-heterojunction devices with a very high open circuit voltage of 1.18 V.
The development of renewable energy technologies is a pressing desire for modern humans. Natural resources such as solar, water and wind show the most promise in delivering renewable energy, with many approaches being developed to harvest solar energy at an affordable price. The fabrication of organic, otherwise termed bulk-heterojunction, solar cells1 and dye-sensitized solar cells2 is the most studied strategy. The bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) devices recently achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 10%,3 mainly due to the advancement of design and development of novel materials and improvement of device fabrication strategies. This progress is encouraging given the fact that BHJ devices show promise to be transformed into light-weight, flexible and low-cost photovoltaic devices.4 It is imperative to mention that the record PCEs in the research field of organic photovoltaics are a result of narrow band-gap polymer donors together with soluble fullerene acceptors, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and its C71 analogue (PC71BM). It should be noted that such donor polymers are obtained through cumbersome synthetic strategies and tiresome purification procedures, which add to their cost. Concurrently, the fullerene acceptors are expensive too. Despite the fact that fullerene derivatives are dominant acceptors due to their good electron mobility (typically ranging 10−3–10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), excellent solubility and the ability to form a favourable nanoscale network with versatile donor semiconducting components,5 they are afflicted with a number of potential drawbacks. These drawbacks are restricted chemical and energetic tuning via structural modification, weak absorption in the visible spectrum and morphological instability.6 Furthermore, a large electron affinity can result in low open-circuit voltage (Voc).7 Such disadvantages impede the development of fullerene acceptors and have held up further advances in PCEs, providing a strong incentive for research in advancing the design and development of non-fullerene acceptors. Such acceptors must address the limitations of fullerene acceptors, such as strong absorption in the visible region, and limited structural diversity and electronic tunability. Furthermore, a non-fullerene acceptor should retain the properties that make fullerene acceptors attractive, such as strong accepting strength, solubility and thermal stability.
Recent years have seen increased attention paid to the development of non-fullerene acceptors. Reviews by Lin et al. and Sonar et al. highlight the key examples of their development,8 and recent reports exhibit PCEs in the range of 4–8%.9 We have thus seen noteworthy advances in our understanding of the area that lend us the ability to control and predict the properties of a thoughtfully designed chromophore.10 We further believe that for understanding a new type of non-fullerene acceptor, we must consider its suitability with one of the most studied and commercially available polymeric donors, P3HT, in order to evaluate the viability of that acceptor for practical applications. This will help us understand the compatibility between donor and acceptor domains, especially in terms of efficient blend absorption, charge transfer transition and optimum device fabrication conditions. As mentioned above, we understand that a good non-fullerene chromophore must have a conjugated structure through a merger of a variety of building blocks including a donor and an acceptor. We, and others, have been successful in demonstrating a number of potential non-fullerene acceptors where such chromophores have displayed encouraging device performance.9,10 We discerned that strong accepting groups such as diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) can be great allies when used as terminal acceptors in conjunction with central conjugated blocks.10a,b,11 Taking the aforementioned considerations for non-fullerene acceptors, and our understanding of materials' design into account, we explore herein a new non-fullerene acceptor, 6,6′,6′′,6′′′-((ethene-1,1,2,2-tetrayltetrakis(benzene-4,1-diyl))tetrakis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))tetrakis(2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3-(thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione) (coded as 4D) (see Fig. 1), that is (1) a highly conjugated chromophore based on tetraphenylethylene (TPE) and DPP functionalities, (2) synthesized with commercially available substrates in an efficient manner, (3) purified through simple chromatography and (4) displayed good thermal stability with excellent solubility. It was further demonstrated that the envisioned design of 4D was verified as the solution-processable BHJ devices based on the blend of P3HT:4D (1:1.2 w/w) exhibited PCEs as high as 3.86% with high Voc of 1.18 V. These PCE and Voc values are among encouraging literature reports to indicate optimum performance for P3HT-based non-fullerene BHJ devices.9a,i The present work is a continuation of our efforts made in the design and development of small molecular chromophores for organic photovoltaic applications.12
 Fig. 1  Molecular structure of the newly designed and synthesized non-fullerene acceptor, 4D. 
Compound 4D was synthesized in a straightforward manner with high yield via the Suzuki coupling reaction between 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)ethene (2) and commercially available 3-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-6-(thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione. The reaction was conducted in dimethoxyethane at 100 °C for 16 h using sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) as base and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(0) [Pd(PPh3)4] as the catalyst (Scheme S1, see ESI†). 4D was purified via simple column chromatography and its structure was confirmed by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) as well as 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (for synthetic details and experimental spectra see the ESI†). 4D was found to be highly soluble in a variety of common organic solvents such as chloroform, dichlorobenzene and toluene (for instance >30 mg mL−1 in o-dichlorobenzene). High solubility is crucial for fabricating solution-processable roll to roll BHJ devices and 4D fulfils this criterion.
The normalized optical absorption spectra of 4D in chloroform solution and as a thin solid film are shown in Fig. 2. In solution, 4D exhibited strong absorption with an absorption maximum (λmax) at 590 nm. As a thin film, 4D displayed a slightly broader absorption peak and λmax was red-shifted by around 31 nm compared to its solution spectrum, suggesting effective π–π stacking in the solid state. It is imperative to mention that the 4D film revealed intense absorption in the range of 540–800 nm, which complements well with the main absorption of P3HT (380–610 nm), a result that demonstrates panchromatic absorption through the entire visible spectrum and tailing into the near infra-red region.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs13 and the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory indicated that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) orbital densities were evenly disseminated over the entire molecular backbone, a recent finding that is quite customary with small-molecule non-fullerene acceptors9i,10a,b (Fig. S1, ESI†). DFT calculations further revealed that the torsional angle between the thiophene ring planes (of DPP) and phenyl ring planes (of TPE) was ∼20°, thus giving 4D a non-planar structure overall (Fig. S2, ESI†). Such non-planar molecular arrangements in the design of a potential non-fullerene acceptor, for instance 4D, are considered crucial as they can prevent strong intermolecular aggregation, whilst sustaining elongated and effective conjugation in each direction for photon harvesting, as well unveiling adequate π-surfaces for electron transport. This principle has recently been demonstrated by S. Holliday et al.,9a S. Li et al.9i and H. Patil et al.10a The theoretical optical absorption transitions of 4D were also calculated and corroborated our experimental findings (Fig. S3, ESI†). Experimentally, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated/calculated using a combination of photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) and UV-Vis spectroscopy on thin films. The repetitive analyses of HOMO energy levels using pristine and blend films indicated that the average HOMO level resides at around −5.53 eV. The LUMO energy level was calculated using the absorption onset (720 nm) of the 4D film. The energy level diagram suggested that 4D can indeed guarantee a high Voc when fabricated using the conventional donor polymer P3HT (Fig. 3, for energy level diagram and Fig. S4 (ESI†) for PESA curve). The energy level values of P3HT and PC61BM (Fig. 3) were drawn from the work of Y.-J. Cheng et al.14 Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed 4D to be a thermally stable chromophore, meaning that the BHJ devices can be annealed at a higher temperature (e.g. >100 °C), if required (Fig. S5 for TGA curve, ESI†).

Once established that 4D displayed promising optoelectronic and chemical properties, we set out to fabricate solution-processable BHJ devices. As stated earlier, we chose a well-studied and commercially available donor polymer P3HT, and a simple device architecture was chosen to allow convenient analysis of the initial performance, stability and device fabrication conditions. The BHJ device architecture chosen was ITO/PEDOT:PSS (38 nm)/active layer (∼65 nm)/Ca (20 nm)/Al (100 nm) where the active layer was a 1:1.2 blend of P3HT:4D, respectively, spin-cast from o-dichlorobenzene on top of the PEDOT:PSS surface. In terms of device processing conditions, solvent selection and device annealing, it is becoming apparent that the use of a high boiling point solvent combined with annealing at high temperature can indeed affect the device performance. The literature reported by S. Li et al.,9i Y. Kim et al.,15 Y. Lin et al.16 and Patil et al.11a provides this proof of concept, and based on the literature findings and our own understanding of the device architecture we used o-dichlorobenzene as the processing solvent and annealed our active blend surfaces at 110 °C for 5 min.
The BHJ devices showed encouraging performance with a donor:acceptor weight ratio of 1:1.2. The best photovoltaic cell parameters; Voc, short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE, reached 1.18 V, 5.17 mA cm−2, 0.64, and 3.86%, respectively, and all of the fabricated devices yielded a very high Voc, a result consistent with the measured optical band gaps between the LUMO of 4D and the HOMO of P3HT. It is important to point out that the Voc nearing 1.20 V is among the highest voltages exerted by a single junction BHJ device based on the combination of P3HT and a DPP-based non-fullerene acceptor. Annealing of the active film at a higher temperature, for example 120 °C, resulted in slight cracks on surfaces and the device performance dropped below 50%. Unannealed devices with a donor:acceptor weight ratio of 1:1.2 afforded reasonable outcomes too, and the cell parameters, Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE, reached 1.17 V, 3.15 mA cm−2, 0.62 and 2.28%, respectively. In contrast, the maximum PCE, Voc, and Jsc reached 2.85%, 0.61 V and 7.91 mA cm−2, respectively, for a device based on P3HT:PC61BM, when fabricated under similar annealing conditions. For current–voltage (J–V) curves, see Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Current–voltage curve for the best device based on P3HT:4D (1:1.2 w/w) under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5, 1000 W m−2). Device structure was: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (38 nm)/active layer/Ca (20 nm)/Al (100 nm). The active layer was ∼65 nm thick. 
The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement of the blend film with a donor:acceptor weight ratio of 1:1.2 is shown in Fig. S6, ESI.† The analysis revealed that the IPCE spectrum levels out at a value of ∼26% at around 590 nm, and is a broad spectrum IPCE ranging from 300 to 750 nm, typically over the entire visible region. The broadness of this IPCE spectrum implies that 4D is a type of non-fullerene acceptor which can be matched with a variety of donors, such as conjugated polymers and small molecular solids, in order to achieve charge generation over a broad range of wavelengths. The physical microstructure of the blend film was examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode. The actual surface morphology of the blend film of P3HT:4D (1:1.2 w/w) is shown in Fig. 5. The blend appeared to be interlaced and exhibited crystalline grains with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 2.5 nm. Such plaiting of donor and acceptor domains is advantageous to exciton dissociation and can result in an enhanced efficiency of photovoltaic devices. Crystalline grains suggested the domination of P3HT in the blend morphology and grew larger upon annealing, thus increasing the RMS roughness to 5.3 nm. The ubiquitous presence of P3HT in the annealed blend film confirms that the presence of the acceptor domain didn't disrupt the effect of P3HT dominating the surface morphology. It was evident that the AFM analysis supported our physical observation of the annealed blend surface.
 Fig. 5  AFM images for the unannealed (left) and annealed blends (right) with the weight ratios of 1:1.2 (donor:acceptor). RMS roughnesses of 2.5 nm and 5.3 nm were observed for unannealed and annealed surfaces respectively. 
Though the PCE numbers steadily improve with the use of non-fullerene acceptors combined with high performing donor polymers, we believe in continued emphasis on systematic material design, and developing non-fullerene acceptors which can interweave well with the archetypal and commercially available donor polymers, such as P3HT, thus demonstrating their foremost suitability to be an efficient acceptor. Having said this, and taking into account the DPP-based acceptors reported in the literature, it is justifiable to say that the device outcome reported herein provides strong support and incentive for the current research strategy.
In summary, a TPE core-based non-fullerene electron acceptor, 4D, with DPP terminals, was designed and synthesized. 4D possessed a four-directional molecular arrangement, excellent solubility, thermal stability and energy levels matching those of the archetypal donor polymer P3HT. Owing to the favourable morphology and an excellent high Voc of 1.18 V, the BHJ devices based on the P3HT:4D blended films provided a PCE of 3.86%. Not only is 4D the first example in the literature which boasts promising functionalities, such as TPE and DPP, but the device parameters outlined herein are among the leading numerals using a combination of a non-fullerene acceptor and the archetypal donor P3HT. The results indicate that 4D is a propitious non-fullerene acceptor for future applications in BHJ devices.
