    , Accepted 6th January 2020First published on 7th January 2020AbstractPoly[3-(4-carboxybutyl)thiophene-2,5-diyl] (P3CT) has been noticed as a promising hole transport layer (HTL) for high-performance inverted planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to its excellent stability and relatively high hole mobility. As we all know, the morphology of perovskite films is largely influenced by the substrate materials. Considering the affinity of alkali metal ions Rb+ and Cs+ with perovskite materials, inverted perovskite solar cells using alkali metal ion (Rb+, Cs+) doped P3CT (denoted as P3CT-Rb and P3CT-Cs) as the HTLs were investigated in this work. It turned out that the work function (WF) of P3CT-Rb matches well with the valence band of perovskites. The perovskite (MAPbI3−xClx) film deposited on top of the P3CT-Rb film exhibited a dense and uniform morphology with superior crystallinity and few pinholes. Consequently, a high efficiency of 20.52% was achieved for P3CT-Rb HTL-based devices, with an impressive open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.144 V and a high fill factor (FF) of 82.78%.
Introduction
Organometallic halide perovskite semiconductor materials have attracted widespread attention due to their excellent photovoltaic properties such as strong light absorption,1 a suitable optical band edge,2 a long and balanced charge diffusion length,3–7 low cost, and solution processability.8 High-performance devices with a significant increment in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% to 25.2% have been reported since 2009.2,9 Most efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with conventional architectures apply the metal–oxide layer (e.g. ZnO,10 SnO2,11 and TiO212,13) as the electron transport layer (ETL), which usually require a high temperature sintering process. Low-temperature processable and solution-processable inverted planar perovskite solar cells are considered to be more suitable for large-scale commercialization and flexible applications.14,15
In recent years, studies about inverted planar perovskite solar cells have aroused a lot of interest. A photoactive layer in inverted planar PSCs is sandwiched between the bottom hole transporting layer (HTL) and the top electron transporting layer (ETL). The interface between the absorber material and the bottom HTL determines not only the energy level alignment and charge transport, but also the growth of perovskite crystals. Therefore, it is necessary to select suitable hole selective contacts.16,17 Poly[3-(4-carboxybutyl) thiophene-2,5-diyl] (P3CT) HTLs possess excellent stability, and relatively high hole mobility,18–20 which have achieved considerable efficiency in PSCs. P3CT-Na is the most widely used P3CT material, and a lot of work based on P3CT-Na as a HTL in inverted PSCs has been reported.21–25 However, P3CT-Na still has some drawbacks, such as strong aggregation tendency, unwell-matched energy alignment and large surface energy. Strategies were carried out to improve the efficiency of PSCs based on the P3CT HTL. As reported by X. Li et al.,26 the strong aggregation of P3CT-Na can be controlled by developing P3CT-CH3NH2 through counterion tailoring. J. Li et al.27 reported doped graphdiyne in P3CT-K to improve the surface wettability of HTLs to enhance the device performance. In order to further improve the device performance of PSCs based on the P3CT-HTLs, it is necessary to explore a more effective engineering strategy.
Fig. S1† presents the fill factor (FF) vs. open-circuit voltage (Voc) scatter plot based on the reported inverted PSCs using P3CT HTLs. According to current reports, Voc of the P3CT HTL-based devices is generally not high (Voc < 1.1 V),19,26–29 and the low Voc is the main reason for inferior efficiency of P3CT-based inverted PSCs. The main factors affecting Voc are the work function (WF) of the HTL and the quality of perovskite films in inverted PSCs.30,31 In order to improve Voc of inverted PSCs, well-matched energy levels between HTLs and perovskite materials and uniform perovskite films are necessary. For inverted PSCs, the choice of HTLs is critical because it is related to the energy level requirement and also it will directly affect the perovskite film quality, as the perovskite film is deposited on top of the HTL. Considering the successful application of RbCl and CsCl in inorganic perovskites solar cells,32–34 we hypothesized that the affinity of the alkali metal ions Rb+ and Cs+ with perovskites will help to improve the quality of the perovskite films deposited on P3CT-Rb and P3CT-Cs HTLs.35 On the other hand, the doping of Rb+ or Cs+ ions may affect the work function of the conjugated polymer P3CT. Herein, Rb+ and Cs+ doped P3CT was applied as the hole transport layer for inverted perovskite solar cells. It turned out that the work function of P3CT-Rb matches well with the valence band of the perovskite. Meanwhile, the perovskite (MAPbI3−xClx) film deposited on top of the P3CT-Rb film exhibited a dense and uniform morphology with superior crystallinity and lower pinhole density. As a result, devices based on the P3CT-Rb HTL achieved a high PCE of 20.52%, with an excellent Voc of 1.144 V, a high FF of 82.78% and a short circuit current (Jsc) of 21.67 mA cm−2. Devices based on the P3CT-Cs HTL achieved a high PCE of 18.80%, with a Voc of 1.116 V, a FF of 80.07% and a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.04 mA cm−2. So far the Voc and FF achieved in this work represent one of the highest results in inverted MA-based PSCs incorporating the P3CT-M HTLs.
Results and discussion
P3CT-M was synthesized by different alkali metal ions reacting with P3CT (M represents the Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+ ions, respectively). P3CT-Na and P3CT-K were reported before and here were used as control conditions. The chemical structure of P3CT-Rb is shown in Fig. 1(a). We measured the film thickness of different P3CT-M HTLs deposited from 1 mg mL−1 aqueous solution, and found that these P3CT-M films all showed similar thicknesses around 5 nm. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was employed to confirm the existence of the alkali metal ions in P3CT-M films. As depicted in Fig. S2,† survey spectra of the P3CT-Rb film show the Rb 4f peak, which indicates that Rb+ ions were successfully introduced into the P3CT films. And also the Na 1s, K 2p, and Cs 3d peaks were found in P3CT-Na, P3CT-K, and P3CT-Cs films, respectively. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the same thickness P3CT-M films are shown in Fig. S3.† The four different P3CT-M HTLs all exhibit small roughness around 4.5 nm. The favourable morphology could improve the coverage of the charge transport layer on the transparent electrode, which can help to reduce current leakage in the device and increase the effective hole transport of the HTLs. Moreover, the smooth surface of HTL could provide good contact for the upper perovskite.

The UV-Vis transmission spectra of P3CT-M films are provided in Fig. S4(a);† it can be seen that the four different P3CT-M hole transport layers all exhibit high optical transmittance (90%). The excellent transmittance of all the P3CT-M films ensures that optical transparency of all the P3CT-M films was not affected by the doped metal ions. The UV-Vis absorption of the P3CT-M films was measured. As shown in Fig. S4(b),† the absorption peak of P3CT-Na, P3CT-K and P3CT-Cs films shows a red shift of 19 nm, 19 nm, and 32 nm compared to that of the P3CT-Rb film, respectively. This indicates that the aggregation of P3CT-Na, P3CT-K and P3CT-Cs films is more severe than that of the P3CT-Rb film. The ionic radius of Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+ is 1.02 Å, 1.38 Å, 1.52 Å, and 1.67 Å, respectively. The reason why P3CT-Rb forms appropriate molecular aggregation may be that the ionic radius of Rb+ is moderate, while P3CT-Na, P3CT-K and P3CT-Cs show more serious molecular aggregation perhaps due to the inappropriate ionic radius, that is, the radius of Na+ and K+ is too small and the radius of Cs+ is too large. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) with He I (21.22 eV) was used to measure the WF of the different P3CT HTLs with the same thickness (∼5 nm), as illustrated in Fig. 1b. The energy level diagram of the device studied is shown in Fig. 1c. As we can see, the WF of P3CT-K, P3CT-Rb and P3CT-Cs is larger than that of the P3CT-Na. The significantly augmented WF of P3CT-K and P3CT-Rb could provide better energy level alignment between the HTLs and the valence band edge of the perovskite, which may help to improve Voc of the corresponding devices. To evaluate the resistance and hole transport properties of different P3CT-M films with the same thickness (∼5 nm), half devices with the sandwiched structure of ITO/P3CT-M/Ag were fabricated to record the dark J–V curves. As depicted in Fig. 1d, a steeper J–V curve of the P3CT-Rb-based device than that of the other devices is observed. In other words, the P3CT-Rb film exhibits lower resistance and better conductivity than the other P3CT-M HTL, which is consistent with the EIS results, as we will discuss in the following part. The hole mobility of different P3CT-M HTLs is measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with hole-only devices (ITO/P3CT-M (M = Na+, K+, Rb+ or Cs+)/MoO3/Ag), in which the film thickness for different P3CT HTLs is about 30 nm. As shown in Fig. S5,† the hole mobility of P3CT-Na, P3CT-K, P3CT-Rb and P3CT-Cs is 2.83 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 3.03 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 3.74 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 3.27 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. We can see that the hole mobility of P3CT-Rb is higher than that of the other P3CT HTLs.

Fig. 2a shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of perovskite films deposited on different P3CT-M HTLs; we can see that the absorbance of the perovskite deposited on the P3CT-Rb HTL is slightly enhanced. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was utilized to characterize the crystallinity of the perovskite films prepared on different P3CT-M HTLs. As displayed in Fig. 2b, there is no obvious shift in the position of the peak, which identifies the phase purity of the MAPbI3−xClx layer coated on the P3CT-M HTLs. On the other hand, there is a visible increase in the intensity of the main peak (110) of the perovskite film deposited on P3CT-Rb, indicating the enhanced crystallinity of the perovskite.

Additionally, the influence of the different P3CT-M layers on the perovskite morphology was assessed by using top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. Perovskite films with smooth morphology and enhanced crystallinity are necessary for enhanced device performance. SEM images of perovskite films deposited on different P3CT-M layers are illustrated in Fig. 3a–d; it is observed that the perovskite films deposited on the P3CT-Rb HTL show a more uniform surface morphology with larger crystals than that on the other P3CT-M HTLs. Large grains mean that the perovskite films have fewer trap centers, thus facilitating charge transfer. From the magnified SEM images depicted in Fig. S6,† pin-holes are clearly seen on the perovskite films deposited on the P3CT-Na, P3CT-K, and P3CT-Cs HTLs. The perovskite film prepared on P3CT-Rb showed much fewer pin-holes. Lots of pin-holes may lead to the poor charge transfer in P3CT-Na, P3CT-K and P3CT-Cs-based devices. AFM images of perovskite films deposited on different P3CT-HTLs were recorded. As shown in Fig. 3e–4h, perovskite films deposited on P3CT-Na, P3CT-K, P3CT-Rb, and P3CT-Cs show a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 27.0 nm, 19.2 nm, 15.2 nm, and 17.1 nm, respectively. This demonstrates that perovskite films deposited on P3CT-Rb form a smoother surface compared to other HTLs. Such a smooth surface can serve as an efficient contact between the perovskite and electron transport layer, which is beneficial for charge transfer.

The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are given in Table 1. Excitingly, P3CT-Rb-based devices show an impressive Voc of 1.144 V, a high FF of 82.78% and a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 21.67 mA cm−2, leading to a PCE of 20.52%, which is significantly higher than that of the control devices based on P3CT-Na showing a PCE of 17.4% (Voc = 1.066 V, FF = 78.51%, Jsc = 20.79 mA cm−2). P3CT-K and P3CT-Cs-based devices show a PCE of 17.95% and 18.80%, respectively.

The remarkably enhanced Voc of the P3CT-Rb-based device benefits from the improved perovskite film quality and the well-matched energy level alignment between P3CT-Rb and perovskite materials. Although P3CT-K and P3CT-Cs also exhibit well-matched energy levels with the perovskite, a large number of pin-holes in perovskite films deposited on the two HTLs may lead to a lower Voc in P3CT-K and P3CT-Cs-based devices. The enhanced Jsc in the P3CT-Rb-based device is attributed to the enhanced charge transfer and the better conductivity of the P3CT-Rb HTL. The notably increased FF means a more balanced charge transfer inside the cells,36 which is attributed to the perovskite film morphology with fewer pin-holes and the better conductivity of the P3CT-Rb HTL. An Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) was used to test whether Na+, K+, Rb+ or Cs+ has diffused into perovskite layers. Fig. S8† shows the EDS diagram of the cross section of P3CT-M/perovskite/ITO. There are no Na+, K+, and Rb+ detected in perovskite layers, indicating that Na+, K+, and Rb+ did not diffuse into the perovskite layer. The detection of Cs+ in the perovskite layer indicates that Cs+ may have diffused into the perovskite layer. This indicates that the enhanced performance of perovskite solar cells is not the result of the diffusion of alkali metal ions into the perovskite layer. The well-matched energy level, high hole mobility, high hole extraction ability and good contact of the P3CT-Rb hole transport material may account for the high performances of the P3CT-Rb-based device.
External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement results are illustrated in Fig. 4c. The calculated integrated Jsc values for devices based on P3CT-Na, P3CT-K, P3CT-Rb, and P3CT-Cs are 19.98 mA cm−2, 19.91 mA cm−2, 20.73 mA cm−2, and 20.21 mA cm−2 respectively, which are consistent with the J–V measurements.
In addition, PSCs based on the P3CT-Rb HTL achieved a high efficiency of 20.52% from forward scanning and a comparable efficiency of 20.41% from reverse scanning, indicating a negligible hysteresis effect, as compared to the P3CT-Na-based devices (Fig. 4d). The device normally showed low hysteresis due to the balanced charge transport at the perovskite/HTL interfaces and ideal charge transport inside the perovskite layer.37 The higher conductivity and hole mobility of the P3CT-Rb film facilitate charge transport in the device and reduce device hysteresis. P3CT-Na-based devices show a significant hysteresis effect, which may be derived from the accumulation of ions at the interface between the P3CT-Na HTL and perovskite.38 The hysteresis effect of the devices based on P3CT-K and P3CT-Cs HTLs is shown in Fig. S7(b).† Devices based on P3CT-K and P3CT-Cs HTLs also show a smaller hysteresis effect than the P3CT-Na device. As shown in Fig. S7(c–f),† the stabilized PCE and Jsc of the device based on different P3CT HTLs were evaluated at the maximum power point (MPP). The stabilized Jsc of P3CT-Na, P3CT-K, P3CT-Rb and P3CT-Cs-based devices is 18.84 mA cm−2, 18.74 mA cm−2, 19.93 mA cm−2, and 19.55 mA cm−2, and the stabilized PCE is 17.14%, 17.42%, 19.13%, and 18.18% for these devices, respectively. The results reflect that all the devices show a stable output.
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskite films are shown in Fig. S9† to analyze the hole extraction ability of different HTLs.39,40 The strong fluorescence emission in the pristine perovskite film is significantly quenched after coating the P3CT-M HTMs. P3CT-Rb shows a more pronounced fluorescence quenching effect than the other HTMs, meaning that the P3CT-Rb layer exhibits more efficient hole extraction ability. To further understand the dynamic recombination and charge carrier lifetimes of devices based on P3CT-Na and P3CT-Rb HTL layers, transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) were measured and the results are provided in Fig. 5a and b.41,42 The P3CT-Rb-based device exhibited an obviously faster photocurrent decay compared to the P3CT-Na-based device, indicating a faster photogenerated hole transport in the P3CT-Rb-based device. This result could be attributed to the more efficient hole extraction ability and much higher hole mobility of the P3CT-Rb layer, as compared to the P3CT-Na HTL. TPV was measured under open circuit conditions. The P3CT-Rb-based device shows longer charge carrier lifetime than the P3CT-Na device. The longer photovoltage decay implied that the generated charge carriers possess a longer time to achieve the spatial separation of electrons and holes in the device, which could suppress the non-radiative charge recombination and thus improve device performance.43–45

Fig. 6 shows the Nyquist plots obtained by performing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for the device based on different P3CT-M HTLs to study the charge transfer dynamics.46,47 EIS was performed under dark conditions at 0.94 V forward bias. According to the Nyquist plots provided by EIS, the series resistance (Rs) of P3CT-Na, P3CT-K, P3CT-Rb, and P3CT-Cs-based devices was 28.01 Ω, 20.44 Ω, 18.87 Ω, and 21.43 Ω, respectively. The minimum Rs in the P3CT-Rb-based device was ascribed to the reduced contact resistance. The radius of the semicircle represents the recombination resistance (Rrec). The biggest semicircle observed in the P3CT-Rb-based device among the P3CT-M-based devices suggests the smallest charge recombination in the former device. It is known that large Rrec results in small charge recombination and then the increased Voc.48 Overall speaking, the smaller Rs and larger Rrec are beneficial for the separation and transportation of photogenerated carriers in devices using the P3CT-Rb HTL.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated a facile method to engineer the P3CT HTL by doping rubidium ions. The effect of rubidium ions on the HTL could be explained in two aspects. On the one hand, the P3CT-Rb can appropriately mitigate molecular aggregation of the P3CT polymer and improve its WF and conductivity. On the other hand, due to the affinity of P3CT-Rb with perovskites, a high quality perovskite film with superior crystallinity and low pinhole density was obtained. Consequently, a high performance of 20.52% was achieved in P3CT-Rb-based inverted PSCs with a large open-circuit voltage of 1.144 V and a high FF of 82.76%, with negligible hysteresis.
