    , Accepted 8th December 2010First published on 10th January 2011AbstractNovel A–D–A type oligothiophenes incorporating benzothiadiazole (BTDA) and thiadiazolopyridine (TDAPy) as terminal acceptor groups have been developed for small molecule organic solar cells (SMSC). In vacuum-processed planar heterojunction solar cells the TDAPy-based oligomer showed a power conversion efficiency of 3.15% and a high fill factor of 0.67.
Organic solar cells are promising candidates for low cost photovoltaic applications, since they can be fabricated at low temperatures and on flexible substrates.1 During the last decade, there has been enormous synthetic effort to develop multifunctional organic semiconducting materials for solar cell applications, resulting in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 7%.2 Due to high absorption coefficients of organic dyes, very thin photovoltaic devices can be realized with low material consumption. Solution-processed organic solar cells are built on the concept of a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture using a blend of a soluble electron-rich compound as the donor and an electron-poor fullerene as the acceptor. Vacuum-processed planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells based on dicyanovinyl-substituted oligothiophenes (DCVnT) have been reported with photovoltages as high as 1.0 V and PCEs of up to 3.4%.3 Very recently, this has been improved to PCEs as high as 5.2% by co-evaporation of a non-alkylated DCV5T-derivative as the donor and C60 as the acceptor.4 The resulting bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure not only provides a large area donor–acceptor interface for charge separation, but also leads to a bicontinous interpenetrating network for charge transport.
So far, benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BTDA) is among the most popular acceptor moieties used in low band gap materials for organic solar cell applications. For this purpose, the BTDA unit has been combined with various electron-rich building blocks.5 Motivation for incorporating the heterocyclic BTDA into π-conjugated systems is its excellent thermal stability, high absorption coefficient, suitable HOMO and LUMO energy levels, and strong intermolecular π–π interactions leading to ordered morphologies in the solid state. In BHJ solar cells, polymers comprising BTDA moieties as acceptors showed efficiencies close to 6%.5e,6
Analogous thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (TDAPy) represents a pyridine-based acceptor moiety which is less explored in the field of organic photovoltaics. Leclerc et al. recently prepared a low band gap polymer comprising TDAPy and carbazole units for use in solution-processed BHJ solar cells.7 In comparison to the corresponding BTDA polymer, the pyridine moiety of TDAPy decreased both HOMO and LUMO energy levels, resulting in a low band gap of 1.73 eV. A BHJ solar cell gave a moderate PCE of 0.7%. In any case, the TDAPy unit could be an interesting moiety for the construction of oligomers for vacuum-processed small molecule solar cells (SMSC), because of (1) its greater acceptor strength compared to BTDA and (2) the additional nitrogen at the pyridine of the TDAPy unit, which could lead to better stacking in the solid state, due to stronger intermolecular interactions. In this communication, we report the synthesis, characterization and application of novel A–D–A type oligothiophenes, comprising a terthiophene donor end-capped with electron accepting BTDA or TDAPy moieties. The use of these materials as donors in m–i–p-type planar and bulk heterojunction solar cells prepared by a vacuum sublimation technique is described.
The new A–D–A oligothiophenes were synthesized according to Scheme 1. Terthiophene 3 was prepared according to the literature8 and reacted with n-BuLi and trialkyltin chloride to give bis-stannylated terthiophenes 4a and 4b in 77 and 50% yields, respectively. A microwave-assisted Pd0-catalysed Stille-type coupling reaction of 4a and 4-bromobenzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole9 afforded BTDA3T 1 in 21% yield. Thiadiazolopyridine-functionalized pentamer 2 was synthesized in analogy to BTDA3T 1. Thiadiazolopyridine 6 was obtained in 19% yield by ring closure reaction of 2-bromopyridine-3,4-diamine10 with thionyl chloride.7 Microwave-assisted Stille coupling of 4b and 6 gave TDAPy3T 2 as a dark red powder in 48% yield. The good performance of compound 6 in Stille-type coupling reactions might be due to the fact that (1) the nitrogen coordinatively binds to the Pd-center during the catalytic cycle11 and (2) the electron deficiency of the chloride facilitates oxidative addition during the catalytic cycle.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of oligomers 1 and 2. 
Compounds 1 and 2 displayed good thermal stability with onset of decomposition temperatures (Td) at about 420 and 397 °C, respectively, which was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S1, ESI†).

Electronic absorption spectra of 1 and 2 in dichloromethane are displayed in Fig. 1 and corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. BTDA-derivative 1 showed a longest wavelength absorption maximum at 458 nm. This corresponds to a blue-shift of about 50 nm compared to the analogue DCV end-capped terthiophene (DCV3T).12 The hypsochromic shift can be assigned to the weaker acceptor strength of the terminal BTDA functionalities compared to the DCV units. In contrast, TDAPy3T 2 has a longest wavelength absorption at 496 nm, which is red-shifted by 38 nm compared to 1 and is in agreement with the increased acceptor strength of the TDAPy moiety. The observed multiple absorption bands for these oligomers at higher energies (<400 nm) can be assigned to the combined transitions of the terminal chromophores and the terthiophene core.

Compared to the solution spectra, the absorption spectra of 1 and 2 in thin films prepared by vacuum sublimation are significantly red-shifted (Fig. 1). Compounds 1 and 2 showed absorption maxima at 503 and 548 nm, respectively. The reason for this red-shift in the thin films is presumably intermolecular π–π stacking and ordering of the molecules in the bulk. The optical band gaps Egopt in the films were 2.0 and 1.87 eV for 1 and 2, respectively, which are about 0.29 and 0.22 eV lower compared to the band gaps determined from solution spectra. The significant broadening of the absorption spectrum of 2 as compared to 1 may indicate better ordering of the molecules in the bulk and is manifested in the behavior of the external quantum efficiency (EQE).
In cyclic voltammetry measurements, two reversible or quasi-reversible 1e−oxidation waves were observed for 1 and 2, which can be assigned to the stepwise oxidation of the oligothiophene core and formation of radical cations and dications, respectively (Table 1). Furthermore, compounds 1 and 2 showed each a fully reversible 2e−reduction wave, which is correlated to the reduction of the terminal acceptors and the formation of independent radical anions. Reflecting the stronger electron withdrawing nature of the pyridine-based acceptor group, TDAPy3T 2 showed a first oxidation potential at 0.63 V and a reduction potential at −1.56 V, which is positively shifted by 0.16 V and 0.27 V, respectively, in comparison to analogous derivative 1 (Fig. 2). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of both compounds were calculated from the onset of the first oxidation and reduction wave. The electrochemical band gaps are well supported by the optical band gaps, i.e. the replacement of the BTDA units by the π-electron deficient TDAPy units shows a smaller band gap. Both HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the corresponding DCV3T are shifted to more negative values, indicating that BTDA and TDAPy are weaker acceptors compared to the terminal DCV-groups.

Fig. 3a shows the mismatch corrected current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of m–i–p type PHJ and BHJ solar cells. The PHJ cell structure is: ITO/C60 (15 nm)/donor (10 nm)/Di-NPB (5 nm)/Di-NPB:NDP9 (53 nm, 5 wt%)/NDP9 (1 nm)/Au (50 nm) and the solar cell data are summarized in Table 2. The cells were prepared by keeping the substrate at room temperature. All cells were measured with an aperture mask of 2.76 mm2. A clear rectification behavior is observed in the dark. The device based on BTDA3T 1 gave an open circuit voltage VOC of 0.98 V, a short circuit current density JSC of 3.1 mA cm−2, and a fill factor FF of 0.57, leading to a PCE of 1.73% under simulated solar illumination in AM1.5G conditions. In contrast, devices based on TDAPy3T 2 delivered a superior performance with a VOC of 1.00 V, a JSC of 4.7 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.67, thus improving the PCE to 3.15%. The excellent FF obtained with 2 could be due to better stacking in the thin film caused by intermolecular H-bonding interactions by the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring.

The BHJ solar cells are prepared using a blend layer of oligomer 1 or 2 and C60 with the layer sequence: ITO/C60 (15 nm)/donor∶C60 (20 nm, 2∶1)/BPAPF (5 nm)/BPAPF:NDP9 (50 nm, ∼10wt%)/NPD9 (1 nm)/Au (50 nm). The blend layer was deposited at a substrate temperature of 90 °C. In comparison to the PHJ solar cells described above, an additional layer of C60 was used to stabilize the contact to the ITO. The decrease of the efficiency to 1.5% in the case of BTDA3T 1:C60 based BHJ device as compared to the PHJ cells is due to decrease in the JSC value. On the other hand, devices prepared with TDAPy3T 2 showed a large decrease of the efficiency to 1.94% due to lower JSC and FF values. Although the poorer performance of the BHJ device for 2 is not clearly understood at this stage, the lower FF value of 0.43 could be an indication for a different organization of the molecules in the blended films. This is further corroborated by the slight decrease of the JSC value.

Fig. 3b shows the EQE measurements of the dyes in PHJ and BHJ solar cells. In the optimized PHJ solar cells, both compounds 1 and 2 display reasonable EQE values with a maximum of 23% at 500 nm and 35% at 550 nm, respectively (Fig. 3b). The EQE maxima are in good agreement with the thin film absorption spectrum. The JSC values calculated by integration of the EQE curves with the AM1.5G spectrum are close to the experimental values indicating minor spectral mismatch. The higher JSC for the device with 2 compared to the device based on 1 is reflected in the higher EQE values in the red wavelength region.
In summary, we have successfully synthesized novel oligothiophenes 1 and 2 end-capped with BTDA and TDAPy acceptor units, and obtained materials with interesting optical and electrochemical properties. Vacuum-processed small molecule organic solar cells have been assembled and PCEs as high as 3.15% were obtained. High VOC in the range of 1.0 V and high FF values up to 0.67 V were observed for these compounds, which are among the highest values reported for small molecule-based organic solar cells. We expect that further improvement of the device performance will be achieved by careful optimization of the processing conditions and thus control of the morphology in the active layer.
