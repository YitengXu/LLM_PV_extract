    , Accepted 23rd September 2011First published on 21st October 2011AbstractA [70]fullerene–benzodifuranone acceptor dyad synthesized by a Ag+-mediated coupling reaction was used to construct a thin-film organic solar cell. The fullerene and the benzodifuranone dye in the dyad have close-lying LUMO levels in the range of 3.7–3.9 eV, so that energy transfer from the dye to the fullerene can take place. A p–n heterojunction photovoltaic device consisting of a tetrabenzoporphyrin and a [70]fullerene–benzodifuranone dyad showed a weak but discernible contribution from light absorption of the dyad to the photocurrent under both a positive and a negative effective bias. These results indicate that the benzodifuranone moiety attached to the acceptor contributes to light-harvesting by energy transfer.
Introduction
Thin-film organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices1 often consist of a light-harvesting donor and an electron-transporting fullerene derivative,2 but suffer from the common problem of a limited range of light absorption by the donor. A high-performance printable small molecule OPV device that we recently reported also suffers from this limitation because the tetrabenzoporphyrin (BP) donor absorbs only at its Q and Soret bands and little around 500 nm.3 To remedy this issue, one can employ an additional dye that absorbs at 500 nm through covalent attachment of the dye to an acceptor molecule or in the form of an additional layer.4,5 We report here a new dyad molecule 3 consisting of a [70]fullerene molecule and a benzodifuranone moiety that absorbs at 500 nm (Scheme 1 and Fig. 1). Photoillumination of a p–n device consisting of BP and 3 showed a weak but discernible contribution of light absorption of 3 under both a positive and a negative effective bias, indicating that energy transfer from the benzodifuranone moiety to the fullerene contributed to photocurrent generation. This finding encourages a further search for dyes that show broader and stronger absorption at wavelengths not covered by the electron donor.

Results and discussion
The [70]fullerene–benzodifuranone dyad 3 was synthesized by a Ag+-mediated coupling of C70 bromide 1 with benzodifuranone dye 2, and was examined as an acceptor material in a p–n device with BP as the donor material. Benzodifuranones are widely used in the textile industry,6 but not as yet in OPV research. The dyad was designed to have close-lying LUMO levels (spectral overlap proximity) for both the fullerene and the dye in order to permit energy transfer from the dye to the fullerene.
Synthesis and characterization of dyad 3
The bromide 1 was synthesized efficiently from C70via a three-fold addition reaction reported previously,7 followed by deprotonation/bromination and then coupled with the alkylhydroxy-substituted benzodifuranone6 precursor 2 in the presence of silver tosylate in THF/1,2-dichlorobenzene (2:1) to obtain the dyad 3 and a regioisomer.8Purification on a silica chromatography column and preparative HPLC gave a racemic mixture of pure 3 as a single regioisomer. 1H NMR, UV/Vis, and high-resolution mass spectra are consistent with the structure of 3.
The dyad 3 was further characterized by cyclic voltammetry, photoluminescence, and DSC measurements. Four quasi-reversible reduction waves were observed down to −1.8 V vs.Fc/Fc+ (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Based on a comparison with benzodifuranone and fullerene reference compounds9 (see ESI†), the first and third reduction waves were assigned to the benzodifuranone group and the second and fourth reduction waves were assigned to the fullerene core. The difference between the first reduction potentials of the benzodifuranone and fullerene constituents is 140 mV. Therefore, as desired, the fullerene and dye units in the dyad have close-lying LUMO levels in the range of −3.7 to −3.9 eV that match well with that of BP (LUMO: −3.2 eV), which we used as a donor material.

The UV/Vis spectrum of 3 in CH2Cl2 showed characteristic absorption bands that can be interpreted as a superposition of the absorption bands of the dye and the fullerene units (Fig. 1, black line). The absorption maximum and the corresponding extinction coefficient (501 nm, 49000 L mol−1 cm−1) were similar to those of monomeric benzodifuranone dyes.6a
The photoluminescence spectrum of the dyad 3 (Fig. 1, gray line) exhibits overlapping peaks between 550 nm and 750 nm that are assigned mainly to fullerene fluorescence (broad peak at λmax = 635 nm) and partly to benzodifuranone fluorescence (λmax = 595 nm), as judged by a comparison with known compounds11 (see ESI†). Fluorescence quenching of the dye occurred with an efficiency of >99% (λex = 470 nm). This efficiency is similar to that of [70]fullerene–porphyrin dyads.12 Because absorption and emission for the fullerene and dye units overlap with each other, a definitive determination of the quenching mechanism is not obvious. However, based on several studies of [60]fullerene–perylene and other dyads with similar energy levels and architecture,12–14 it appears likely that energy transfer from the dye to the fullerene is predominantly responsible for the fluorescence quenching in dyad 3 in environments with low dielectric constants; however, a contribution from electron transfer processes cannot be ruled out. The dyad 3 exhibits no phase transition or decomposition up to 200 °C, according to DSC measurements (see ESI†).
Device fabrication and measurements
An ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BP/dyad 3/NBPhen/Al p–n heterojunction device was fabricated and tested under AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination. The dyad 3 exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) value of 0.46% (short circuit current density (JSC) = 2.68 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (VOC) = 0.59 V, fill factor (FF) = 0.29) (Fig. 3a), which was lower than that of an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BP/PCBNB/BCP/Al p–n device (PCBNB: phenyl C61-butyric acid n-butyl ester) that we previously reported (PCE = 2.2%),15 but comparable to those of other dyad devices with multicomponent active layers.4,5 The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum (Fig. 3b, solid line) under zero bias voltage mainly originated from the absorption of BP; there is no obvious peak around 500 nm because of the smaller absorption coefficient of the benzodifuranone dye (Fig. 1) compared with that of BP (λmax = 440 and 693 nm, ε = 309000 and 229000 cm−1, respectively, in the thin film).

(a) J–V curves of an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BP/dyad 3/NBphen/Al p–n heterojunction device (solid line: current density under illumination JL, dashed line: dark current density JD). (b) Comparison between IPCE and absorption spectra. Solid line: IPCE spectrum. Dashed line: absorption spectrum of BP. 
Nonetheless, we noticed that the maximum IPCE value of 12.4% at 460 nm was red-shifted by 23 nm with respect to the absorption maximum of BP (Fig. 3b, dotted line). This shift is due to the photocurrent from the light-harvesting dyad, which is understandably small because of four to six times weaker absorption of the dye (vide supra). Theoretically calculated IPCE spectra that are based on the number of photons absorbed within a photoactive layer (see ESI†) gave a calculated IPCE value of 12.3% at the peak wavelength of 462 nm, which matches very well the experimental value of 12.4% at 460 nm. Therefore, we also consider that the red-shift occurred because of an optical filtering effect by the BP layer that absorbs light before the light reaches compound 3 in the active layer.16
To study the dependence of the photocurrent on the external electric field, we used the absolute photocurrent Jph (= JL − JD) as a function of effective applied voltage V0 − V, where V0 is the compensation voltage at which Jph = 0 (Fig. 4a).17 The IPCE spectra changed dramatically upon application of a −0.72 or −0.22 negative effective bias voltage (Fig. 4b, top), which resulted in a photocurrent in the forward direction (JPh = 1.7 mA cm−2 at V0 − V = −0.72 V, Fig. 4a) that is highest between 500 and 550 nm (Fig. 4b, top). We consider that the photocurrent generation at this wavelength (cf.Fig. 1) is a signature of the benzodifuranone dye contribution for photocurrent generation, owing to excitation of the fullerene component by energy transfer. These measurements also suggest that two separate charge carrier generation processes exist in this photovoltaic device. That is, a realignment of energy levels upon application of the bias voltage occurred and changed the relative driving force of the two charge-separation pathways. (1) Under a 1.78 or 0.28 V positive effective bias (Fig. 4a and 4b (bottom)), electron transfer from the LUMO of BP to the LUMO of the dyad components (dye, fullerene) was normally favored (Fig. 5a). (2) Under a positive effective bias, the LUMO level of BP is lowered and the LUMO of the dyad components is increased (Fig. 5b). Therefore, charge carrier generation viabenzodifuranone excitons becomes predominant (Fig. 4b, top) and the photocurrent flows in the reverse direction.18,19

Negative effective applied voltages (i.e. −0.72 and −0.22 V effective bias) and positive effective applied voltages (i.e. 0.28 and 1.78 V effective bias) represent a forward and a reverse photocurrent, respectively.

Conclusions
We synthesized a new light-absorbing [70]fullerene–benzodifuranone dyad to harvest light around the 500 nm wavelength region. By introducing the benzodifuranone dye unit to a [70]fullerene, we have shown electric-field-dependent photocurrent generation from BP- or dyad-excitons in a BP/dyad OPV device. The latter results in the generation of a forward photocurrent by light absorption of the benzodifuranone dye. However, this was achieved effectively only under negative effective applied bias. Under reverse photocurrent generation with zero bias voltage, the contribution of the dye was discernible but weak, because of overwhelming light absorption by BP. With the principle of a donor–acceptor dual OPV system in hand, we expect that proper selection of a dye will allow us to increase the range of wavelengths available for thin-film OPV devices.
Experimental section
General
All reactions dealing with air- or moisture-sensitive compounds were carried out using standard Schlenk techniques with dry and degassed solvents. Commercially available starting materials were purchased from TCI or Aldrich. HPLC analyses were performed on a Shimadzu LC-10A system equipped with an SPD-M10A diode array detector and a Buckyprep column (Nacalai Tesque Inc., 4.6 mm id × 250 mm). Preparative HPLC was performed on a Buckyprep column (20 mm id × 250 mm) using toluene/2-propanol (9:1) as eluent (flow rate of 10 mL min−1) with a UV spectrophotometric detector, Shimadzu SPD-6A (detection at 350 nm). Column chromatography was performed on silica gel 60N (Kanto Chemical, spherical and neutral, 140–325 mesh). NMR spectra were measured with a JEOL ECA-500 (500 MHz) spectrometer. Spectra are reported in parts per million from internal tetramethylsilane (δ 0.00 ppm) or residual deuterated solvent resonances for 1H NMR and from solvent carbon (e.g. δ 77.00 ppm for chloroform) for 13C NMR. High-resolution mass spectra were measured by APCI using a time-of-flight mass analyzer on a JEOL JMS-T100LC (AccuTOF) spectrometer. UV/Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Fluoromax 3 (Horiba) instrument in degassed solvent. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a HOKUTO DENKO HZ-5000 voltammetric analyzer. All measurements were carried out in a one-compartment cell under Ar gas, equipped with a glassy-carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. Measurements were performed in THF solution containing tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) as a supporting electrolyte at 25 °C with a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1. All potentials were corrected against Fc/Fc+. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a NETZSCH thermal analyzer (DSC 204/F1). Samples (5 mg) were placed in aluminium pans and heated at 10 °C min−1 under N2 gas.

            7a (600 mg, 0.461 mmol) was dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (40 mL). Then, pyridine (37 μL, 0.46 mmol, 1 equiv.) and N-bromosuccinimide (411 mg, 2.31 mmol, 5 equiv.) were added to the solution. The temperature was elevated to 40 °C while stirring. After 1 h, the reaction solution was directly poured into MeOH (100 mL). The solid was filtered and washed with MeOH (3 × 50 mL) and hexane (3 × 50 mL). Drying under vacuum for 3 h afforded 1 (609 mg, 0.419 mmol, 91% yield, 95% purity as determined by HPLC) as a brown-black powder. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3/CS2 1:1) δ 7.27–7.67 (m, 23H, Ar), 7.91 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H, Ar), 8.07 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 2H, Ar); 13C NMR spectra could not be obtained because of low solubility; APCI-HRMS (−): calcd for C106H27 [(M − Br)−] 1299.2113, found 1299.2169.

            1 (7.2 mg, 5.2 μmol) and hydroxy-benzodifuranone 2 (10.4 mg, 26 μmol, 5 equiv.) were dissolved in a mixture of THF and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (2:1, 1.5 mL) and sonicated for 30 s. The solution was heated to 60 °C and silver tosylate (7.3 mg, 26 μmol, 5 equiv.) was added. The dark-red solution was stirred vigorously for 3 h, followed by solvent removal in vacuo at 35 °C and column chromatography (CS2/toluene 1:1). The two red bands were collected and the solvent was removed in vacuo. The first band consists of 3 (2.1 mg, 1.2 μmol, 24% yield, dark-red powder) while the second band (2.0 mg, 1.2 μmol, 22% yield, dark-red powder) contains two regioisomers of 3 with different UV/Vis spectral patterns, as observed via analytical HPLC. A larger amount of 3 was synthesized with slightly lower yield because the reaction was carried out at higher temperature. This material was further purified using an HPLC Buckyprep column before device fabrication. 1H NMR (500 MHz, d8-THF) δ 3.81–3.86 (m, 2H, CH2O-C70), 4.12–4.16 (m, 1H, CHHOAr), 4.21–4.25 (m, 1H, CHHOAr), 6.71 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 2H, Ar), 6.79 (s, 1H, benzodifuranone), 6.95 (s, 1H, benzodifuranone), 7.14–7.36 (m, 16H, Ar), 7.39–7.42 (m, 2H, Ar), 7.48–7.52 (m, 4H, Ar), 7.58 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 2H, Ar), 7.63 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 2H, Ar), 7.67 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H, Ar), 7.80 (t, J = 8.1 Hz, 4H, Ar), 7.89 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H, Ar); 13C NMR spectra could not be obtained because of low solubility; UV/Vis (CH2Cl2): λmax [nm] (ε [L mol−1 cm−1]) = 501 (49000); APCI-HRMS (−): calcd for C130H42O6 [M−] 1698.2982, found 1698.2922.

Device fabrication
The organic photovoltaic devices were fabricated on a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Baytron AI4083) coated indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate. The insoluble p-layer BP was deposited via a solution procedure as described elsewhere.3[70]Fullerene–benzodifuranone dyad 3 (0.7 wt%) was solubilized overnight in THF and filtered through a 0.45 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) filter prior to use in device fabrication. The solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s and thermally annealed at 120 °C for 5 min in an inert-atmosphere N2 glove box. The devices were completed by deposition of a 7 nm 2,9-bis(naphthalen-2-yl)-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (NBphen) layer and an 80 nm Al electrode.
Performance evaluation of the OPV devices
The encapsulated organic photovoltaic cells were subjected to J–V measurements under both dark and irradiated conditions. Current–voltage sweeps were acquired using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit controlled by a computer. For the power conversion efficiency measurement, a solar simulator system (Sumitomo Heavy Industries Advanced Machinery), AM1.5G, with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 was used as the light source. For the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement, a constant power mode was employed using monochromatized photons from halogen or xenon lamps.
