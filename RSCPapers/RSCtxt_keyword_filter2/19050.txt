    , Accepted 1st September 2015First published on 2nd September 2015AbstractTwo novel, star-shaped isoindigo(II)-based small molecules with different cores of triphenylamine and benzene, namely P1 and P2, respectively, were designed and synthesized as non-fullerene acceptor materials in organic solar cells (OSCs). The impacts of the different cores combined with the II terminal groups on the optical absorption, electrochemical properties, film morphology, and solar cell performance were studied thoroughly. The two compounds possess a broad absorption covering the wavelength range of 400–650 nm and relatively high LUMO energy levels of 3.73 and 3.79 eV for P1 and P2, respectively. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the OSCs based on P2 as the acceptor material and P3HT as the donor material (1:1, w/w) is 0.19%. In contrast, a PCE of 0.81% was achieved for the device based on P1 as the acceptor and P3HT as the donor (1:1, w/w).
Introduction
In recent years, the field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) has been an area of intense research since these devices offer a potentially efficient, cost-effective, and scalable approach for solar energy conversion.1–4 Although OPV efficiencies have exceeded 10%, they still lag behind typical inorganic solar cells.5,6 Nevertheless, OPVs can be mass produced using solution based roll-to-roll processing from inexpensive, earth-abundant, and environmentally benign materials. Therefore, OPVs offer the potential to eclipse inorganic solar cells in cost per watt and eventually achieve grid-parity. The vast majority of efficient OPV systems are based on bulk-heterojunctions (BHJs) of either small molecule or polymer donors mixed with fullerene-based acceptors to form interpenetrating networks of electron and hole conducting pathways.7–10 Fullerenes have many unique charge carrier capabilities and have been exploited in well-optimized systems to obtain internal quantum efficiencies approaching 100% and fill-factors approaching 80%.11–14 However, despite success in laboratory scale devices, fullerenes are not ideal materials for production on an industrial scale. They are expensive to synthesize, difficult to modify chemically, and are unstable in air.3,15
In the past few years, people have developed a number of small molecule and polymer non-fullerene electron acceptors,16–22 consisting of perylene diimide (PDI),23–36 naphthalene diimide (NDI),37–43 benzothiadiazole (BT),44–50 and other electron-deficient groups.51–64 Recently, more and more attention has been paid to the development of non-fullerene acceptors, and a PCE higher than 6% has been achieved.65–70 The non-fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs), which consist of a p-type semiconducting polymer or small molecule as an electron donor and an n-type semiconducting polymer or small molecule as an electron acceptor, have some advantages over fullerene. Firstly, these non-fullerene acceptors can achieve broad and strong absorption via the molecular design. Secondly, their LUMO energy levels can be adjusted to achieve a suitable charge separation driving force and a high open circuit voltage. Thirdly, non-fullerene OSCs exhibit good long-term stability.71
With the OPV device performance entering the realm of potential commercial applications, the design of organic electronics is becoming increasingly focused on materials that can be synthesized from sustainable and readily available building blocks. This approach to meet the demands of synthetic accessibility must be considered in the design and synthesis of industrially relevant materials for eventual large-scale production. Isoindigo(II) is a symmetrical molecule consisting of two indolin-2-one units, which contribute towards its strong electron-withdrawing character. It has been widely used in the dye industry and can be obtained easily from various natural sources and can be effectively synthesized in bulk quantities.72 As reported by Reynolds et al., oligomers with bithiophene as the donor and isoindigo as the acceptor showed promising absorption spectra and electrochemical and photovoltaic properties, which represent the first application of isoindigo-based materials to OPVs involved (iI)2TT and iI(TT)2, blended with PC61BM as the electron acceptor, which resulted in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 0.55 and 1.76%, respectively.73 They disclosed the photophysical and electrochemical properties of isoindigo-based polymers.74 A homopolymer of isoindigo (poly(II)) has been first reported by Reynolds et al. in the open scientific literature,75 for which their preliminary results show the power conversion efficiencies approaching 0.5% based on P3HT as the donor, and its preparation has been discussed in a patent application.76 While, to the best of our knowledge, there are few publications that report on isoindigo-based small molecules as non-fullerene acceptors in bulk heterojunction solar cells. Owing to their monodisperse nature with well-defined chemical structures, together with no end-group contaminants or batch-to-batch variations, molecular organic semiconductors can be reproducibly prepared, functionalized and purified. With these concerns in mind, here we report the synthesis and characterization of two star-shaped organic small molecules P1 and P2 with triphenylamine (TPA) and benzene as cores and isoindigo as terminal units (Scheme 1). Nevertheless, ‘propeller-like’ (often designated as ‘star-like’) small molecules have been regarded as promising candidates for photovoltaics due to their 3D electron delocalization. TPA-based molecules77–86 have a special propeller star-burst molecular structure because of the sp3 hybrid orbital of the nitrogen atom and possess a quasi-3D non-planar structure and isotropic optical and charge-transporting properties. It has also been proved that the phenyl core-based material has also a special propeller-like structure.87 Branched structures have been shown to increase the tendency for the formation of interpenetrating networks.

Both materials show good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and toluene, and can be readily solution-processed to form smooth and pinhole-free films upon spin-coating. They have been used as acceptor components in bulk heterojunction solar cells with P3HT as the donor. The device based on P3HT and P2 displays a much low PCE of 0.19%. In contrast, a PCE of 0.81% was achieved with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.96 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 1.91 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.44 for the device based on P3HT and P1. To the best of our knowledge, this efficiency is the highest value for the BHJ OSCs based on isoindigo small molecules as non-fullerene acceptors.
Experimental
General

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-500 spectrometer operating at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, in deuterated chloroform solution at room temperature. MALDI-TOF spectra were recorded on a Bruker BIFLEX III instrument. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed on a Netzsch DSC 209 under a N2 flow at heating and cooling rates of 10 °C min−1. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a Netzsch TG 209 under a N2 flow at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a HP 8453 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a CHI600D electrochemical workstation with a platinum working electrode and a Pt wire counter electrode at a scanning rate of 100 mV s−1 against a Ag/Ag+ (0.1 M of AgNO3 in acetonitrile) reference electrode with an argon-saturated anhydrous acetonitrile solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate. Thin solid films used for absorption spectral measurements were prepared by spin-coating their o-dichlorobenzene solutions on quartz substrates. Atom force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out by using a Digital Instrumental DI Multimode Nanoscope IIIa in tapping mode. The processing conditions to make the blend films for the morphology study are the same as those for the fabrication of the solar cell devices.
Materials
All reactions and manipulations were carried out under an inert atmosphere with the use of standard Schlenk techniques. The other reagents and solvents, unless otherwise specified, were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. As outlined in Scheme 1, two new isoindigo molecules P1 and P2 were synthesized through the Suzuki coupling reaction.

4,4′,4′′-Tris(pinacolatoborane)phenylamine (1). 
Tris(4-bromophenyl)amine88 (1.93 g, 4 mmol), bis(pinacolato)diborane (3.75 g, 15 mmol), KOAc (7.0 g, 70 mmol), and dioxane (60 mL) were mixed together in a 100 mL flask. After degassing, [Pd(dppf)Cl2] (0.5 g, dppf = 1,1′ bis(diphenylphosphonyl)ferrocene) was added. The reaction mixture was kept at 85 °C overnight before it was cooled to room temperature. The organic solvent was removed, and the residue was dissolved in dichloromethane and washed with water. After drying the organic layer with MgSO4, the solvent was removed. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography, using hexane:dichloromethane (2:1) as an eluent, to give 1 as a white solid (4.2 g, 59%). 1H-NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz) δ: 7.68 (d, 6H), 7.07 (d, 6H), 1.34 (s, 36H); 13C-NMR (CDCl3, 125 MHz) δ: 149.80, 135.94, 123.50, 83.70, 24.90.


1,3,5-Tris(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzene (2)89. 
To a 100 mL Schlenk flask 1,3,5-tribromobenzene (1.57 g, 5 mmol), bis(pinacolato)diboron (5.08 g, 20 mmol), palladium acetate (0.166 g, 0.74 mmol), potassium acetate (7.34 g, 75.0 mmol) and 35 mL of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were added. The mixture was degassed by gently bubbling argon for 30 min at room temperature. This was then heated at 70 °C under argon overnight. The cooled mixture was extracted with dichloromethane, washed with brine, and dried over MgSO4. The crude product was chromatographed on silica using ethyl acetate in hexane as the eluent to give 2 as a white solid (1.14 g, 50%). 1H-NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz) δ: 8.36 (s, 3H), 1.33 (s, 36H).


6-(N,N′-2-Ethylhexyl)-bromoisoindigo (3). 
To a suspension of 6-dibromoisoindigo90 (4.20 g, 10.0 mmol) and potassium carbonate (8.29 g, 60 mmol) in DMF (45 mL), 2-ethyl-bromohexane (5.79 g, 30 mmol) was injected through a septum under nitrogen. The mixture was stirred for 15 h at 100 °C and then poured into water (200 mL). The organic phase was extracted by CH2Cl2, washed with brine and dried over MgSO4. After removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, the dark red liquids were purified by silica chromatography and eluted with (CH2Cl2:hexane = 1:2) to give 3 as a dark red solid (3.95 g, 70%). 1H-NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz) δ: 9.04 (d, 2H), 7.14 (dd, 2H), 6.83 (d, 3H), 3.56 (d, 4H), 1.83 (bs, 2H), 1.40–1.24 (m, 16H), 0.88–0.84 (m, 12H); 13C-NMR (CDCl3, 125 MHz) δ: 168.2, 146.3, 132.6, 131.3, 126.9, 125.2, 120.6, 112.7, 44.9, 36.3, 32.1, 32.0, 31.7, 30.2, 29.87, 29.77, 29.5, 26.6, 22.89, 22.87, 14.34, 14.31.


Compound P1. 
Compound 1 (623 mg, 1.0 mmol) and compound 3 (2.26 g, 4 mmol) were placed in a dried round bottom flask under protective gas. 10 mL of toluene and potassium carbonate aqueous solution (2 M, 5 mL) were added to the flask which then was sealed and degassed with argon for 15 min. Then, Pd(PPh3)4 (10 mg) was added and the solution was heated to 90 °C. The reaction mixture was stirred for two days at 90 °C. The crude product was obtained by extraction with CH2Cl2, and the organic phase was subsequently washed with a diluted hydrochloric acid, water and sodium carbonate solution. The organic phase was dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated on a rotary evaporator. After the removal of solvent, the crude product was purified by silica gel using a mixture solvent of hexane–CH2Cl2 as an eluent and afforded P1 as a black solid (679 mg, 40%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz) δ: 9.09 (d, 6H), 7.70 (d, 6H), 7.19 (dd, 6H), 7.00 (d, 6H), 6.90 (d, 9H), 3.56 (d, 12H), 1.83 (bs, 6H), 1.40–1.24 (m, 48H), 0.88–0.84 (m, 36H). 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 170.2, 150.70, 147.3, 136.94, 134.6, 133.3, 129.9, 126.2, 125.50, 123.6, 116.7, 87.70, 45.9, 37.3, 35.1, 36.0, 33.7, 30.7, 29.77, 29.67, 29.5, 27.6, 24.97, 22.89, 22.87, 14.37, 14.3.

P2 was synthesized and purified in a similar manner to that of P1 and was obtained as a dark solid (459 mg, 30%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz) δ: 9.04 (d, 6H), 8.36 (s, 3H), 7.14 (dd, 6H), 6.83 (d, 9H), 3.56 (d, 12H), 1.83 (bs, 6H), 1.40–1.24 (m, 48H), 0.88–0.84 (m, 36H). 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 172.2, 150.3, 143.6, 137.3, 127.9, 126.2, 125.6, 114.7, 47.9, 36.3, 32.1, 32.0, 31.7, 30.2, 29.87, 29.77, 29.5, 26.7, 22.87, 22.77, 14.74, 13.22. MS (MALDI-TOF) m/z: calculated for C102H126N6O6, 1531.98; found, 1532.70.

Device fabrication and characterization
The photovoltaic devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer (100 nm)/Ca (20 nm)/Al (80 nm). Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were cleaned by sonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and dried in a nitrogen stream, followed by an oxygen plasma treatment. A 40 nm-thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P VP AI4083, filtered at 0.45 mm) was spin-coated (3000 rpm) onto the ITO surface. After being baked at 150 °C for 20 min, the substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box. Subsequently, a 100 nm-thin active layer was spin-casted from a blend of donor (P3HT) and acceptor (P1 or P2) in an o-dichlorobenzene solution (20 mg mL−1) on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate and was annealed at 110 °C for 10 min. The active layer thickness was measured using a Dektak 150 profilometer. A 20 nm-thin Ca layer was deposited on the active layer under a high vacuum (3 × 10−6 torr). Finally, a 80 nm-thin Al layer was deposited on the top of the Ca layer under a high vacuum (3 × 10−6 torr). The effective device area was patterned to be 0.16 cm2 by using a shadow mask. The PCEs were measured in an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Oriel model 91192) under ambient conditions. The power of the sun simulator was calibrated before testing by using a standard silicon solar cell, giving a value of 100 mW cm−1 in the test. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices was measured on a Hypermonolight System (Bunkoh-Keiki SM-250).
Results and discussion
Thermal stability and optical absorption
Thermal properties of the two small molecules were investigated by TGA and DSC. As shown in Fig. 1, P1 and P2 show good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (Td) of 375 and 340 °C, respectively, in a N2 atmosphere, which are adequate to resist the degradation of the materials at the resulting device operating temperatures. No clear glass transition process was observed for P1 up to 250 °C. In contrast, compound P2 was found to exhibit a melting temperature of approximately 221 °C and a crystallization temperature of approximately 183 °C (Fig. 2), which demonstrates that the material can tolerate temperatures that exceed 200 °C and still form ordered crystalline domains when cooled back below 183 °C. This clearly shows that P2 possesses strong crystallization properties possibly due to the planarity of the phenyl core based structure.

To study the relationships between the chemical structures and the photophysical properties, UV-vis absorption spectra of P1 and P2 in diluted chloroform solutions (10−5 M) and in thin solid films (100 nm) prepared by spin-coating, along with the molar extinction were recorded as shown in Fig. 3. The absorption bands in the shorter wavelength region should be commonly ascribed to the π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone, and the absorption band in the longer wavelength region could be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction between their donor moieties and acceptor groups. Compared to the absorption in solution, the thin films of P1 and P2 show a broader absorption with a similar profile, suggesting that there is a weak intermolecular interaction and molecular aggregation in the film, because of the 3D molecular structures of P1 and P2. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) of the P1 and P2 films estimated from the absorption edge were 1.77 and 1.85 eV, respectively. However, P1 possesses a smaller bad gap due to the stronger electron-donating triphenylamine. In addition, triphenylamine-based P1 exhibits higher absorption coefficients of 3.8 × 104 M−1 cm−1 (537 nm) and 2.4 × 104 cm−1 (552 nm) in chloroform solutions and in thin solid films, respectively, compared with P2 (2.0 × 104 M−1 cm−1 (512 nm) and 1.56 × 104 cm−1 (550 nm)) in the longer wavelength region due to its stronger ICT interaction between the donor moieties and acceptor groups, indicating a stronger solar light absorption ability which is preferable to light-harvesting. Moreover, their blend films with P3HT (1:1 w/w) exhibit a broad absorption ranging from 400 to 680 nm (Fig. 3b).

Electrochemical properties and energy levels
In order to insightfully understand the relationships between the chemical structure and the electronic structure of the resulting materials and consequently provide key parameters for the design of small-molecule-based non-fullerene BHJ solar cells, CV experiments were conducted to measure the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy levels of P1 and P2. The potentials were calibrated with the redox couple of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) under the same experimental conditions. In the oxidation curves shown in Fig. 4, both the CV curves of P1 and P2 in acetonitrile solution show an irreversible p-doping process. The onset oxidation potentials (Eox) versus Ag/AgNO3 are 1.00 and 1.10 V for P1 and P2, respectively. As summarized in Table 1, the HOMO energy levels of P1 and P2 are estimated to be 5.54 and 5.64 eV, respectively, according to an equation of EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.54) (eV). Because the reliable onset reduction potentials of these materials are hardly gained, their LUMO energy levels are thus estimated from the HOMO energy levels and the Eoptg based on the relationship ELUMO = EHOMO + Eoptg. The LUMO energy levels are calculated to be 3.77 and 3.79 eV, which are mainly determined by the acceptor units II. Because the Voc is proportional to the energy difference between the HOMO energy level of the electron donor and the LUMO energy level of the electron acceptor in the active layer of the BHJ solar cells, such high-lying LUMO energy levels are expected to increase the open circuit voltages in the solar cell devices.

Theoretical calculations
In order to study the ground-state geometries and electronic structures of P1 and P2, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have also been performed by using Gaussian 03W program based on the B3LYP/6-31G(d) basis set. To expedite the calculations, the alkyl chains on the II nitrogen were replaced by methyl groups. Fig. 5 shows the 3D spatial structures and the electron distributions of HOMOs and LUMOs of the optimized ground-state structures for the P1 and P2 systems. The electron density of the HOMO of P1 is mainly delocalized on the triphenylamine unit due to its electron-rich properties. On the other hand, the electron density of the LUMO of P1 is mainly localized on the II moieties due to its strong electron affinity. Nevertheless, the electron density of the HOMO of P2 is delocalized on the phenyl-core and II moieties. And the electron density of the LUMO of P2 is mainly localized on the II moieties. It is observed that P1 based on the triphenylamine core provides more evident spatial separation of the HOMO and LUMO than P2 based on the phenyl core due to its stronger electron-rich properties. And it can also be seen that the space configuration of P1 is more distorted than P2 due to the sp3 hybrid orbital of the nitrogen atom. The calculated HOMO and LUMO energies of the optimized ground-state geometry of P1 and P2 are −5.00/−5.52 eV and −2.72/−2.74 eV, respectively. The theoretically estimated values refer to the gas phase with isolated molecules, whereas the experimental values are for the condensed phase, and so the values are somewhat different. Nevertheless, the trend in the experimentally estimated energy levels is very consistent with that of the theoretically estimated values.

Photovoltaic properties
To demonstrate the potential of the two star-shaped small molecules as electron acceptor materials in an organic solar cell, photovoltaic devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer (100 nm)/Ca (20 nm)/Al (80 nm) were fabricated by spin-coating from the blend of donor (P3HT) and acceptor (P1 or P2) in an o-dichlorobenzene solution (20 mg mL−1). Typical current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the fabricated devices under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) are displayed in Fig. 6, and the device performances are summarized in Table 2.

Considering the energy levels of P3HT and the current acceptors, there is sufficient driving force to form charge carriers. The device optimizations were conducted by varying the weight ratios of the donor and the acceptor. From Fig. 6 and Table 2, one can see the characteristically high Voc of the devices based on P1 and P2 (>0.9 V) because of their relatively high-lying LUMO energy levels, which is predominantly determined by the backbone acceptor moiety. In addition, the Voc of the devices based on P2 is higher than that of the devices based on P1 with the same donor material and weight ratios. Furthermore, the Voc of 1.15 V achieved in the devices based on P2 is one of the highest values reported for single junction OSCs. For the conventional devices with P3HT as the donor material, the active layer of P3HT:P1 with a weight ratio of 1:1 exhibited a Voc of 0.96 V, a Jsc of 1.91 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.44, and a PCE of 0.81%. In contrast, the active layer based on P3HT:P2 with the same weight ratio gave a very high Voc of 1.15 V, but a very low Jsc of 0.45 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.37, and a low PCE of 0.19%. The active layer of P3HT:P1 with a weight ratio of 1:0.5 exhibited a slightly higher Voc of 0.99 V, a lower Jsc of 1.68 mA cm−2, a lower FF of 0.32, and a lower PCE of 0.54%. In contrast, the active layer based on P3HT:P2 with the same weight ratio gave a high Voc of 1.09 V, a low Jsc of 0.5 mA cm−2, a lower FF of 0.28, and a lower PCE of 0.15%. Compared to the cells based on P3HT:P2, the higher PCE of the cells based on P3HT:P1 can be primarily explained by their higher Jsc and an enhanced FF, which may be attributed to the stronger light absorption from P1 and a suitable morphology due to its strong distortion of the space structure.
To further understand the device performance, the EQE spectra of the fabricated devices were measured as shown in Fig. 7. From the curves, it is observed that all the EQE spectra cover a broad wavelength range from 300 to 650 nm. The calculated Jsc values obtained by the integration of the EQE data for the P3HT:P1 and P3HT:P2 devices showed a 3–5% mismatch compared with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V measurements. Obviously, the EQE of the devices based on P3HT:P1 is higher than that of the devices based on P3HT:P2, and it can be attributed to the stronger light absorption of P1 and the appropriate film morphology as proven by the following AFM images.

Film morphology
In order to deeply understand the photovoltaic properties of the resulting small molecular non-fullerene donor materials, the active layer morphology was studied by AFM in the tapping-mode. Similar to the OSC devices, the films for the AFM measurements were also prepared by spin-coating their o-dichlorobenzene solutions on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer, which was spin-coated on the ITO glass substrates. As shown by the topography images presented in Fig. 8, it can be obviously seen that the different core of these two star-shaped small molecules result in substantial morphology variations in the condensed state. The root-mean-square (rms) roughness of the P1, P2, P3HT:P1, P3HT:P2 films is 0.547, 5.820, 10.108 and 10.037 nm, respectively. The AFM phase images show that the P2-based films demonstrate over-aggregation and larger size phase separation, which are not beneficial for dissociation of excitons into free charge carriers and charge transport in the thin film, possibly due to its strong crystallization properties. Nevertheless, phase images of the P1-based films indicate that P1 has a good miscibility with P3HT to give a favourable donor–acceptor interpenetrating network (IPN). The well-defined IPN structure ensures large D–A interfaces as efficient percolation channels for charge transport, thus improving the exciton separation and carrier collection efficiency and leading to a high Jsc and FF. From a structural point of view, the intermolecular interactions among the P2 molecules with the phenyl core should be stronger than the P1 molecules with the triphenylamine core due to their stronger crystallizing tendency, which may greatly increase the phase separation in the blended thin films with donors, as can be observed in the corresponding AFM images.

Conclusions
In summary, two novel star-shaped II acceptor materials (P1 and P2) with TPA and phenyl cores were explored. These materials exhibited a 3D structure, weak intermolecular interactions and molecular aggregation, a strong absorption in the visible region, and appropriate energy levels matched with the general polymer donor P3HT. Solution-processed OSCs based on a P3HT:P1 (1:1, w/w) blend film exhibited PCEs as high as 0.81%, which is among the highest values reported for the solution-processed OSCs based on isoindigo-based non-fullerene small molecule acceptors. These preliminary results demonstrate that isoindigo-based small molecules can be potential non-fullerene acceptors in bulk heterojunction solar cells.
