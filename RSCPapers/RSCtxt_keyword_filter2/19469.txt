The phase separation of the donor polymer and molecular acceptor within the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer is often driven by the crystallisation of the acceptor molecules. Hence, a suitable crystallisation tendency of the chosen acceptor is ultimately important. In this work, we identified melting temperature as an indicator for the crystallisation tendency and introduced extended fused-aromatic rings to the end groups of the nonfullerene acceptor molecule to enhance the intermolecular binding energy as well as its crystallisation tendency. The crystallinity, crystal regularity and average crystal size were significantly increased for those molecules with larger fused end groups. The devices containing molecule IDTTC with two fused thiophene rings, which displayed intermediate crystallisation tendency, were found to possess an optimized phase separation scale, balanced hole/electron mobility and highest device performances with the fill factor as high as 73.2% and a power conversion efficiency of 13.49%. With the above observations, we established a new route and paradigm to adjust the crystallisation tendency and BHJ nanostructure of nonfullerene acceptor molecules, thus enhancing the device performances through molecular engineering.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are considered as one of the candidates for the next generation solar energy technology.1–9 A key requirement for high-performance PSCs is an optimized nanostructure of the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) active blend. This can be often achieved by controlling the crystallisation of electron-accepting materials such as fullerene derivatives. Therefore, fullerene-based acceptors were often prepared into amorphous thin films and subjected to thermal annealing sequentially to enhance the crystallinity and enable the phase separation of the resulting BHJ blends.10–13 This stratagem was also adopted for devices with acceptors other than fullerenes.14 Hence, a suitable crystallisation tendency of the chosen acceptors is ultimately important for achieving a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs.
The crystallisation tendency of a material is closely governed by the intermolecular binding energy15 (U0) which is directly linked to the melting temperature (Tm) of such material.16,17 This correlation between Tm and U0 was observed as early as 1950s18 and found in pharmaceutical substances19,20 and nanoclusters.21,22 An over simplified interpretation of the melting process can be described as U0 is overcome by the molecular vibration kinetic energy provided by temperature at Tm, i.e. U0 = kTm, where k is the Boltzmann constant.23 Although this simple relationship often fails to precisely predict the Tm of substances, because it ignores the influence from the molecular packing style and surface energies,23 positive correlation between U0 and Tm is found in many molecule systems.24 A good example is the fused acenes, where the Tm is found to be higher for larger molecules when benzene (Tm = 279 K), naphthalene (Tm = 353 K), anthracene(Tm = 490 K) and tetracene (Tm = 613 K) are compared. This is because, when more carbon atoms are incorporated into the fused acene, the average U0 contribution from each additional carbon atom remains similar.25 Hence, the U0 of fused acenes is positively correlated to their molecular weights, and larger molecules with higher Tm possess higher U0. This correlation is also true for fused thiophene where the double-ring thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (Tm = 329 K) is found to be a solid while the single-ring thiophene (Tm = 235 K) appears as a liquid at room temperature. The higher U0 contributes directly to the lowering of the bulk free energy which leads to higher nucleation rates and growth rates of the crystals. Hence, the close correlation between crystallization tendency, U0 and Tm is widely utilized in the field of pharmaceutical substances where crystallization is often required to be diminished.19,20
End group modification is a useful method for controlling the crystallisation tendency of a group of non-fullerene molecular acceptors, which have replaced fullerene derivatives as the working horse for top-performing PSCs in recent years.26–30 The champion molecules such as ITIC31 are of a collection of intelligently designed A–D–A type molecules with an electron-donating core and electron-accepting end groups. Side groups were also attached to the donor core with bulky aromatic rings and an aliphatic chain extending out of the plane of the donor core. These side groups introduced steric hindrance to prevent the donor cores from directly stacking on each other, and hence, reduced their π interactions. Therefore, the main binding force for intermolecular aggregation was provided by the stacking of the acceptor end groups. The stacking of the end groups and the steric hindrance next to the donor cores forced the molecules to adopt a “brick wall” packing style which was favourable for the electron transport and supported by single crystal diffraction as well as molecular dynamics simulation.32–36 For this reason, the decoration of the end group became a widely adopted stratagem for tuning the band structure as well as U0 of these molecules. By decorating the end groups of ITIC with ethynyl or phenylethynyl groups, the U0 was enhanced by increasing the overlapping distance of the end groups.36,37 Another common approach for the end group decoration was halogenation. Attaching fluorine or chlorine atoms to the end groups significantly decreased the intermolecular packing distance between the acceptor end groups and increased the crystallisation tendency.35,38–44 Other groups such as alkyl or alkoxyl were also explored as decoration options for the end groups for enhancing the crystallisation tendency and device performances with success.38,39,45–49 Interestingly, without changing the decoration group, moving the position of the substitution along was found to influence the BHJ nanostructure significantly, suggesting that the crystallisation tendency was extremely sensitive to end group decorations.46,50
On the other hand, the extension of the fused end group can also be used as a tuning knob for controlling the crystallisation process and the nanostructure of the BHJ layer containing nonfullerene acceptors. Molecules with larger end groups have already been found to have a detrimental effect on the nanostructure of the BHJ layer.51–54 Additionally, extending the fused end groups was found to increase the electron delocalization range which improved the optoelectronic properties, such as the photon absorption,52 suitable band structure51,52,54 and electron mobility,51–53 of the acceptor molecules. Therefore, a systematic study of how the fine tuning of the crystallisation tendency by the incorporation of fused aromatic rings at the end groups influences the nanostructure and device performances is of great importance. In this work, we extended the one thiophene end group of IDTC37 into two (IDTTC) or three fused thiophene rings (IDTTTC) (Scheme 1). These molecules displayed gradually increased the absorption coefficient and reduced the band gap. More importantly, the crystallisation tendency was found to steadily increase in these molecules based on the thermal analysis as well as structure characterisation of their thin films. Investigating the PSC devices containing these molecules provided a unique insight into how the crystallization tendency of an acceptor could be tuned and how it influenced the nanostructure of the BHJ blends and the solar cell performances.

2.2. Methods and characterization

2.2.1. Methods. 

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance-400 spectrometer with d-chloroform (CDCl3) or d-dimethyl sulfoxide ((CD3)2SO) as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. Elemental analysis was performed on a Thermo Electron SPA Flash EA 1112 series analyser. TGA was conducted on a TA Instrument Model SDTQ500 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 flow rate of 90 mL min−1. DSC thermograms were recorded with a NETZSCH DSC 200PC with a heating and cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 flow rate of 50 mL min−1. UV-vis spectra were obtained on a Hitachi U2910 spectrophotometer. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed using a Shimadzu IR Tracer-100 interferometer. Atomic force microscopy-infrared (AFM-IR) spectra were recorded using a Bruker/Anasys nanoIR3 in tapping mode with Au coated probes (1–7 N m−1). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out on a CHI660 potentiostat/galvanostat electrochemical workstation at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1. A platinum wire was used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode was Ag/AgCl with its energy level calibrated by a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple to be −4.34 eV. Grazing-incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were conducted at the PLS-II 9A U-SAXS beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory, Pohang, Korea. Samples for GIWAXS measurements were prepared by spin-coating active blend solutions on top of a silicon wafer. The thin films containing the active layer for AFM-IR and GIWAXS measurements were prepared onto the silicon wafer using the same processing methods under identical conditions as for the PSC devices.


2.2.2. Device fabrication and measurements. 
The devices were fabricated with a conventional architecture (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/OTF/Al). Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) (Bay P VP. Al 4083, Bayer AG) was spin-coated on cleaned indium tin oxide (ITO, sheet resistance = 15 Ω square−1) glass substrates and baked at 150 °C for 10 min. The active layer solutions containing the donor and acceptor materials (1:1 blend ratio in weight, total concentration of 16 mg mL−1 in chloroform with 0.3 v% of 1,8-diiodooctane additive) were spin-coated on the top substrates at a speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s to achieve a thickness of about 100 nm. The active layer was annealed at 110 °C for 10 min to obtain the optimized morphology and device performances. OTF (3,3′,3′′,3′′′-(9′,9′-bis(4-(5(4-(octyloxy)phenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzyl)-9H,9′H,9′′H-[2,2′:7′,2′′-terfluorene]-9,9,9′′,9′′-tetrayl)tetrakis(N,N,N-trimethylpropan-1-aminiumbromide)) solution (0.5 mg mL−1 in ethanol) was spin-coated on the top of the active layers before aluminium (Al, 100 nm) was evaporated on top as the electrode. The device area was exactly fixed to 4.00 mm2.

I–V characterisation was performed on a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit under an AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination created using a solar simulator (XES-70S1, SAN-EI, calibrated with a Konica Minolta AK-200 standard Si solar cell). The EQE values were measured on a QE-R solar cell spectral response measurement system (Enli Technology Co., Ltd, Taiwan). All fabrication and characterisation processes, except for the EQE measurements, were conducted in a high purity argon filled glove box (<0.1 ppm O2 and H2O).


2.2.3. Charge carrier mobility measurements. 
Charge carrier mobility was measured using the SCLC method. Hole-only devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:acceptor/MoO3/Au. Electron-only devices were fabricated with a structure of glass/Al/polymer:acceptor/Al. The active layer was prepared using the same processing methods under identical conditions as for the PSC devices. The dark I–V curve was collected and fitted to equation: J = 9ε0εrμV2/8L3, where J is the current density, L is the active layer thickness, μ is the hole or electron mobility, εr and ε0 are the relative and free space (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1) permittivities, V is the internal voltage in devices and V = Vappl − Vbi − Va, where Vappl is the applied voltage, Vbi is the built-in voltage and Va is the voltage drop.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Thermal properties
The chemical structure of the three acceptors is shown in Fig. 1a. The thermal behaviours (summarized in Table 1) of these three molecules were analysed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. 1b) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Fig. 1c). When we compared the temperatures at which the weight loss reached 4% in TGA, we found decomposition temperatures at 214 °C, 363 °C and 385 °C for IDTC, IDTTC and IDTTTC, respectively, which suggested that molecules with larger end groups were with improved thermal stabilities. The DSC thermogram of IDTC displayed a broad and shallow exothermic transition with onset at 96 °C, indicating a cold crystallisation process. Starting at 180 °C, an endothermic transition marked the melting of these crystals. IDTC decomposed right above the melting with sharp exothermic transitions starting at 204 °C. The degradation of IDTC was confirmed by the weight loss found in TGA at this temperature as well as the disappearance of all thermal transitions in sequential DSC scanning cycles (not shown). In contrast, IDTTC displayed a cold crystallisation starting at a higher temperature (Tcc = 201 °C) with a well-defined exothermic transition. The melting of IDTTC started at 350 °C which was 38% higher than that of IDTC. This increase is very close to the Tm difference between thiophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene which is about 40%. The high resemblance in the increase of Tm strongly supported that the U0 values of these molecules were mainly provided by the stacking of the end groups. The IDTTC molecule was found to decompose soon after the melting process started with an enormous exothermic transition. The degradation during melting suggested that the decomposition of these molecules required molecular conformation adjustment and was prevented by the steric hindrance when the molecules were locked within the crystal lattice.57,58 An exothermal transition related to the cold crystallisation was also observed in IDTTTC around 208 °C. The degradation of IDTTTC started above 383 °C and the melting of the IDTTTC molecules was not observed. The melting of IDTTTC was likely to occur only above the decomposition temperature, i.e. Tm > 383 °C. The increase of Tm proved that the U0 could be increased by extending the fused end groups of the IDTC. Higher U0 brought along increased tendency of both the nucleation and growth of the crystals, which would influence the solid-state nanostructure of the thin films containing these materials.15

3.2. Optoelectronic properties
UV-vis absorption spectra of the three molecules dissolved in chloroform displayed a similar shape of vibronic structures with a red shift and increased molar absorption coefficient for molecules with extended fused end groups (Fig. 2a). The absorption edges (λmax) of the three molecules were found at 638, 657 and 686 nm and maximum molar absorption coefficients (ε) were 1.41 × 105, 1.65 × 105 and 1.79 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for IDTC, IDTTC and IDTTTC, respectively. Both the red shift and increased absorption coefficient would increase the total photon absorption of the PSC devices and were a result of the expansion of the electron delocalization range.36,52 The increment in photon absorption can be converted into additional short circuit current (Jsc) which contributes to the PCE. In thin films, all three acceptors showed red shifts in comparison to their solutions (Fig. 2b). IDTTC showed a larger red shift (36 nm) in comparison to the other two materials (∼20 nm) suggesting its higher degree of aggregation in the solid state. The energy levels collected by cyclic voltammetry (CV, Fig. 3a) measurements are summarized in Fig. 3b, in comparison to the donor polymer PBDB-T59 used in this work. Extending the end groups raised both the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of IDTC due to the extension of the electron delocalization caused by the increased conjugation length at the end group.36,52 All three molecules displayed lower LUMO levels (−3.76, −3.72 and −3.67 eV) and HOMO levels (−5.47, −5.40 and −5.34 eV) compared with the donor polymer (EHOMO = −5.33 eV, ELUMO = −3.53 eV). The higher LUMO levels for molecules with extended fused end groups reduced the LUMO gap with the polymer, and hence, cut down the energy loss and increased the open circuit voltage (Voc) which also contributed to the PCE of the PSC devices.60 Compared to the absorption of thin film containing donor polymer PBDB-T, it was obvious that the molecules with extended end groups delivered a more complementary absorption range than IDTC which had its absorption range largely overlapped with the donor polymer. The photonic and electrochemical properties of the three acceptors are summarized in Table 1. Theoretical calculations using density functional theory (DFT, B3LYP/6-31G(d) level, Fig. 4) were performed to verify the band structures. Alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups to simplify the calculation because they would not significantly affect the electronic properties and the corresponding geometry of the molecules. The calculated HOMO/LUMO levels were −5.42/−3.23, −5.36/−3.21 and −5.34/−3.20 eV for IDTC, IDTTC and IDTTTC, respectively. The trend of the calculated energy level evolution was identical to that obtained from the CV measurements with values within an approximate range.

3.3. Morphology characterisation
The higher crystallisation tendency for molecules with extended end groups was readily visible in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the thin films containing these three molecules in the blends with the donor polymer PBDB-T (Fig. 5a–c) prepared identical to the PSC devices. Clear phase separated structures were visible from all blend thin films. Thin films containing IDTC showed rice like grains with an average length and width of 69.3 nm and 39.1 nm (Table S1†), respectively, and a root mean square (RMS) of the surface height of 3.1 nm. The thin film containing IDTTC showed a separated structure with grains of an average length and width of 67.6 nm and 31.7 nm (Table S2†), respectively, and an RMS of 2.9 nm. The thin film containing IDTTTC displayed a much coarser surface with an RMS of 5.2 nm despite of similar rice like features with an average length and width of 70.0 nm and 39.1 nm (Table S3†), respectively. The significantly higher variation on the surface height was more clearly visible from the line cut height profiles attached to the AFM images. The Fourier transform analysis of these height profiles (Fig. S1†) suggested an additional cluster structure for the blend thin film containing IDTTTC at a frequency of 7 μm−1 which corresponded to a domain size of 142.9 nm. The clusters around this size were spotted and are highlighted in Fig. 5c and f. We performed AFM-IR nanoscale microscopy (Fig. 5d–f) to further investigate these AFM features. The mapping of IR absorption was conducted at 1380 cm−1 highlighting the acceptor molecules suggested by the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and IR response from the AFM-IR of the pure acceptors and donor films (Fig. 5g). Additional information supporting the choice of wavenumber is described in the ESI.† The clusters in the blend film containing IDTTTC overlap with high IR response from the acceptor agreeing with the high crystallization tendency of IDTTTC.

Clusters of IDTTTC are highlighted in the images. (g) FTIR spectra of the neat materials measured by FTIR spectroscopy (solid lines) and IR response from the AFM-IR (dash lines). 
To confirm the higher crystallinity in thin films with extended end groups, GIWAXS measurements were performed on the thin films containing neat acceptor molecules as well as their blends with PBDB-T (Fig. 6 and Table 2). The GIWAXS image of neat IDTC showed relatively weak diffractions suggesting a low crystallinity. The IDTC molecules within the crystalline domains were predominantly face on with the (010) π stacking diffraction situated out-of-plane at q = 1.76 Å−1, which corresponded to a π stacking distance of 3.57 Å between the acceptor end groups. The diffraction from the (100) lamellar stacking was found preferably in-plane at q = 0.32 Å−1, which corresponded to a 19.63 Å lamellar stacking distance. A weak lamellar diffraction ring could also be observed for IDTC. The pole figure was of (100) diffraction plotted to investigate the relative diffraction intensity and orientation (Fig. 6h). The areas integrated with the polar angle χ range of 0–45° and 135–180° (Axy) and 55–125° (Az) were defined as those corresponding to the fractions of face-on and edge-on crystallites, respectively.61Axy/Az was calculated to be 1.23, which was quite close to 1, suggesting a notable amount of IDTC crystals orienting randomly. In the blend of IDTC with PBDB-T, most diffraction features from the GIWAXS image could be attributed to the donor polymer along with an out-of-plane (010) π stacking diffraction at q = 1.70 Å−1 and an in-plane (100) lamellar stacking diffraction at q = 0.30 Å−1. The IDTC diffractions almost disappeared in the blend suggesting it was predominantly amorphous within the polymer matrix. The thin film containing neat IDTTC showed a much higher diffraction intensity for both the out-of-plane (010) π stacking diffraction at q = 1.80 Å−1 and the in-plane (100) lamellar stacking diffraction at q = 0.41 Å−1, which corresponded to packing distances of 3.49 and 15.32 Å, respectively. The slightly lower π stacking distance of the acceptor end group agreed with the higher binding energy provided by the larger π stacking areas. The lamellar stacking distance was significantly reduced for IDTTC, suggesting a likelihood of interdigitation of the side groups and a closer packing. The Axy/Az of (100) diffraction was significantly increased to 5.54, suggesting a more preferential face-on packing. The relative intensity of the (100) peak was 1.28 times that of IDTC, suggesting the improved crystallinity of IDTTC. In addition to higher crystallinity, a (200) diffraction could be found in the plane at q = 0.82 Å−1. From the GIWAXS image of IDTTC in blend with PBDB-T, diffractions from both materials were visible. The relative intensity of the (100) peak was 1.24 times that of PBDB-T:IDTC, implying the higher crystallinity was maintained in the PBDB-T:IDTC blend film (Fig. 6i). The thin film containing neat IDTTTC displayed an out-of-plane (010) π stacking diffraction at q = 1.75 Å−1 and an in-plane (100) lamellar stacking diffraction at q = 0.38 Å−1, which corresponded to packing distances of 3.59 and 16.53 Å, respectively. The Axy/Az of (100) diffraction was further enhanced to 9.53, suggesting the most predominant face-on packing among the three molecules. The relative intensity of the (100) peak was 2.03 times that of IDTC, demonstrating the highest crystallinity of IDTTTC. An additional strong out-of-plane diffraction could be clearly seen at q = 0.70 Å−1 which corresponded to 8.97 Å and might relate to the stacking of the donor core suggesting its higher crystal regularity than that of crystals containing molecules with shorter end groups.37,62 Many other minor orders could be observed in both thin films containing neat IDTTTC and its blend with PBDB-T also suggesting higher crystallinity as well as higher crystal regularity. The relative intensity of the (100) peak was 1.84 times that of PBDB-T:IDTC, implying the highest crystallinity of the PBDB-T:IDTC blend film. We estimated the domain sizes of the acceptor crystals by applying the Scherrer equation to the axial distribution of (100) diffraction of the neat and blended films.63 The calculated lower limits of average crystal sizes (Lc) of the acceptor crystals were 9.4, 34.3 and 76.3 nm for the IDTC, IDTTC and IDTTTC neat films, respectively. In the blend films, IDTTC and IDTTTC displayed an Lc of 18.4 and 87.1 nm, respectively. The Lc of IDTC in blend with PBDB-T was not calculated because of the absence of the acceptor diffractions. We also estimated the Lc for PBDB-T in the blends. The Lc values for the donor polymer were 11.2, 16.8 and 15.1 nm in blend with IDTC, IDTTC and IDTTTC, respectively. Hence, the crystalline domain size of the donor polymer remained little affected when blend with different acceptor molecules. As the phase separation scale cannot be lower than the Lc of the crystalline domains of either components of the blends, it can be concluded that IDTTTC forms much larger phase separation than the ideal phase separation scale for high performance PSCs. The estimated Lc values were in agreement with the observation from the AFM and AFM-IR images. The significantly higher crystallinity, crystal regularity and crystal size found in GIWAXS measurements for both neat and blend films containing molecules with an extended fused end group were direct evidence for their higher crystallization tendency.

3.4. Charge carrier mobilities
The higher crystallinity of molecules with extended end groups contributed directly to the electron transport mobility (μe) of the BHJ blends. The charge transport mobility of thin films containing these three acceptor molecules in blend with PBDB-T were analysed with space charge limited conductivity (SCLC, Fig. 7a and b) measurements. Thin film containing PBDB-T and IDTC displayed a hole transport mobility (μh) of 4.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe of 2.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The μh/μe ratio was 1.60. In thin film containing blends of PBDB-T and IDTTC, a μh of 5.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a μe of 5.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μh/μe ratio of 1.03 were recorded. In thin film containing blends of PBDB-T and IDTTTC, we found a μh of 1.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a μe of 3.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μh/μe ratio of 0.34. The ratio of μh/μe decreased drastically in blend thin films containing molecules with extended end groups agreeing with the increasing crystallinity. Interestingly, IDTTC, which had intermediate crystallization tendency, was found to deliver almost identical μe to the μh of the donor polymer facilitating almost balanced hole/electron transport within the BHJ which is favourable for the device performances.64,65

3.5. Photovoltaic performances
To evaluate the influence of the crystallization tendency as well as the nanostructure on photovoltaic performances, PSC devices containing each of these acceptor molecules were fabricated and characterized (see the J–V characterisation studies in Fig. 8a and the corresponding device parameters summarized in Table 3). All devices were found with similar and outstanding Voc over 1 V. The Voc increased faintly when the end group was extended, and the trend was in agreement with the rising LUMO levels. In contrast, the Jsc of these three devices varied strongly. The Jsc of devices containing IDTTC (18.25 mA cm−2) was notably higher than that of IDTC (16.09 mA cm−2). When we investigated the origin of this difference by comparing the external quantum efficiency (EQE, Fig. 8b) curves with respect to the wavelength of the photon, we found that the increased Jsc in IDTTC could be predominately attributed to the photon absorption by IDTTC at higher wavelengths due to its lower band gap. However, devices containing IDTTTC were found with a largely reduced Jsc (14.53 mA cm−2) despite a similar EQE range and higher photon absorption coefficient than that of IDTTC. A significantly lower EQE throughout the absorption range for IDTTTC devices in comparison to IDTTC likely due to the poor charge generation and collection process is caused by its unfavourable nanostructure. The influence of the nanostructure on device performances was more evident when the fill factors (FF) were compared. IDTC, IDTTC and IDTTTC exhibit FFs of 68.9%, 73.2% and 43.2%, respectively. The high FF of IDTTC was in agreement with its more optimized nanostructure as well as the more balanced charge transport compared with the other two materials. The highest PCEs of these three materials are 11.08%, 13.49% and 6.46%, respectively. Hence, IDTTC, which has an intermediate crystallization tendency, delivered highest performances predominately due to its optimized nanostructure, balanced charge transport and higher photon absorption.

To obtain further insight for comparing the performances of devices containing the three acceptors, we measured Voc and Jscversus the incident light intensity (Fig. 9a and b).66–69 The slopes of the Voc evolution against the light intensity on the logarithmic scale were found to be 1.097, 1.036 and 1.250 kT e−1 respectively. This indicated that trap-assisted charge recombination is only evident in the devices containing IDTTTC.67–69 Devices with IDTTC as the acceptor show the slope closest to 1 suggesting that the trap-assisted charge recombination is suppressed utmost.67–69 The slopes (α) of the Jsc evolution against the light intensity in a double-logarithmic plot were found to be 0.931, 0.959 and 0.780 respectively. The devices containing IDTTTC showed the lowest α, which was a sign of noticeable bimolecular charge recombination. Devices with IDTTC as acceptors showed α closest to 1 suggesting that the bimolecular charge recombination was suppressed utmost.67–69 The relatively high trap-assisted as well as bimolecular charge recombination is in agreement with the low FF and large phase separation in thin films containing IDTTTC. We also explored the free charge generation process by plotting Jphversus Veff in a double-logarithmic plot, where Jph is the difference between the dark (JD) and light (JL) current density and the effective voltage Veff is defined as V0 − V, and V0 is the voltage where Jph = 0 V (Fig. 9c).66–70 All three devices showed clear saturation current density (Jsat) at high reverse voltage (Jeff > 2 V). Devices with IDTTC showed highest Jsat and were situated at lower voltage suggesting easiest free charge generation.66,70 The charge dissociation probability (P(E,T)), which was defined as Jph/Jsat under short circuit conditions, was found to be 0.914, 0.9254 and 0.8472 for devices containing IDTC, IDTTC and IDTTTC, respectively. The most efficient free charge generation for IDTTC devices was one of the sources for their high Jsc and FF.66 The low probability of recombination and high efficiency of charge dissociation in devices containing IDTTC was expected based on its optimized nanostructure due to a suitable crystallization tendency and was in agreement with the highest device performances.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we tuned the crystallisation tendency step by step of a nonfullerene acceptor molecule IDTC by extending the size of its fused end groups. Its derivatives IDTTC and IDTTTC with larger fused end groups possessed increased melting temperatures suggesting higher intermolecular binding energies which influenced their crystallisation tendency. This systematic study revealed that the nanostructure of the BHJ blend can be modified by tuning the crystallisation tendency of the acceptor molecules. Compared with IDTC which displayed very limited crystallinity within the BHJ blend, IDTTC provided increased crystallinity with a suitable phase separation scale and balanced hole/electron transport ability of the BHJ, and hence, increased the device performances significantly. IDTTTC, on the other hand, possessed further increased crystallisation tendency which led to a very high crystallinity, average crystal size and crystal regularity in the BHJ blend. The unfavourable nanostructure with a phase separation scale over 100 nm diminished the performances of the devices containing IDTTTC. With these observations, we established a new route and paradigm to adjust the crystallisation tendency as well as the BHJ nanostructure through molecular engineering and how a molecule with a suitable crystallization tendency delivered optimized device performances. Additionally, Tm as an indicator for the crystallisation tendency was verified for nonfullerene acceptors which provided a handy tool for molecule screening.
