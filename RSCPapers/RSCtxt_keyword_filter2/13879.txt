However, the light-harvesting performance of these devices is still limited by excessive charge carrier recombination. Charge carrier management can be improved, taking into account the transport properties of layers surrounding the absorber. In particular, the choice of an appropriate hole-transport material (HTM) could provide a path towards increasing the device performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The Lambertian reflection on the cell's back-surface reflector could increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs as well. Taking into account these facts, we analyse the absorptance and the PCE of a perovskite thin-film solar cell with the Lambertian reflection on the cell's back-surface reflector for various organic and inorganic HTMs. The analysis is done by means of the Monte-Carlo ray tracing simulations complemented by the transfer-matrix method to account for the interference phenomenon in the local generation rate G of carriers in a thin-film multilayer system. This function is employed further in the transport equations to calculate the current–voltage characteristics of the cell. We show that wide band gap HTMs, that possess negligible absorption, increase the photocurrent in the perovskite, passing reflected photons from the back reflector. In contrast, at the same perovskite thickness the PSC gains less photocurrent with narrow band gap HTMs, where an excessive non-radiative recombination takes place. Our analysis demonstrates that the optimal thickness of the solar cell with the typical absorber CH3NH3PbI3 is ∼300 nm, providing the maximal efficiency ∼18.8% for the wide band gap HTM (CuSCN) at the moderate absorber purity (the diffusion length D ∼ 1 μm).
1 Introduction
Remarkable electrical and optical properties of organic–inorganic halide perovskites ensure tremendous experimental as well theoretical activities on their application in the field of photovoltaics.1,2 The advantages of this class of materials are the versatility of their chemical and crystallographic structures which are made by abundant elemental constituents.3,4 Evidently, the high absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion length, high carrier mobility, and low temperature processing are also important benefits of this class of materials. Surpassing ∼25% PCE5 makes hybrid perovskite solar cells equal in efficiency to most polycrystalline solar absorbers, exceeded only by single-crystal silicon and III–V technologies. It becomes obvious, however, that the availability of an effective absorber is a necessary, but still an insufficient condition to build an efficient thin-film perovskite solar cell.6 Nowadays, the diversity of various PSC configurations is classified on typical designs, based on junction structure (n–i–p) and morphology (planar, mesoporous and meso-superstructure)7. The performance of a solar cell depends just as much on the transporting layers used in the device, and the interplay of various physical mechanisms that define the efficiency of PSCs.
We recall that in the process of absorption, simultaneously, the photons create free electron–hole pairs and excitons. The latter ones are, however, useless for the production of current if there is no charge dissociation before reaching the corresponding layers. Additionally, there are various types of recombination. We consider only the Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) non-radiative recombination,8 as a dominant one. In the same vein, ion migration may induce trap states that act as non-radiative recombination centers in a perovskite film, decreasing the charge carrier lifetime. It is noteworthy that ion migration generates defect states in perovskite bulk crystal, causing interfacial band doping and degradation of the carrier transport layer. Various approaches are suggested to suppress ion migration: (i) lowering the defect state densities inside the perovskite bulk crystal and increasing the grain size; (ii) post passivation to block the grain boundary channels; (iii) interface passivation, etc. (for a review see ref. 9). There are still open questions such as: (1) Why does light enhance ion migration? (2) How can ion migration be suppressed without affecting the PCE? Recently it was proposed to replace I− ions in the perovskite with Br−.10 This results in the reduction in trap density and defect states, improving the device performance. In fact, the engineering of the interfaces: a perovskite-HTM and an electron-transport material (ETM)-perovskite, can lead to substantial performance improvements of PSCs.11,12 Given the fact that ion migration effects will be eventually minimized, once the perovskite structure and surrounding layers are optimized, we neglect the phenomenon of ion migration and leave detailed discussion of this issue for the future. The main goal of our paper is to illuminate the role of typical HTM layers for the performance of PSCs.
In fact, various efforts on modifying and upgrading the perovskite as well HTMs are carried out to improve the overall device performance and to achieve better stability.13 Different organic HTMs, such as Spiro-OMeTAD, PTAA, CuPc, or P3HT are used for PSCs. Note, however, that the low tolerance to moisture, rapid degradation when exposed to UV light and high temperature restrict their use for PSCs.14 In addition, the low permittivity of organic, narrow band gap semiconductors yields a high binding energy of excitons, making more difficult charge dissociation in contrast to that in a perovskite. Furthermore, in particular, the high cost of Spiro-OMeTAD or P3HT restricts their use when commercializing solar cells. Consequently, the natural requirement for several years of device operation intensified the need to consider inorganic p-type materials. Inorganic materials, employed as a HTM in PSCs, are CuI, CuSCN, NiO, Cu2O, MoO3, among others.14 They have a wider band gap (high transparency in the visible region); good chemical stability; and high conductivity. These properties could provide a high PCE as well as long term operational and cost-effective perovskite solar cells. For example, CuSCN films limit the photovoltaic degradation of moisture sensitive perovskite layers.15
In general, any type of HTM, being an essential element of the PSC, possesses the following features: (i) acts as a potential barrier between the anode and perovskite layer, and, consequently, blocks the electron transfer to the anode; (ii) blocks cold hole transfer from the anode to the perovskite; (iii) prevents the degradation at the metal–perovskite interface, that might occur in its absence; (iv) together with an ETM layer forms a built-in electric field that separates photogenerated carriers.16 Although there is a wide variety of device architectures for improving both the stability and the performance, a HTM plays, however, the most vital role in the environmental and economic disadvantages of the PSCs.17 Additionally, the light path and absorption inside a perovskite are subject to the complex refractive index of a HTM.
Indeed, the efficiency of a real solar cell depends as well on a few important constituents. Among them, the optics is the key underpinning feature for improving solar energy conversion technologies. It is of utmost importance during the initial stages of development of a new prototype. One of the most common tools used to determine the optics of complex solar systems with a high accuracy is the so-called Monte-Carlo ray tracing simulation. It consists of a set of techniques that determine the path of light through matter in a three-dimensional (3D) environment with computer simulations.18 It helps to analyze the performance of solar cells, due to the ability to perform optical simulations of systems with complex geometries [e.g. ref. 19–22]. We implement in our approach the Monte-Carlo ray tracing technique, adding the transfer-matrix method (TMM) to characterize the optical response of the PSC. Note, that in all these studies mentioned above, J–V characteristics, that define objectively the system efficiency, are missing. On the other hand, different groups focus on the effects of perovskite thickness on the PCE;23J–V characteristics,24 and optimization of electron and hole transport layers of PSCs,25 to name just a few, without cross-impact analysis of the optics. This is one of the major goals of our paper to consider the combined effect of the ray tracing results with the PCE of a solar cell.
It is important to mention that rigorous optical models, that consider all the effects regarding the radiation-matter interaction mentioned above, are needed to elucidate the number of absorbed photons inside the active materials. To this aim the rate G of the creation of pairs of electrons/holes should be considered a position-dependent function. For instance, such dependence was employed to estimate energy losses in a fixed PSC structure, taking into account: (i) reflections on the backside of the solar cell; and (ii) the interference effects.26 In our approach, in addition to the above mechanisms, we will optimize the perovskite layer thickness, depending of the chosen HTM, and consider the effect of a light-trapping mechanism on the rate G.
Although the most energetic photons of the solar spectrum are absorbed very close to the interface of the active absorbing layer, the reduction of a short circuit current Jsc due to the very thin thickness should be compensated.27 The efficiency improvement of thin solar cells may be achieved by light trapping mechanisms [e.g. ref. 28 and 29]. It appears that light-trapping mechanisms such as textured surfaces,30 back-reflectors,7 anti-reflecting coatings31etc., should be considered in order to increase the light path inside a semiconductor and enhance the absorption. From the ray-optics point of view, light-trapping mechanisms make use of the effect of total internal reflection between a semiconductor and an adjacent medium. Lambertian light trapping, also known as Lambertian scattering, sets the thermodynamic limit of the maximum absorption in a semiconductor layer with a given thickness in the geometric optics regime.32 Therefore, we consider the Lambertian scattering between the HTM and the back reflector as the most simple trapping mechanism.
As is mentioned above, the light path inside a perovskite, that determines the light absorption, is closely related to the refractive index of the adjacent layers. It is noteworthy that HTMs could have considerable absorption coefficients. Neglecting this fact, one risks to misestimate the photogenerated current. There appears to be little doubt about a consideration optical as well as electronic properties of a HTM in their impact on a real device PCE. Obviously, this impact could vary according to the HTM choice. In fact, there is a lack of parametric analysis that evaluates the influence of HTMs on the interplay between the PCE and the thickness of PSCs. To the best of our knowledge, there are no available models that couple the optics equations + the carrier transport equations + the Lambertian light trapping, and provide the objective certainty of the efficiency of the solar cell samples/models for different HTMs.
Thus, the main aim of our study is to carry out a parametric analysis of a n–i–p perovskite solar cell, comparing results for several HTMs. One of the goals is to obtain an optimum perovskite thickness for a chosen HTM, and, consequently, compare the influence of a HTM choice on the PSC efficiency. We will carry out our analysis within a recently developed approach,33 that combines ray tracing simulations and the electron transport theory, used for the analysis of the maximum efficiency of the typical perovskite solar cell ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3/CuI.34
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 the basic ingredients of our approach are presented. Section 3 is devoted to analysis of the properties of various HTMs in light of: (i) the efficiency increase in PSCs; and (ii) the determination of an optimal absorber thickness. In the final section, the main results are stated.
2 Methodology
The aim of this section is to discuss the most relevant aspects of our approach33 in order to provide an overview the methodology used in the present work.
2.1 Solar cell stack
The thin-film multilayer structure, analyzed in this paper, consists of a typical set of materials used for high-efficiency n–i–p perovskite solar cells (see Fig. 1). The top of the system is composed of the BK7 glass cover, coated with the MgF2 antireflective film, followed by the fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) layer as a transparent conducting oxide. The compact layer of TiO2, acting as the ETM, is deposited over the most widely studied perovskite absorber, CH3NH3PbI3. Finally, there is the HTM and silver back contact, connected to the external circuit.
 Fig. 1  A sketch of the thin-film system. It is composed of: MgF2 (99.8 nm)35/BK7 glass (1 mm)36/FTO (200 nm)37/TiO2 (56.5 nm)38/Pervoskite (variable)39/HTM (variable)/Ag.40 
The thickness of the MgF2 and the TiO2 layers have been calculated applying the antireflective coating condition at the wavelength λ = 550 nm.62 To illuminate the contribution of each HTM to the efficiency of our sample (see Fig. 1), we consider the following HTMs: Spiro-OMeTAD,63 P3HT,64 two of the most typically used organic HTM in PSCs; and in addition CuPc65 and CuSCN,66 both promising candidate Cu-based p-type semiconductor HTMs. In this way we elucidate essential physical properties that could be taken into account at the high-level design of the PSC. Hereafter, for the sake of convenience, we introduce the following notation for the considered HTMs: Spiro-OMeTAD (HTM1), P3HT (HTM2), CuSCN (HTM3), and CuPc (HTM4).
For all the films, incorporated into the multi-layer system, the physical parameters are taken from the experimental data (see the corresponding references in the caption to Fig. 1 and Table 1). The optical properties of the solar cell materials (the refractive index n and the extinction coefficient k, as a function of wavelength) are also taken from experimental data.35–40,63–66

We use two different values for the HTM layer thickness: 225 nm67,68 and 85 nm,69–72 for HTM1,2 and HTM3,4, respectively. The presence of the Lambartian BSR, where a nanoscale roughness is taken into account, leads to the definition of the effective HTM layer thickness, defined as the average of the layer thickness in a contact + the roughness.
2.2 Optical model
As discussed in the introduction, to study the influence of optical properties on the BSR, we employ ray tracing simulations with the aid of the ray trace OTSun python package.73 It is a Monte Carlo ray tracing where the optics is implemented through the Fresnel optics equations in their most general form, complemented by the transfer-matrix method to account for the interference phenomenon.74,75 This software allows us to perform the simulations by loading a geometry file designed with the aid of FreeCAD,76 an open source software for the parametric modeling of geometric figures in 3D.
OTSun considers the Fresnel equations and light polarization to determine the trajectory and the energy of each ray in a solar optical system. The Fresnel coefficients describe the amplitudes of the reflected (R) and transmitted (T) waves at an interface for both parallel and perpendicular components:62 (1) (2)The tilted optical admittance of the material ηi (i = 1, 2) depends on the polarization of the incident light: (3)where  is the optical impedance of a free space; θi is the incidence angle; ñi(λ) = ni(λ) − iki(λ) is the complex refractive index; and λ is the light wavelength.
According to the Beer–Lambert law for a given absorption coefficient α(λ) = 4πk(λ)/λ of a material, the number of absorbed photons is a function of the path length  of the light beam through a material: N(,λ) = N0(0,λ)e−α(λ).(4)Here, N0(0,λ) is the initial number of photons of the incident ray on a material per unit area and per wavelength (for each time when a ray impacts onto a material according to the path trajectories determined by the ray tracing simulation). With the aid of OTSun and eqn (4), we calculate the generation rate (5)where z = cosθ is the depth from a semiconductor surface, and θ is the ray refracted angle. The function G(z) provides the number of electrons per unit volume, generated at each point in the device due to the photon absorption.
A sketch of the considered n–i–p junction, formed by the ETM, the perovskite and an HTM, is displayed in Fig. 2. Since the absorption in the TiO2 layer (ETM) is much less in contrast to other active layers of our system (see Fig. 1), we count the absorption starting from the ETM-perovskite interface. In order to visualize the idea of the optical calculations we show: (i) the direction of the z-coordinate, according to the arrangement of the layers; (ii) the magnitude of the corresponding photogeneration rate function in the two active layers. We recall that a semiconductor has to fulfill some basic requirements in order to attain a high efficiency. In particular, an ideal absorber requires: (i) a short absorption length (A); (ii) large relaxation life-times τ for carriers; and (iii) high carrier mobilities μ. In total, the following condition should hold for the diffusion length:  where W is a semiconductor thickness, and D is the diffusion coefficient (see Section 2.4).
 Fig. 2  Sketch of the n–i–p junction of the PSC, where the coordinate z direction is shown. The photogeneration rate (black solid line) is displayed as a function of the z-coordinate in the perovskite and HTM regions. 
Evidently, the maximum of the photogeneration rate is reached near the absorbing surface, at a small value of the depth z. It is more prominent in the perovskite due to its large absorption coefficient. On the other hand, approaching the interface HTM-back reflector there is an increase in the rate in HTMs, especially in narrow band gap ones, due to the contribution of the reflected photons from the BSR. We return to this question below, taking into account the effect of charge recombination mechanisms.
2.3 The Lambertian scattering
As is mentioned in the Introduction, light-trapping mechanisms increase effectively the light path inside the active materials, and, consequently, increase the absorption. As a result, light-trapping may decrease the absorption material thickness. Note, however, that the open circuit voltage Voc increases at a smaller thickness, while the short circuit current Jsc is decreasing. The light trapping is opposed to this decrease. Consequently, it effectively increases the PCE, since more photogenerated carriers contribute to the photocurrent.33,77
The simplest trapping mechanism, considered by us, is the Lambertian scattering on the back contact surface.33 The roughness of the BSR randomizes the light propagation inside the active materials, increasing effectively a propagation light path inside them. Additionally, the randomization breaks the interference of the reflected rays. In the present paper, the perovskite and HTMs layers (the active materials) have been considered as incoherent in the simulations. In favour of this consideration, we used the results of our analysis for the case of the specular (ideal) reflection.33 These results demonstrate a close correspondence between the perovskite absorptance considered as coherent or incoherent.
In our multilayer structure (see Fig. 1) the BSR material Ag is in contact with a HTM layer. We consider the Ag's roughness as a source of the isotropic reflection characteristic of the Lambertian scattering. The literature provides us with an example of how this roughness could be achieved in a silver back-contact.78
2.4 Carrier transport model
To calculate J–V characteristics of an illuminated solar cell with different HTMs, we employ the model in ref. 34. It allows us to incorporate generation rates for carrier transfers into the continuity equations for electrons in a conduction band and for holes in a valence band. Below we provide the principal elements of the model.
The following set of equations for electron/hole density η = n/p is considered: (6) (7) (8)  = n − p(9) (10)The function G is the generation rate of carriers per unit volume, which is calculated by means of the OTSun program, discussed in Section 2.2; R is the recombination rate of carriers per unit volume; Na/Nd is the ionized acceptor/donor density; EC(EV) is the edge energy of the conduction (valence) band; ε is the permittivity, and q = |e|. Since the electric field strength  is related to the scalar potential ϕ, eqn (8) transforms to Poisson's equation.
The considered approach is extended by adding the continuity equations for the energy density Eη = η·εη of electron–hole plasma (11)Here, Pη = η·η; Γη = η(εη − ε0)/τεη, where τεη is the energy relaxation time and ε0 = 3kBT0/2. This extension is due to the fact that the mobility μη, and, correspondingly, the diffusion coefficient Dη = μηkBT0/qη depends on the mean carrier energy εη. Here, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T0 is a solar cell temperature. The energy flux density η is defined as (12)where γ determines the differential thermo e.m.f. coefficient [see ref. 79, p. 430], and K determines the thermal conductivity. The rate of non-radiative recombination has a standard form R = (np − ni2)/[τp(n + ni) + τn(p + ni)].(13)Here, ni is a carrier concentration in the intrinsic semiconductor [see ref. 80 for details]. To study the efficiency of the solar cell we solve eqn (6)–(13) only for the active layers of the solar cell structure (see Fig. 1 and the corresponding discussion in Section 2.2). The parameters for the contact and the perovskite layers are given in Table 1.
We use the following boundary conditions. At the surface interface FTO-TiO2 in a heavily doped TiO2 the majority carrier concentration is set to the value n = Nd, while the minority one is set to the value p = ni2/Nd. The opposite situation occurs at the surface interface HTM-Ag, where in heavily doped HTMs the majority carrier concentration is p = Na (see Table 1), while the minority one is set to the value n = ni2/Na. We assume that at boundaries (top and bottom boundaries of the active region in Fig. 2) electron and hole subsystems have average energies as in thermal equilibrium εn = εp = 3kBT0/2.
When the n–i–p system is illuminated, light creates electron–hole pairs in the perovskite and HTM layer, while the ETM layer is a transparent material in this case. In order to define the J–V characteristics of the considered system, one has to extract the contact potential difference (the built-in voltage) from the applied voltage to the n–i–p structure by means of the standard procedure.80 At a given voltage applied to the solar cell under incident light, we are able to define the current over contacts. The numerical approach to the solution of the set of equations is discussed in detail in ref. 34.
3 Discussion of results
Our theoretical model is validated by comparing the simulation results with experimental data reported by Ball et al.81 We obtain excellent agreement between our results for the optical data and the J–V characteristics for the device configuration reported by Ball et al. (see the ESI†). These results provide a solid basis for the vitality of our analysis, as discussed below.
3.1 Optical properties of the PSC with different HTMs
Before discussing the J–V characteristics of the PSC, let us analyse its optical properties. To this aim it is useful to conduct the analysis of different physical mechanisms, participating in the distribution of the solar radiation in the PSC. We consider the following ratio (14)Here, Pirr is the solar irradiation power density; Pref is the fraction of the energy reflected by the PSC; Ploss is the fraction of the energy absorbed by the passive components (all materials unless the perovskite and HTM layers), named as the parasitic losses. The power densities Ppvk and Phtm are associated with the fraction of the solar radiation, absorbed by the perovskite and by the HTM, respectively. The calculations are done with the aid of the OTSun python package73 under the standard AM1.5 ASTM G-173-03 reference direct spectrum.82 We consider the wavelength range 300–800 nm, in which the useful irradiance is 508.8 W m−2. The ray tracing simulations are carried out emitting 1000 rays per wavelength with a 2 nm step at the normal incidence.
By integrating the absorptance over the wavelength, it is possible to compare the influence of parasitic losses with the perovskite and the HTM absorption, and the total reflectance, as a function of perovskite thickness (see Fig. 3). The PSC reflects stronger with the wide band gap HTM1,3 layers, since the absorption is absent in these layers.
 Fig. 3  Parasitic losses, reflectance and absorptance in the PSC with the Lambertian BSR as a function of the perovskite layer thickness. Different values of the perovskite thickness are considered to stress the effect of different processes with different HTMs. The calculations are done for: (a) HTM1(Spiro-OMeTAD); (b) HTM2(P3HT); (c) HTM3(CuSCN); (d) HTM4(CuPc). 
The total absorption ξ is stronger in the PSC with the narrow band semiconductor HTM2,4 layers. It turns out, however, that the absorption in the perovskite is stronger in the PSC with the HTM1,3 layers in contrast to that with the HTM2,4 layers, at the same thickness of perovskite (see Fig. 3). This phenomenon is due to the additional absorptance of the reflected photons from the BSR in the perovskite.
Evidently, the enhanced absorption in the HTM2,4 layers reduces the contribution of the reflected photons in the perovskite. What is more important, this process does not increase the PCE of the device however (see Section 3.3). First, the increased absorption in heavily doped HTM layers leads to the increase of non-radiative SRH recombination,8 which decreases the number of free carriers (electrons and holes) that could reach the contacts. Second, in many organic semiconductors we can distinguish the optical and the transport band gaps. Note that the optical band gap (Eoptg) is usually smaller than the transport band gap (Etrg).45 For example, in CuPC (HTM4) the transport band gap is 2.2 eV (λtr ≈ 563 nm), while the detectable absorption takes place till λopt ∼ 800 nm (1.55 eV)46 (see also Fig. 4). Although the absorption with photon energies below the transport band gap energy is less in the P3HT, similar behaviour is observed as well.49
 Fig. 4  Absorption spectra of semiconductors. The band gap values of CuPc (Eg = 560 eV) and P3HT (Eg = 690 eV) are indicated by vertical lines with the indexes (1) and (2), respectively. 
We recall that in organic semiconductors the absorption of photons with energy hν < Etrg is delivered basically into the formation of tightly bound (Frenkel) excitons (cf. ref. 83). As was discussed above such excitons are, however, useless for the production of the photocurrent, since there is no charge dissociation before reaching the corresponding charge transport layer. It seems, therefore, natural to assume that all photons with energies Eoptg ≤ hν < Etrg will be lost for the production of the free electron–hole pairs. Consequently, all photons with the wave lengths corresponding to these energies, although being absorbed, are neglected in the calculations of the integral (5) (the function G(z)) and following charge transport eqn (6)–(13).
In inorganic semiconductors (CuSCN) the difference between the transport and optical band gaps is ignored due to the much smaller Wannier exciton binding energy than that of the organic counterparts. Furthermore, in the latter case low exciton binding energies enable thermal dissociation of bound electron–hole pairs. It results in predominantly free electrons and holes at room temperature (∼300 °K).
3.2 Internal quantum efficiency and PCE
Let us consider in detail a few mechanisms that affect the number of free carriers, produced in the PSC under solar irradiation, and, consequently, the short circuit current Jsc and the PCE. It is well known that the output of the interplay is: (i) the light absorption; (ii) the rates of photocurrent generation and charge recombination, determine the PCE of the PSC. It seems reasonable to expect that the largest recombination takes place in a domain where carriers are photogenerated. It is solely a perovskite layer in the PSC with a wide band gap HTM layer, while the perovskite and HTM layers constitute this domain in the PSC with a narrow band gap HTM layer. Notice, the concentration of defects near the interfaces between different crystal regions of a PSC heterostructure creates trap states that increase the recombination rate. Fortunately, several techniques have been suggested recently, that allow us to reduce the surface recombination. Among them are: a temperature treatment,84 a chemical passivation,85,86 or a laser processing,87 to name just a few. In the well-constructed structures the additional recombination is, indeed, negligible [see, for example, the discussion in ref. 88]. Therefore, in this contribution we neglect the additional recombinations, produced at the interfaces, to highlight opportunities that arise from the open circuit voltage increase in thin film solar cells if they are well-constructed.
Naively, one might expect that the large absorption in the narrow band gap HTM2,4 would increase the PCE of the PSC. However, in the heavily doped HTM the excess recombination reduces detectable amounts of the photogenerated carries. To get deeper insights into the interplay of these two processes we consider the internal quantum efficiency (IQE).
We compare the IQE for the considered HTMs at the fixed perovskite thickness W (see Fig. 5). Since in the perovskite the diffusion length D ≫ W (see Table 1), it is expected that the bulk recombination in this layer is negligible. Note, in the wide band gap HTM1,3 the absorption (and, consequently, the photogeneration as well as the recombination) is negligible in comparison with the perovskite absorption (see Fig. 3). The partial short circuit current Jsc is determined by the free carriers generated in the perovskite layer only. Consequently, the IQE is almost one for all considered wavelength intervals (see Fig. 5). On the other hand, in the narrow band gap HTM layers the absorption in the wavelength range 300 < λ < 500 nm is negligible as well in comparison with the perovskite absorption (see Fig. 4). These photons, absorbed in the perovskite, generate the free carriers there. As a result, within these limits the IQE is also one for such devices.
 Fig. 5  The IQE for the PSC at the absorber thickness W = 300 nm. 
In the wavelength range 500 nm < λ < λtr [λtr = 563(688) nm in HTM4 (HTM2)] the absorption coefficient α in the perovskite falls faster than that in HTM layers. In the latter case the absorption coefficient even increases slightly (see Fig. 4). As a result, in this wavelength range we observe the decrease of the IQE for the PSC with the HTM2 (P3HT), while its behavior is more complex for the PSC with the HTM4 (CuPc) (see Fig. 5). This decrease can be attributed only to an excessive recombination in highly doped HTM layers. Note, however, that within these limits the IQE of the PSC with the thick perovskite layer (W = 900 nm) and the narrow band gap HTM4 is still close to unity. In this case all photons are absorbed in the perovskite.
We recall that in the narrow band HTM2,4 there is the difference between the transport and optical band gaps. The IQE decreases rapidly in the wavelength domain λ > λtr due to formation of strongly bound excitons. Although the absorption persists with the increase of the photon wavelength (see Fig. 4), the recombination processes and exciton formations yield the decrease of IQE for the device with CuPc even with the thick absorber.
The behaviour of the IQE is more complicated in the device with the HTM2 (P3HT) layer (see Fig. 5). A close look on the absorption in the P3HT layer (see Fig. 6) illuminates the local sharp increase of the IQE in the region 610 < λ < 650 nm. At λ ≤ 500 nm there is the dominant absorption in the perovskite resulting in the IQE value around one. In this wavelength domain the absorption is absent in the P3HT layer. However, the absorption coefficient in the perovskite decreases much faster than that in the P3HT (see Fig. 4), starting from λ = 500 nm. Consequently, at 500 < λ < 610 nm there is an increase of the absorption in the HTM2 layer. As discussed above, this absorption induces the recombination processes that decrease the IQE. In the wavelength interval 610 ≤ λ < 650 (nm) the absorption coefficient decreases faster in the P3HT than that in the perovskite. As a result, the local bump appears in the IQE in this wavelength domain. The dominance of the absorption rate in the perovskite results in more absorbed photons that contribute to the photocurrent. Starting from λ > 650 nm, the absorption coefficient increases in the P3HT layer, leading to the fast decrease of the IQE in the long wavelength domain due to an exciton formation at λ > λtr.
 Fig. 6  IQE (left scale) for the PSC with the perovskite absorber thickness W = 300 nm. The HTM absorption (right scale) with respect to the overall active materials absorption (it is stated as a percentage). The calculations are done for the HTM2. 
We conclude that in the narrow band gap organic HTM layers there are favourable conditions for the formation of excitons as well as for the recombination. Evidently, these processes are unwanted from the view point of the PCE increase. These facts make such HTMs less attractive for the design of PSCs compared to the wide band gap organic HTMs, and even more so to inorganic HTMs.
3.3 On optimal absorber thickness
One of the basic requirements of photovoltaic elements is to operate with an active absorbing layer width of the order of a micron or even less to produce flexible films for various applications. Additionally, J–V characteristics should provide the maximal efficiency for a chosen device architecture. We recall that the efficiency η is expressed through the principal characteristics of the PSC such as: (i) short circuit current Jsc; (ii) open circuit voltage Voc; (iii) fill factor FF, in the well-known form: η = Jsc·Vos·FF/Pirr.(15)Before discussing the optimal thickness a few comments are in order.
In general, to increase the Jsc one should use a sufficiently thick absorber, or to employ light-trapping mechanisms and minimize photocarriers losses. On the other hand, the increase of the open circuit voltage Voc can be attributed to the dependence of the forward n–i–p current (governed by the recombination) on the device thickness. These two effects affect the PCE in opposite directions. Evidently, their interplay should be essential for the optimal thickness of PSCs.
It is well known that maximum voltage is obtained under illumination of the photovoltaic element at open circuit conditions. This voltage shifts the n–i–p diode in the forward direction and generates the injection of electrons (holes) from the ETM (HTM) layer into the perovskite. At open circuit conditions this injection current (J) must be precisely equal to the photogenerated current, flowing in the opposite direction (Jsc). We recall that the current (J) is expressed as J = Js·(eqV/kT − 1),(16)where Js is the injection current at high negative applied voltages V → −∞. At the condition V = Voc the total current through the irradiated PSC is Jtot = J(Voc) −Jsc = 0 and, consequently, we have (17)It is expected that the thicker the absorber layer, the larger the recombination; and, consequently, the larger the dark saturated current Js. We recall that the dark current is governed by the recombination current. On the other hand, intuitively it is obvious that the larger the built-in voltage (Vbi, see below) the smaller the dark current Js, and, consequently, the larger the open circuit voltage Voc. Note that in the n–i–p structure the saturated dark current Js could be decreased with the aid of the potential barrier created in the interface perovskite-HTM (see Fig. 7). Below we show how the variation of the built-in voltage Vbi and height ΔEv, defined by the HTM choice affects the open circuit voltages and the PCE of corresponding PSCs.
 Fig. 7  Band structure of the TiO2-perovskite-HTM PSC. Here, the quantity ΔEv is a barrier, created by the valence band maximum discontinuity at the perovskite-HTM interface. 
Now we are ready to discuss how the interplay of the physical characteristics (Vos, Jsc, FF) could bring the optimal absorber thickness while striving to achieve the maximal efficiency at a chosen HTM. The result of calculations demonstrates the increase of the short circuit current Jsc [see Fig. 8(b)] with the increase of the perovskite thickness. The presence of the Lambertian BSR is the determining factor of the enhanced corresponding current in thin samples 125 ≤ W ≤ 500 (nm). The magnitude of the short circuit current Jsc differs, however, noticeably in the PSC with the HTM1,3 layers from that with the HTM2,4 layers. The PSC with HTM1,3 layers generate much larger Jsc in contrast to that generated with the HTM2,4 layers. As is discussed above (see Section 3.1), the enhanced absorptance in the HTM2,4 layers reduces the contribution of the reflected photons in the perovskite (see Fig. 3). This results in the carrier lose in the photocurrent due to the recombination and the exciton formation.
 Fig. 8  The open circuit voltage (a), and the short circuit photocurrent density (b), as a function of the perovskite thickness for each HTM. 
With the increase of the perovskite thickness its absorption is saturated (see Fig. 3). It appears that with a further increase of the perovskite thickness the current tends to the asymptotic limit as well, which depends slightly on the choice of the HTM [see Fig. 8(b)]. In this limit the magnitude of the short circuit current Jsc is defined basically by optical properties and the degree of the purity of the perovskite sample itself. It appears that the recombination process in the perovskite determines this asymptotic limit. Note, however, that even at the perovskite thickness W = 500 nm the short circuit current Jsc is larger in the sample with the CuSCN (HTM3) layer than that in the sample with the CuPc (HTM4) layer and the perovskite thickness W = 1100 nm. Although the narrow band gap HTM layers absorb more photons in comparison with the wide band gap HTM layers, the device with the HTM2,4 layers produces a smaller value of the short circuit current Jsc.
In contrast, the increase of the thickness yields the decrease of the open circuit voltage Voc [see Fig. 8(a)]. Other factor that affect the open circuit voltage are the barrier height ΔEv and the contact potential difference Vbi. Their mutual action suppresses the dark current, and, consequently, yields the increased value of the open circuit voltage Voc. It is noteworthy that the noticeable value of the barrier height ΔEv = 0.33 eV yields the large value Voc = 1.01 V even at the relatively small value of the contact potential difference Vbi = 0.875 V for the device with the P3HT layer [see Table 2 and Fig. 8(a)]. On the other hand, the large value of the contact potential difference Vbi in the device with the CuSCN layer yields a large value of the Voc at a small value of the barrier height ΔEv.

It appears, however, that the large value of the barrier height ΔEv leads to the fast decrease of the fill factor with the increase of the perovskite thickness [see Fig. 9(b)]. We recall that the strong absorption takes place in the narrow band gap HTM layers at λ > λtr (see Section 3.2). Therefore, the PSC with the CuPc layer, having the largest absorption at this wavelength domain, has the smallest short circuit current Jsc [see Fig. 8(b)] at the same perovskite thickness (W ≤ 700 nm); and the smallest Voc among the considered HTM layers [see Fig. 8(a)]. As a result, the device with this HTM layer reaches a reasonable PCE [see Table 2 and Fig. 9(a)] at the largest perovskite thickness among the considered cases. In this case almost all photons are absorbed in the perovskite.

4 Summary
In this paper we consider the optical as well as the electronic properties of the HTM layer in its impact on the PCE of a real device. To this aim we investigate the effect of the organic and the inorganic HTM layers: Spiro-OMeTAD (HTM1), P3HT (HTM2), CuSCN (HTM3), and CuPc (HTM4) on the efficiency of a typical perovskite thin-film solar cell (see Fig. 1 and Table 2). In order to describe the optical performance of this cell we carry out the analysis, using both the ray tracing simulations and the transfer-matrix method. To perform the ray tracing simulations, the OTSun python package was used. To calculate the J–V characteristics of the solar cell we employed the model for the carrier transport.34 Our approach is validated by comparing the simulation results with experimental data reported by Ball et al.81 Additionally, to improve the efficiency of the PSC, we proposed to include the effect of the Lambertian scattering on the back reflector.
By means of our approach, we identify the basic mechanisms that affect the interplay between the PCE and thickness of PSCs. By optical means it is found that the absorption in the wide band gap HTM layers is negligible. However, we demonstrate that the use of the Lambertian scattering in the BSR allows us to return transmitted photons to the perovskite. It results in the photocurrent increase, and, consequently, leads to the increase of the PCE in contrast to the specular reflection case.33 Our analysis sheds light on the fact that at a small perovskite thickness the largest PCE is obtained for the device with the wide band HTM layers [see Fig. 9(a)]. Considering as an example of the wide-band gap semiconductor Spiro-OMeTAD (CuSCN), we found that the maximum efficiency 18.1%(18.8%) can be reached even at the moderate absorber purity (D = 1 μm) for the perovskite thickness W = 300(275) nm. These results imply that the wide band HTMs are promising materials in the design of the solar cell architecture. We conclude that the negligible difference between the transport and optical band gaps in the inorganic HTM3 (CuSCN) layer provides the principal indication on its favorable choice at the design of the PSC. However, further research is required to make a preferable choice of a HTM layer, which would depend on the specific requirements to a photovoltaic device. For example, the infusion of an organic HTM is essential to complete the meso-structured PSCs. In this way it may be possible to increase the photocurrent in the perovskite absorber.89
