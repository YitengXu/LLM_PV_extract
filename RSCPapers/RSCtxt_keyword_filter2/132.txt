    , Accepted 16th December 2013First published on 16th December 2013AbstractThe current challenges for efficient bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs) based on organic/polymeric (non-fullerene) acceptors involve difficult control of neat phase separation in the nanoscale, severe geminate charge recombination, etc. Herein, a new molecular design concept, that is to construct donor–spacer–acceptor (D–S–A) co-oligomers with self-assembly properties, is proposed in order to realize ideal film morphology and manipulate the exciton dissociation and geminate charge recombination processes simultaneously. Three D–S–A co-oligomers, i.e.F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6 with oligo(fluorene-alt-bithiophene), perylene diimide (PDI) and alkyl as D-, A- and S-segments, respectively, were synthesized. All three D–S–A co-oligomers can form D–A alternating lamellar nanostructures with periods of ∼15 nm, an ideal nanostructure for BHJ OPVs. Compared to D–A co-oligomer F5T8-epP in which the D- and A-segments are directly connected without the alkyl spacer, the D–S–A co-oligomers not only show higher electron mobilities due to closer packing of PDI moieties, but also exhibit longer lifetimes of the charge-transfer states that can potentially restrain the geminate charge recombination and improve the charge generation efficiency. Accordingly, the single-molecule photovoltaic cells based on the D–S–A co-oligomers exhibit an improved fill factor of 0.47 and a high open-circuit voltage of 1.04 V. In particular, an external quantum efficiency of ∼65%, which is the highest for BHJ OPVs based on non-fullerene acceptor materials, has been demonstrated. By further extending the absorption onset of D–S–A co-oligomers to ∼600 nm, a single-molecule photovoltaic device with a power conversion efficiency of 2.70% has been fabricated. These results prove that high-efficiency BHJ OPVs based on non-fullerene acceptors are achievable if both the film morphology of the D–A blend and D–A interfaces are suitably manipulated.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are attracting more and more attention due to their advantages such as low-cost, light-weight and flexibility.1–3 In BHJ OPVs the BHJ layer is composed of a blend of a p-type conjugated polymer or small molecule as the electron donor (D) and an n-type material as the electron acceptor (A). In principle, D- and A-components should phase-separate to form bicontinuous phases with nanometer-scale interspacing for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport/collection.2
Fullerene derivatives, the most common phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), are usually employed as electron acceptor materials.4–6 They have many advantages for applications in OPVs, including large electron affinity, high electron mobility and the ability to transfer electrons in three dimensions.7,8 Currently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.2% has been achieved for the single-junction OPVs with PC71BM as an electron acceptor.9 However, fullerene derivatives have a few drawbacks, such as weak absorption in the visible region,4,5 high-cost for synthesis and purification,10 and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels which are difficult to tune.11 In contrast, organic/polymeric electron acceptors in general exhibit strong absorption and their energy levels can be tuned appropriately according to the requirements.10,12 However, to date only a few non-fullerene electron acceptors, including both small molecules13–19 and polymers,20,21 can deliver OPVs with PCEs exceeding 2%, which is far below that of the state-of-the-art OPVs based on fullerene derivatives. Several reasons may be responsible for the modest device performance of OPVs based on organic/polymeric acceptors: (1) the nanoscale phase separation of the BHJ layer is difficult to manipulate to form inter-connected domains comprising a neat donor or acceptor, which is harmful to the exciton dissociation and charge collection,22 (2) the electron mobilities are generally low for fast exciton diffusion and charge transfer,23 and (3) the severe geminate recombination of the charge transfer (CT) state at the donor–acceptor (D–A) interfaces leads to low charge-generation efficiency.24–28 Therefore, OPVs based on organic/polymeric acceptors usually exhibit low fill factor (FF) and external quantum efficiency (EQE). Obviously, to solve these problems, a new molecular design concept has to be developed to simultaneously attain well-controlled film morphology, fast exciton dissociation, slow geminate charge recombination as well as high charge mobility.
In the past few years, several approaches for controlling the morphology of the BHJ layer, such as the miniemulsion process,29 nanoimprint lithography,30 the self-assembly of D–A block copolymers,31–33 and the self-assembly of D–A co-oligomers,34,35 have been developed. Of those, the most successful approach is the self-assembly of D–A co-oligomers reported by us.34,35 We found that D–A co-oligomers formed by covalently connecting oligo(fluorene-alt-bithiophene)s (D-segment) and perylenediimides (PDIs, A-segment) via one of the N atoms in the PDI unit exhibited smectic mesomorphism and could self-assemble into highly ordered D–A alternating lamellar nanostructures with the periods relative to the molecular lengths. Single-molecule OPVs based on the nanostructured films exhibited the EQE of 50–58% at 400–500 nm. In consequence, PCEs up to 1.75% were demonstrated although the D–A co-oligomers could merely absorb the light with wavelengths shorter than 550 nm. Like other OPVs based on non-fullerene acceptors, the FF of the devices was lower than 40% due to the unbalanced hole and electron mobilities (electron mobility was an order of magnitude lower than hole mobility) and short CT state lifetime,35,36 which resulted in significant field-dependent free charge generation and collection.37 In the current paper, to explore the strategy to improve the charge carrier mobility and manipulate the exciton dissociation as well as geminate charge recombination processes upon photo-excitation while taking advantage of monodisperse conjugated co-oligomers on the formation of ordered D–A alternating lamellar nanostructures, we propose a novel molecular design concept, that is to connect D- and A-segments through an alkyl spacer (S) to form D–S–A co-oligomers (Chart 1). The flexibility of the alkyl spacer is expected to give both the segments a higher self-assembly capability (especially for PDI units) for improving the charge transport properties. Meanwhile, using alkyl spacers with different lengths may be able to tune the distance between D- and A-segments, thereby exciton dissociation and geminate charge recombination processes.38,39 Under this design concept, three D–S–A co-oligomers (Chart 1), i.e.F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6, in which ethyl, butyl and hexyl were used as the flexible spacers, respectively, were synthesized, and their self-assembly, photophysics and photovoltaic properties were studied in detail. Finally, by introducing a 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) unit into the D-segment of F5T8P-C4 for extending the absorption range of the co-oligomers, single-molecule OPVs with a PCE of 2.70% were successfully fabricated.

Results and discussion
Molecular structures of the D–S–A co-oligomers F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6 are depicted in Chart 1. D–A co-oligomer F5T8-epP was reported previously.35 D-segment F5T8 and A-segment epPDI are also displayed for comparison. In F5T8-epP, D-segment F5T8 is directly connected to the N-atom of the epPDI unit. F5T8 is more bulky than the PDI unit due to the presence of sp3-carbon in fluorene units. This inevitably limits the self-assembly of the PDI unit to form closely packed nanostructures,40 resulting in low electron mobility. The flexible alkyl spacer in D–S–A co-oligomers F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6 can render the D- and A-segments more freedom for their self-assembly. Meanwhile, it was reported that increasing the distance between the donor and acceptor could lead to a decrease in the Coulomb binding strength exerted on the interfacial hole–electron pairs,39 encouraging the geminate pairs to split into free charges.
The co-oligomers F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6 were synthesized according to Scheme 1, and the details are provided in the ESI.† All co-oligomers were further purified by preparative gel permeation chromatography (PGPC) after column chromatography purification on silica gel. The yields of F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6 were 67, 90 and 78%, respectively. The chemical structures were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, elemental analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6 are shown in Fig. 1a and b, and the related data are listed in Table 1. In solution, the co-oligomers exhibit featureless absorption spectra identical to F5T8-epP, indicating that the introduction of the alkyl spacer has no noticeable effect on their electronic structures in the ground state. Meanwhile, there is no electronic interaction between D and A segments in the ground state since the absorption spectra of the co-oligomers are almost the superimposition of those of the D-segment (F5T8) and A-segment (epPDI).41,42 From solution to film, the maximum absorption of the co-oligomers attributed to the D-segment blue-shifts from ∼445 nm to ∼420 nm. Meanwhile, the absorption maximum of the PDI unit at the long wavelength red-shifts from 525 to 545 nm along with a dramatic decrease of relative intensity. All these results indicate that the molecules adopt an H-aggregation in the solid state.43–46 It is noted that this absorption band is much weaker for F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6 than that for F5T8-epP. This indicates that the electronic coupling between H-aggregated PDI units in D–S–A co-oligomers is stronger, which is consistent with our expectation.

Cyclic voltammograms (CV) of F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6 were recorded for determining the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. As shown in Fig. 1c, three quasi-reversible redox waves in the positive potential region and two reversible redox waves in the negative potential region were observed. The oxidation and reduction onset potentials (EOX onset and ERE onset, respectively) versus ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) pair are outlined in Table 1. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6 are estimated to be −5.27/−3.86, −5.28/−3.89 and −5.29/−3.87 eV, respectively (Table 1). These values are close to those of F5T8-epP (−5.27 and −3.89 eV for the HOMO and LUMO, respectively).35
The phase transitions of D–S–A co-oligomers were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Fig. 1d) and polarizing optical microscopy (POM, Fig. S7†). As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1d, as the length of the alkyl spacer increases, the melting point decreases from 270.7 °C for F5T8P-C2 to 226.5 °C for F5T8P-C4 and then 203.0 °C for F5T8P-C6. The enthalpies are found to be 12.14 J g−1, 12.02 J g−1 and 8.72 J g−1 for F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6, respectively. These values are dramatically higher than that of the transition of F5T8-epP,35 implying stronger intermolecular interactions between the molecules of the D–S–A co-oligomers.
Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to investigate the ordered structures within the powders of the co-oligomers. As shown in Fig. 2a, all three co-oligomers show scattering peaks up to 4th or 5th order. The primary peaks are at 2θ = 0.57, 0.65 and 0.54° for F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6, respectively, indicating the formation of lamellar nanostructures with a period of 15.5 nm for F5T8P-C2, 13.6 nm for F5T8P-C4 and 16.3 nm for F5T8P-C6. These values are larger than the single molecular lengths, and smaller than the double molecular lengths (the molecular lengths of F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6 are 9.4, 9.6 and 9.8 nm, respectively, as calculated by the MM2 method). In wide-angle XRD patterns (Fig. 2b), two sets of diffraction peaks are observed for all three D–S–A co-oligomers and F5T8-epP. The peak with a d-spacing of ∼1.75 nm (2θ = ∼5°) is attributed to the distance between F5T8 segments separated by the side chains.46–48 The broad halos at 2θ = 15–23° are assigned to the diffractions from the alkyl side chains. Two additional sets of reflections at 2θ = ∼9 and 25° with d-spacings of ∼10 and 3.5 Å, which relate to the ordered packing of PDI units, are observed for F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6, but not for F5T8-epP. The latter one corresponds to the π–π stacking distance between PDI units. Clearly, the D–S–A co-oligomers can form lamellar nanostructures with higher order than F5T8-epP. We attribute this behavior to the stronger aggregation tendency of PDI units in the D–S–A co-oligomers owing to the introduction of a flexible alkyl spacer between D- and A-segments.

Schematic illustration of the lamellar nanostructure in the film (i). 
The nanostructures of the co-oligomers in thin films were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the images are shown in Fig. 2c–e. The films of F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6 were thermally annealed at 160 °C for 10 min prior to characterization. Dark-bright stripes are clearly present in the films with the periods of 14.2 ± 0.4, 15.0 ± 1.0 and 14.6 ± 0.7 nm for F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6, respectively. These values are identical to those observed in powder SAXS, indicating the formation of lamellar nanostructures in thin films. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6 are shown in Fig. 2f–h. F5T8P-C4 shows multi-diffraction rings, and two of them with the d-spacings of 3.5 and 4.4 Å are attributed to the π–π stacking distances of the adjacent PDI units and F5T8 segments, respectively. This indicates that D- and A-segments in F5T8P-C4 segregate each other and form nanostructured films comprising D- and A-domains in which the D- or A-segments are closely packed, which is beneficial to charge transport. Only the diffraction ring correlated with π–π stacking of PDI units is observed for F5T8P-C2, and for F5T8P-C6, a diffused diffraction ring ascribed to π–π stacking of F5T8 segments can be found. Clearly, the film orders of F5T8P-C2 and F5T8P-C6 are lower than that of F5T8P-C4. Combining all above observations, it is found that the co-oligomers can self-assemble in a head-to-head fashion to form D–A alternating lamellar nanostructures, as shown in Fig. 2i, and F5T8P-C4 can form nanostructures with the highest intermolecular packing order.
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the co-oligomers, OPV cells with a device structure of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulphonate) (PEDOT:PSS, 40 nm)/co-oligomer (70 nm)/epPDI (5 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) (Fig. 3a) were fabricated, in which N,N′-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxyl diimide (epPDI) was utilized as a hole-blocking layer.34 The films of the co-oligomers were prepared by spin-coating and then thermally annealed at 160 °C for 10 min to promote the formation of D–A alternating lamellar nanostructures. The photovoltaic properties of the devices are summarized in Table 2. Fig. 3b shows the illuminated current–density versus voltage (J–V) curves of the devices based on the D–S–A co-oligomers F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6. The PCEs of 1.86, 2.33 and 2.04% are achieved for F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6, respectively. These values are not only higher than that of the devices based on thermally annealed F5T8-epP films, but also higher than that of the devices based on solvent vapor annealed F5T8-epP films.35 The enhancement of the device performance is mainly attributed to the increased open circuit voltage (VOC) and FF. In particular, FF is increased by about 30–50%. Of the three D–S–A co-oligomers, F5T8P-C4 exhibits the highest PCE owing to the highest short-circuit current density (JSC) and FF, which is consistent with its highest intermolecular packing order in the film as evidenced by morphology characterization (Fig. 2c–h). Fig. 3c displays the EQE curves of the devices based on the D–S–A co-oligomers, which largely resemble the absorption spectra of the co-oligomers. The devices exhibit a high photon-to-current response from 400 to 500 nm. It is noted that the highest EQE of the device based on F5T8P-C4 reaches ∼65%. This is not only a record value for BHJ OPVs based on non-fullerene acceptor materials,16–21 but also comparable to that of the high-performance BHJ OPVs based on fullerene acceptors.49 D–S–A co-oligomers exhibit higher VOC than F5T8-epP (∼1 V vs. 0.88 V) although they have similar HOMO and LUMO energy levels.35 It has been disclosed recently that VOC was determined by the energy of the CT state, while the experimental VOC was usually 0.3–0.5 eV lower than this energy due to the recombination of charge carriers.50,51 The decrease of the recombination rate should be able to reduce the loss, resulting in a higher VOC.38 On the other hand, FF is determined by charge carriers reaching the electrodes when the built-in field is lowered toward the VOC. Accordingly, the charge mobility (μ) and lifetime (τ) of charge carriers are both critical for obtaining high FF.2 Therefore, to gain insights into the improved device performance using the D–S–A co-oligomers as BHJ layers, we studied the charge transport properties, exciton dissociation and geminate charge recombination processes upon photo-excitation of the D–S–A co-oligomers.

The hole and electron mobilities of F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4, F5T8P-C6 and F5T8-epP were measured by using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method.52 Device structures for hole-only and electron-only devices are ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/co-oligomer (70 nm)/MoO3 (6 nm)/Al (100 nm) and Al (100 nm)/co-oligomer (70 nm)/Al (100 nm), respectively. The typical J–V curves are displayed in Fig. 4 and the mobilities calculated from the SCLC region are summarized in Table 3. The hole mobilities (μh) of F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4, F5T8P-C6 and F5T8-epP are 2.2 × 10−6, 2.5 × 10−5, 9.6 × 10−6 and 1.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, while their electron mobilities (μe) are 1.5 × 10−5, 9.1 × 10−6, 4.6 × 10−6 and 2.5 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. All three D–S–A co-oligomers have higher electron mobilities than F5T8-epP, proving the effectiveness of our molecular design concept. Compared to F5T8P-C6, F5T8P-C2 has higher electron mobility but lower hole mobility. This is consistent with the fact that F5T8P-C2 exhibits a higher packing order of PDI units while F5T8P-C6 shows a higher packing order of F5T8 segments (Fig. 2f and h). The F5T8P-C4 film has relatively higher and more balanced hole and electron mobilities since both D- and A-segments are packed in an ordered fashion. This may lead to more efficient charge transport and collection, and thereby the highest EQE and JSC. Note that both F5T8P-C2 and F5T8-epP exhibit unbalanced hole and electron mobilities, but the device based on F5T8P-C2 has much higher FF.35 Moreover, the FF values of the devices based on three D–S–A co-oligomers only vary in a small range (0.43–0.47) even though their hole–electron mobilities are very different. Therefore, we cannot simply attribute the higher FF of the devices based on D–S–A co-oligomers to the improvement of charge transport properties.

Mobility measurements alone as shown above cannot explain the FF enhancement. Therefore, we further studied the formation and recombination processes of the CT states of the D–S–A co-oligomers in both film and solution by a femtosecond transient absorption technique. The D–A co-oligomer F5T8-epP was also studied for comparison. Fig. 5a shows the time-resolved transient absorption spectra of F5T8P-C4 in chloroform with a concentration of 10−5 mol L−1. The transient absorption spectra of F5T8-epP, F5T8P-C2 and F5T8P-C6 are displayed in the ESI (Fig. S9).† The bands from 400 to 600 nm in Fig. 5a represent the ground state bleaching (GSB) and stimulated emission (SE), and those from 600 to 850 nm are the excited state absorption (EA). A new peak at 710 nm, which is absent in the transient spectra of either F5T8 or epPDI solution (Fig. S8†), can be attributed to the EA of the newly formed CT state. The same spectral assignment can be found for the other co-oligomers. Fig. 5b shows the comparison of the CT state dynamics of the four co-oligomers in solution. As shown in Table 4, there is only one rising component for the CT state of F5T8-epP (4.2 ps), but there are two rising components for the CT state of D–S–A co-oligomers and the second rising lifetime is much longer (100, 696 and 1102 ps for F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6, respectively). This indicates the longer forming time of the CT state, and is consistent with the decreased charge transfer rate with increasing the distance between the D- and A-segments.53 The same trend can be found for the recombination of the CT states. About 90% CT states of F5T8-epP decay out within 200 ps, while only less than 30% CT states decay to the ground state within 1 ns for F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6. The relatively long CT state average lifetime and small likelihood of recombination are conducive to charge separation.27,38 The CT state recombination of F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6 with longer spacer is slower than that of F5T8P-C2, which has a shorter distance between the D- and A-segments. This suggests that increasing the distance between the D and A segments can slow down the recombination rate of the CT state.38,39 It is noted that the CT lifetime of F5T8P-C6 is shorter than that of F5T8P-C4, which may be attributed to the shorter D–A distance of F5T8P-C6 caused by the folding of the flexible hexyl to some degree.

Fig. 5c depicts the time-resolved transient absorption spectra of the F5T8P-C4 film. The transient absorption spectra of F5T8-epP, F5T8P-C2 and F5T8P-C6 films are displayed in Fig. S11.† The films were spin-coated onto quartz substrates from chlorobenzene solution and thermally annealed at 160 °C (10 min) for F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6 and at 150 °C (10 min) for F5T8-epP prior to the measurements. In Fig. 5c, the bands at 400–650 nm represent the GSB and SE, while those from 650 nm to 850 nm represent the EA. The peak at 770 nm shows a growing component with the decay of SE, which indicates that there must be some portion of newly formed CT states. However, this peak is a mixture of the exciton and CT states with the CT states taking the major part, and we cannot find the spectral range of the pure CT states. Fortunately, the exciton state takes the major part in the band around 850 nm. In consequence, relatively pure dynamics of the CT states can be obtained by subtracting the time resolved spectra at 850 nm from that at 770 nm, as shown in Fig. 5d. The primary comparison of the CT state dynamics of the four co-oligomers is shown in Fig. S11.† The detailed spectral calculation can be found in the ESI (Fig. S12†). Clearly, the decay process of the CT states is prolonged with an increase of the alkyl spacer. As shown in Table 4, the formation of the CT state for F5T8-epP is faster (1.3 ps) than that for F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6 (10 ps). The longer rising time of the CT states for the D–S–A co-oligomers may be ascribed to the increased distance between the D- and A-segments, which can result in weaker electronic coupling and then slow down of the charge transfer rate between them.53 The decay of the CT states of F5T8-epP is much faster (τavg = 1144 ps) than that of F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6 (τavg = 1915, 3358 and 2992 ps, respectively). The possible reason is that the electron–hole pairs (CT states) in F5T8-epP are still strongly Coulomb-bound to some degree.38,39 While for F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6, the Coulomb-bound strength of the electron–hole pairs becomes weaker due to the longer distance between the D- and A-segments. As the lifetime of CT states of the F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6 is greatly increased, the dissociation probability P(F) of CT states to generate free charges is increased based on the Onsager–Braun model P(F) = kd(F)/(kd(F) + kf), here, F is the electric field, kd the dissociation rate and kf = τ−1 the recombination rate of the geminate pair (CT states) to the ground state.
In combination with the study on charge mobility, the enhanced VOC and FF are mainly attributed to the prolonged CT state lifetime and decreased geminate recombination rate due to the increased distance between D- and A-segments. F5T8P-C4 combines three key features required for efficient optoelectronic conversion: highly ordered nanoscale D–A phase separation for exciton dissociation and charge transport, balanced hole and electron mobility for charge collection, and long lifetime CT states for low geminate recombination and efficient hole–electron pair separation, demonstrating superior photovoltaic performance to previously reported polymer blends and D–A copolymer systems, such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/poly{(9,9-dioctylfluorene)-2,7-diyl-alt-[4,7-bis(3-hexylthien-5-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole]-2,2′-diyl} (F8TBT),24 P3HT/poly{[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(di-carboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)} (P(NDI2OD-T2))25 and P3HT-block-poly (perylene bisimide acrylate) (P3HT-b-PPerAcr).28
Lowering the optical bandgap of the D–S–A co-oligomers would enhance the absorption of the incident solar light, resulting in a larger JSC and higher PCE, since the dominant absorption of F5T8P-C2, F5T8P-C4 and F5T8P-C6 only covers the range of 350–550 nm.54 Therefore, a new D–S–A co-oligomer F5T8BTP-C4, in which an electron-deficient BT unit was introduced into the F5T8 D-segment to lower its optical bandgap (Fig. 6a), was synthesized. The co-oligomer F5T8BTP-C4 can also self-assemble into highly ordered lamellar nanostructures with a period of 16.0 ± 0.7 nm upon thermal annealing at 170 °C for 10 min, as evidenced by the TEM image and SAED pattern (Fig. S13 and S14†). As shown in Fig. 6c, compared to F5T8P-C4, the absorption of F5T8BTP-C4 is broadened and becomes stronger in the range of 500–600 nm. Consequently, the photo-response of the single-molecule OPV device is noticeably enhanced in this wavelength region. Fig. 6b displays the illuminated J–V characteristics of the single-molecule device based on F5T8BTP-C4. The JSC is accordingly increased to 5.32 mA cm−2 along with a FF of 0.49 and a VOC of 1.04 V, leading to a higher PCE of 2.70%. This efficiency value is among the highest so far for OPV devices based on non-fullerene acceptors,16–21 although the absorption of F5T8BTP-C4 at wavelengths >500 nm is still much weaker than that of the donor materials commonly used. Most importantly, the PCE of the OPV device based on F5T8BTP-C4 is comparable to those of the OPV devices based on fullerene acceptors with a similar photo-response range. For instance, the typical OPV device with poly[(2-methoxy-5-(3′,7′-dimethyloctyloxy))-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MDMO-PPV) and PC61BM as the electron donor and acceptor, respectively, exhibited a photo-response range of 300–570 nm and a PCE of 2.5%.55 This indicates that OPV devices based on non-fullerene acceptors can be as efficient as the state-of-the-art OPV devices based on fullerene acceptors once the molecular structures are optimized for attaining a broad absorption range, well-defined film morphology and balanced hole and electron mobilities. For example, Hou et al. recently reported non-fullerene based OPVs with PCE up to 4% by using PBDTTT-C-T, a conjugated polymer with an absorption onset of ∼750 nm, and a PDI dimer as the electron donor and acceptor, respectively.19 However, the EQE of the devices was merely ∼40%, resulting in a relatively low JSC while considering the bandgap of the polymer. The current studies on D–S–A co-oligomers imply that the EQE of the OPV devices based on non-fullerene derivatives can be improved to the same level of those based on fullerene derivatives. Accordingly, one can expect that the PCE of the OPVs based on the system reported by Hou can be improved to 6–7% if the film morphology and D–A interfaces are well-controlled.

Conclusions
A series of D–S–A co-oligomers with an alkyl spacer between D- and A-segments have been synthesized. A flexible alkyl spacer not only endows the co-oligomers with better self-assembly properties for forming D–A alternating lamellar nanostructures with strong intermolecular interactions, but also allows manipulation of the exciton dissociation and charge recombination processes between D- and A-segments. The introduction of the alkyl spacer leads to an increased CT state lifetime. In consequence, the VOC, FF and EQE of the single-molecule OPVs based on the D–S–A co-oligomers were significantly improved, and PCEs up to 2.70% have been demonstrated although the co-oligomers exhibit the absorption onsets ≤600 nm. Particularly, the EQE of the devices has reached ∼65%, which is the highest for non-fullerene based OPV devices to date and is comparable to those of the high performance OPVs based on fullerene acceptors. Our results suggest that OPVs based on organic/polymeric acceptors can be as efficient as those based on fullerene acceptors once the optical bandgap, film morphology and charge carrier transport properties are carefully optimized.
