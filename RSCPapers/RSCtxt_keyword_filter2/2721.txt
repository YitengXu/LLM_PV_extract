    , Accepted 11th March 2013First published on 11th March 2013AbstractSolid state hybrid solar cells with hybrid organolead halide perovskites (CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3) as light harvesters and p-type polymer poly[N-9-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-3,6-bis(thiophen-5-yl)-2,5-dioctyl-2,5-di-hydropyrrolo[3,4-]pyrrole-1,4-dione] (PCBTDPP) as a hole transporting material were studied. The CH3NH3PbBr3-sensitized hybrid devices display an outstanding open circuit voltage (Voc) of ∼1.15 V, and the CH3NH3PbI3-based cells exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼5.55% along with high stability. The present results show that PCBTDPP is superior to the model p-type polymer P3HT as a HTM in these hybrid solar cells to achieve remarkably high Voc and high PCE. The possible mechanisms have been suggested.

Broader context
The ever increasing demand for clean energy has prompted researchers to intensively investigate environmentally friendly photovoltaic devices. Solid state sensitized solar cells are promising due to their potential for low cost and easy processing along with relatively high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Study on oxide electrodes has been extensively performed, while choices in light harvesters and hole transporting materials are quite limited at present. Design of novel light absorbers and hole transporting materials are key issues to achieve high performance for solid state sensitized solar cells comparable to their liquid electrolyte counterparts. Organolead halide perovskites provide this ability with sufficiently high light-harvesting capacity and simple solution processing, showing promising applicability to obtain solid state photovoltaic devices with high PCE and cost effective fabrication. In this work, we have introduced a new hole transporting material “PCBTDPP” in sensitized mesoscopic solar cells with the novel organolead halide perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3) as light harvesters. An outstanding open-circuit voltage of ∼1.15 V was achieved for the CH3NH3PbBr3 devices and 5.55% PCE for the CH3NH3PbI3 cells. Along with superior stability, these features shed light on the future design of more powerful light absorbers and hole transporting materials.

Great attention has recently been drawn to developing cost-effective, high efficiency solar cells to meet the ever increasing demand for clean energy. Dye/semiconductor sensitized solar cells,1–11 organic solar cells,12–15 and inorganic–organic hybrid solar cells16–21 show promise among the novel photovoltaic devices. However, liquid electrolyte-based sensitized solar cells suffer from solvent leakage, and organic solar cells have the problem of short life-time. Hybrid solar cells present a possibility to overcome these disadvantages by using solid-state p-type hole transporting materials (HTM) in lieu of the liquid electrolyte.22–28 Most recently, research in this field has achieved great progress: PCEs exceeding 5% have been obtained for solar cells consisting of Sb2S3 nanocrystals as the sensitizer, mesoscopic TiO2 as the n-type electron transporting material (ETM) and p-type polymers as the HTM.29,30
Hybrid organolead halide perovskites are a class of semiconductors with ABX3 (X = Cl−, Br−, and I−) structures consisting of lead cations in 6-fold coordination (B site), surrounded by an octahedron of halide anions (X site, face centered) together with the organic components in 12-fold cuboctahedral coordination (A site) (Fig. 1a). Their intrinsic properties can easily be tuned by tailoring the chemistry of the organic and inorganic components.31,32 These hybrid perovskites have a direct band gap, a large absorption coefficient as well as high carrier mobility. Especially notable is that they can be synthesized by simple solution approaches, a very attractive characteristic for fabricating cost-effective solar cells. Miyasaka et al.33 have pioneered their application in sensitized solar cells in a liquid electrolyte system, and a high efficiency of 6.5% was reported later. Unfortunately the performance of the solar cells degraded very rapidly due to the dissolution of perovskite sensitizers in the liquid electrolyte.34 A breakthrough was recently reported in solid-state hybrid solar cells by using organolead iodide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) nanoparticles as a light absorber and spiro-MeOTAD [2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene] as a HTM,35 which shows a very high PCE of 9.7% with superior stability over 500 h. A high performance hybrid solar cell with CH3NH3PbI2Cl as the light harvester, spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM, and TiO2 as the ETM was fabricated very recently, exhibiting a PCE of 7.6%. When the n-type semiconductor TiO2 was replaced by an insulating Al2O3 mesoporous scaffold, the device displayed a very impressive PCE of 10.9%, where a CH3NH3PbI2Cl thin absorber layer functions as both a light absorber and an ETM.36 Moreover, Etgar et al. have recently described the photovoltaic device comprised of a meososcopic CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction with CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticles as both a light harvester and a HTM, which shows a high efficiency of 5.5% under 1 Sun illumination.37 These studies are suggestive of the great potential for developing low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells using organolead halide perovskite as light absorbers. Nevertheless, the research in this subject is still very rare at present, it is hence urgent to further explore the potential of organolead halide perovskites in photovoltaic devices.

To date, only a few materials have been demonstrated to be effective HTMs for hybrid solar cells with good performance, among which P3HT is the model material in polymers and spiro-OMeTAD is the model material in small molecules. To obtain high photovoltaic performance, it is of critical importance that the HTM should show a good hole mobility and compatible HOMO (the highest occupied molecule orbital) energy level to the semiconductor light absorbers. PCBTDPP (whose molecular structure is shown in Fig. 1b) exhibits good stability, high hole mobility and a HOMO energy level comparable to P3HT. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells consisting of PCBTDPP and PC70BM displayed fair performance with PCEs of 1.6–3.6%.38,39 These demonstrations are indicative of the application potential of PCBTDPP as a HTM for hybrid solar cells.
In the present work, we have introduced PCBTDPP as the HTM to study solid state hybrid solar cells consisting of CH3NH3PbBr3 nanoparticles as the light harvester and mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) as the ETM. The resulting devices showed a PCE up to 3.04% together with an outstanding open circuit voltage (Voc) of ∼1.15 V. We have further employed CH3NH3PbI3 that can absorb solar light in a significantly wider range than CH3NH3PbBr3 as the light harvester, and the as-made photovoltaic devices display a considerably larger short circuit current (Jsc ∼ 13.9 mA cm−2) and higher PCE (η ∼ 5.55%) under AM 1.5G sunlight illumination. This highlights the application promise of the hybrid organolead halide perovskites as light harvesters and PCBTDPP as a HTM in hybrid photovoltaic devices.
The hybrid solar cells were made in a configuration of mesoporous (mp) TiO2/CH3NH3PbBr3/PCBTDPP/Au. Both the sensitizer (CH3NH3PbBr3) and the HTM (PCBTDPP) were deposited onto the mp-TiO2 by spin coating. Fig. 2a shows the characteristics of the current–voltage (J–V) for the devices fabricated with different CH3NH3PbBr3 precursor concentrations of 0.1 M. 0.2 M. 0.3 M, 0.4 M and 0.5 M in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), which are correspondingly designated as devices 1–5. Table 1 displays the photovoltaic parameters for these devices. All devices, except device 1, exhibit remarkably high Voc > 1.0 V, and devices 3–5 show an Voc of ∼1.15 V, which is even superior to that of the well-developed GaAs-based photovoltaic cells (with an Voc ∼ 1.12 V).40Fig. 2b and c show respectively, the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra and the UV-vis spectra for these devices. In general, the trend of the IPCE spectra (Fig. 2b) of the CH3NH3PbBr3-based hybrid solar cells is consistent with that of the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 2c): the IPCE is increasingly enlarged upon increasing the light absorption intensity, and the shapes of the IPCE spectra match perfectly with that of the UV-vis absorption spectra, displaying onset at ∼550 nm, a sharp rise at ∼540 nm, and saturation at ≤∼520 nm, characteristic of a band-gap absorption of CH3NH3PbBr3 (Fig. 2c). Moreover, despite the fact that PCBTDPP shows significant absorption in visible range (λ < 750 nm), it does not contribute to the photocurrent, as shown in the ESI (Fig. S5†). Therefore, CH3NH3PbBr3 should play a key role in light absorption, while PCBTDPP functions mainly as a HTM for these hybrid photovoltaic devices. It is observed that the density of CH3NH3PbBr3 nanoparticles deposited on the mp-TiO2 heavily affects the performance of the device: Jsc, fill factor (FF), and PCE of the hybrid solar cells are all enhanced steadily with increasing CH3NH3PbBr3 precursor concentration, highlighting the importance of the CH3NH3PbBr3 as the light harvester. Device 5 displays the highest Jsc of 4.46 mA cm−2, an Voc of 1.16 V, and a FF of 0.59, yielding an overall PCE of 3.04%. Considering the fact that CH3NH3PbBr3 with a band gap of ∼2.0 eV can only absorb light with a wavelength ≤540 nm, this efficiency is significant.

It is of great interest to gain insight into the outstanding Voc for the CH3NH3PbBr3-sensitized solar cells with PCBTDPP as the HTM in the present work. It is known that the Voc of a hybrid solar cell is closely correlated to the difference between the electron quasi-Fermi level of the n-type semiconductor (TiO2 in our case) under illumination and the hole quasi-Fermi level of the p-type HTM (usually HOMO of the polymer). PCBTDPP employed in the present study depicts HOMO at −5.4 eV, slightly deeper than that of P3HT at −5.2 eV. The offset of the HOMO of PCBTDPP and the valence band maximum (VBM) of CH3NH3PbBr3 (−5.38 eV) is neglegible, ensuring the largest difference between the electron- and hole-quasi-Fermi levels in the devices, which is favorable to and results in high output voltage. Moreover, the conduction band minimum (CBM) of CH3NH3PbBr3 at −3.36 eV is significantly higher than that of TiO2 (at −4.1 eV). This large offset (in energy levels of conduction bands) provides a strong motivation to inject the exited electrons from the conduction band of CH3NH3PbBr3 into that of TiO2. On the other hand, it can also form a high barrier to confine effectively the electrons into the TiO2. This suppresses effectively the electron's back transfer and the charge recombination,41 pushing the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 upward, thereby enlarging the difference from the HOMO of PCBTDPP. Because of the combining effects of the beneficial factors mentioned above, a very high Voc is obtained for the hybrid solar cells with CH3NH3PbBr3 as the light harvester and PCBTDPP as the HTM in the present experiments. Nevertheless, the likely interaction between TiO2/CH3NH3PbBr3/PCBTDPP can not be completely ruled out since the liquid electrolyte-based CH3NH3PbBr3 solar cells also show high Voc (0.96 v).33
To get more insight into the remarkably high Voc of the CH3NH3PbBr3-sensitized solar cells with PCBTDPP as the HTM, P3HT, the model p-type polymer in hybrid solar cells, was employed as the HTM to fabricate the photovoltaic device. Their J–V curves are compared and presented in Fig. 3a, and the photovoltaic parameters are also listed in Table 1. The P3HT device shows an Voc of only 0.50 V, much lower than the 1.16 V Voc of the PCBTDPP-based device. The HOMO level of PCBTDPP (at −5.4 eV) is only 0.2 eV deeper than that of P3HT (at −5.2 eV). Such a small difference in HOMO levels cannot fully account for the large difference (0.66 V) in the Voc for the two devices. There must be other factors that affect their Voc significantly. Several factors may contribute to the much better performance of the PCBTDPP-based device than the P3HT-device: (a) light filtering of polymers could cause detrimental effects on the photovoltaic performance.19,29,30 As shown in Fig. S5,† the absorption spectrum of the P3HT overlaps with that of CH3NH3PbBr3 in a large range, while this does not occur for the PCBTDPP device. Therefore, the light filtering effect of the polymer PCBTDPP should be much weaker than the P3HT, leading to the better photovoltaic performance of the PCBTDPP device. (b) Interfacial charge recombination is an important energy loss mechanism in solid state sensitized solar cells.42 The polymer PCBTDPP contains carbazole groups that do not exist in P3HT, which likely results in different interactions in the PCBTDPP/CH3NH3PbBr3/TiO2 system than in the P3HT system, leading to a favorable effect on the PCBTDPP device. (c) PCBTDPP displays a high hole mobility of 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1,38 which is ∼70 times the magnitude of that for P3HT (3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), meaning that PCBTDPP facilitates hole transportation much more efficiently than P3HT. It has been reported that high hole mobility is beneficial to photovoltaic performance.43,44 (d) As the result of the above effects, the charge recombination in the PCBTDPP-based devices could be suppressed much more effectively compared with the P3HT-based devices, resulting in a considerably lower back current density in the PCBTDPP cells, which was revealed by the dark current–voltage characteristics in Fig. 3b. A diode-like behavior can be clearly seen for both devices. The (reverse bias) saturation current density (Jo) of the PCBTDPP cell is significantly lower than that of the P3HT-based device, thereby leading to a larger open circuit voltage (Voc) of the PCBTDPP device, which is estimated according to the well-known relationship:45Voc = (nkT/q)ln(Jph/Jo + 1)where Jph is the photocurrent density, which is generally equal to the short-circuit current density (Jsc), Jo is the (reverse bias) saturation current density, q is the charge of an electron, n is the ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature.

To improve the energy conversion efficiency of the hybrid solar cells with PCBTDPP as the HTM, it is a judicious approach to broaden the range of light absorption of the semiconductor light harvesters. As a member of the hybrid organolead halide perovskites, CH3NH3PbI3 shows a band gap of ∼1.5 eV, which enables it to absorb solar light with wavelengths up to ∼800 nm, significantly broader than CH3NH3PbBr3 (≤550 nm). Therefore, CH3NH3PbI3 was employed as the light harvester in lieu of CH3NH3PbBr3 to assemble the photovoltaic device with the structure of TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBTDPP/Au by spin coating with 1.0 M CH3NH3PbI3 precursor in γ-butyrolactone solution to deposit CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticles onto mp-TiO2. Fig. 4a shows the current–voltage characteristics of the CH3NH3PbI3-sensitized hybrid solar cell with PCBTDPP as the HTM. As is the case in CH3NH3PbBr3-sensitized solar cells, the IPCE spectrum (Fig. 4b) and the UV-vis light absorption spectrum (Fig. 4c) show similar shapes with an onset at ∼800 nm along with a sharp rise at ∼780 nm due to the characteristic band-gap absorption of CH3NH3PbI3, which works as a light harvester in the present photovoltaic device. As the result of a broader wavelength range of absorption, a much higher Jsc and PCE were gained in the CH3NH3PbI3-sensitized devices than the CH3NH3PbBr3-based ones. Typically, the CH3NH3PbI3-sensitized photovoltaic device shows a Jsc of 13.86 mA cm−2, an Voc of 0.83 V, and a FF of 48%, thus yielding an overall energy conversion efficiency of 5.55%. In contrast, the photovoltaic device using P3HT as the HMT and CH3NH3PbI3 as the light absorber, made under otherwise identical conditions, shows a PCE of ∼3.0%, significantly lower than the PCBTDPP device. These results highlight the application potential of organolead halide perovskites as light harvesters and PCBTDPP as a HTM in hybrid solar cells.

Finally, the ex situ long-term stability in the dark of the CH3NH3PbI3-sensitized hybrid solar cells with PCBTDPP as the HTM was tested under conditions that the devices are usually stored in, i.e. in air at room temperature without encapsulation. The results are shown in Fig. 4d. In the first 100 h, Jsc increases steadily upon prolonging the storage time, accompanied by a gradually increasing and slightly enhanced Voc and FF, significantly improving the PCE by ∼11%. After storage for more than 200 h, the Voc, FF and PCE of the device continued to rise to a certain degree, and they remained quite stable even after being stored for more than 900 h, while Jsc suffered a slight decrease. Very interestingly, a peak value of the PCE was found to be 5.55% when the device was stored for 576 h. These impressive results are indicative of the superior stability of the CH3NH3PbI3-sensitized solar cells with PCBTDPP as the HTM, which is in a stark contrast to the liquid electrolyte-based device where the performance degraded very rapidly because of the fact that CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticles are unstable and could be rapidly dissolved in the iodide-containing liquid electrolyte .34 We have also fabricated the CH3NH3PbI3/Sprio-MeOTAD photovoltaic device with 6.48% efficiency according to reported process.35 The PCE was reduced to 3.34% in three days (Table S2†), which in turn demonstrates the superior stability of the CH3NH3PbI3/PCBTDPP device.
In summary, we have successfully fabricated solid-state hybrid solar cells with hybrid organolead halide perovskite nanoparticles as the light harvester, mesoporous TiO2 as the electron transporting material, and the p-type polymer PCBTDPP as the hole transporting material. The CH3NH3PbBr3-sensitized photovoltaic devices displayed a considerably higher Voc of ∼1.15 V, which was suggested to be due to several factors, such as the negligible difference between the valence band maximum of CH3NH3PbBr3 and the HOMO level of PCBTDPP, and to the large offset between the conduct band minimum of CH3NH3PbBr3 and the quasi-Fermi levels of TiO2, and to the possible interaction between TiO2/perovskite/PCBTDPP, as well as to the superior hole mobility of PCBTDPP. When using CH3NH3PbI3 as the light absorber, the photovoltaic devices can remarkably broaden the light response range, enhance the current density, and improve significantly the energy conversion efficiency to ∼5.55%. Superior stability was finally revealed. The present study demonstrates the critical roles of hole transporting materials and light harvesters in developing cost-effective, high efficiency solid state hybrid solar cells.
Methods
Materials synthesis
The precursors CH3NH3Br and CH3NH3I were synthesized from HBr (≥40% in water, Sinopharm) and HI (≥45% in water, Sinopharm) respectively, by reaction with methylamine solution (27–32% in ethanol, Sinopharm) according to the reported procedure.34 To prepare CH3NH3PbI3, equimolar CH3NH3I and PbI2 (98%, Sinopharm) were mixed in γ-butyrolactone (97%, Sinopharm) at 60 °C overnight whilst being stirred. For CH3NH3PbBr, equimolar CH3NH3Br and PbBr2 (98%, Alfa Aesar) were mixed in N,N-dimethylformamide (99.5%, Sinopharm) whilst being stirred at room temperature overnight.
Preparation of mesoporous TiO2 film
A dense TiO2 layer was deposited on a cleaned FTO glass substrate by dip-coating with a TiO2 organic solution. This was followed by a sintering process at 500 °C for 30 min, as described in detail in reference 46. A paste containing P25 TiO2 (Degussa) particles was then screen-printed onto the dense-TiO2 coated FTO substrate with a thickness of ∼800 nm, followed by heating at 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and finally at 500 °C for 15 min. The mesoporous TiO2 film was then dipped into a 20 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution for 15 min at 70 °C and washed with deionized water and alcohol, then sintered again at 500 °C for 30 min.
Device fabrication
CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Br, I) serving as a sensitizer was deposited onto mesoporous TiO2 by spin-coating at 2000 rpm for 40 s, then annealed at 100 °C for 15 min on a preheated hot plate. Before spin-coating, the mesoporous TiO2 film was preheated to 40 °C and 70 °C for CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3, respectively. 5 mg ml−1 PCBTDPP (Lumtec) or 15 mg ml−1 P3HT (Rieke Metals) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) were spin-coated onto mesoporous TiO2/CH3NH3PbX3 film at 3000 rpm for 40 s. The Au electrode was then deposited by a thermal evaporator to a thickness of ∼80 nm. The active area of the device was fixed at 0.1134 cm2.
Device characterization
The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source under illumination of a simulated sunlight (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2) provided by a solar simulator (Newport 69907) with an AM 1.5 filter. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was measured in DC mode with a 1/4 m double monochromator (Crowntech DK242), a multi-meter (Keithley 2000), and two light sources depending on the wavelength range required (300–600 nm: xenon lamp, 300 W; 600–900 nm: tungsten-halogen lamp, 150 W). The monochromatic light intensity for IPCE efficiency was calibrated with a reference silicon photodiode.

Broader context
The ever increasing demand for clean energy has prompted researchers to intensively investigate environmentally friendly photovoltaic devices. Solid state sensitized solar cells are promising due to their potential for low cost and easy processing along with relatively high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Study on oxide electrodes has been extensively performed, while choices in light harvesters and hole transporting materials are quite limited at present. Design of novel light absorbers and hole transporting materials are key issues to achieve high performance for solid state sensitized solar cells comparable to their liquid electrolyte counterparts. Organolead halide perovskites provide this ability with sufficiently high light-harvesting capacity and simple solution processing, showing promising applicability to obtain solid state photovoltaic devices with high PCE and cost effective fabrication. In this work, we have introduced a new hole transporting material “PCBTDPP” in sensitized mesoscopic solar cells with the novel organolead halide perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3) as light harvesters. An outstanding open-circuit voltage of ∼1.15 V was achieved for the CH3NH3PbBr3 devices and 5.55% PCE for the CH3NH3PbI3 cells. Along with superior stability, these features shed light on the future design of more powerful light absorbers and hole transporting materials.
