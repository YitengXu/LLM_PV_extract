    , Accepted 11th June 2018First published on 13th June 2018AbstractTwo star-shaped electron acceptors (E-SubPc-PDI and S-SubPc-PDI) based on subphthalocyanine (SubPc) as the core and three perylene diimides (PDIs) as wing groups linked with and without acetylene bridges, respectively, have been synthesized. Compared with conventional SubPc-based acceptors with optical absorption full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of less than 100 nm and optical bandgaps over 2 eV, both E-SubPc-PDI and S-SubPc-PDI possess broader absorption spectra with FWHM values of up to 170 nm and smaller optical bandgaps below 1.9 eV. Due to the different linkages between SubPc and PDIs, they exhibit different molecular geometries, optical properties, energy levels and stacking behaviors. With a more twisted molecular structure, the single bond linked S-SubPc-PDI exhibits reduced intermolecular aggregation and a higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level compared to the acetylene bridge-linked E-SubPc-PDI. When blending with a donor polymer PBDB-T, the active layer of PBDB-T:S-SubPc-PDI shows more favorable phase separation and more balanced carrier transport. As a result, solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) based on S-SubPc-PDI exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 4.53%, which is much higher than that of E-SubPc-PDI-based devices (1.78%).
Introduction
Non-fullerene organic solar cells (NFOSCs) have attracted much attention due to their unique advantages such as relatively low cost, low energy loss and good morphological stability.1–16 By now, the PCEs of NFOSCs have exceeded 13%.17–23 The development of NFOSCs benefits from the abundant design potential of the structures of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs). The most popular type of NFA is the linear Acceptor–Donor–Acceptor (A–D–A) acceptor composed by a fused planar ladder-type core and two electron-deficient end groups.1 In addition, NFAs with nonplanar star-shaped structures have also been studied widely because they can facilitate the quasi-isotropic charge transport and suppress the excessive intermolecular aggregation.24–31
Subphthalocyanine (SubPc) is a 14-π-electron conjugated aromatic macrocycle with a nonplanar cone-shaped conformation.32,33 Benefiting from excellent features such as intense Q band absorption and relatively high electron mobility, SubPc and its derivatives have been applied in organic solar cells (OSCs) as active layer materials for over ten years.32–41 When employed as acceptors in vacuum-deposited planar heterojunction (PHJ) OSCs, SubPc and its derivatives have achieved a noticeable PCE of up to 8.4%, revealing their potential as NFAs.36 However, there are only a few studies focusing on SubPc derivatives in solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs. Ebenhoch et al. employed fluorine or chlorine atoms as peripheral substituents to improve the solubility and LUMO level of SubPcs.42 As acceptor materials, these SubPcs can be applied to solution-processed BHJ OSCs with a PCE of up to 3.5%. Duan et al. achieved a PCE of 4% by using hexachlorosubphthalocyanine acceptors with modified axial groups, which is the highest PCE for solution-processed BHJ OSCs based on SubPc and its derivatives to date.43 However, the relatively narrow absorption windows of these SubPc-based acceptors largely restrict further improvement of their PCEs.
In order to broaden the absorption band of SubPcs, we have developed a new strategy to construct star-shaped electron acceptors with the SubPc core and PDI wing groups. There are two main advantages for this design: first, the introduction of PDIs will supplement the absorption spectrum of SubPc, leading to a broader absorption band; second, the cone-shaped SubPc core can reduce the strong aggregation of PDI wings, which will lead to favorable changes in the blend film morphology.44–46 With this strategy, two star-shaped acceptors have been synthesized: E-SubPc-PDI and S-SubPc-PDI (Scheme 1). SubPc and PDI were connected by an acetylene bridge, and by a single bond for the former and the latter, respectively. In particular, the changed linkages between E-SubPc-PDI and S-SubPc-PDI result in differences in the dihedral angles between SubPc and PDIs, π-conjugation and electron-withdrawing properties, which will induce different intermolecular aggregation behaviours, optical properties and energy levels. Compared with E-SubPc-PDI, S-SubPc-PDI exhibits a higher LUMO level and much weaker aggregation, which will contribute to a higher value of open circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) in OSCs, leading to a better PCE.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis route of the two acceptors is shown in Scheme 2. E-SubPc-PDI was obtained by the Sonogashira coupling reaction of SubPc-3I and PDI-E in moderate yield. For S-SubPc-PDI, we synthesized the precursor PDI-CN by the Suzuki coupling reaction in the first step. Then, cyclotrimerization of PDI-CN in BCl3p-xylene solution afforded S-SubPc-PDI. The chemical structures of the two acceptors were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Both of the acceptors are soluble in common solvents such as CHCl3, chlorobenzene (CB), and o-dichlorobenzene (DCB). Their solubility in CHCl3 was measured by using the literature method.45 The estimated solubilities are 30 mg mL−1 for S-SubPc-PDI and 12 mg mL−1 for E-SubPc-PDI, respectively, indicating the better solubility of S-SubPc-PDI compared to E-SubPc-PDI. The thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) curves indicate that both the acceptors are thermally stable with a decomposition temperature over 384 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†). From the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement, both the acceptors show no thermal transition in the range from 20 °C to 300 °C (Fig. S2, ESI†).

Theoretical calculations
The ground-state geometries of S-SubPc-PDI and E-SubPc-PDI were optimized by density functional theory (DFT) calculation at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level using Gaussian 09. The alkyl chains were replaced by H atoms to simplify the calculation, and the optimized geometries and frontier molecular orbitals are illustrated in Fig. 1. Compared with E-SubPc-PDI, S-SubPc-PDI exhibits a more twisted geometry, and its dihedral angle between the benzene ring of SubPc and PDI is 55°, which is much higher than that of E-SubPc-PDI (6°) (Fig. 1a). The distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals of S-SubPc-PDI and E-SubPc-PDI is similar (Fig. 1b). For both of them, the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) are mainly localized at the SubPc core and the LUMOs are mainly localized at the PDI wings, indicating that the different linkages have little effect on the frontier orbital distributions. Compared with the single-bond linkage, the acetylene bridge downshifts the LUMO levels possibly due to its electron-withdrawing properties and extended π-conjugation, indicating that changing the bond-linkage should be a feasible method for tuning the LUMO level of SubPc-based acceptors.47,48

Photophysical properties
The absorption spectra of the two acceptors are shown in Fig. 2. In CHCl3 solution, both acceptors have two obvious absorption bands: the first band from 450 nm to 570 nm mainly arises from the absorption band of PDI,46 with the absorption peaks at 529 nm for S-SubPc-PDI and 537 nm for E-SubPc-PDI, respectively; the second band from 570 nm to 650 nm originates from the red-shifted Q bands of SubPcs33 with the absorption peaks at 590 nm for S-SubPc-PDI and 615 nm for E-SubPc-PDI, respectively,46 which indicates the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the SubPc core and PDI wings. The more red-shifted absorption peak of E-SubPc-PDI relative to S-SubPc-PDI can be attributed to the higher degree of conjugation caused by the introduction of an acetylene bridge.47,48 In thin films, the absorption peaks of E-SubPc-PDI are at 545 nm and 628 nm, respectively, which are red-shifted by 8 nm and 13 nm relative to its solution absorption peaks, while the absorption peaks of S-SubPc-PDI have a smaller change compared with its solution absorption peaks (Table 1). This indicates that E-SubPc-PDI exhibits stronger intermolecular aggregation in its solid film form compared to S-SubPc-PDI. Moreover, the FWHM of S-SubPc-PDI and E-SubPc-PDI reached 139 nm and 170 nm, respectively, which is higher than those of SubPc-based acceptors reported previously (less than 100 nm).42,43 According to the absorption onset, the optical bandgap (Eoptg) was estimated to be 1.88 eV for S-SubPc-PDI and 1.82 eV for E-SubPc-PDI, respectively, both of which are also much smaller than those of conventional SubPc-based acceptors (around 2.1 eV).42,43 The broader absorption and lower optical bandgaps of SubPc-PDI and E-SubPc-PDI will favour efficient light-harvesting, and a high JSC in the OSC devices can be expected.

Electrochemical properties
In order to estimate the HOMO and LUMO levels of S-SubPc-PDI and E-SubPc-PDI, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was employed using an electrochemical workstation (Fig. S3, ESI†). The HOMO levels of S-SubPc-PDI and E-SubPc-PDI are estimated to be −5.71 eV and −5.69 eV, respectively. The LUMO levels of S-SubPc-PDI and E-SubPc-PDI are estimated to be −3.83 eV and −3.98 eV, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 3). Obviously, the LUMO energy level of S-SubPc-PDI is 0.15 eV higher than that of E-SubPc-PDI, which is consistent with the theoretical calculation results.47–52 As a result, a higher VOC value for S-SubPc-PDI based OSC devices was expected. Additionally, the energy levels of the donor polymer PBDB-T were also measured under the same conditions, and its corresponding HOMO/LUMO levels were −5.37 eV and −3.02 eV (Fig. 3), respectively, which match well with those of both S-SubPc-PDI and E-SubPc-PDI acceptors, making them suitable for fabrication of OSC devices.

Photovoltaic properties and characterization
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the two acceptors, solution-processed OSCs were fabricated with an inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:acceptor/MoO3/Al. The J–V curves and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 4. The photovoltaic parameters of these devices are summarized in Table 2. For optimized devices based on E-SubPc-PDI, a VOC of 0.74 V, a JSC of 5.18 mA cm−2, a FF of 46.45% and a PCE of 1.78% were obtained. In contrast, optimized devices based on S-SubPc-PDI show higher performance with a VOC of 0.89 V, a JSC of 9.18 mA cm−2, a FF of 55.41% and a PCE of 4.53%. Compared with E-SubPc-PDI, the noticeably promoted VOC of the S-SubPc-PDI based devices is attributed to its high-lying LUMO level; while considering the similar absorption spectra of their blend films, the higher JSC and FF values for S-SubPc-PDI based devices may be due to the more proper morphology of the active layer. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 4.53% is among the highest PCE values for SubPc based solution-processed BHJ OSCs. Both of the OSCs exhibit broad EQE spectra from 300 to 800 nm, which are contributed by both acceptor and donor absorptions. However, compared with S-SubPc-PDI, the EQE value of the E-SubPc-PDI based device is much lower in both acceptor and donor absorption regions, also suggesting the reduced charge carrier generation and a concomitant loss of photocurrent in the case of E-SubPc-PDI.

To investigate the charge transport properties of the two acceptors, single carrier devices based on optimized blend films were fabricated and characterized using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method.53 The electron mobilities were measured with the device structure of ITO/polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE)/blend film/Ca/Al, and the hole mobilities were measured with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend film/MoO3/Al. For the PBDB-T:S-SubPc-PDI blend film, a hole mobility of 9.16 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 5.28 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained. As for the PBDB-T:E-SubPc-PDI blend film, a hole mobility of 1.39 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 2.66 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained (Fig. S5, ESI†). The ratios of hole/electron mobilities (μh/μe) are 1.73 and 5.23 for the PBDB-T:S-SubPc-PDI and PBDB-T:E-SubPc-PDI blend films, respectively. More balanced carrier transport of the PBDB-T:S-SubPc-PDI blend film is responsible for the higher FF and JSC values in the OSC devices compared with the PBDB-T:E-SubPc-PDI blend film.
The morphology of the PBDB-T:S-SubPc-PDI and PBDB-T:E-SubPc-PDI blend films was further studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement. As shown in Fig. 5, possibly due to the remarkably twisted structure preventing the intermolecular aggregation interaction, the PBDB-T:S-SubPc-PDI blend film exhibits continuous nanoscale phase separation, which is beneficial for efficient exciton dissociation and balanced carrier transport, and contributes to the high JSC and FF values. In contrast, the PBDB-T:E-SubPc-PDI blend film shows relatively larger phase separation compared to the PBDB-T:S-SubPc-PDI blend film, which is also consistent with its lower device performance. From the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. S6, ESI†) of the neat films, S-SubPc-PDI shows a slightly longer lamellar distance (36.0 Å) compared to E-SubPc-PDI (33.9 Å). In both of their blend films, the lamellar stacking of E-SubPc-PDI and S-SubPc-PDI is still observed with similar peak positions and intensities to their neat films, which corresponds to their different phase separation scales in the blends.

In order to further understand the charge transfer behaviour in the two blend films, photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments were performed at an excitation wavelength of 550 nm, and the spectra are shown in Fig. 6. For the PBDB-T:S-SubPc-PDI blend film, the PL from the acceptor is well quenched by the polymer donor with a quenching efficiency of 91%. In contrast, the PBDB-T:E-SubPc-PDI blend film has a much lower PL quenching efficiency of 77%. These results reveal that more efficient exciton dissociation occurs in the S-SubPc-PDI based devices, which improves the JSC value more efficiently relative to the E-SubPc-PDI based devices.

For the purpose of further understanding the charge recombination mechanism of the OSCs based on the two acceptors, the dependence of JSC and VOC on the light intensity (Plight) was observed, respectively (Fig. 7). Theoretically, JSC follows a power-law dependence on the illumination intensity (JSC ∝ Pαlight), where the power law exponent α implies the extent of bimolecular recombination while the VOC dependence on the illumination intensity is fitted to a linear law (VOC ∝ lnPlight) with a slope of kT/q that represents the extent of monomolecular recombination.54,55 As shown in Fig. 7a, the exponent α value for the S-SubPc-PDI based device is 0.954, which is higher than the value of 0.911 for the E-SubPc-PDI based device. This reveals that less bimolecular recombination occurred in both S-SubPc-PDI based devices under the short circuit conditions. This is possibly due to the more proper phase separation scale of the PBDB-T:S-SubPc-PDI blend film. On the other hand, according to the plot of the VOC dependence on the illumination intensity in Fig. 7b, the slopes for the S-SubPc-PDI and E-SubPc-PDI based devices are 1.08kT/q and 1.90kT/q, respectively. The smaller slope for the S-SubPc-PDI based devices relative to the E-SubPc-PDI based devices indicates that monomolecular recombination in the S-SubPc-PDI based devices is also less than that in the E-SubPc-PDI based devices, which is consistent with the higher PL quenching efficiency for the PBDB-T:S-SubPc-PDI blend film. Less bimolecular and monomolecular recombination in the S-SubPc-PDI based devices provides more effective carrier extraction and charge transport, leading to the higher JSC values and better device performance in comparison with the E-SubPc-PDI based devices.

Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and synthesized two star-shaped SubPc core-based electron acceptors with three PDI wings linked with and without acetylene bridges, respectively. Both of the acceptors show broad absorption in the 450–700 nm region with a FWHM of up to 170 nm and an optical bandgap below 1.9 eV. Compared with the acetylene bridge-linked E-SubPc-PDI, the single bond linked S-SubPc-PDI shows a more twisted molecular geometry, which reduced the intermolecular aggregation interaction, leading to appropriate phase separation and more balanced carrier transport in its blend films. Meanwhile, S-SubPc-PDI has a higher LUMO energy level compared to E-SubPc-PDI. As a consequence, the PBDB-T:S-SubPc-PDI BHJ device shows better device performance with remarkably higher VOC, JSC and FF values compared to the PBDB-T:S-SubPc-PDI device. Finally, a promising PCE of 4.53% is achieved for the PBDB-T:S-SubPc-PDI BHJ device, which is more than two-fold higher than that for the PBDB-T:S-SubPc-PDI device (1.78%). To the best of our knowledge, this PCE of the S-SubPc-PDI based device is among the highest PCE values for SubPc based solution-processed BHJ OSCs.

Fabrication and measurement of OSC devices
OSC devices were fabricated with an architecture of ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:acceptor/MoO3/Al. Patterned ITO glass substrates were cleaned by sequential ultrasonication with isopropyl alcohol, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, followed by heating at 120 °C for 30 min and UV-ozone treatment for 30 min. A thin layer of ZnO was spin-coated on ITO at 3500 rpm and then heated for 1 h at 200 °C. The active layer was spin-coated from a solution of PBDB-T:S-SubPc-PDI or PBDB-T:E-SubPc-PDI in o-dichlorobenzene (20 mg mL−1 in total) at 1600 rpm, which resulted in an active layer thickness of 100 nm. Then, the active layer was heated at 160 °C for 10 minutes. Finally, the device was transferred to a vacuum chamber and MoO3 (20 nm)/Al (100 nm) was sequentially deposited by thermal evaporation at a pressure of about 2 × 10−4 Pa. The active area of each device was 8.0 mm2. The current density (J–V) curves of the OSC devices were recorded using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G simulated solar light illumination provided by a XES-40S2-CE Class Solar Simulator (Japan, SAN-EI Electric Co., Ltd). The EQE was measured using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd), which was calibrated with a crystal silicon photovoltaic cell before use.
