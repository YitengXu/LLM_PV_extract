    , Accepted 1st November 2021First published on 1st November 2021AbstractAt present, the polymer PM6 is the most widely used donor polymer, with many researchers focusing on improving the performance of PM6. The most commonly used strategy for modifying the polymer PM6 is to form a ternary random copolymer by incorporating a third component. However, most reported modified PM6 terpolymers have strictly equal D and A units. Herein, we developed four novel D–A–D–D1-type copolymer donors (PM6-T5, PM6-T10, PM6-T15 and PM6-T20 with a D1 unit with molar ratios of 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%, respectively) by introducing a third component (BDT-T: 2,6-dibromo-4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene) into the backbone of PM6 with unequal D and A units (D/A unit ratio > 1). Compared with the alternate D–A copolymer PM6, the four D–A–D–D1-type copolymers possess an up-shifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), a down-shifted highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), and a higher degree of self-assembly. As a result, owing to the suitable energy level, crystallinity, better absorption, higher hole mobility and prolonged exciton life, the PM6-T15:Y6-based OSCs achieved a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.61% with a remarkably enhanced short-circuit current density (JSC) of 27.02 mA cm−2 and a higher fill factor (FF), which performed better than the reference PM6:Y6-based organic solar cells OSCs (PCE:14.51%).
1. Introduction
As a novel type of green solar cell, organic solar cells (OSCs) based on a blend of an electron donor and electron acceptor have received significant attention owing to the advantageous characteristics such as flexibility, light weight, low cost, easy solution processing, and the ability to use roll to-roll printing for production over large areas.1–3 In the past few years, non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (SMAs) with a low band gap and high absorption have been developed to enhance power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 18% in OSCs.4–11 In particular, owing to the unique molecular design of A–DA′D–A, electron-deficient-core-based SMAs have been rapidly developed.12–21 For example, the most representative Y6 narrow band gap acceptor was developed by Zou and after being combined with a typical wide band gap donor PM6, the state-of-the-art power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeded 15%.22 The PCEs of the OSCs are determined by the short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF), which include charge generation, transmission, recombination and extraction.23–26 In general, the open circuit voltage is mainly governed by the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the donor material and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the acceptor material, and the JSC is determined by the light absorption ability of the active layer and the carrier mobility.27–29
Nowadays, polymer donors require a wide band gap absorption spectrum to better complement the absorption of the recently developed narrow band gap acceptor for increasing the JSC. Thus, selecting a suitable wide band gap donor to match the narrow band gap acceptor is also crucial for realizing high-efficiency OSCs.30–36 One of the most widely used donor polymers is PM6, which can complement the narrow band gap acceptor with a good absorption, suitable molecular energy level matching, a suitable molecular crystallinity and favourable fibril-assembly to achieve a high PCE.22,37,38 However, the JSC of PM6 still needs further research to improve the PCE of the OSCs, and the methods used to increase the JSC current are usually a ternary blend,39 solvent addition,40 and side chain engineering;41 these techniques can efficiently improve the JSC. At present, the most commonly used strategy for modifying the polymer PM6 is to achieve a ternary random copolymer by incorporating a third component (such as an electron-withdrawing unit or electron-donating unit) to form a D–A1–D–A242–45 or a D1–A–D2–A46 type terpolymer with strictly equal D and A units. In our previous work, we found that increasing the amount of the D (BDT-T) unit would weaken the push–pull interaction of the D–A unit and reduce the degree of crystalline behaviour, which is advantageous for the complementary absorption and miscibility of the crystalline acceptors. Herein, we report D–A-type random bi-polymers (PBDTa–TPDb)47 and D–D1–D–A type terpolymers (PBDT(T)FTAZ–Bn)48 with obviously enhanced JSC and PCE values by simply tuning the D–A molar ratio. Very recently, non-equivalent D–A copolymer donors (PM6–Dn) with an enhanced performance were reported by Li's group, indicating that increasing the D–A molar ratio is an effective strategy resulting in random copolymerization.49
Herein, BDT–T was selected as the third component (D1) to modify the structure of PM6. Novel polymers with a D–A molar ratio greater than 1 were designed and synthesized. These polymer donors are D–A–D–D1-type random copolymers (D represents the donor unit and A represents the acceptor unit; the structures of the polymers are shown in Fig. 1) derived from PM6. The D unit is the fluorinated bis-2-ethylhexyl thiophene substituted benzodithiophene (BDT-TF) donor unit and the A represents the typical 1,3-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyl) thiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-alkyl) benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′] dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) acceptor. Compared to PM6, in this study, some brominated BDD are substituted by some BDT–T to prepare PM6-Tx. To the best of our knowledge, modifying the polymer PM6 by incorporating a third component to form a non-equivalent D–A–D–D1-type polymer has not previously been reported.

The light absorption, energy levels, thermal properties and packing structure of these random polymers were characterized. The widely used small molecular Y6 was selected as an acceptor to fabricate the devices. Then, a promising polymer PM6-T15 containing 15% of the BDT-T unit was obtained, which exhibited a high PCE (16.61%), and a remarkable JSC was obtained for PM6-T15 that exceeded 27 mA cm−2 in the resulting OSCs. This is attributed to the suitable energy level, crystallinity, better absorption, higher hole mobility and prolonged exciton life of the PM6-T15/Y6 blends, thus achieving an elevated JSC and high PCE.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Materials design and properties
As shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI,† bis(trimethylstannyl)-substituted BDT-TF was used as the first donor unit (D), BDT-T was used as the second donor unit (D1), and BDD was used as the acceptor unit (A). By controlling the feed ratios of BDT-TF:BDD:BDT-T, the target polymer donors PM6-Tx (PM6, PM6-T5, PM6-T10, PM6-T15, PM6-T20) were synthesized using the Stille coupling reaction of the three monomers, in which x% represents the molar contents of the BDT-T unit. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) were measured using gel permeation chromatography obtained at a high temperature of 150 °C and found to be 20.5 kg mol−1 and 3.01 (for PM6), 14.7 kg mol−1 and 3.15 (for PM6-T5), 20.0 kg mol−1 and 3.41 (for PM6-T10), 14.7 kg mol−1 and 3.13 (for PM6-T15), and 14.0 kg mol−1 and 2.75 (for PM6-T20), respectively. These polymers possess a good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform and chlorobenzene.
In order to determine the actual BDT-T unit content incorporated into the PM6-Tx polymers, 1H NMR characterization and elemental analysis were performed. The detailed characterization results are provided in the ESI,† and the corresponding values were estimated and are shown in Table 1.

In the thermo-gravimetric analyses (Fig. S5, ESI†), the 5% weight loss decomposition temperatures (Td) of the polymers were 397, 413, 415, 423, and 419 °C for PM6, PM6-T5, PM6-T10, PM6-T15, and PM6-T20, respectively, indicating that these polymers display a good thermal stability. In comparison with PM6, the thermal stability was improved through the introduction of the BDT-T unit.
2.2 Electrochemical and optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the donor polymers and acceptor Y6 in the solid-state films and chloroform solutions are shown in Fig. 1b and Fig. S6 (ESI†). It was found that these polymer donors are well matched with the narrow band gap acceptor Y6. The corresponding data are listed in Table 1. All the spectra for the PM6-Tx polymers in the CF solution and film have two characteristic absorption bands. The absorption edge of the PM6, PM6-T5, PM6-T10, PM6-T15, and PM6-T20 films are located at around 726, 721, 719, 718 and 715 nm, respectively, and their corresponding optical band gaps are 1.71, 1.72, 1.72, 1.73 and 1.73 eV, respectively. The two characteristic absorption bands that are observed for all PM6-Tx polymer spectra in CF solutions and films at 350–450 nm from the π → π* transition of the conjugated backbone and 500–700 nm are attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the BDT-TF, BDT-T and BDD units. Comparing the spectra of PM6 and PM6-T15 in solution, PM6-T15 shows the 0–1 absorption peak at 607 nm (PM6, 613 nm) and the 0–0 absorption peak at 644 nm (PM6, 650 nm), in which the intensity of the 0–1 peak (I0–1) is more intense than that of the 0–0 peak (I0–0) in contrast to PM6. With the increase in the content of the BDT-T unit, it was observed that the absorption band is gradually blue-shifted to better complement the Y6 spectrum, and the 0–1 transition peak is gradually strengthened while the 0–0 transition peak is gradually weakened in the film and the chloroform solution, owing to the reduction of the stacking push–pull interaction and the destruction of the intermolecular aggregation via the random terpolymer approach.
The electronic energy levels of the PM6-Tx polymers and Y6 small molecules were measured using electrochemical cyclic voltammetry, and the corresponding curves are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Then, in order to investigate the influence of the BDT-T unit on the frontier molecular orbitals, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/def2svp level using the Gaussian 09 program suite. According to the empirical equation: EHOMO = −e(Eonsetox + 4.44)V, ELUMO = −e(Eonsetred + 4.44)V, the HOMO energy levels were estimated to be −5.56, −5.62, −5.64, −5.66, −5.68, and −5.67 eV for PM6, PM6-T5, PM6-T10, PM6-T15, PM6-T20, and Y6, respectively. Moreover, as shown in Table 1, the corresponding LUMO energy levels were estimated to be −3.48, −3.37, −3.33, −3.27, −3.19, and −4.08 eV, respectively, and the results were also in good agreement with the results of the DFT calculations. With the increase in the concentration of BDT-T units, the donor HOMO energy level will gradually downshift, maintaining a relatively higher VOC, but simultaneously the increase in the donor LUMO energy level will also increase the non-radiative VOC loss. Fortunately, under the balance of these two factors, all copolymers show a relatively lower energy loss (Eloss) for 0.39–0.42 eV (shown in Table S1, ESI†). Then, the LUMO energy level of the copolymer correspondingly upshifted compared to PM6, resulting in a greater driving force to dissociate more excitons; thus the PM6-T15 polymer achieves a high JSC, as evidenced by the following photoluminescence (PL) quenching measurement.
2.3 OSCs photovoltaic properties
The OSCs with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:Y6/PDINN/Ag were fabricated to explore the photovoltaic properties of introducing the third component into the polymer PM6. OSCs were optimized by tuning the donor/acceptor (D/A) ratio and changing the content of the solvent additive (1-chloronaphthalene, 1-CN) to obtain the best photovoltaic performance. Under the same conditions, active layers with a D/A ratio of w/w = 1:1 were prepared using a filter (PTFE, 0.45 μm, 13 mm) via spin-coating a mixed chloroform:1-chloronaphthalene (v/v = 100:0.7) solution with a total solid concentration of 13 mg mL−1 before thermal annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and related photovoltaic parameters of all OSCs are summarized in Fig. 2a and Table 2. With the increasing content of the BDT-T unit, the copolymers display a gradually increasing JSC from 23.20 to 27.02 mA cm−2, but for PM6-T20 (with the highest BDT-T unit content) the JSC only reaches 24.22 mA cm−2 because it has the lowest HOMO energy level. With the increase in the BDT-T unit content, the donor HOMO energy level will be gradually downshifted, which will produce a higher VOC, but simultaneously the increase in the donor LUMO energy level will also increase the non-radiative VOC loss. Fortunately, under the balance of these two factors, all copolymers show a high open circuit voltage (0.86–0.89 V). In short, PM6-T15 achieved the highest PCE (16.61%) owing to its high JSC (27.02 mA cm−2) compared to the other four polymer donors (reference PM6 (14.51%), PM6-T5 (14.17%), PM6-T10 (15.31%) and PM6-T20 (13.94%)), which indicates that introducing the third component (D1) into the PM6 polymer backbone is an effective design strategy for remarkably improving the JSC to achieve a high performance.

As shown in Fig. 2b, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured in order to understand the photon conversion process and confirm the JSC values in the OSCs. Remarkably, the PM6-T15:Y6-based devices show a maximum EQE value over 90% and it remains above 80% from 530 to 860 nm, which indicates that the PM6-T15:Y6-based devices possess a state-of-the-art photoelectric conversion capacity, thus achieving higher JSC values. In addition, the current density values integrated from the EQE curves under the AM 1.5G spectrum are shown in Table 2, and the PM6-T15-based OSCs yielded the highest integrated current density of 26.52 (mA cm−2), higher than those obtained for the other four PM6-based (24.41 mA cm−2), PM6-T5-based (22.85 mA cm−2), PM6-T10-based (24.98 mA cm−2), and PM6-T20-based (21.93 mA cm−2) OSCs, respectively. The result is well consistent with the JSC values from the J–V curves within the 9% mismatch.
The charge transport capabilities of the active layers directly affect the JSC and FF values of the related OSCs; thus the hole and electron mobilities were measured in the PM6-Tx/Y6 series with hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT: PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag) and electron-only devices (ITO/PFN/active layer/LiF/Al) using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method. As shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), the calculated electron mobilities were PM6-based (2.75 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), PM6-T5-based (1.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), PM6-T10-based (4.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), PM6-T15-based (5.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and PM6-T20-based (3.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), and the corresponding hole mobilities were PM6-based (2.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), PM6-T5-based (1.01 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), PM6-T10-based (3.71 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), and PM6-T20-based (2.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), especially for PM6-T15 with the highest μh value of 5.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. However, the HOMO energy level of the PM6-T20 donor is slightly lower than the Y6 acceptor, which hinders the transfer of holes from the acceptor to the donor, resulting in the low hole mobility of the PM6-T20-based OSC. The result indicates that increasing the proportion of BDT-T units (X ≥ 20%) will reduce the hole mobility and thus decrease the JSC and FF of the PM6-Tx series-based OSCs. Compared to the reference PM6-based devices with a μe/μh ratio of 1.35, PM6-T15-based devices exhibit a more balanced μe and μh value of 1.22, which can effectively enhance the JSC and FF, thus achieving a higher PCE for the OSCs.
To better understand the variation in the working mechanism caused by the introduction of the third component into the PM6 backbone in the PM6-Tx series devices, the steady-state PL and the time-resolved transient photoluminescence (TRTPL) measurements were measured. As shown in Fig. S10a–e (ESI†), we measured the PL spectra of the pure films and their blended films for detecting the charge generation and transfer at the bulk interfaces between the donors and acceptors of PM6-Tx. Compared to the PL spectra of the polymer donor pure films (excited by a 578 nm), all the blended films display high PL quenching efficiencies of 96–98%, while the PM6-T15:Y6 blended film shows the highest PL quenching efficiency. As a result, the PM6-T15-based devices possess more effective photo-induced charge generation and transfer behaviour at the donor and acceptor (D/A) interfaces, which include the hole transfer from Y6 to PM6-T15 and the electron transfer from PM6-T15 to Y6. Moreover, it can be seen from the TRTPL data shown in Fig. S10f (ESI†) that exciton lifetimes were 0.43, 0.64, 0.60, 0.71, and 0.62 ns for PM6, PM6-T5, PM6-T10, PM6-T15, and PM6-T20, respectively. The extended exciton lifetime of the donor favours a longer exciton length, which could facilitate more excitons to diffuse to the D/A interfaces, increasing the short-circuit current of the OSCs; thus the PM6-T15-based OSCs achieved the highest JSC value.
In order to further investigate the exciton dissociation and charge collection process of the devices based PM6-Tx series, the dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) was measured for five optimal OSCs, while the corresponding definition of the parameters and the calculation method are provided in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. S9 and Table S3 (ESI†), the Jph–Veff curves of the devices and the related data for the calculation and summarization include the saturation current (Jsat), exciton dissociation efficiency (Pdiss: Jsc/Jsat value under the short-circuit condition) and charge collection efficiency (Pcoll: Jmpp/Jsat value under the maximum power output condition).30 It can be seen in Table S3 (ESI†) that the Pdiss/Pcoll values are 97.6%/84.3%, 97.1%/83.6%, 98.0%/86.7%, 98.1%/89.3%, and 97.8%/84.1% for the PM6/Y6-based device, PM6-T5/Y6-based device, PM6-T10/Y6-based device, PM6-T15/Y6-based device, and PM6-T20/Y6-based device, respectively. The PM6-T15/Y6-based device displays the higher Pdiss value and the higher Pcoll, indicating that the PM6-T15/Y6-based OSCs demonstrate a more effective exciton generation and dissociation, as well as more efficient charge extraction, which can partly explain the improved JSC and FF values for the PM6-T15-based OSCs.
2.4. Morphology and crystalline properties
To further study the relationship between the packing structure and the photovoltaic performance of these D–A–D–D1 copolymers-based PSCs, we performed grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) experiments to detect the molecular packing of the five copolymers and their mixed films with Y6 acceptors. As shown in Fig. 3a, all polymers exhibit a well-defined molecular crystallinity, and the four D–A–D–D1-type polymers possess a more preferential face-on orientation, with π–π stacking diffraction peaks ((010) peak) in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction compared to PM6, indicating that the introduction of the third component into the polymer backbone can effectively reverse the molecular orientation. In summary, the face-on orientation of the polymers is more beneficial for charge transport. From the GIWAXS patterns of the blended films (Fig. 3b), the five blended films show a stronger IP (100) lamellar stacking peak at q = 0.30 Å−1 (d010 = 3.69 Å), indicating that the five blended films have a high crystallinity. Moreover, the blended films present a clear OOP (010) π−π stacking diffraction peak at q = 1.70 Å−1 (d010= 3.69 Å), q = 1.70 Å−1 (d010= 3.69 Å), q = 1.71 Å−1 (d010 = 3.63 Å), q = 1.71 Å−1 (d010 = 3.63 Å) and q = 1.71 Å−1 (d010 = 3.63 Å) for the PM6/Y6, PM6-T5/Y6, PM6-T10/Y6 PM6-T15/Y6 and PM6-T20/Y6 blended films, respectively. In particular, the PM6-T10/Y6 and PM6-T15/Y6 blended films display a more obvious OOP (010) π–π stacking diffraction peak, revealing the more face-on orientation in the PM6-T10/Y6 and PM6-T15/Y6 blended films, which is more favourable to the charge transfer. As a result, the PM6-T10/Y6 and PM6-T15/Y6 blended films possess a more face-on orientation, which is advantageous for improving the charge transportation and charge transfer, thus giving rise to an elevated JSC.

(a) GIWAXS images of the neat copolymer films and (b) the copolymer: Y6 films; (c) line cuts are in the plane direction and (d) the out of plane direction of the copolymer films; (e) line cuts in the plane direction and (f) the out of plane direction for the copolymer:Y6 blended films. 
To further understand the way in which the composition of the copolymer donor effects the photovoltaic performance, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was also used to study the nanoscale morphology of the five donor/Y6 blended films and the height and 3D images are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S13 (ESI†). In the AFM images (shown in Fig. 4), all active layers show a uniform texture with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.12–1.81 nm. Compared to the PM6:Y6 blend film, with the increasing content of the BDT-T unit, polymer donors gradually show greater aggregation in the surface image, which implies the increasing degree of molecular self-assembly for donors in the blended films. The PM6-T10:Y6 and PM6-T15:Y6 blended films display suitable aggregation sizes to form a well-defined phase separation structure, which can achieve efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer, thus achieving a high JSC within the range of the OSCs, while the PM6-T20:Y6 blended film displays too much aggregation resulting in a low miscibility that reduces the exciton dissociation.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we developed four D–A–D–D1-type copolymers (PM6-T5, PM6-T10, PM6-T15, and PM6-T20) using the terpolymer strategy, and tuned the molar ratios of the donor and acceptor units (D/A unit ratio > 1) by introducing a D1 unit as the third component into the alternate D–A copolymer PM6 backbone. Notably, we found that the four D–A–D–D1-type copolymers display an up-shifted LUMO, a down-shifted HOMO, a higher degree of self-assembly and a high crystallinity. As a result, owing to the suitable energy level, crystallinity, better absorption, higher hole mobility and prolonged exciton life, the PM6-T15-based OSC achieved a much higher PCE of 16.61% with a significantly improved JSC of 27.02 mA cm−2 compared to the PM6-based OSC (PCE = 14.51% and JSC = 24.74 mA cm−2). This work not only means that the ternary strategy of tuning the D/A ratio through the introduction of D1 units can effectively improve the JSC and FF, but also provides novel molecular design ideas for the fabrication of efficient D–A polymers for use in in OSCs.
