    , Accepted 13th October 2016First published on 13th October 2016AbstractFor the first time, we report the assembly of p-type dye-sensitized solar cells (pDSCs) based on an aqueous electrolyte containing a tris(1,2-diaminoethane)cobalt(II/III) ([Co(en)3]2+/3+) redox couple. With exception of devices made with pH 8.15 electrolytes (η = 1.13%) constant energy conversion efficiencies close to 1.5% were achieved with all other electrolytes under simulated one sun illumination (AM 1.5 G), with the best cell achieving an efficiency of 1.6%. Even higher efficiencies (≥1.9%) were achieved at a lower light intensity indicating that mass transport may be limiting performance at higher light intensities. The drop in VOC with increasing pH is compensated by improvements in the short circuit current and fill factor. Notably, the efficiencies reported here for electrolytes with pH > 9 are higher than those reported for the corresponding devices made with an organic electrolyte based on the same redox mediator.
Introduction
Low cost dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted much attention during the past several decades as a promising alternative to traditional solar cells.1–3 In an n-type solar cell, an electron is injected from the dye into the conduction band of a semiconductor (typically TiO2) and then moves into the underlying conductive oxide layer and an external circuit. An efficiency of 13% was reported for these devices.4 In contrast, for p-type DSCs, electron transfer occurs in the reverse direction, from the valence band of the semiconductor into the photoexcited dyes (Fig. 1).5 In 2000, Lindquist et al. proposed that the replacement of the platinised counter electrode in DSCs with a sensitized photocathode (in series) should greatly improve the device efficiency by collecting high energy photons at the top electrode and lower energy photons at the bottom electrode.6 In this way tandem DSCs can be developed which could provide a route to high efficiency solar energy conversion at low cost.7 Theoretically, a p–n tandem device can have an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 43%.8 Such devices can surpass the Shockley–Queisser limitation for conventional n-type DSCs because the energy loss due to thermalization of carriers can be minimized when a large band gap cell is stacked with a low band gap cell.9 Therefore, there is growing interest in the study of p-type DSCs with one ultimate goal being their assembly into tandem devices.7

Previous research on p-type DSCs based on the iodide/triiodide redox mediator resulted in a good efficiency of 0.61%.10 There are several disadvantages of using such redox couple. The high optical density of iodide/triiodide will cause the light to be filtered during illumination, thereby lowering the generation of photocurrent.11 Moreover, due to its close proximity of its redox potential (0.4 V vs. NHE) with that of the NiO valence band (0.7 V vs. NHE), a high open circuit voltage (VOC) cannot be expected from the devices.12 Later, Hagfeldt introduced a cobalt polypyridine complex as a redox couple which is non-corrosive and non-volatile.13,14 Despite the threefold increase of the open circuit voltage (350 mV), the lower solubility of the cobalt complex and slow diffusion coefficient inhibited the improvement of short circuit current. Our group applied the [Co(en)3]2+/3+ couple (en = 1.2-diaminoethane) in p-type DSCs, achieving an energy conversion efficiency of 1.3%. In acetonitrile, this couple has a more negative redox potential (0.03 V vs. NHE) than iodide/triiodide.15 Recently, the efficiency of these devices has been increased to 2.5% by applying electrolytes based on the [Fe(acac)3]0/1− couple (acac = acetylacetonato).16Table 1 summarizes the progress in the development of p-type DSCs. Readers who are interested in this area could refer to the related literature.

Despite the high efficiency, toxicity and volatility are the two problems encountered when acetonitrile is used as a solvent. Water, an earth-abundant and clean resource, would be an ideal solvent for replacing the organic solvent used to prepare the DSC electrolytes. We previously applied an aqueous electrolyte based on the [Co(bpy)]2+/3+) redox couple (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) in n-type DSCs and achieved a power conversion efficiency of 5.1%,25 which was subsequently improved to 5.7% by applying silane treatment after dyeing of the titania films.26 Since then there have been no publications reporting aqueous p-type DSCs, and we have initiated research aiming to apply water based electrolytes in the fabrication of p-type DSCs, which could eventually be incorporated into aqueous tandem dye sensitized solar cells.
In p-type devices, the VOC is determined by the potential difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the semiconductor and the Nernstian potential of the redox mediator. One way to improve the VOC is by fine tuning of the valence band of the semiconductor. For example, doping of Co2+ ions into a NiO lattice structure causes a shift of the valence band in a more positive direction, e.g., to 0.45 V (vs. NHE) at pH 7 for 10% Co doping, making a higher VOC possible.27 In an aqueous electrolyte, the incorporation of protons into the semiconductor can cause the valence band of NiO to shift with the electrolyte pH. Thus, the Fermi level of the semiconductor and device VOC may be adjusted. In this study, the [Co(en)3]2+/3+ redox couple was chosen to develop an aqueous electrolyte for use in p-type DSCs (Fig. 2) owing to the high solubility of the Co(II) and Co(III) complexes in aqueous potential and the possibility of achieving high VOC values because of the less positive redox potential, cf. for example iodide/triiodide, and excellent performance in p-type DSCs applying organic solvent electrolytes.15 The variation in the valence band of the semiconductor and the potential of the redox couple were measured as a function of the electrolyte pH and the impact of this variation on device performance was studied by constructing p-type DSCs with an excellent D–π-A sensitizer, PMI-6T-TPA (Fig. 2).8,15,16,24 These devices exhibited maximum power conversion efficiencies that were higher than those achieved with the corresponding acetonitrile based electrolyte.

Results and discussion
The electrolytes used in this study contained 0.6 M [Co(en)3](BF4)2, 0.07 M [Co(en)3](BF4)3, 0.9 M LiBF4 and 0.3 M N-methyl benzimidazole (NMBI) in deionized water (see Tables S1–S4† for electrolyte optimization), and the pH was adjusted to values in the pH 8–11 range with either boric acid or 1,2-diaminoethane. In total, four electrolytes, whose pH varied between 8 and 11 (chosen because NiO is stable to dissolution within this pH range), were applied in device construction. The top-view and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the NiO film on the FTO substrate are shown in Fig. S1.† The IV curves measured for these devices at four pH values are shown in Fig. 3a and the corresponding performance data are collected in Table 2. The VOC of these devices decreased with increasing electrolyte pH whereas, on the other hand, the short circuit current (JSC) showed a very small increase. The fill factor (FF) showed a sharp increase between pH 8.15 and 9.20 followed by minor changes at higher pH. This change in FF is coupled to a major change in the electrochemical behavior of the electrolyte (as discussed below). Overall, the average device performance for the aqueous p-type DSCs was constant between pH 9.20 and 10.91 with the best average device efficiency of 1.48 ± 0.10% and the best cell performance of 1.6%, achieved at pH = 10.05. This efficiency is higher than our reported value of 1.3% for p-type DSCs using the same redox mediator and an organic electrolyte.15 Notably, efficiencies of 2% or even higher (Table 2) were obtained for the four aqueous electrolytes at 0.1 sun, indicating that there is room for performance improvement at higher light intensities. One issue to be addressed is the decrease in fill factor with increasing light intensity, which in a detailed analysis by Daeneke et al.,28 has been attributed to the intrinsic low hole conductivity of NiO. Application of ITO as a semiconductor in p-type DSCs, as in our recent publication24 should resolve this issue, providing the faster recombination rates at the ITO–electrolyte interfaces can be ameliorated.

As may have been anticipated from the very minor changes in JSC with electrolyte pH, the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) performance of the device is independent of electrolyte pH (see Fig. 3b). Good light harvesting in the 400–550 nm wavelength region is indicated by a broad IPCE plateau at nearly 40%. The UV-vis spectra of the different electrolytes show that the electrolyte competes with the dye for the incident photons below 500 nm, especially when the electrolyte with the lowest pH (8.15) is used (see Fig. S2†). In keeping with this, the JSC value is the lowest for this electrolyte and increases slightly as the electrolyte pH increases. Our study was limited to the pH 8–11 range as the cobalt(II) complex dissociates below pH 8 and NiO becomes unstable whereas, above pH 11, leaching of the dye from the NiO is more facile.
In order to ascertain the origin of the decrease in VOC with increasing electrolyte pH, experiments were conducted to elucidate whether shifts in the valence band potential of NiO and/or redox potential of the redox couple occurred as the electrolyte pH changes. In the first series of experiments, the valence band potential of NiO in contact with different pH electrolytes was determined using the Mott–Schottky technique. A three-electrode setup was employed comprising a NiO film, a Pt wire and a Ag/AgCl as a working, counter and reference electrode, respectively. To construct the Mott–Schottky plots, measurements were made over a range of potentials (−0.5 V to 0.5 V) and at a frequency of 1 Hz. The resulting data were analyzed using eqn (1):29 (1)where CSC is the capacitance of the space charge region, ε is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor which is 11.9 for NiO at room temperature, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, N is the hole density, e is the elementary charge, EVB is the valence band potential of NiO and E is the applied potential. Therefore, the Mott–Schottky plot is depicted as 1/(CSC)2vs. E. The hole density can be calculated from the slope of this plot and the flat band potential of the p-type semiconductor can be determined by extrapolation to 1/(CSC)2 = 0. The negative slopes of the plots of 1/(CSC)2vs. E confirmed the p-type semiconductor nature of NiO (Fig. S4†). The fitted data are shown in Table S6.† As can be gleaned from Fig. 4, there is strong dependence of the valence band position on pH with a slope of around −0.06 V determined from the plot of EVBversus pH. According to Yeager,30 the formation of an electric double layer by the electrostatic interaction between the NiO surface protons and the charge carriers in the electrolyte is responsible for the dependence of the valence band potential on pH. For lower pH electrolytes, a greater electrostatic repulsion between p-carriers (or holes in the NiO) and the adsorbed protons means that a more anodic potential is required to attain the valence band condition. This pH dependence of the valence band potential follows a Nernstian behaviour, i.e., a shift of 59 mV per pH unit.31,32
 Fig. 4  pH dependence of the NiO valence band (black squares) measured using NiO films with a thickness of 2.4 μm and the redox potential of the redox couple (red squares). 
In the second series of experiments, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to measure the redox potential of the redox mediator as a function of pH. An aqueous electrolyte containing 6 mM [Co(en)3]2+, 0.7 mM [Co(en)3]3+ and 100 mM KCl was used for this purpose and the CV was recorded at a constant scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The CV data obtained from these experiments are summarized in Table S7.† As can be seen from Fig. 4, there is a negative shift of the redox potential when pH of the electrolyte is increased. A small decrease in the redox potential of ≤20 mV per unit increase in pH was observed, which could be reflecting minor changes in the speciation, particularly for the labile cobalt(II) ions. The CV profile (Fig. S5†) is similar for the electrolytes with pH in the pH range 9–11 in that similar currents are generated in either the oxidative or reductive wave, and the peak separations (ΔE) of 80–100 mV indicate a degree of reversibility. On the other hand, the CV measured at pH 8 shows broad oxidative and reductive peaks with very low currents and a larger peak separation (ΔE = 117 mV). One explanation for this behaviour is that at the lower pH, protonation of the 1,2-diaminoethane ligands is favoured (the pKas for 1,2-diaminoethane are 7.52 and 9.98)33 and competes with the process of coordination to the Co(II) centres (this is not possible for the kinetically inert Co(III), where ligand exchange on the electrochemical timescale must involve reduction to Co(II), ligand exchange and re-oxidation). A dynamic equilibrium appears to be established which affects the electrochemical behavior, and could be at the origin of the low FF and unusual IV curve observed for cells constructed with the pH 8 electrolyte. Therefore, for optimum device operation the pH of the aqueous [Co(en)3]2+/3+ electrolyte should be ≥9. Under this condition the device efficiencies were found to be constant (see Table 2) although there was a systematic decrease in VOC with increasing pH, as expected from the observed systematic variations in the valence band potentials of NiO and potential of the redox couple with pH. Compensatory changes in JSC and FF maintained a constant efficiency, which was close to 1.5% on average.
In order to probe the stability of the devices, one of the best performing DSCs made with the pH 10 electrolyte was stored in the dark and periodically measured under AM 1.5 G simulated light (Fig. 5). There is a gradual increase of the VOC, which could be due to the adsorption of the Li+ ion onto the surface of the semiconductors.34,35 However, a decrease of JSC is also observed. It is possible that, over time, any free 1,2-diaminoethane can potentially dissolve some NiO forming very stable Ni-en complexes (formation constant for [Ni(en)3]2+ is ≥1018).36 No dye desorption was observed, indicating a fairly stable dye attachment onto the NiO film. Overall, the cell maintained over 90% of its initial efficiency in the first 10 days and then decayed more obviously after 20 days. This stability is not as good as the p-DSCs made with the analogous organic electrolyte which have been reported to be stable for over 25 days in the dark.15
 Fig. 5  Stability of the p-type DSCs in the dark. The device was constructed with pH = 10 electrolyte containing 0.6 M [Co(en)3](BF4)2, 0.07 M [Co(en)3](BF4)3, 0.9 M LiBF4 and 0.3 M NMBI in deionized water, and 1,2-diaminoethane was used to adjust electrolyte pH. 
Conclusions
An aqueous p-type dye-sensitized solar cell based on the [Co(en)3]2+/3+ redox mediator has been developed which achieves an average efficiency of ∼1.5% at 1 sun illumination for electrolytes with pH > 9. The efficiencies are higher than those reported for the corresponding organic solvent p-type DSCs with the same redox couple. There was a systematic decrease in VOC observed with increasing pH which mirrored the changes in the valence band potential of NiO. This decrease in VOC was compensated by slight improvements in the JSC and FF. Thus, for optimum p-type DSC operation, the pH of the aqueous [Co(en)3]2+/3+-based electrolyte should be ≥9. In general, the electrolyte pH is a critical parameter to optimize in order to maximize the performance of aqueous n-type DSCs and tandem devices.
Experimental
Material preparation
All the reagents and chemicals, unless otherwise specified were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. [Co(en)3](BF4)315 and PMI-6T-TPA8 were synthesized according to the reported procedure.
Electrolyte preparation
To prepare the series of electrolytes with different pHs, either boric acid (0.05 M) or 1,2-diaminoethane was used to adjust the pH (8–11) and the values were recorded using a pH meter (phosphate and borate buffer solutions with pH 7 and 10, respectively, were used for calibration). For electrolyte preparation, 0.60 M Co(BF4)2 and 0.07 M [Co(en)3](BF4)3 were added to freshly prepared aqueous electrolyte at different pHs. Afterwards, three equivalents (or 1.8 M) of 1,2-diaminoethane (relative to [Co(BF4)2]) were added to the solution to complete the in situ exothermic formation of [Co(en)3](BF4)2. After cooling to room temperature, 0.9 M LiBF4 and 0.3 M NMBI were added as additives and the solution was mixed until homogeneous. The containers of the electrolytes were filled with inert nitrogen for storage as [Co(en)3](BF4)2 is sensitive to oxygen.
Device fabrication
The glass substrate used was 4 mm thick 10 Ω □−1 conductive FTO (fluorine doped tin oxide) glass from Dyesol. Mesoporous 4 × 4 mm NiO films were printed using a commercial semi-automatic screen printer. NiO nanoparticle powder was used as received from Inframat (73.22 wt% Ni) with a nominal particle size of 20 nm. The pastes were prepared by mixing 8 wt% NiO, 46% ethyl cellulose solution (5 wt% in ethanol) and 46% terpineol. The printed films were subjected to a 500 °C sintering process. Prior to device assembly, the films were sintered again (500 °C), cooled to approximately 70 °C and immersed in a solution containing PMI-6T-TPA (0.2 mM) in dimethylformamide (DMF) for 4 hours. The dyed films were rinsed with DMF to remove non-attached dye from the films. Platinum counter electrodes were prepared from 3 mm thick 15 Ω □−1 conductive FTO glass from Dyesol. A solution of chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (10 mM) in ethanol was doctor bladed onto the pre-drilled substrate and pyrolyzed for 15 min at 400 °C. The dried working electrode and counter electrode were assembled using a 25 μm thick Surlyn gasket (Solaronix) of the dimensions 5 × 6 mm. The cells were then vacuum backfilled through a predrilled hole in the counter electrode with inert nitrogen protection. The holes were sealed at 120 °C with Surlyn and a glass cover slip.
Photovoltaic performance (IV)
A solar simulator (Oriel) fitted with a filtered 1000 W xenon lamp was used to provide simulated solar irradiation (AM 1.5, 1000 W m−2). Current–voltage curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The output of the light source was adjusted using a calibrated silicon photodiode (Peccell Technologies). The light intensity was adjusted by using a filter wheel equipped with a series of mesh filters.
Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE)
IPCE was measured using a 150 W xenon lamp (Oriel) fitted with a Cornerstone 260 monochromatic light source. IPCE photocurrents were recorded under short circuit conditions using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The monochromatic photon flux was quantified by means of a calibrated silicon photodiode (Peccell Technologies).
Mott–Schottky characterization
Mott–Schottky was carried out by using a three-electrode setup and the results were recorded using a Bio-Logic VSP Modular 5-channel potentiostat operated in Staircase Potentio Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (SPEIS) mode. A 7 × 7 mm NiO film was used as a working electrode, a platinum wire and Ag/AgCl were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Boric acid and 1,2-diaminoethane were used to adjust the pH of the electrolytes. The scan range was from −0.5 V to 0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and the frequency was chosen at 1 Hz for figure plotting.
UV-vis spectrophotometry
UV-vis spectra were recorded using a Cary 5000 (Varian) spectrophotometer. Electrolytes with different pHs contained 0.6 M [Co(en)3](BF4)2, 0.07 M [Co(en)3](BF4)3, 0.9 M LiBF4 and 0.1 M NMBI in deionized water. The blank sample is an aqueous solution containing 0.9 M LiBF4 and 0.1 M NMBI.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV)
CVs were measured using a three electrode electrochemical set-up which had a glass carbon working electrode, a platinum wire as a counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (0.2 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode). The measurement was conducted at a 20 mV s−1 scan rate in the range of −0.7 to −0.1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and the results were recorded on a Bio-Logic VSP Modular 5-channel potentiostat. The solution for electrochemical analysis contained 6 mM [Co(en)3](BF4)2, 0.7 mM [Co(en)3](BF4)3 and 0.1 M potassium chloride in water. Either boric acid or additional 1,2-diaminoethane was used to adjust the pH of the electrolyte.
Stability
One of the best performing devices constructed with a pH 10 aqueous electrolyte was chosen to measure the stability of the aqueous p-type devices. The initial energy conversion efficiency was 1.3%. The device was stored in the dark and its performance was periodically tested by characterization under AM 1.5 simulated sun light (1000 W m−2).
