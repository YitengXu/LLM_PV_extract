    , Accepted 18th January 2019First published on 19th January 2019AbstractIn this work, we design and synthesize an acceptor–donor–acceptor structured non-fullerene acceptor (ACS8) with an ultra-narrow bandgap (1.3 eV). It possesses a well-ordered molecular orientation and π–π stacking, and hence exhibits a high electron mobility of 2.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on PTB7-Th:ACS8 (1:2, w/w) processed using toluene and 0.5% PN (1-phenylnaphthalene) treatment exhibited an optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.2% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.75 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.3 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 69.3% under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. This PCE is among the highest values reported in the literature to date for PSCs based on ultra-narrow bandgap acceptors (Eoptg ≤ 1.3 eV). Furthermore, semitransparent devices based on PTB7-Th:ACS8 exhibit an outstanding PCE up to 11.1% with an average visible transmittance of 28.6%.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) as a promising renewable energy technology have attracted great attention due to their unique advantages, such as light weight, low cost, easy fabrication and capability to be fabricated into large area and flexible devices through roll-to-roll processing.1–5 In typical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs, the active layer is generally comprised of a p-type conjugated polymer as the donor and an n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) as the acceptor. In comparison with fullerenes, non-fullerene (NF) n-OS acceptors have exhibited great potential for highly efficient PSCs due to their distinguished advantages of easily tunable optical absorption and electronic energy levels, low production cost and good morphological stability.6–15 Therefore, the NF-PSCs have drawn considerable attention and made great progress in recent years with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 11–14% for single-junction devices16–25 and 14–17% for tandem devices.26–30
Among the NF n-OS acceptors, fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) with an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure based on fused aromatic cores with strong electron withdrawing groups,31–40 such as ITIC,31 IDIC,32 IT-4F,33 ATT-1,38 and NFBDT,40 have become dominant in highly efficient PSCs. These acceptors exhibit strong absorption in the wavelength of 500–800 nm with an optical bandgap (Eoptg) over 1.5 eV. When blended with wide bandgap polymer donors with complementary absorption and matched energy levels, the devices can sufficiently utilize visible light and the best PCE over 14% has been achieved.41–43 Considering the trade-off between the open circuit voltage (Voc) and the bandgap, it is a great challenge to further improve the performance of single-junction devices limited by the absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region and unavoidable energy loss (Eloss = Eoptg − eVoc). However, the exploitation of ultra-narrow bandgap non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs, Eoptg ≤ 1.3 eV) with high Voc and external quantum efficiency (EQE) in the NIR region is rather rare and has impeded the progress of tandem devices.27,29 For example, although the representative ultra-narrow bandgap NFA, IEICO-4F, exhibited an ultra-narrow bandgap of 1.24 eV, the device based on the blend of PTB7-Th and IEICO-4F only exhibited a medium PCE of ∼12%.44,45 In addition, as one of the unique advantages of PSCs, semitransparent (ST) devices have great potential for use in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and power generating windows.46–52 Recently, ST-PSCs based on NFAs have exhibited an outstanding PCE of 10.2% with an average visible transmittance (AVT) of 31%.53 However, the lack of NIR acceptors also restrains the achievement of highly efficient and highly transparent ST-PSCs. Hence, the development of a new NIR NFA is an urgent need for the application of PSCs.
In this work, we designed and synthesized a small molecule acceptor ACS8 with indacenodithiophene (IDT) as the core, alkylthio-substituted thiophene as the π-bridges and electron-withdrawing 3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-5,6-difluoro-1-indanone (IC2F) as the end groups (as shown in Fig. 1a). The ACS8 film shows a narrow-bandgap of 1.3 eV with strong absorption in the region of 650–900 nm, and a redshift of 80 nm compared with that in solution. Moreover, the ACS8 film possesses a well-ordered molecular orientation and π–π stacking, and hence exhibits a high electron mobility of 2.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The PSCs based on PTB7-Th:ACS8 (1:2, w/w) with 0.5% PN (1-phenylnaphthalene) exhibited an optimal PCE of 13.2% with a Voc of 0.75 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.3 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 69.3% under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. This PCE is the highest value reported in the literature to date for PSCs based on NIR acceptors (Eoptg ≤ 1.3 eV). Furthermore, semitransparent devices based on PTB7-Th:ACS8 (1:2, w/w) exhibited PCEs varying from 9.4% to 11.1% at different AVTs (43.2–28.6%). These results indicate that ACS8 is a very promising NIR acceptor material for semitransparent and tandem solar cell applications.

2. Results and discussion
The synthetic route to and molecular structure of ACS8 are shown in Scheme S1† and Fig. 1a, respectively. The detailed synthesis and characterization data are provided in the ESI.† ACS8 has been characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). ACS8 shows good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB) and toluene (TL) at room temperature. Moreover, ACS8 exhibits a decomposition temperature (Td) of 334 °C at 5% weight loss as shown in the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) plot in Fig. S1,† which indicates that it has good thermal stability for application in PSCs.
As shown in Fig. 1b, ACS8 in solution exhibits absorption in the region of 600–850 nm with the maximum absorption peak (λmax) at 751 nm. In the thin film, the absorption peak redshifts ca. 80 nm compared with that in solution, which should be attributed to the strong aggregation of molecular chains in the solid state. The Eoptg of ACS8 estimated from the absorption edge (λedge = 950 nm) of the thin film is 1.30 eV with an increase of 0.06 eV in comparison with that of IEICO-4F (1.24 eV).44 Furthermore, the electron mobility of ACS8 was evaluated by the space-charge-limited current method (Fig. S8†) and a higher value of 2.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved than that of IEICO-4F (1.14 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).
The electrochemical properties of ACS8 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. 1c and S2,† the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of ACS8 estimated from the onset oxidation potential (φox) and reduction potential (φred) are −5.54 eV and −4.05 eV, respectively. Hence, ACS8 exhibits a lower HOMO and a similar LUMO relative to IEICO-4F (HOMO = −5.46 eV; LUMO = −4.08 eV). Moreover, theoretical calculations are performed by using density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the influence of alkoxyl and alkylthiol on the properties of small molecule acceptors as shown in Fig. S3.† There are no obvious differences between ACS8 and IEICO-4F in their optimized molecular conformations and the electron distributions of the frontier molecular orbitals. In comparison with IEICO-4F, ACS8 shows a similar LUMO and a downshifted HOMO, which is consistent with the CV measurement results.
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of ACS8, PSCs with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN)/PTB7-Th:ACS8/MoO3/Al were fabricated using TL as the host processing solvent. Firstly, the influence of the D/A weight ratio of the blend active layer was investigated. As shown in Fig. S4 and Table S1,† the optimal D/A weight ratio was 1:2 (w/w), and a PCE of 9.8% was obtained with a Voc of 0.75 V, a Jsc of 22.1 mA cm−2 and an FF of 58.8%. In order to further improve the photovoltaic performance, PN was utilized as a solvent additive to optimize the morphology of the active layers as shown in Fig. S5 and Table S2.†Fig. 2a and b show the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and EQE curves of the solar cells based on PTB7-Th:ACS8 without and with 0.5% PN. It was found that using PN as a solvent additive can remarkably improve the PCEs of the devices due to the significantly enhanced Jsc and FF. Furthermore, when 0.5% PN was added, the devices exhibited the best PCE of 13.2% with a Voc of 0.75 V, a Jsc of 25.3 mA cm−2 and an FF of 69.3% (Table 1). Moreover, under the same device processing conditions, the devices based on IEICO-4F exhibited only a moderate PCE of 9.4% (Fig. S6†). To our knowledge, the PCE of 13.2% is the highest value reported in the literature to date for PSCs based on NIR acceptors (Eoptg ≤ 1.3 eV).41,45 As shown in Fig. 2b, when adding 0.5% PN as a solvent additive, the EQE curves were significantly enhanced and redshifted in the long wavelength region of 600–900 nm. Moreover, a maximum EQE value of 82.6% at 650 nm was recorded for the optimal device. The integrated Jsc values from the EQE curves were 21.3 and 24.2 mA cm−2 for the PSCs based on the blend film without and with 0.5% PN treatment, respectively, which agree well with the J–V measurements. The variations of EQE and Jsc should be related to the absorption and carrier mobilities of the blend films. As shown in Fig. S7,† the absorption spectrum of the blend film with PN treatment exhibited an obvious redshift and an enhanced absorption peak in the long wavelength region, which is in agreement with the EQE curves. As shown in Fig. S8 and Table S3,† the hole/electron mobilities (μh/μe) were estimated to be 1.47/1.30 × 10−4 and 2.25/2.01 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the blend film without and with 0.5% PN treatment, respectively. The higher and more balanced carrier mobilities for the blend film are beneficial to suppress space charge accumulation and promote the charge transport and extraction.

As shown in Fig. 2c, the dependence of the photocurrent (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) was measured to investigate the impact of adding the solvent additive on the exciton dissociation and charge collection process for PSCs. Here, Jph is defined as JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is defined as V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage at which the photocurrent is zero and V is the applied voltage.54 The Jph reaches the saturation current density (Jsat) at a high Veff (≥2 V in this case). Thus, the exciton dissociation probability (P(E, T)) is determined from the ratio of Jph/Jsat. Under maximal power output and short-circuit conditions, the values of P(E, T) are 67.3/89.8% for the as-cast device, and 75.0/92.6% for the device with 0.5% PN treatment, respectively. The higher P(E, T) indicates that solvent additive treatment leads to more efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction efficiencies, which is consistent with the better performance of the corresponding devices. Furthermore, in order to investigate the charge recombination process in the devices, the dependence of Jph on different light intensities (P) was measured as shown in Fig. 2d. The relationship between Jph and P is defined as Jph ∝ PS. Weak bimolecular recombination in the device would result in a linear dependence of Jph on P with an S value close to 1.55 The S values of the PSCs based on the blend without and with 0.5% PN are 0.92 and 0.93, respectively, implying that the additive treatment has a negligible effect on the bimolecular recombination process in this blend.
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed to probe the effect of PN additive treatment on the molecular orientation and packing of the blend films.56Fig. 3a and b show the 2D GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding scattering profiles in the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) direction. For the pure ACS8 film, the IP direction profile shows an obvious (100) diffraction peak at 0.30 Å−1 with a d-spacing of 20.73 Å, whereas the OOP direction profile shows a sharper and stronger peak at 1.79 Å−1, corresponding to the (010) π–π stacking with a d-spacing of 3.51 Å, indicating that the pure ACS8 film exhibits a dominant face-on molecular orientation relative to the substrate. The lamellar (100) diffraction peak of the PTB7-Th film is located at 0.26 Å−1 with a d-spacing of 24.02 Å in the IP direction. In the as-cast PTB7-Th:ACS8 film, there is no apparent change in the lamellar (010) diffraction peak compared with the pure films, which is located at 1.79 Å−1 for ACS8 and 1.57 Å−1 for PTB7-Th in the OOP direction, respectively. When adding the PN additive, the blend film shows a stronger and narrower (100) diffraction peak and (010) diffraction peak at 0.31 and 1.80 Å−1, respectively, corresponding to smaller lamellar distances of 20.00 and 3.50 Å, respectively. The improved π–π stacking ordering and enhanced face-on π–π stacking can be clearly observed after PN additive treatment, which is favorable for charge transport and thus for obtaining high Jsc and FF. At the same time, we calculated the coherence length (CL) of the π–π stacking, which was calculated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of OOP direction profile using the Scherrer equation.57 Moreover, in the OOP direction, the PTB7-Th:ACS8 film blend with PN additive treatment shows a larger CL of 10.11 nm compared to the as-cast film blend with a CL of 3.97 nm, which means that the overall crystallinity of ACS8 was enhanced with PN additive treatment. Obviously, appropriate PN additive treatment promotes good crystalline behavior of the blend film and strong face-on orientation, which are desirable for vertical charge transport, and thereby for higher Jsc and FF.

Resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) was used to probe the phase separation and average domain purity in PTB7-Th:ACS8 blend films.58 A resonant photon energy of 284.8 eV was selected, where the material contrast dominates the scattering.59 The PTB7-Th:ACS8 blend film without PN shows scattering peaks at q ∼ 0.096 nm−1, corresponding to a domain size of ≈32 nm. The scattering peak of the PTB7-Th:ACS8 blend film with 0.5% PN locates at q ∼ 0.083 nm−1, corresponding to a domain size of ≈38 nm, which is slightly larger than that of the as-cast blend films. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3c, the relative domain purities of the blends without and with PN additive treatment are 74% and 100%, respectively. The purer domains can reduce bimolecular recombination and thus lead to high performance. In a word, the appropriate domain sizes and the purer domains are beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport.60 As a result, the devices based on PTB7-Th:ACS8 with 0.5% PN show higher Jsc, FF, and PCE.
The surface and bulk morphologies of BHJ-films were probed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. S9,† the blend film with 0.5% PN treatment exhibits a relatively smooth surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.03 nm in comparison with the as-cast blend film with a RMS value of 1.26 nm. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S9f,† when using 0.5% PN as a solvent additive, the phase separation and domain sizes of the blend film were effectively optimized and the clear needle crystals of ACS8 can be observed, which are beneficial for the exciton separation and charge transport.
Considering that the blend of PTB7-Th:ACS8 shows weak absorption in the region of 400–600 nm, ST-PSCs with the structure of ITO/ZnO/PFN/PTB7-Th:ACS8/MoO3/Au/Ag were fabricated. Ultrathin Au (1 nm) was used to reduce percolation of the Ag film and enhance Ag film uniformity, leading to optimal transmittance and low electrical resistance.61 The J–V characteristics, EQE curves and transmission spectra are shown in Fig. 4a–c, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the optimized devices are summarized in Table 2. The photovoltaic performances of the devices with different Ag thicknesses (10 nm, 15 nm and 20 nm) were investigated. An obvious trade-off between the AVT and the PCE could be observed when changing the Ag thickness. When 10 nm Ag was used, the device showed a good AVT of 43.2% with a PCE of 9.4% and Jsc of 19.9 mA cm−2. When the Ag thickness was increased to 20 nm, the AVT decreased to 28.6% with a PCE of 11.1% and Jsc of 22.5 mA cm−1, which are among the highest values for the ST-PSCs reported in the literature.20,47,52,62 The Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) 1931 color coordinates of the transmitted light using CIE standard illuminant D65 (Fig. 4d), correlated color temperature (CCT) and color rendering index (CRI) of the ST devices are summarized in Table 2. The champion ST-PSCs with 20 nm Ag have CIE coordinates of (0.2621, 0.2976) close to the white color point (1/3,1/3), demonstrating their good neutral color feature and possess a CCT of 11528 K and a CRI of 84.

3. Conclusions
In summary, a new small molecule acceptor (ACS8) based on IDT as the core, alkylthio-substituted thiophene as the π-bridges and electron-withdrawing IC2F as the end groups has been designed and synthesized for PSC applications. ACS8 shows a narrow-bandgap of 1.30 eV with strong absorption in the region of 650–900 nm and a relatively low LUMO energy level of −4.05 eV. Furthermore, the ACS8 film possesses a well-ordered molecular orientation and tight face-on packing, and hence exhibits a high electron mobility of 2.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The PSCs based on PTB7-Th:ACS8 (1:2, w/w) with 0.5% PN exhibited an optimal PCE of 13.2% with a Voc of 0.75 V, a Jsc of 25.3 mA cm−2 and an FF of 69.3% under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. Furthermore, semitransparent devices based on PTB7-Th:ACS8 (1:2, w/w) exhibited PCEs varying from 9.4% to 11.1% at different AVTs (43.2–28.6%). These results indicate that ACS8 is a very promising NIR acceptor material for semitransparent and tandem solar cell applications.
