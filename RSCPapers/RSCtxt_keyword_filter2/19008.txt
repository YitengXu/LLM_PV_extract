    , Accepted 21st January 2016First published on 21st January 2016AbstractTwo new A–D–A conjugated small molecules Por-Rod and Por-CNRod were developed using a porphyrin core as the donor unit and 3-ethylrhodanine and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine as the acceptor units. Por-Rod and Por-CNRod show broad absorptions up to ∼850 nm with optical energy bandgaps of 1.47 and 1.45 eV, respectively. Additionally, their blend films containing PC71BM show SCLC hole mobilities of 8.5 × 10−5 and 7.5 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Although bulk heterojunction solar cells containing PC71BM that were processed either without additives, with thermal annealling alone or with only pyridine show very low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), Por-Rod-based solar cells processed using pyridine and then thermal annealing, show a PCE of up to 4.97% with a remarkable VOC of up to 0.94 V and a very low energy loss of only 0.53 eV. This is the first report in which small molecule-based solar cells show such a low energy loss comparable to perovskite solar cells, while exhibiting a good PCE of about 5% and a maximum external quantum efficiency up to 61%. To further understand the effect of different processing conditions on the blend films, the morphology of the blend films was studied by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and resonant soft X-ray scattering.
Introduction
Solution processed organic photovoltaic devices have been deemed to be a good solution to the imminent shortage, the rising prices and the environmental problems associated with fossil fuels, because of their low cost, light weight, and mechanical flexibility.1–5 Also, there has been great progress during the past decade,6–11 in achieving power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 10% for single bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ OSCs) based on both polymers and small molecules (SMs).12–18 Compared to polymers, SMs not only enrich the material choices, but also possess certain advantages such as defined molecular structures, definite molecular weights, easy purification and good batch-to-batch reproducibility, which make them suitable for the commercialization of OSCs.7,19–23
On the other hand, recent years have also witnessed unprecedentedly rapid progress in the development of perovskite solar cells.24,25 Compared with perovskite solar cells, the main issue with present OSCs is how to obtain a high open circuit voltage (VOC) and a short circuit current (Jsc) simultaneously.2,26–30 Firstly, it is impossible to convert the entire bandgap energy (Eg) of the donor material into VOC because driving forces are needed between the donor and acceptor materials in OSCs. A key parameter of the energy loss (Eloss), which is defined as Eloss = Eg − eVOC, creates a link between the VOC and the Eg, and the minimum Eloss was suggested to be 0.6 eV for efficient BHJ OSCs.30 Secondly, although an Eloss below 0.6 eV sometimes can be achieved for OSCs, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) drops remarkably because an Eloss that is too low enhances the charge recombination significantly, even though a lower Eloss can also help the charge separation.28 On the contrary, in perovskite solar cells the Eloss values can be as low as 0.5–0.55 eV, but the EQE can still be very high.25,31 Therefore lowering the Eloss to values comparable to those of perovskite solar cells, but still maintaining a high EQE is important to further improve the performance of BHJ OSCs.7 However, most BHJ OSCs show energy losses of above 0.7 eV, and OSCs with energy losses below 0.6 eV usually show low EQE values as show in Fig. 1.7,24,28,29,32 Although there are many ways to reduce the energy losses and obtain high VOC values such as: (1) tuning the energy levels of the donor materials, (2) increasing the crystallinity without decreasing the D/A interfaces to provide more paths for charge separation,33 (3) reducing the exciton binding energy and getting a higher Eeff by increasing the permittivity,34 and (4) lowering bimolecular non-radiative recombination,35 it is still not easy to obtain a low energy loss and high EQE values for BHJ solar cells.
 Fig. 1  Maximum EQE vs. the energy loss for published donors with low energy loss values below 0.6 eV. 
Porphyrins and their derivatives have been studied as active materials in initial OPV studies because of their easy modification (either of their periphery or by metal insertion into the cavity), extensively π-conjugated systems and high molar absorption coefficients.36–38 Very recently, we developed conjugated donor–acceptor–donor (A–D–A) porphyrin small molecules, in which electron-deficient units were linked to the electron-rich porphyrin core through ethynylene, for solution-processed BHJ OSCs, and the PCEs were finally enhanced up to 8%.7 Considering the good performance of the electron-deficient units of 3-ethylrhodanine and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine in OPV molecules,39–41 herein, we report the design and preparation of two new A–D–A SMs of Por-Rod and Por-CNRod, in which 3-ethylrhodanine and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine units, respectively, are symmetrically conjugated through thiophenylethynyl bridges to a porphyrin core in BHJ OSCs.42,43 We not only explore the photovoltaic properties of the BHJ OSCs based on these SMs as the donor materials, but also the morphologies of the blend films under different device fabrication conditions.
Experimental
General methods

1H NMR spectra were conducted on a Bruker AVANCE Digital 300 MHz spectrometer in deuterated chloroform using tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. Mass spectrometry (MS) data were obtained on a Bruker Daltonics BIFLEX III MALDI-TOF Analyzer using MALDI mode. UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the films on quartz substrates were measured using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a Horiba Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out on a CHI660A electrochemical workstation with platinum electrodes at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 against an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the internal potential standard with a nitrogen-saturated solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in chloroform. The J–V characteristics were measured under an AM 1.5 solar simulator (Japan, SAN-EI, XES-40S1) at 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a standard Si solar cell, and the data were collected using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter.
Synthesis of Por-Rod and Por-CNRod
All operations involving air-sensitive reagents were conducted under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen or argon. All chemicals and solvents were used as received from commercial sources (TCI, Sigma Aldrich, J&K, Alfa Aesar), unless otherwise indicated. Toluene, tetrahydrofuran (THF) and triethylamine were all dried by distillation over sodium prior to use. Rhodanine–(CN)2 was synthesized according to reported procedures,39 and the detailed synthetic procedures for 6 are shown in the ESI.† The main synthetic routes for Por-Rod and Por-CNRod are shown in Scheme 1. The chemical structures of Por-Rod and Por-CNRod were confirmed by 1H NMR, MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy and elemental analysis.

Compound 4
40 mL acetic acid was added to a mixture of 1 (546.7 mg, 2.862 mmol) and 2 (506.9 mg, 3.148 mmol) under argon before ammonium acetate (484.8 mg, 6.297 mmol) was added. After stirring and heating at 110 °C for 36 h, the mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2, washed with water and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. After the removal of solvent, the crude product was first purified by column chromatography and then recrystallized from CH2Cl2 and CH3OH to afford 4 as a yellow solid (915 mg, 96%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 7.75 (s, 1H), 7.16 (d, 2H), 4.18 (q, 2H), 1.29 (t, 3H).

Por-Rod

To a 50 mL two necked round-bottom flask were added compound 6 (103.3 mg, 0.1 mmol), compound 4 (99.9 mg, 0.3 mmol), anhydrous toluene (12 mL) and triethylamine (6 mL), and the mixture was deoxygenated with Ar for 30 min before Pd(PPh3)4 (11.55 mg, 0.01 mmol) and CuI (1.9 mg, 0.01 mmol) were added. Then the mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 72 h under a protective atmosphere of Ar. After being cooled to room temperature, the mixture was washed with water and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Then the solvent was removed, and the residue was purified using column chromatography to give a black solid Por-Rod (yield: 77%). Mass (MALDI-TOF): Obs. 1539.6; calcd for C84H94N6O2S8Zn, 1538.4.

Mass (MALDI-TOF): Obs. 1604.1; calcd for C90H94N10O2S6Zn, 1602.5. Anal. calcd for C90H94N10O2S6Zn: C, 67.33; H, 5.90; N, 8.72. Found: C, 66.83; H, 6.03; N, 8.68.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of Por-Rod and Por-CNRod
Two new A–D–A porphyrin organic semiconductor materials were synthesized. The aldol condensation reaction of commercially available 1 with 2 or 3 produced compound 4 or 5. The bis-Sonogashira reaction of 4 or 5 with 6 affords the target product Por-Rod or Por-CNRod in a good yield of about 75%. More importantly, no toxic tin compounds or dangerous lithium reagents were used in any of the synthetic routes.7
Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of Por-Rod and Por-CNRod in very dilute THF solution and a thin film cast from chlorobenzene (CB) solution. The corresponding optical properties including absorption edges (λonset), absorption peaks (λmax) and optical bandgaps (Eoptg) are summarized in Table 1. Por-Rod in THF exhibits two absorption peaks at 500 and 703 nm, which are ascribed to the Soret band and Q band of porphyrin, respectively. The strong and red-shifted Q band compared to normal non-functionalized porphyrins indicates that there is strong intramolecular charge transfer.37 On the other hand, Por-CNRod shows a quite similar absorption profile but with a slightly blue-shifted and broadened Soret band. Por-Rod and Por-CNRod films cast from CB exhibit remarkably intensified NIR absorption peaks up to 764 and 748 nm, respectively. The more intensified and longer wavelength shifted NIR absorption peak of Por-Rod indicates the stronger J-aggregation of Por-Rod compared to Por-CNRod in the solid state.44 The optical bandgaps, estimated from the onset absorption edges, are 1.47 eV and 1.45 eV for Por-CN and Por-CNRod, respectively.

The electrochemical properties of the two molecules were investigated using CV in order to obtain the frontier orbital energy levels. HOMO energy levels (EHOMO) were estimated according to the empirical equation of EHOMO = −(4.8 + Eox), where Eox is the onset oxidation potential of molecules relative to that of the Fc/Fc+ standard. As shown in Fig. 3, Eox(Por-Rod) and Eox(Por-CNRod) after the deduction of Eox(Fc/Fc+) were measured to be 0.44 and 0.48 V, thus the HOMO energy levels are calculated to be −5.24 and −5.32 eV, and the LUMO energy levels (ELUMO) are calculated to be −3.77 and −3.87 eV for Por-Rod and Por-CNRod, respectively, according to ELUMO = EHOMO + Eoptg. Their electrochemical data and the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are summarized in Table 1.

Photovoltaic properties and exciton dissociation rate
The solution-processed BHJ OSCs were fabricated with PC71BM as the electron acceptor and Por-Rod or Por-CNRod as the electron donor in a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ blends/PFN/Al (ITO: indium tin oxide; PEDOT:PSS: poly(styrene sulfonate)-doped poly(ethylene-dioxythiophene); PFN: poly[(9,9-bis(30-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]) under different conditions, and were then measured under AM 1.5 illumination. The ratio of Por-Rod or Por-CNRod to PC71BM was optimized to be 1:1 (w/w). Device results are summarized in Table 2, and their corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S1 (ESI†). All the OSCs fabricated using only CB as the solvent without any post treatment show very poor performance. The addition of a pyridine (Py) additive (1 v%), which was often used to improve the film morphology of zinc(II) porphyrins, only improves the device performance slightly. However, it is noted that using Py as an additive can enhance the VOC. In particular, the Por-CNRod-based OSCs show a high VOC of up to 0.94 V. Since the Eg of Por-CNRod is 1.45 eV, the Eloss for Por-CNRod-based OSCs fabricated using a Py additive is just 0.51 eV, which is smaller than the value of 0.55 eV in perovskite solar cells when PEDOT:PSS is used.31 Therefore, the VOC is very high for such a small bandgap molecule-based OSC. However, the small Jsc and FF lead to a poor PCE of only 0.6%.

Thermal annealing does not improve the properties of these OSCs either, inducing similar or inferior performance to those fabricated without any post-treatment. However, when the devices were further optimized with the Py additive and then thermal annealing, Por-Rod-based devices exhibit a significant PCE enhancement of up to 4.97% with a Jsc of 12.39 mA cm−2, a fill factor of 42.71% and a VOC of 0.94 V, while Por-CNRod-based ones do not show an improved performance. The VOC values of the OSCs change obviously under different device fabrication conditions, showing that film morphology impacts significantly on the open-circuit voltages.45,46 As shown in Table 2, the VOC values for the devices fabricated with the pyridine additive are increased compared with those without pyridine, which can be ascribed to more D/A interfaces induced by pyridine.35 On the other hand, different device fabrication conditions can lead to different degrees of crystallinity. A more disordered morphology introduces a broad distribution of energy states of the electronic carriers, and can inhibit the energy output through enhanced recombination, which reduces the photo-voltages.33 Therefore, more D/A interfaces but with higher crystallinity are beneficial for higher VOC values, which is one of the very important reasons for the high VOC in Por-Rod-based OSCs fabricated with pyridine and then thermally annealed.
It is also worthy to note that Por-Rod-based devices show not only an extremely low energy loss down to 0.53 eV but also a good Jsc of up to 12.39 mA cm−2, which can be confirmed by the EQE as shown in Fig. 4b. The EQE of Por-Rod-based solar cells processed using a pyridine additive and then thermal annealing exhibits a broad photoresponse from 300 to 850 nm with a maximum EQE value of up to 61% at 520 nm and another two peak values of over 50%, indicating that it is possible to further enhance the efficiency by reducing the Eloss while maintaining high EQE values. To the best of our knowledge, an EQE of up to 61% is the highest value reported for BHJ OSCs with an Eloss of less than 0.55 eV. The high EQE can be partially ascribed to the efficient exciton dissociation, which is demonstrated by photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments.43 As seen in Fig. S3 (ESI†), a Por-Rod pristine film exhibits a PL emission peak at 805 nm, and it is quenched almost completely by PC71BM in the blend films, which suggests efficient exciton separation. In addition, the very weak PL of the blends is further quenched when processed with Py or Py + TA, indicating that more efficient exciton dissociation occurs in the active layers.
Hole-mobility measurement
The hole and electron mobilities of the blend films under different conditions shown in Fig. 5, Fig. S1 and Table S1 (ESI†) were estimated according to the electric-field dependent space charge limited current (SCLC) model in the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer (85 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (∼60 nm) using the following equation:  where J is the current, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, E is the effective electric field, d is the thickness of the active layer, μ0 is the zero-field mobility and β is the field activation factor.
 Fig. 5  
J–V characteristics of the hole-only devices in the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al. 
Compared with those of pure chlorobenzene processed thin films, the electron mobility decreased to half and the hole mobility increased by five times for the blends fabricated using the pyridine additive. However, thermal annealing following the addition of pyridine lead to obvious improvements in the hole and electron mobilities compared with processing using pyridine alone, which is an important reason for the increase in FF and Jsc. The other reason is the smaller μh/μe ratio than that of the devices fabricated using Py and TA. Also, the SCLC hole mobilities of Por-Rod and Por-CNRod blend films containing PC71BM, fabricated under Py + TA conditions, are calculated to be 8.5 × 10−5 and 7.5 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher hole mobility of Por-Rod is one of the reasons why Por-CNRod-based devices show a higher Jsc, because a higher mobility usually leads to a smaller photocurrent loss caused by charge recombination.
Morphology characterizations
The structural order of these materials in BHJ blends was studied using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) methods. Shown in Fig. 6 are the GIXD images. From the as-casted thin films from CB, it is quite obvious that Por-Rod and Por-CNRod take an edge-on orientation. A quite sharp (100) diffraction peak is seen from the out-of-plane direction, accompanied by 3–4 high ordered reflections. A strong π–π stacking peak shows up in the in-plane directions, with a wide angle spreading of intensities. Thus the orientation of crystallites is poor.47 The detailed line-cut profiles are summarized in Fig. 7. For Por-Rod blends, the π–π stacking peak located at 1.84 A−1 gives a distance of 3.41 Å. This distance is quite small for organic semiconductors, and should result from porphyrin ring induced stacking. The (100) stacking located at 0.26 A−1 corresponds to a 24.16 Å lamellae distance. It should be noted that in our previous studies, porphyrin and DPP based molecules show quite weak molecular packing, and even lack an obvious π–π stacking signal.7 Modifying the chemical structure, by replacing the DPP moiety with thiophene and rhodanine, leads to stronger intermolecular packing. The crystal size was estimated using the Scherrer equation. The (100) crystal size is estimated to be 15.64 nm, and the π–π stacking peak is estimated to be 5.97 nm. For Por-CNRod, the (100) distance is estimated to be 22.14 Å (located at 0.28 A−1) and the π–π stacking distance is estimated to be 3.46 Å (located at 1.82 A−1). Thermal annealing of the as-casted BHJ thin film leads to shifting of the (100) peaks, which is more severe in Por-CNRod blends. The (100) peak shifted to 0.24 A−1, a ∼2 Å shifting distance. The π–π stacking peak shifted to 1.86 A−1, therefore this size is also increased by about 9.67, corresponding to ∼3 layers of π stacks. When pyridine was used in thin film processing, the nanostructure of the BHJ thin film changed completely. Both the (100) and π–π stacking peaks became much less intense and crystal size was largely reduced, because pyridine is quite effective in reducing the crystallinity of porphyrin based materials due to coordination with the metal center, which strongly retards the molecular assembly. The subsequent thermal annealing did not help to improve the structure order of the BHJ thin film. Quite similar GIXD results were obtained.

The length scale of phase separation was studied by using resonant soft X-ray scattering methods (RSoXS) by taking advantage of high scattering contrast at the carbon k-edges (Fig. 8). For both Por-Rod and Por-CNRod blends, the as-cast samples show a quick decay of scattering signals in the very low q region, indicating a large scale phase separation outside of the probing length scales. Thermal annealing does not generate a new length scale of phase separation and a nearly identical morphology is seen in this system. When the pyridine additive is used, a small length scale of phase separation at ∼20 nm (0.032 A−1) is seen for Por-Rod blends. Further thermal annealing leads to enhancement of this scattering peak at even larger q positions, corresponding to a length scale of ∼16 nm (0.039 A−1). This new scattering feature can be critical for enhancing the device performance, giving a much larger short circuit current and power conversion efficiency. For Por-CNRod blends, using pyridine as the additive does lead to a smaller length scale of phase separation, showing a peak at 0.025 A−1 with low scattering intensities. Further thermal annealing does not improve this length scale of phase separation. A quite similar scattering profile is recorded. From morphological aspects, it should be concluded that both Por-Rod and Por-CNRod blends processed using the pyridine additive and the subsequent thermal annealing should lead to improved device performances. The low lying LUMO energy level of Por-CNRod cannot align well with PCBM, and this leads to major issues in the efficient splitting of excitons and generation of current.

Conclusions
In summary, two new conjugated A–D–A porphyrin small molecules of Por-Rod and Por-CNRod were designed and synthesized through Sonogashira reactions. BHJ OSCs based on the two porphyrins and PC71BM as the active materials in a conventional device structure under different conditions were investigated. The Por-Rod-based devices processed using a pyridine additive and then thermal annealing exhibit a PCE up to 4.97% with a VOC of 0.94 V and a maximum EQE up to 61%. The energy loss for Por-Rod-based devices is only 0.53 eV which is comparable to that of perovskite solar cells, and this is the first report in which such low energy loss BHJ OSCs can exhibit EQE values of more than 60%. However, Por-CNRod-based OSCs show very poor performance under the investigated conditions even though a very low energy loss of only 0.51 eV was recorded. Morphology studies using GIXD and RSoXS show that while the pyridine additive reduces the crystallinity of porphyrin and the length scale of phase separation, the subsequent thermal annealing leads to the enhancement of the scattering peak corresponding to an even smaller length scale, which can be critical for the enhanced performance of Por-CN-based devices. The morphology of the Por-CNRod blends is quite similar to that of the Por-CN blends under the same fabrication conditions. However, the low lying LUMO energy level of Por-CNRod cannot align well with PCBM to efficiently split excitons and generate current, which is a major reason for the poor performance of all the Por-CNRod-based OSCs. The results provide a further understanding of the energy loss and help to design new donors with high VOC values for more efficient organic solar cells.
