The extracted data sets related to photovoltaic performance from the science papers are as follows:

1. Absorber Layer: ZnO NWs + ZnO HMSPs + CdS
   PCE: 2.35%
   Voc: 511 mV
   Jsc: 9.01 mA/cm2
   FF: 51%

2. Absorber Layer: ZnO HMSPs + CdS
   PCE: 1.53%
   Voc: 490 mV
   Jsc: 7.11 mA/cm2
   FF: 44%

3. Absorber Layer: bare ZnO NWs + CdS
   PCE: 0.59%
   Voc: 330 mV
   Jsc: 5.52 mA/cm2
   FF: 32%

These data sets fulfill the requirements of including the parameters Absorber Layer, Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE), Open-circuit Voltage (Voc), Short-circuit Current (Jsc), and Fill Factor (FF) (Ranjan2014 chunk 2). The correctness of the data has been verified using the equation FF * Voc * Jsc = PCE, with an allowed error of under 5%.
