The photovoltaic performance data from the provided context includes two complete and valid sets of data. The first set is for the absorber layer TPA-BTD-NPI:PC71BM (1:1), with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.21%, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.94 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 6.18 mA/cm2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.38%. The second set is also for the absorber layer TPA-BTD-NPI:PC71BM (1:1), with a PCE of 6.67%, a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 11.24 mA/cm2, and an FF of 0.66%. These data sets satisfy the requirement of including the specified parameters and have been verified to meet the condition FF * Voc * Jsc = PCE with an error within 10%.
