The extracted data sets related to photovoltaic performance from the science paper include the following parameters: Absorber Layer, Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE), Open-circuit Voltage (Voc), Short-circuit Current (Jsc), and Fill Factor (FF). The data sets are as follows:

1. Absorber Layer: Without
   PCE: 16.86%
   Voc: 1.147 V
   Jsc: 21.35 mA/cm2
   FF: 68.46%

2. Absorber Layer: EAI
   PCE: 16.82%
   Voc: 1.160 V
   Jsc: 20.84 mA/cm2
   FF: 69.65%

3. Absorber Layer: PEAI
   PCE: 13.94%
   Voc: 1.166 V
   Jsc: 19.19 mA/cm2
   FF: 62.35%

4. Absorber Layer: PMAI
   PCE: 17.61%
   Voc: 1.164 V
   Jsc: 21.22 mA/cm2
   FF: 71.29%

These data sets satisfy the requirement of including all the specified parameters and have been verified for correctness using the formula FF * Voc * Jsc = PCE, with an error of less than 10% (Ye2022 chunk 1, Ye2022 chunk 0).
