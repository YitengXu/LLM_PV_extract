To extract only complete and valid sets of data related to photovoltaic performance from science papers, the following requirements should be followed:

1. The data should be in JSON format.
2. Only include entries that have all five parameters: Absorber Layer, Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE), Open-circuit Voltage (Voc), Short-circuit Current (Jsc), and Fill Factor (FF).
3. If a complete set of parameters is not found, do not include that entry.
4. No incomplete entries or "N/A" values should be used.
5. Follow the given format strictly.
6. If multiple sets are found within the same paper, append them below the first one.

Here is an example of the desired format:

[{
  "Absorber Layer": "<Chemical Composition or Material Name>",
  "PCE": "<Value in %>",
  "Voc": "<Value in V>",
  "Jsc": "<Value in mA/cm2>",
  "FF": "<Value in %>"
}]

Please note that the provided context, "Tada2012 chunk 2," is not sufficient to extract the required data. More specific information about the papers and their content is needed to proceed with the data extraction.
