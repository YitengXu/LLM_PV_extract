The extracted data sets related to photovoltaic performance are as follows:

1. For PSCs based on YT5 as the hole-transport material (HTM) with a perovskite absorber layer, the PCE is 21.34%, Voc is 1.13V, Jsc is 23.76mA/cm2, and FF is 0.795%. (Wu2021 chunk 0)

2. For hybrid PSCs with a perovskite absorber layer, the PCE, Voc, Jsc, and FF values for YT4, YT5, and Spiro-OMeTAD are as follows:
   - YT4: PCE 18.58%, Voc 1.10V, Jsc 23.07mA/cm2, FF 73.2%
   - YT5: PCE 21.34%, Voc 1.13V, Jsc 23.76mA/cm2, FF 79.5%
   - Spiro-OMeTAD: PCE 19.72%, Voc 1.11V, Jsc 23.04mA/cm2, FF 77.1% (Wu2021 chunk 1)

3. For inorganic PSCs with a perovskite absorber layer, the PCE, Voc, Jsc, and FF values for YT5 and Spiro-OMeTAD are as follows:
   - YT5: PCE 14.61%, Voc 1.17V, Jsc 15.89mA/cm2, FF 78.6%
   - Spiro-OMeTAD: PCE 13.49%, Voc 1.16V, Jsc 15.06mA/cm2, FF 75.3% (Wu2021 chunk 1)

These data sets provide information on the photovoltaic performance of different hole-transport materials (HTMs) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), including the power conversion efficiency (PCE), open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF). The data suggests that PSCs based on YT5 as the HTM exhibit higher PCE values compared to YT4 and Spiro-OMeTAD-based devices, both in hybrid and inorganic PSCs. (Wu2021 chunk 0, Wu2021 chunk 1)
