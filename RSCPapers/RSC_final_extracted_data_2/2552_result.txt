The provided data includes complete and valid sets of photovoltaic performance parameters for two different polymers, PBDT-TS1 and PBDT-TSR. For PBDT-TS1, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is 9.74%, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) is 0.802V, the short-circuit current (Jsc) is 17.72 mA/cm2, and the fill factor (FF) is 68.57%. For PBDT-TSR, the PCE is 10.20%, the Voc is 0.804V, the Jsc is 17.99 mA/cm2, and the FF is 70.55%. These values indicate that PBDT-TSR has slightly higher performance compared to PBDT-TS1.
