The provided data set includes the absorber layer, power conversion efficiency (PCE), open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) of the mixed-cation mixed-halide perovskite solar cells. The absorber layer is composed of Cs0.05FA0.75MA0.2PbI2.7Br0.3. The PCE is reported as 20.45%, with a Voc of 1.09 V, Jsc of 23.56 mA/cm2, and FF of 79.84%. These values satisfy the equation FF * Voc * Jsc = PCE within the allowed error range of 10%. (Wenson2022 chunk 1)
