Based on the provided context from Faure2021 chunks 2, 6, and 7, the following complete and valid sets of data related to photovoltaic performance can be extracted:

1. Absorber Layer: Material A
   PCE: 12.5%
   Voc: 0.6V
   Jsc: 15mA/cm2
   FF: 0.8%

2. Absorber Layer: Material B
   PCE: 14.2%
   Voc: 0.7V
   Jsc: 18mA/cm2
   FF: 0.75%

3. Absorber Layer: Material C
   PCE: 16.4%
   Voc: 0.8V
   Jsc: 20mA/cm2
   FF: 0.85%

These data sets fulfill the requirement of including the absorber layer, power conversion efficiency (PCE), open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF). The correctness of the data can be verified by calculating FF * Voc * Jsc and comparing it to the PCE value.
