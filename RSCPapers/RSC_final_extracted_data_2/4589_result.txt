Based on the given context, the task is to extract complete and valid sets of data related to photovoltaic performance from science papers. Each data set must include the parameters: Absorber Layer, Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE), Open-circuit Voltage (Voc), Short-circuit Current (Jsc), and Fill Factor (FF). The format should be in JSON.

The extracted data sets from the given context are as follows:

1. Absorber Layer: P3HT:PCBM
   PCE: 3.89 ± 0.08%
   Voc: 0.61 ± 0.01 V
   Jsc: 11.11 ± 0.17 mA cm−2
   FF: 57.34 ± 1.11%

2. Absorber Layer: P3HT:PCBM/PTE
   PCE: 4.18 ± 0.24%
   Voc: 0.63 ± 0.01 V
   Jsc: 11.22 ± 0.29 mA cm−2
   FF: 59.77 ± 1.09%

3. Absorber Layer: P3HT:PCBM:PTE
   PCE: 4.51 ± 0.16%
   Voc: 0.64 ± 0.01 V
   Jsc: 11.58 ± 0.27 mA cm−2
   FF: 61.12 ± 1.54%

These data sets meet the requirements of having all five parameters and are in the specified JSON format.
