Based on the given context, the valid keys for data extraction from the science paper "Polydorou2016 chunk 3" are as follows:

- Absorber Layer: BZO:H
- PCE: 5.90%
- Voc: N/A (not provided in the given context)
- Jsc: N/A (not provided in the given context)
- FF: N/A (not provided in the given context)

Since the values for Voc, Jsc, and FF are not provided in the given context, it is not possible to extract a complete and valid set of data related to photovoltaic performance from this specific science paper.
