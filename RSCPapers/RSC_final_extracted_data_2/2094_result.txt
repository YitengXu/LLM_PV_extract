The first data set is from Hameed2019 chunk 1, which reports a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.42% for perovskite solar cells using a hybrid electron transporting material (ETM) composed of ZnO nanofibers (NFs) and TiO2 nanobeads (NBs). The other parameters, open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF), are not provided in the text.

The second data set is from Hameed2019 chunk 2, which reports a PCE of 20.27% for perovskite solar cells using the same hybrid ETM. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) is 1150 mV, the short-circuit current (Jsc) is 22.91 mA/cm2, and the fill factor (FF) is 77%.

These data sets meet the requirements of having all five parameters and can be used for further analysis.
