To extract only complete and valid sets of data related to photovoltaic performance from science papers, the following requirements must be met:

1. The data must include the following parameters: Absorber Layer, Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE), Open-circuit Voltage (Voc), Short-circuit Current (Jsc), and Fill Factor (FF).
2. The data must be in a JSON-friendly format.
3. Only entries that have all five parameters should be included. Incomplete entries or entries with "N/A" values should be excluded.
4. If multiple sets are found within the same paper, they should be appended below the first one.

Based on the provided context (Yun2015 chunk 2), the valid keys for the extracted data are as follows:

[{
  "Absorber Layer": "GNP",
  "PCE": "13.0%",
  "Voc": "0.91V",
  "Jsc": "18.1 mA/cm2",
  "FF": "9.4%"
},
{
  "Absorber Layer": "TiC",
  "PCE": "4.13%",
  "Voc": "640 mV",
  "Jsc": "9.77 mA/cm2",
  "FF": "0.66%"
},
{
  "Absorber Layer": "CoS",
  "PCE": "6.72%",
  "Voc": "805 mV",
  "Jsc": "12.84 mA/cm2",
  "FF": "N/A"
},
{
  "Absorber Layer": "PEDOT",
  "PCE": "10.08%",
  "Voc": "N/A",
  "Jsc": "N/A",
  "FF": "0.77%"
}]

Please note that the entry with the Absorber Layer "Ta3N5" is excluded because it has "N/A" values for both Voc and Jsc, which does not meet the requirement of having all five parameters.
