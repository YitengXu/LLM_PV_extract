From the provided context, we can extract the following complete and valid sets of data related to photovoltaic performance:

1. Sharma2014 chunk 1:
- Absorber Layer: P-tNp-P':PC71BM
- PCE: 2.91%
- Voc: 0.98 V
- Jsc: 6.75 mA cm−2
- FF: 0.44 (Sharma2014 chunk 1)

2. Sharma2014 chunk 2:
- Absorber Layer: Modified active layer prepared from a 3% v/v pyridine-THF mixture
- PCE: 4.16%
- Voc: Slightly lower than the previous case (not specified)
- Jsc: 8.52 mA cm−2
- FF: 0.52 (Sharma2014 chunk 2)

Unfortunately, Sharma2014 chunk 0 does not provide specific data for Voc, Jsc, or FF, so we cannot include it in the answer.

Overall, the data from Sharma2014 chunk 1 and Sharma2014 chunk 2 provide information on the absorber layer, PCE, Voc, Jsc, and FF for the respective solar cell configurations (Sharma2014 chunk 1, Sharma2014 chunk 2).
