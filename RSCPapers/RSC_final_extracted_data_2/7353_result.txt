The only complete and valid set of data related to photovoltaic performance is from Fan2015 chunk 3. It includes the parameters Absorber Layer: PBDTDT(Qx-3)-T, PCE: 6.9%, Voc: 0.94V, Jsc: 11.28 mA/cm2, and FF: 64.7%. This data set has been verified using the equation FF * Voc * Jsc = PCE, with an allowed error of under 10%. (Fan2015 chunk 2, Fan2015 chunk 3)
