Note: The data sets provided in the answer are based on the information provided in the context. The power conversion efficiency (PCE), open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) values have been extracted from the context and included in the answer. The correctness of the data has been verified using the formula FF * Voc * Jsc = PCE, allowing for a maximum error of 10%.
