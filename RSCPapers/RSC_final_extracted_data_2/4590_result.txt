The data extraction task is to extract complete and valid sets of data related to photovoltaic performance from science papers. Each data set must include the following parameters: Absorber Layer, Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE), Open-circuit Voltage (Voc), Short-circuit Current (Jsc), and Fill Factor (FF). The format should be in JSON-friendly format.

The given example provides a valid data set that meets the requirements:

{
  "Absorber Layer": "CdS/CdSe QDs sensitized ZnO NRA",
  "PCE": "2.70%",
  "Voc": "0.60 V",
  "Jsc": "12.6 mA/cm2",
  "FF": "0.36"
}

The score for this data set is 10.
