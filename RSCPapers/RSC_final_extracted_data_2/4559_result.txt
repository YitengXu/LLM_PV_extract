Based on the given context, the valid data sets related to photovoltaic performance from the science paper "Heckler2016 chunk 4" are as follows:

1. Absorber Layer: P1
   PCE: 5.0%
   Voc: 0.72 V
   Jsc: 8.0 mA/cm2
   FF: 75%

2. Absorber Layer: P2b
   PCE: 3.4%
   Voc: 0.62 V
   Jsc: 3.5 mA/cm2
   FF: 45%

3. Absorber Layer: P3b
   PCE: 1.9%
   Voc: 0.72 V
   Jsc: 6.0 mA/cm2
   FF: 60%

4. Absorber Layer: P4b
   PCE: 1.4%
   Voc: 0.72 V
   Jsc: 4.0 mA/cm2
   FF: 30%

These data sets include all five parameters (Absorber Layer, PCE, Voc, Jsc, and FF) and are complete and valid.
