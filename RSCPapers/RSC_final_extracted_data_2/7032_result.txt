The extracted data sets from the science papers are as follows:

1. Absorber Layer: C-GB2
   PCE: 5.61%
   Voc: 0.64V
   Jsc: 13.23mA/cm2
   FF: 0.66%

2. Absorber Layer: GB-G4
   PCE: 4.94%
   Voc: 0.66V
   Jsc: 13.83mA/cm2
   FF: 0.54%

3. Absorber Layer: C-GB-G2
   PCE: 6.29%
   Voc: 0.67V
   Jsc: 13.59mA/cm2
   FF: 0.69%

These data sets have been verified using the formula FF * Voc * Jsc = PCE, with an allowed error of under 10% (Zhang2019 chunk 1).
