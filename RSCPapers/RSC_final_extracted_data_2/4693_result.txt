Based on the given context, the valid keys for data extraction are as follows:

- Absorber Layer: FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells
- PCE: 15.14% and 17.16%
- Voc: 1.095 V
- Jsc: 23.80 mA cm−2 and 23.90 mA cm−2
- FF: 63.93% and 67.67%

These values represent the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells using different hole transporting layers, specifically p-CZTS and m-CZTS. The data includes average PCEs, Voc, Jsc, and FF for both hole transporting layers, as well as specific values for the champion J-V curves in the reverse and forward scan measurements. The text also mentions the stability and advantages of using CZTS hole transporting layers and carbon electrodes.
