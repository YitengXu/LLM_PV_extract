The given task is to extract complete and valid sets of data related to photovoltaic performance from science papers. Each data set must include the parameters: Absorber Layer, Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE), Open-circuit Voltage (Voc), Short-circuit Current (Jsc), and Fill Factor (FF). The required format for the extracted data is JSON-friendly.

The provided context is from a paper by Wang in 2013. The paper describes the synthesis and characterization of a polymer (PBDT-TID) for use in polymer solar cells. The paper reports the PCE, Voc, Jsc, and FF values for solar cells fabricated using PBDT-TID and PC61BM with both conventional and inverted device structures.

Based on the given context, the extracted data sets are as follows:

1. Absorber Layer: PBDT-TID:PC61BM
   PCE: 5.25%
   Voc: 0.80 V
   Jsc: 12.65 mA/cm2
   FF: 0.52%

2. Absorber Layer: PBDT-TID:PC61BM
   PCE: 6.51%
   Voc: 0.82 V
   Jsc: 15.07 mA/cm2
   FF: 0.53%

These data sets meet the requirements of having all five parameters and are in the specified JSON-friendly format.
