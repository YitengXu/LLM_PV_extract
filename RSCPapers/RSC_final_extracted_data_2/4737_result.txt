Based on the given context, the valid keys for extracting data related to photovoltaic performance from science papers are "Lu2018 chunk 1" and "Lu2018 chunk 0". These keys refer to specific sections or chunks of the paper that contain relevant information about the parameters of interest.

To extract the data, we need to look for complete and valid sets of parameters, which include the Absorber Layer, Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE), Open-circuit Voltage (Voc), Short-circuit Current (Jsc), and Fill Factor (FF). The format for the extracted data should be in JSON format.

Here is an example of the extracted data in the specified format:

[{
  "Absorber Layer": "GQD-NO",
  "PCE": "7.43%",
  "Voc": "0.90 V",
  "Jsc": "11.48 mA/cm2",
  "FF": "71.9%"
},
{
  "Absorber Layer": "ZnO",
  "PCE": "6.56%",
  "Voc": "N/A",
  "Jsc": "N/A",
  "FF": "N/A"
}]

Please note that the second entry for the Absorber Layer "ZnO" does not have values for Voc, Jsc, and FF, so "N/A" is used to indicate the missing values.
