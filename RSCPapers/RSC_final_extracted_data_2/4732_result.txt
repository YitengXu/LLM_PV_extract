Based on the given context, it is not possible to extract the complete and valid sets of data related to photovoltaic performance. The text does not provide specific data for the absorber layer, open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF). Therefore, no valid entries can be extracted from this particular science paper.
