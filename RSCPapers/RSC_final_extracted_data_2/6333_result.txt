The provided data sets include the absorber layer, power conversion efficiency (PCE), open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) for three metal complexes used in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The absorber layers are CYC-33O, CYC-33R, and N749. The corresponding PCE values are 5.7%, 6.1%, and 5.8% respectively. The Voc values are 0.474 V, 0.533 V, and 0.496 V. The Jsc values are 19.38 mA/cm2, 16.69 mA/cm2, and 19.20 mA/cm2. The FF values are 0.623, 0.686, and 0.612. The calculated values for FF * Voc * Jsc are within 10% of the reported PCE values for all three complexes (Ratna2020 chunk 2).
