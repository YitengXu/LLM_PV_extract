Based on the given context, the valid data sets related to photovoltaic performance from the science paper "Zhang2016 chunk 1" are as follows:

[{
  "Absorber Layer": "PbSe NC films",
  "PCE": "1.62%",
  "Voc": "0.38 V",
  "Jsc": "10.62 mA/cm2",
  "FF": "40%"
},
{
  "Absorber Layer": "PbSe NC films",
  "PCE": "2.90%",
  "Voc": "0.56 V",
  "Jsc": "11.51 mA/cm2",
  "FF": "45%"
}]

These data sets include all five parameters (Absorber Layer, PCE, Voc, Jsc, FF) and are complete and valid according to the given requirements.
