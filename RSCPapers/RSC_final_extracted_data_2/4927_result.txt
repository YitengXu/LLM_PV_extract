These are the complete and valid sets of data related to photovoltaic performance from the science paper (Mikroyannidis2009 chunk 2). The data sets include the absorber layer, power conversion efficiency (PCE), open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) for each absorber layer. (Mikroyannidis2009)
