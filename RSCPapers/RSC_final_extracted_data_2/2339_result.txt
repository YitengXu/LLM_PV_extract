Based on the provided context, the complete and valid set of data related to photovoltaic performance can be extracted from the Chen2023 paper. The data includes the absorber layer as "Sn-Pb mixed perovskite", the power conversion efficiency (PCE) as "18.78%", and the remaining parameters (Voc, Jsc, and FF) are not provided in the context. Therefore, the values for Voc, Jsc, and FF are missing and cannot be included in the extracted data. Additionally, there is no information about the absorber layer, PCE, Voc, Jsc, and FF in the other papers (Liang2022, Yang2019, and Wang2017).
