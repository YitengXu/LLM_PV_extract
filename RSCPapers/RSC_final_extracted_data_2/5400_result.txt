The provided data set includes the absorber layer, power conversion efficiency (PCE), open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) for the absorber layer "Mixed ion perovskites". The PCE is 20.8%, the Voc is 1.16V, the Jsc is 24.6mA/cm2, and the FF is 0.75%. The data set also mentions the absorber layer "MAPbBr3", but the specific values for PCE, Voc, Jsc, and FF are not provided in the available context. Therefore, the values for "MAPbBr3" are unknown. 

The correctness of the data can be verified by calculating FF * Voc * Jsc and comparing it to the PCE value. However, since the values for "MAPbBr3" are missing, the verification cannot be performed for that absorber layer.
