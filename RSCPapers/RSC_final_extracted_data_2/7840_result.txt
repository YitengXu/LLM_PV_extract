The first data set provides the absorber layer as PBDTT-BTzQx-EH-C12/PC61BM (1:2) with PFN/Ca as a co-interfacial layer, with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.24%. The values for open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) are not provided in the text (Hai2014 chunk 2). The second data set does not provide the absorber layer, but it has a PCE of 1.40%, an open-circuit voltage of 0.62 V, a short-circuit current of 4.12 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 55% (Hai2014 chunk 0).
