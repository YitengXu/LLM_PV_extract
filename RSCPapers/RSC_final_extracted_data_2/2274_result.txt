Based on the provided context, the data extraction from the science papers yields two complete and valid sets of data related to photovoltaic performance. The first set is from Wang2017 chunk 1, which includes an absorber layer of CH3NH3PbI3, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.61%, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.92 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 19.03 mA/cm2, and a fill factor (FF) of 54.05%. The second set is also from Wang2017 chunk 1, with an absorber layer of CH3NH3PbI3, a PCE of 17.04%, a Voc of 1.06 V, a Jsc of 23.25 mA/cm2, and an FF of 69.62%. The data provided is complete and valid, and the formula FF * Voc * Jsc = PCE can be used to verify the correctness of the data.
