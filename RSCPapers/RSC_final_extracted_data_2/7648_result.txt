These are the complete and valid sets of data related to photovoltaic performance from the science papers. The data sets include the absorber layer, power conversion efficiency (PCE), open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) for each polymer. The data has been verified using the formula FF * Voc * Jsc = PCE, with an allowed error of under 10% (Ong2013).
