Based on the provided information, there is only one valid key for extracting complete and valid sets of data related to photovoltaic performance parameters (Absorber Layer, PCE, Voc, Jsc, and FF), which is "Quiroz2015 chunk 0". This chunk provides information about the fabrication of semitransparent solar cells using perovskite films, including the power conversion efficiency (PCE), open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) values for different active layer thicknesses. The data can be extracted in the following format:

[{
  "Absorber Layer": "Perovskite",
  "PCE": "10.12-15.99%",
  "Voc": "Constant",
  "Jsc": "N/A",
  "FF": "71.70-78.62%"
}]
