The photovoltaic performance data for the three copolymers (P1, P2, and P3) in polymer solar cells (PSCs) are as follows: 
- P1: PCE = 0.85%, Voc = 0.85V, Jsc = 2.66 mA/cm2, FF = 38.85%
- P2: PCE = 1.13%, Voc = 0.80V, Jsc = 4.07 mA/cm2, FF = 35.33%
- P3: PCE = 1.29%, Voc = 0.82V, Jsc = 4.37 mA/cm2, FF = 38.00%

These values were obtained from measurements of the J-V characteristics of the PSCs (Zhang2015 chunk 1). The calculated values of FF * Voc * Jsc were within 10% of the reported PCE values for all three copolymers, indicating the data's validity (Zhang2015 chunk 1).
