Based on the given context, the valid and complete sets of data related to photovoltaic performance are as follows:

[{
  "Absorber Layer": "BCCPDQ",
  "PCE": "0.40%",
  "Voc": "0.5 V",
  "Jsc": "2.56 mA/cm2",
  "FF": "29.4%"
},
{
  "Absorber Layer": "BCCPDQ/TiO2 NPs",
  "PCE": "2.26%",
  "Voc": "1 V",
  "Jsc": "6.72 mA/cm2",
  "FF": "33.6%"
}]

These sets include the required parameters: Absorber Layer, Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE), Open-circuit Voltage (Voc), Short-circuit Current (Jsc), and Fill Factor (FF). They are formatted as JSON objects.
