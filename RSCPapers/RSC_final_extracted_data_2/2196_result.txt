The data sets provided in the Kumar2011 paper meet all the required parameters for photovoltaic performance. The first data set consists of an absorber layer of PDCPTCz/PC71BM with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.73%, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.74 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 1.92 mA/cm2, and a fill factor (FF) of 52%. The second data set consists of an absorber layer of PDCPTCz-BT/PC71BM with a PCE of 1.57%, a Voc of 0.81 V, a Jsc of 4.59 mA/cm2, and an FF of 42%. These data sets provide valuable information on the performance of these polymer-based solar cells. (Kumar2011 chunk 1)
